00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.740
What if the climate cooled,

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.300
tensions thawed and the
sky was a clear blue?

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.280
What if power outages were a thing of
the past and our businesses were

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.380
future ready?

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.192
What if our digital footprints were no
more dangerous than our physical

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:27.680
ones and the only limits to a better
world were the limits of our own

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.900
imagination? What if this weren't
just a pipe dream,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.236
but a possibility,

00:00:33.428 --> 00:00:34.760
even a promise?

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.908
Because while prosperity
is an ambition,

00:00:38.084 --> 00:00:39.400
not a guarantee,

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.476
progress awaits and technology is the
most powerful tool humanity has.

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:46.720
With technology,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.516
we can build a digital blueprint
for a better world.

00:00:50.668 --> 00:00:55.652
Where AI enabled smart grids accelerate
the energy transition and the

00:00:55.676 --> 00:00:59.320
products we buy exceed our
increasing expectations.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.088
Where electrified transportation
is not only sustainable,

00:01:04.244 --> 00:01:06.180
but also efficient,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.220
consistent, resilient.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.420
Where buildings self optimize,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.900
healthcare is personalized and the next
big idea is just one leap away.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.752
This is what's possible when data combines
with advanced technologies to

00:01:24.776 --> 00:01:27.056
reveal industrial insights.

00:01:27.248 --> 00:01:31.460
And those insights enable us to
decarbonize our communities.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.932
It's the promise of software defined machines
that adapt to ever changing

00:01:37.996 --> 00:01:41.280
conditions and give us
ever better goods.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.820
Robots that pick and pack with human
like precision and co pilots who

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.484
understand and advise so humans are free
to do the work that only humans

00:01:53.532 --> 00:01:54.192
can do.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.180
It's the power of industrial AI fundamentally
transforming the way we

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.040
commute, consume,

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.480
create, play,

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.360
work. It is the impact of Siemens,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.320
our ecosystem of partners,

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:15.608
our customers together using the best
of digital innovation to create a

00:02:15.664 --> 00:02:20.300
better real world today and for
every day that follows.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.660
This is technology to transform
the everyday for everyone.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.780
Please welcome to the
stage Peter Curta.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.840
Well, good afternoon.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.960
It's great to be here at
CES with you this year.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.692
Last year we were at CS to talk about
the industrial metaverse,

00:02:50.836 --> 00:02:53.412
about the three building blocks,

00:02:53.476 --> 00:02:55.036
what it takes to build it.

00:02:55.036 --> 00:02:58.436
We talked about physics
based digital twins,

00:02:58.628 --> 00:03:02.120
software defined automation
and we spoke about AI.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.560
Now this year we are here because we
know that on everybody's mind is.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.160
Is AI overhyped?

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.708
And we'll show you today that the
answer to that very question is

00:03:17.844 --> 00:03:19.720
absolutely not.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:27.788
Why? Because AI is going to create real
impact across all the industries

00:03:27.884 --> 00:03:30.120
that we at Siemens serve today.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.084
We have a lot of news to share with
you in the next few 40 minutes.

00:03:35.084 --> 00:03:40.776
So we're going to start and talk about
announcing five new AI powered

00:03:40.808 --> 00:03:46.060
products that will help our customers
to solve real world problems.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.920
We're going to talk about a very exciting
partnership with Jet Zero to

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.980
completely reimagine air travel.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.736
And we're going to talk about collaborations
with our ecosystem partners

00:04:01.848 --> 00:04:03.860
to scale our impact.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.070
So incremental change,

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.870
iterative Innovation is a natural
human inclination.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.570
But in the face of an environmental
crisis,

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.670
of geopolitical instability and
shortage of skilled labor,

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.698
we don't need steps,

00:04:24.874 --> 00:04:26.670
we need leaps.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:28.922
And at Siemens,

00:04:28.986 --> 00:04:33.914
we are giving our customers the confidence
to take those leaps by

00:04:34.002 --> 00:04:38.650
fundamentally transform the
way how industry operates.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.490
And the way we gonna do that
is through industrial AI.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.318
So what is so special
about industrial AI?

00:04:49.494 --> 00:04:55.210
Well, if your regular AI gets the
tone of your email wrong,

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.854
that's one thing.

00:04:57.022 --> 00:04:58.390
But think about it,

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.052
if the AI gets the programming
of a machine wrong,

00:05:02.206 --> 00:05:04.264
or a medical diagnosis wrong,

00:05:04.392 --> 00:05:08.136
or even the management of
an energy grid wrong,

00:05:08.328 --> 00:05:12.300
the consequences can be
outright catastrophic.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.280
So therefore,

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.048
industrial AI needs to be safe,

00:05:17.224 --> 00:05:18.808
it needs to be reliable,

00:05:18.808 --> 00:05:21.020
and it needs to be trustworthy.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.224
And as you all know,

00:05:24.224 --> 00:05:26.020
AI needs data,

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.720
a lot of data.

00:05:27.872 --> 00:05:28.820
And turns out,

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.164
as you probably have read that for training
these large language models,

00:05:33.292 --> 00:05:37.160
we are about to run out
of data to train them.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.348
But in the industrial world,

00:05:40.484 --> 00:05:42.440
it's a very different thing.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.372
Not sure if you know,

00:05:44.372 --> 00:05:48.764
but there are 17 billion smart
devices out there,

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:52.480
twice the population we
have on this planet.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.930
And that number is going to grow
by almost 20% every year.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.854
And these devices,

00:05:58.982 --> 00:06:02.502
they're going to generate an
enormous amount of data,

00:06:02.686 --> 00:06:07.238
a rapidly increasing amount of data about
the products we use and about

00:06:07.294 --> 00:06:09.274
the world that we live in.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.130
This is a huge data treasure.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.370
Except 80% today is not used.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.230
It's valuable data,

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.880
wasted. But with industrial AI,

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.990
we can turn this data into impact and
we can turn it into real value.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.248
That's why we are absolutely convinced
that industrial AI is going to be

00:06:34.248 --> 00:06:36.300
the game changer going forward.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.712
In fact,

00:06:37.816 --> 00:06:42.832
today already we have more than 30
AI powered applications with real

00:06:42.856 --> 00:06:43.740
world impact.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.000
And let me give you a few examples.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.900
Take buildings.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.280
As you all know,

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.900
we spend 90% of our
time in buildings.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.152
And with industrial AI,

00:06:55.216 --> 00:06:57.280
we're making these buildings
more efficient,

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.650
we make them more comfortable and we
make them better for the planet.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.780
But how?

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.088
Well, as just one example,

00:07:05.264 --> 00:07:11.360
we take our AI powered offerings to manage
cooling systems and thereby we

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.860
reduce energy use and carbon
emissions by 30%.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.452
Or take energy grids.

00:07:18.596 --> 00:07:24.084
You probably know that the demand for
electricity is expected to double

00:07:24.132 --> 00:07:25.452
in the coming years,

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:31.012
while the share at the same time of
variable renewable energy sources

00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:34.320
like wind and solar is rising too.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.100
And for grid operators,

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.600
that means a significant challenge.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.532
But with industrial AI,

00:07:40.596 --> 00:07:45.460
we can help them to increase grid
capacity by 30% and manage that

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.420
fluctuating nature of those
energy sources.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.656
Without AI,

00:07:50.768 --> 00:07:53.420
this energy transition
could not happen.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.536
And then lastly,

00:07:55.648 --> 00:07:59.312
take factories and there's a lot
of Talk about factories.

00:07:59.376 --> 00:08:04.980
Because there's an enormous amount
of shortage of skilled labor.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.864
The people with the expertise to program
or maintain the machines on the

00:08:10.872 --> 00:08:11.760
shop floor,

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.020
they are leaving the workforce.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.060
Since 2019,

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.528
the average factory worker's level
of experience has dropped from 20

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:23.672
years down to three years.

00:08:23.856 --> 00:08:24.980
Three years.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.488
And American manufacturing
executives,

00:08:28.664 --> 00:08:34.300
they have unsurprisingly seen a corresponding
downturn in output.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.340
Industrial productivity down 10%,

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:48.190
product recalls up 33% and workplace
fatalities up 9%.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:58.210
So imagine you are a new employee
and it's your second week.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:04.018
You're working the graveyard shift on
a Sunday morning in a factory and

00:09:04.074 --> 00:09:06.568
suddenly the machine
in front of you,

00:09:06.704 --> 00:09:09.860
it breaks down and the
line stands still.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.816
You look around,

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:17.060
there's no colleague to call and
there's no manager to address.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.872
That is exactly the perfect place where
industrial AI and technology can

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:25.400
help. So specifically,

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.632
Siemens has developed together
with Microsoft,

00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:31.180
the Siemens Industrial Co Pilot.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:36.054
The Siemens Industrial Copilot functions
pretty much like a human

00:09:36.142 --> 00:09:37.910
colleague. It's a smart,

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.090
experienced human colleague,

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:44.854
except it's available 247 and it
helps you set up your machine,

00:09:44.902 --> 00:09:47.212
to program it and to
troubleshoot it.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:52.726
Already more than a hundred companies
are using the Siemens Industrial

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:57.904
Copilot, which is the first gen
AI powered assistant designed

00:09:58.032 --> 00:10:04.048
specifically for an industrial environment
because it is safe,

00:10:04.224 --> 00:10:06.900
reliable and it is trustworthy.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.312
So it enables workers to make
these better decisions,

00:10:11.456 --> 00:10:12.820
smarter decisions.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:18.208
And we want to scale this technology
because we want to ensure that all

00:10:18.264 --> 00:10:24.022
customers can have access to the Industrial
Copilot wherever they want to

00:10:24.046 --> 00:10:24.770
have it.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:27.798
Today they can run it.

00:10:27.934 --> 00:10:30.486
The Siemens Industrial
Copilot in the cloud.

00:10:30.678 --> 00:10:32.328
This is where we started.

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:37.222
But we know that many industrial companies
don't want to have their

00:10:37.326 --> 00:10:41.770
sensitive data to leave the
safety of their factory.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:46.450
So we made the copilot available
on premise 2.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:51.702
And now I'm very pleased to share our
first product announcement of the

00:10:51.726 --> 00:10:53.168
day. That is,

00:10:53.304 --> 00:10:58.500
we are bringing the Industrial Copilot
down to the industrial edge.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.968
So by bringing it to
that shop floor,

00:11:04.064 --> 00:11:08.180
it means that the device sits right
beside our customer machines.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.910
And with the Copilot on the edge,

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:16.020
the data processed right there
on the factory floor.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.454
And thanks to our partnership
with Nvidia,

00:11:19.592 --> 00:11:24.882
we bring high performance compute with
GPUs down to the shop floor.

00:11:25.026 --> 00:11:29.618
And that means that our customer sensitive
data is always secure,

00:11:29.794 --> 00:11:30.784
latency is much,

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:33.950
much lower and the costs
are lower too.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:41.274
So these are just a very few examples
of the many we could show and share

00:11:41.274 --> 00:11:45.824
with you today of how we are using
industrial AI to make real world

00:11:45.824 --> 00:11:47.736
impact. So yes,

00:11:47.928 --> 00:11:51.580
AI is a lot More than just hype.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:58.696
And you get even greater value if you
combine industrial AI with other

00:11:58.768 --> 00:12:02.060
technologies such as digital twins.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.352
And therefore,

00:12:03.416 --> 00:12:08.408
I want to bring out one of our customers
who is doing exactly that.

00:12:08.544 --> 00:12:13.268
So please everyone welcome the co
founder and the CEO of JetZero,

00:12:13.384 --> 00:12:14.800
Tom O'Leary.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:22.572
Hey, Tom.

00:12:22.716 --> 00:12:23.236
How are you,

00:12:23.236 --> 00:12:23.740
Peter?

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:24.572
I'm great.

00:12:24.676 --> 00:12:25.996
How do you feel?

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.080
Fantastic. So happy to be here.

00:12:28.116 --> 00:12:28.820
We are too,

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.132
because I have to say,

00:12:30.132 --> 00:12:34.140
we talked about we want to
take leaps and not steps.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.100
And that's exactly what
you're doing.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.692
Actually at Jet Zero,

00:12:37.796 --> 00:12:41.616
you are fundamentally changing the
way we think about air travel.

00:12:41.788 --> 00:12:44.448
So that's why we're very thrilled
to have you here.

00:12:44.448 --> 00:12:47.456
And maybe you can tell us a little bit
about this airplane that we see in

00:12:47.456 --> 00:12:47.760
the back,

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.896
because not sure about you,

00:12:48.896 --> 00:12:52.184
but the airplane I came looks very
different to the one that we're

00:12:52.184 --> 00:12:52.980
looking here.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.488
Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:54.584 --> 00:12:56.848
So happy to share this with you.

00:12:56.848 --> 00:12:58.680
Really. When you look
at this airplane,

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.900
the shape is the new technology.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.380
So, you know,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.048
it's brand new.

00:13:05.104 --> 00:13:06.216
From tip to tail,

00:13:06.216 --> 00:13:08.526
though, from the avionics
to the engines.

00:13:08.552 --> 00:13:10.936
We're using really existing systems.

00:13:10.968 --> 00:13:14.268
And that's so we can speed
its entry into market.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:18.116
Because really why we want to bring
this to the market is the shape

00:13:18.116 --> 00:13:21.636
allows us to address everything
that the market demands,

00:13:21.668 --> 00:13:23.492
what our customers demand
at the airlines.

00:13:23.492 --> 00:13:27.364
Right. And that is with
a blended wing,

00:13:27.412 --> 00:13:30.676
you can have an incredible
step change,

00:13:30.748 --> 00:13:32.520
a jump in efficiency.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.360
That's what our airlines need most.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.452
They know that this shape allows us to
change everything for the better,

00:13:39.452 --> 00:13:40.860
whether it be better performance,

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.068
better comfort,

00:13:42.244 --> 00:13:47.492
and they need us to do that seamlessly
within the infrastructure and the

00:13:47.516 --> 00:13:49.826
environment that they operate
planes in today.

00:13:49.916 --> 00:13:53.012
So this plane is just what
the doctor ordered.

00:13:53.156 --> 00:13:54.036
Looks terrific.

00:13:54.148 --> 00:13:56.940
Now I would think that to build
something like this,

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:57.276
I mean,

00:13:57.276 --> 00:13:57.852
it's still.

00:13:57.852 --> 00:13:58.236
I mean,

00:13:58.236 --> 00:13:59.532
you're about to build it.

00:13:59.532 --> 00:14:01.036
You need a lot of technology,

00:14:01.036 --> 00:14:01.964
cutting edge technology.

00:14:01.964 --> 00:14:04.356
And you choose Siemens as
your technology partner.

00:14:04.356 --> 00:14:06.996
So share with us why that is.

00:14:07.068 --> 00:14:09.048
Yeah, this is an incredible
challenge.

00:14:09.172 --> 00:14:14.176
It's an incredibly big and bold challenge
to bring a new commercial plane

00:14:14.208 --> 00:14:14.944
to market.

00:14:15.112 --> 00:14:18.816
Right. So we needed the best and
of course we wanted to partner.

00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:24.384
We have to build this new shape at high
rate because the demand is going

00:14:24.392 --> 00:14:25.382
to be high.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:29.856
And so we wanted to partner with the
global leader in manufacturing

00:14:29.968 --> 00:14:32.920
technology, but it goes so
much further than that.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.872
Right? Because it's about
the technology,

00:14:35.976 --> 00:14:36.860
the design,

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.652
and also the technology to
make those designs real,

00:14:40.776 --> 00:14:44.520
from the twin into manufacturing
for automation.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:49.652
So Siemens offers us the power of
a fully integrated platform.

00:14:49.716 --> 00:14:53.708
It can't be understated how important
that is for a company like Jet Zero

00:14:53.708 --> 00:14:55.720
to realize this bold vision.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.120
So we need to gain insights,

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:03.700
we need to look at full scale production
before we ever put a shovel into

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.800
the ground and build
that first factory.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:13.624
So together we're going to create a roadmap
that's going to lead us from

00:15:13.792 --> 00:15:17.340
engineering design all the way
to full rate production.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.904
Which is exactly the challenge we always
look at as a technology company.

00:15:21.904 --> 00:15:26.792
And that's why we are very glad to
announce today that Jet Zero and

00:15:26.816 --> 00:15:31.160
Siemens, we're coming together and
we've signed an agreement on the

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:36.132
technology that will revolutionize
the future of air travel.

00:15:36.276 --> 00:15:37.252
Absolutely.

00:15:37.396 --> 00:15:41.116
So we are very happy about that and maybe
we talk about that very future

00:15:41.116 --> 00:15:47.236
because your blended wing aircraft
is due to debut already by 2030.

00:15:47.308 --> 00:15:49.044
So that sounds rather ambitious.

00:15:49.172 --> 00:15:53.652
Yeah, 2030 is right around the
corner really from developing

00:15:53.796 --> 00:15:55.316
manufacturing and so forth.

00:15:55.428 --> 00:15:56.640
It's coming soon.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:03.250
So the only way for us to get there
and collapse the timeframe is with

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:04.146
industrial AI.

00:16:04.178 --> 00:16:05.098
I mean this is so,

00:16:05.098 --> 00:16:05.758
so critical.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:07.482
It's going to help us get there.

00:16:07.482 --> 00:16:07.994
You know,

00:16:07.994 --> 00:16:10.786
ultimately we're engineering
a product for our,

00:16:10.858 --> 00:16:11.714
our customers,

00:16:11.762 --> 00:16:12.870
the airlines,

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.682
and that will improve
their performance.

00:16:15.866 --> 00:16:18.330
Industrial AI is going to
do the same for us.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:22.866
That's, that's what we as customers
to Siemens look for.

00:16:23.018 --> 00:16:26.842
So Siemens is already providing us all
the fundamentals that we use today

00:16:26.842 --> 00:16:29.164
for, for design tools,

00:16:29.212 --> 00:16:30.236
digital twin,

00:16:30.348 --> 00:16:31.580
digital thread,

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:35.370
all the way through to building
a factory of the future.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:38.508
It is the backbone for us.

00:16:38.644 --> 00:16:43.796
But our vision is that Siemens will
be a partner to show us how AI is

00:16:43.796 --> 00:16:48.716
going to inform and really even just
accelerate everything that we're

00:16:48.748 --> 00:16:52.880
doing from the design all the way
through to the manufacturing.

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:57.650
What we like a lot about what you're doing
is that you want to create the

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:01.434
world's first aircraft that
is fully digital,

00:17:01.522 --> 00:17:06.362
meaning from digital design to digital
production to digital maintenance.

00:17:06.506 --> 00:17:09.922
And maybe you can talk us through
about also starting with design,

00:17:09.922 --> 00:17:11.826
what that really means for you.

00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:12.922
This is a great big challenge,

00:17:12.922 --> 00:17:15.830
right. Because we're entering
a very mature space.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:20.442
Right. So this digital twin is a strategic
competitive advantage for us

00:17:20.466 --> 00:17:27.540
to be able to begin with the end in
mind and effectively create a

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:28.916
simulation virtually.

00:17:29.028 --> 00:17:33.196
We can de risk the manufacturing process
kind of what you showed there

00:17:33.196 --> 00:17:34.516
and we'll see more.

00:17:34.636 --> 00:17:38.204
It's going to let us validate our approach
and scale our processes long

00:17:38.204 --> 00:17:43.332
before we take these planes to the skies
and before we break ground in a

00:17:43.356 --> 00:17:45.492
factory. This is an incredible,

00:17:45.636 --> 00:17:49.966
it's basically a leap forward right
off the starting block when you're

00:17:49.998 --> 00:17:51.470
building something from scratch.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:53.342
So thrilled about it.

00:17:53.526 --> 00:17:58.054
So you spoke about that very digital
twin and we have to think about

00:17:58.054 --> 00:18:02.166
that. You actually can also immerse
yourself in there so that you can

00:18:02.166 --> 00:18:02.918
start to design,

00:18:02.918 --> 00:18:06.370
collaborate, explore that product with
many people around the globe.

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:09.670
Yeah, this is so important for
us as a distributed company.

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:11.078
We started the company in Covid,

00:18:11.078 --> 00:18:12.398
we had no facilities,

00:18:12.398 --> 00:18:14.450
everybody was distributed globally.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.150
So this is so critical to what we do.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.028
So then last year at ces,

00:18:21.204 --> 00:18:25.732
we showed a groundbreaking new product
that can enable exactly this kind

00:18:25.756 --> 00:18:27.300
of immersiveness,

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:31.640
which is the Sony head mounted display
for immersive engineering.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:35.940
And the great news also today
is that very device,

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.670
while pre showed last year,

00:18:37.708 --> 00:18:39.800
it's now available for purchase.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:42.558
And this mixed reality headset,

00:18:42.654 --> 00:18:46.510
it enables the next generation
of 3D content creation.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:50.702
It's built on a Qualcomm Snapdragon
XR2 Gen 2 platform,

00:18:50.766 --> 00:18:54.590
which gives us the compute that
we need to make it seamless.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:59.934
It has two 1.3-inch OLED micro
displays with 4K resolution,

00:19:00.062 --> 00:19:04.530
which means it pretty much matches
the precision of the human eye.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.034
And, and with the two precise
finger controllers,

00:19:08.162 --> 00:19:12.578
it's very intuitively to manipulate
and to design these 3D models.

00:19:12.754 --> 00:19:17.390
There's four tracking sensors to detract
the spatial information.

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:22.258
And the haptics are amazing because they
really feel incredibly natural

00:19:22.354 --> 00:19:24.830
in that very mixed reality
experience.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:29.594
And I only can invite you to test
it because the headsets are very

00:19:29.594 --> 00:19:33.564
comfortable that you can wear
them also for extended use.

00:19:33.762 --> 00:19:38.840
And these headsets were originally
developed by Sony for their own

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:43.720
engineers, engineers who used our Siemens
software at the time and still

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.616
do, to design the Sony products.

00:19:45.616 --> 00:19:46.904
But the Sony folks,

00:19:46.904 --> 00:19:50.920
they got so excited about that that they
found the immersive experience

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:51.832
so beneficial.

00:19:51.896 --> 00:19:56.920
They partnered with us so that we also
can offer it to our customers.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.056
So customers now like
Jet Zero and Tom.

00:20:00.168 --> 00:20:01.344
Therefore, the question is,

00:20:01.344 --> 00:20:06.156
how would you envision to use such a
device as the son head mounted this

00:20:06.156 --> 00:20:06.820
plane, we.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:11.480
Just can't wait to get our hands on
it and utilize it for effectively

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.188
everything. I mean,

00:20:13.324 --> 00:20:15.348
that's really the plan for us.

00:20:15.484 --> 00:20:16.180
So maintenance,

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.476
manufacturing, inspections,

00:20:19.668 --> 00:20:21.244
and we want to accelerate that.

00:20:21.244 --> 00:20:21.900
On the way here,

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.524
I stayed on the tarmac for an extra two
hours because they had to make a

00:20:26.524 --> 00:20:27.960
small minor repair.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:31.388
And then it was really the paperwork
that we were waiting for.

00:20:31.388 --> 00:20:35.796
So we're looking for a world of maintenance
where these type of devices

00:20:35.988 --> 00:20:37.048
can be huge.

00:20:37.204 --> 00:20:40.760
But really productivity improves in the
design process when engineers can

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:44.816
engage at human scale and
collaborate globally.

00:20:44.928 --> 00:20:49.872
So where colleagues can access the
Information and the designs from

00:20:49.896 --> 00:20:52.616
anywhere in the world and collaborate
from any of the world.

00:20:52.616 --> 00:20:55.504
The speed and insight that
this provides us,

00:20:55.672 --> 00:21:00.752
it's going to have an extraordinary
influence on how we design the

00:21:00.776 --> 00:21:02.756
airplane and how we mature the,

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.634
the whole design process.

00:21:04.802 --> 00:21:05.750
That's great.

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:09.162
So that's all about the
design process,

00:21:09.266 --> 00:21:12.010
but we also talk about the factory.

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:13.794
So how are we going to build that?

00:21:13.794 --> 00:21:17.282
So I understand that that blended
wing aircraft that we built at a

00:21:17.282 --> 00:21:19.474
factory right here in
the United States.

00:21:19.474 --> 00:21:20.134
Any, any,

00:21:20.178 --> 00:21:21.938
any news to share where that is,

00:21:21.938 --> 00:21:22.650
that factory?

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:24.710
We can't share that just yet,

00:21:24.866 --> 00:21:26.850
but we have been going through
a rigorous process.

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:28.274
It's going to be here in
the United States.

00:21:28.274 --> 00:21:29.818
The Air Force is one
of our customers.

00:21:29.818 --> 00:21:30.394
That was,

00:21:30.394 --> 00:21:32.856
that was something that they
were particularly keen on,

00:21:32.856 --> 00:21:35.544
is making sure that we were building
our factory here in the United

00:21:35.544 --> 00:21:39.560
States. But it's going to be a fantastic
state of the art facility that

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:43.808
we're relying heavily on Siemens
expertise to help us build.

00:21:43.944 --> 00:21:45.924
Great. End of the first quarter.

00:21:45.864 --> 00:21:46.936
End of the first quarter.

00:21:46.744 --> 00:21:47.404
All right,

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:51.000
within the first quarter we'll announce
the state where we're putting the

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:51.632
factory.

00:21:51.776 --> 00:21:52.712
Now for us,

00:21:52.712 --> 00:21:56.376
that very factory is very exciting
because we also want to bring our

00:21:56.376 --> 00:21:59.186
customers, customers there and to show
them how hardware software is

00:21:59.186 --> 00:22:03.270
really working together and can
create additional value.

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:06.346
So tell us a bit about that factory,

00:22:06.346 --> 00:22:07.666
Tom, if you would.

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:12.442
Well, I mean really the impact for
the environment for this plane is

00:22:12.466 --> 00:22:13.786
going to be significant.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:18.762
But what we'll be able to do is use automation
and digital tools to adapt

00:22:18.762 --> 00:22:21.546
quickly to the changing demands.

00:22:21.658 --> 00:22:22.066
I mean,

00:22:22.066 --> 00:22:24.180
this is going to be a
next gen factory.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:29.660
So interconnectivity to the production
line is key really.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.756
We're just looking forward to being
so much more agile because of the

00:22:32.756 --> 00:22:36.280
software and the hardware
that are tied together.

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:41.868
This kind of digitally native design
through to manufacturing that we're

00:22:41.884 --> 00:22:45.276
doing is just simply not available
through legacy systems.

00:22:45.388 --> 00:22:46.708
It's a step forward.

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:51.968
So that's a great advantage that
we look forward to being the

00:22:52.024 --> 00:22:53.072
beneficiaries of.

00:22:53.176 --> 00:22:53.920
That's great.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.960
And exactly that's what
we want to do.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.864
So we want to bring many of our customers
there so that they can see and

00:22:59.864 --> 00:23:03.800
then believe really what is actually
possible to bring all of this

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.456
together. And since you've
been a Tesla,

00:23:05.456 --> 00:23:08.968
you know pretty well of how important
that is to scale up and already

00:23:08.968 --> 00:23:12.216
think about in the very early design
process about the design for

00:23:12.216 --> 00:23:12.976
manufacturing.

00:23:13.088 --> 00:23:14.256
Absolutely. We're just,

00:23:14.328 --> 00:23:14.824
you know,

00:23:14.824 --> 00:23:15.484
lather, rinse,

00:23:15.488 --> 00:23:19.408
repeat. We're deploying those same sorts
of principles as we work on jet

00:23:19.408 --> 00:23:19.816
Zero.

00:23:19.928 --> 00:23:20.776
That's great.

00:23:20.928 --> 00:23:23.688
So may I shift gears
to sustainability?

00:23:23.784 --> 00:23:24.624
So Jet zero,

00:23:24.624 --> 00:23:26.648
obviously is all about zero,

00:23:26.704 --> 00:23:27.560
I would imagine,

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.776
on carbon.

00:23:28.968 --> 00:23:33.656
And we know that aviation is a contributor
to greenhouse gas emissions.

00:23:33.768 --> 00:23:36.392
And the blended wing aircraft
actually has,

00:23:36.496 --> 00:23:36.968
I guess,

00:23:36.968 --> 00:23:40.792
a lot of advantages to get us there.

00:23:40.976 --> 00:23:47.646
Yeah. This is a much more pragmatic approach
to how we get to zero carbon

00:23:47.678 --> 00:23:48.998
emissions, or net zero,

00:23:48.998 --> 00:23:50.270
which our name implies.

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:51.758
Right. That that's the
ultimate goal.

00:23:51.758 --> 00:23:53.262
And we feel that goal is inevitable.

00:23:53.262 --> 00:23:54.134
It's a matter of,

00:23:54.134 --> 00:23:54.406
you know,

00:23:54.406 --> 00:23:56.386
what, what kind of time horizon.

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:57.270
But the question is,

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:58.926
what's the first move forward?

00:23:58.998 --> 00:23:59.328
Right.

00:23:59.334 --> 00:24:05.550
And so we can get to a 50% improvement
by lowering fuel burn by 50% with

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:06.490
this design,

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:11.502
and then that's going to enable us to
move to more sustainable fuels.

00:24:11.502 --> 00:24:12.250
But really,

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:18.216
all those solutions that get us all the
way to net zero and then absolute

00:24:18.216 --> 00:24:20.526
zero, those all come at a premium.

00:24:20.552 --> 00:24:25.416
So the first thing you do
is lower that burden.

00:24:25.528 --> 00:24:29.158
So this design is really the
first way to do that.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.712
That's fantastic.

00:24:30.856 --> 00:24:36.056
So we are convinced this is
the right way of going.

00:24:36.128 --> 00:24:40.362
So you have a clear vision of where the
shape of air travel is going to

00:24:40.362 --> 00:24:44.594
go, and we have a clear vision of
where that technology is needed,

00:24:44.594 --> 00:24:45.754
where that is going to go.

00:24:45.754 --> 00:24:46.594
And together,

00:24:46.682 --> 00:24:49.430
obviously, we can realize
that very vision.

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:54.226
Agreed. We're so happy to be partnered
with Siemens on this.

00:24:54.298 --> 00:24:55.274
Again. For us,

00:24:55.274 --> 00:24:59.170
it's so important to be partnered with
the global leader in manufacturing

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:03.314
technology. And we're just grateful for
your time and interest in helping

00:25:03.362 --> 00:25:06.254
us do what we need to do
to achieve our vision.

00:25:05.954 --> 00:25:06.406
Thank you,

00:25:06.406 --> 00:25:07.742
Tom. For us at Siemens,

00:25:07.742 --> 00:25:09.246
it really is a big pleasure.

00:25:09.246 --> 00:25:13.262
It's very exciting to revolutionize
the way we all travel on these

00:25:13.286 --> 00:25:14.810
aircrafts every day.

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:19.390
And it's have been exciting and
a privilege to have you here.

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.440
Great.

00:25:19.494 --> 00:25:20.094
Thank you.

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:20.182
Thank you,

00:25:20.182 --> 00:25:32.366
Tom. Now you just heard about how
Jet Zero is going to use Siemens

00:25:32.398 --> 00:25:35.080
technologies to transform
air travel.

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:39.588
And these technologies are available
on Siemens Xcelerator,

00:25:39.764 --> 00:25:42.600
which is our open digital
business platform.

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:44.468
And in many ways,

00:25:44.644 --> 00:25:51.748
the world runs on Siemens Xcelerator
because every carmaker,

00:25:51.924 --> 00:25:54.740
including all the leading
global EV manufacturers,

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:55.840
they use it.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:26:00.676
All the top 12 global aerospace and
defense companies use Siemens

00:26:00.708 --> 00:26:05.320
accelerator and as do 100%
of uncrewed spaceflight.

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:11.764
Eight of the top 10 consumer companies
and eight of the top 10 battery

00:26:11.812 --> 00:26:14.680
suppliers are Siemens customers.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.060
And as a matter of fact,

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:17.372
when you leave here,

00:26:17.372 --> 00:26:23.124
you might hear from Samsung or you
may go to Panasonic's keynote.

00:26:23.252 --> 00:26:24.242
So what happens?

00:26:24.276 --> 00:26:26.200
These are Siemens customers.

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:27.200
In fact,

00:26:27.228 --> 00:26:32.558
every single customer company that is
delivering a CAS keynote here is

00:26:32.614 --> 00:26:36.530
either our customer or our partner.

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:43.326
And that's why we love that the biggest
companies are actually using

00:26:43.398 --> 00:26:45.970
Siemens Xcelerator to
achieve their goals.

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:49.890
But what about the smaller ones?

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:54.822
And this is where we also have news to
share because like with Jet Zero,

00:26:54.822 --> 00:26:57.462
we want to bring that
also to startups.

00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:03.588
Today we launch our Siemens for Startups
program because we want our

00:27:03.644 --> 00:27:08.308
technologies, our expertise in our
ecosystem to be accessible to

00:27:08.364 --> 00:27:10.840
companies of every size.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.120
Through this program,

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:15.444
early stage startups,

00:27:15.492 --> 00:27:20.820
they get access to essential Siemens
offerings and accelerator at a

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.880
significantly reduced price.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:26.612
So 90% off in the first year,

00:27:26.796 --> 00:27:33.360
80% in the second and 70% in the third
and occasionally even more.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:36.036
And our partner AWS,

00:27:36.148 --> 00:27:42.052
they will also give program participants
another $5,000 in AWS credit for

00:27:42.076 --> 00:27:42.948
cloud computing.

00:27:43.044 --> 00:27:44.034
So with that,

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:49.280
everything about the Siemens startup
program is designed to help the

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.740
startups scale.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:56.528
And startups like the ones you are able
to see at our booths and there

00:27:56.584 --> 00:27:59.940
you're going to find companies
like Arc Boats,

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:05.280
they are out there to electrify the
marine industry or Spinover,

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:10.128
which is a Finnish startup that
turns wood pulp and waste into

00:28:10.184 --> 00:28:11.984
sustainable textiles.

00:28:12.112 --> 00:28:12.976
Bayard Water,

00:28:13.048 --> 00:28:16.992
which lowers the cost and carbon footprint
of clean water and desert

00:28:16.992 --> 00:28:21.680
control, good stuff which is
making arid land fertile.

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.188
So founders,

00:28:24.364 --> 00:28:27.796
they can apply there for the Siemens
for Startup program right now and

00:28:27.796 --> 00:28:33.160
you can learn more about it if you go
over to our booth in Eureka Park.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.604
So the world's biggest companies,

00:28:38.772 --> 00:28:43.164
they are using Siemens technologies
and now the world's smallest

00:28:43.212 --> 00:28:45.852
companies are also going to
use our technologies.

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:51.084
And just recently the Nvidia
CEO Jensen Huang,

00:28:51.212 --> 00:28:52.060
he said,

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:58.760
well Siemens actually has become the
operating system for industry.

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:04.164
And to tell you more about how we are
enabling our customer success and

00:29:04.164 --> 00:29:06.876
to share some more very exciting
announcements,

00:29:06.988 --> 00:29:11.360
I'm very pleased to welcome my
colleague Tony Hemmelgarn.

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:18.338
Thanks Peter.

00:29:18.434 --> 00:29:22.510
So Peter referenced this operating
system for the industry.

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:25.874
I'm excited to be here today because I
get to talk to you about how we're

00:29:25.874 --> 00:29:30.194
strengthening and expanding the technologies
that are part of Siemens

00:29:30.242 --> 00:29:34.430
xcelerator. So we're not just throwing
a bunch of tech together,

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:39.442
we're doing this to help build out this
physics based digital twin that

00:29:39.466 --> 00:29:40.610
Peter referenced.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:44.250
And over the next few minutes hopefully
I can better explain what we mean

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:47.466
by this physics based digital twin
and what it really means to our

00:29:47.466 --> 00:29:52.322
customers. It's very valuable to be
able to link that digital world to

00:29:52.346 --> 00:29:53.336
the real world.

00:29:53.482 --> 00:29:55.954
And the closer you can make
that relationship,

00:29:55.954 --> 00:30:00.146
the more valuable it is for our customers
because they need factories

00:30:00.178 --> 00:30:03.030
that can respond to really
real time conditions.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:07.320
They want processes that can self
optimize in the moment.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.004
They need answers to very,

00:30:09.004 --> 00:30:10.520
very complex questions.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:17.156
And some argue that the way to deal with
all this complexity is to reduce

00:30:17.188 --> 00:30:18.280
the complexity,

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.332
but that's not realistic.

00:30:21.476 --> 00:30:23.076
Products are becoming more complex.

00:30:23.076 --> 00:30:25.716
The manufacturing processes
for them are more complex,

00:30:25.732 --> 00:30:29.540
as you just heard in what's going on
with some of the technology that's

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:30.660
available today.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.100
So we think differently.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:39.544
We think we can have our customers
use complexity as a competitive

00:30:39.592 --> 00:30:43.400
advantage. Use complexity as
a competitive advantage.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.656
What do we mean by that?

00:30:44.656 --> 00:30:46.408
If you've got all this complexity,

00:30:46.408 --> 00:30:49.848
you need to be able to make decisions
very quickly and with confidence.

00:30:49.848 --> 00:30:52.488
If you get enough digital
representation,

00:30:52.664 --> 00:30:55.430
that real linkage to the digital,

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.298
if you can get that close enough,

00:30:57.298 --> 00:30:58.274
you can move really,

00:30:58.274 --> 00:31:01.310
really quick and go through
that complexity.

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:02.402
You know,

00:31:02.402 --> 00:31:05.106
we just heard about Jet Zero talking
about what they're doing in

00:31:05.106 --> 00:31:08.590
aviation. And it makes me think
about the Wright brothers.

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:11.380
Theirs was not a step,

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:12.970
it was a leap,

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:14.830
a leap of faith.

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:19.906
Can you imagine you're standing on the
edge of that hill and you're about

00:31:19.906 --> 00:31:21.556
to do that first flight.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:25.320
Is this aircraft going to hold
together structurally?

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:28.770
Is the engine going to keep running?

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.320
What if it's a windy day?

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.956
What's that wind going to do to the
effects of the airflow across the

00:31:34.956 --> 00:31:36.276
wings of that plane?

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:40.212
I wonder the Wright brothers,

00:31:40.212 --> 00:31:42.316
what their experience would have been
if they could have used some of the

00:31:42.316 --> 00:31:44.480
technology we're talking
about today.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:45.900
So today,

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:46.388
for example,

00:31:46.388 --> 00:31:49.594
we're introducing a new copilot
specifically for designers.

00:31:49.772 --> 00:31:52.622
This is one of many copilots that
we're doing with Microsoft.

00:31:52.622 --> 00:31:54.446
Microsoft brings the platform,

00:31:54.638 --> 00:31:56.446
we bring the industrial data.

00:31:56.598 --> 00:31:59.342
It's a very powerful combination to
be able to bring those worlds

00:31:59.342 --> 00:32:03.006
together. We gather critical
customer knowledge,

00:32:03.198 --> 00:32:04.270
as Peter referenced.

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:06.270
We keep it private to that customer,

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:07.654
but we use all of the data,

00:32:07.654 --> 00:32:08.878
the knowledge of that customer,

00:32:08.878 --> 00:32:10.574
along with our industry knowledge,

00:32:10.702 --> 00:32:12.790
to be able to help our customers.

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:14.734
So when the Wright brothers
were designing,

00:32:14.734 --> 00:32:17.044
they had many risks to think about,

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:18.470
many questions.

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:20.818
I wonder if the copilot
could have helped.

00:32:20.818 --> 00:32:21.810
For example,

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:24.130
let's say we've got a
part on the plane.

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:27.938
We want to reduce the weight of that
part for the flight that we're

00:32:27.938 --> 00:32:29.994
doing. But I got to know
it's strong enough.

00:32:29.994 --> 00:32:31.762
Could it hold a thousand newtons?

00:32:31.762 --> 00:32:36.270
Could it withstand 1000 newtons of
pressure or force on this part?

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:39.450
So to give you an example
of what we mean by that,

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:40.514
we've got a copilot,

00:32:40.514 --> 00:32:42.164
we've got a part here,

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:44.596
and I simply ask the question Look,

00:32:44.596 --> 00:32:47.220
I want to do analytics on this part.

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:49.692
The Copilot software
looks at the part,

00:32:49.876 --> 00:32:51.460
does a little bit of
analytics and says,

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.284
okay, well based on what we see,

00:32:53.284 --> 00:32:54.188
you've got four holes.

00:32:54.188 --> 00:32:57.700
I assume those holes are where you're
going to fasten or hold the part.

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:01.000
And the green is where the
load will be applied,

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.188
that force that we spoke about.

00:33:03.188 --> 00:33:06.676
The software then runs an analysis on
it and you can see it comes back

00:33:06.676 --> 00:33:09.630
and it shows me it's not
really that stressful.

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:10.490
In fact,

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:13.326
you've got a part that's
probably too safe,

00:33:13.326 --> 00:33:14.750
meaning it's too heavy.

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:16.102
So what do we do?

00:33:16.102 --> 00:33:16.566
We say,

00:33:16.566 --> 00:33:17.366
well, the software says,

00:33:17.366 --> 00:33:18.646
do you want to optimize it?

00:33:18.646 --> 00:33:19.110
And again,

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.766
all I do is say,

00:33:19.766 --> 00:33:21.598
yes, optimize the part.

00:33:21.734 --> 00:33:25.694
So it optimizes and then it comes
back with a different shape,

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:28.910
software design shape that says,

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:29.286
you know what,

00:33:29.286 --> 00:33:30.318
I made it a lot lighter,

00:33:30.318 --> 00:33:31.968
but it's just as strong.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:32.854
So think about,

00:33:32.854 --> 00:33:35.670
these are the kind of decisions you can
make in the virtual world to move

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:40.070
faster with a lot less cost to be able
to do these types of things.

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:42.238
Another example in the
automotive industry,

00:33:42.294 --> 00:33:42.878
for example,

00:33:42.878 --> 00:33:46.870
the Copilot can help you with trade off
decisions because we've got this

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:48.590
physics based digital twin.

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:49.574
In this case,

00:33:49.574 --> 00:33:54.238
the designer wants to reduce weight
as well on this vehicle,

00:33:54.334 --> 00:33:57.730
but also not risk the structural
integrity of the vehicle.

00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:59.430
So I asked the question,

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:02.000
hey, what are the materials
used in this thing?

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.220
It shows me.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.416
And then I said,

00:34:04.416 --> 00:34:04.816
well, you know,

00:34:04.816 --> 00:34:07.848
what are there alternative
materials I could use?

00:34:07.984 --> 00:34:08.656
And by the way,

00:34:08.656 --> 00:34:09.976
while you're doing that,

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:14.336
could you tell me which ones are more
sustainable and how I do that?

00:34:14.336 --> 00:34:14.640
And again,

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:17.768
we're leveraging all of the knowledge
of the company and the individuals

00:34:17.768 --> 00:34:20.880
to be able to bring that and
to be able to make these,

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.620
answer these kind of questions.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.552
Another example,

00:34:24.696 --> 00:34:29.225
I'm a designer and even if
I had an advanced user,

00:34:29.407 --> 00:34:32.249
I still can't know everything
about every domain.

00:34:32.589 --> 00:34:35.989
So I might just ask simple questions
or I need to have a refresher.

00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:37.837
I don't know all of the
things I need to know.

00:34:37.837 --> 00:34:38.429
In this case,

00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:41.301
I'm asking questions about
structural and styling.

00:34:41.445 --> 00:34:44.589
What do I need to know about doing the
styling and the structure of this

00:34:44.589 --> 00:34:47.781
vehicle? And so really what we're doing
is bringing all this knowledge

00:34:47.781 --> 00:34:49.181
together to be able to do that.

00:34:49.181 --> 00:34:51.689
And while these chatbots
are quite interesting,

00:34:52.109 --> 00:34:54.669
there's a lot more to it that
we're bringing to this.

00:34:54.669 --> 00:34:55.157
For example,

00:34:55.157 --> 00:34:57.485
when you think about what we're
doing with industrial AI,

00:34:57.485 --> 00:35:00.000
industrial data and industrial
use cases.

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:01.800
So for Example,

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.612
we think about AI in
kind of three ways.

00:35:04.612 --> 00:35:05.620
First is analyze.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.412
I'm just going to help
you do your task.

00:35:07.412 --> 00:35:08.676
You're a new employee,

00:35:08.676 --> 00:35:10.732
you don't know exactly how
to do these things.

00:35:10.732 --> 00:35:13.260
I bring all the knowledge of
the company to help you,

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:14.124
to run you through.

00:35:14.124 --> 00:35:14.964
That's analyze.

00:35:15.012 --> 00:35:16.068
I can optimize,

00:35:16.164 --> 00:35:20.244
make recommendations about how I should
work the design trade off.

00:35:20.332 --> 00:35:23.764
Maybe I make a trade off between sustainability
and the cost that's

00:35:23.764 --> 00:35:25.092
associated with that sustainability.

00:35:25.156 --> 00:35:28.106
Effort that I have then
finally is generate,

00:35:28.218 --> 00:35:28.546
you know,

00:35:28.546 --> 00:35:29.778
what I describe what I want,

00:35:29.778 --> 00:35:33.090
let the software build it for me and
see what it comes back with.

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:36.954
So AI needs the data to
be able to do this.

00:35:37.042 --> 00:35:41.410
And Siemens has a very unique advantage
in that our software brings a lot

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:44.258
of data through our applications that
we do to be able to design,

00:35:44.258 --> 00:35:45.146
build, whatever.

00:35:45.258 --> 00:35:49.098
But also we run many of the factories
in the world with our automation

00:35:49.098 --> 00:35:52.402
capabilities. So all of that data is what
we bring together to be able to

00:35:52.402 --> 00:35:55.416
solve some of these very
difficult problems.

00:35:55.608 --> 00:35:56.160
And again,

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.608
for AI to be effective,

00:35:57.608 --> 00:35:59.784
you need a physics based
digital twin.

00:35:59.784 --> 00:36:03.440
And while I believe we do this better
than anybody in the world,

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:07.460
you're never really finished bringing
those worlds closer together.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.200
And what do I mean by this comprehensive
digital twin or physics based

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:11.860
digital twin?

00:36:11.896 --> 00:36:13.448
Think about some of the
parts we've discussed.

00:36:13.448 --> 00:36:14.296
You've got a plane,

00:36:14.296 --> 00:36:15.432
you've got the headset,

00:36:15.432 --> 00:36:16.504
just simple examples,

00:36:16.552 --> 00:36:18.192
things you deal with every day.

00:36:18.192 --> 00:36:22.502
If you're a digital twin can only do
the mechanical design and can't do

00:36:22.502 --> 00:36:23.730
anything with electrical.

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:26.526
You really don't have
a digital twin,

00:36:26.638 --> 00:36:27.454
do you?

00:36:27.622 --> 00:36:30.886
And then you've got to think about software
and then you've got to think

00:36:30.886 --> 00:36:32.542
about the manufacturing engineering,

00:36:32.686 --> 00:36:35.334
the manufacturing planning of the
factory that's going to do it.

00:36:35.334 --> 00:36:37.438
And then you've got to
run the factory.

00:36:37.438 --> 00:36:39.302
If you take any of those pieces out,

00:36:39.302 --> 00:36:41.518
you really don't have
a digital twin.

00:36:41.518 --> 00:36:43.278
So you can't make those
decisions fast,

00:36:43.278 --> 00:36:44.928
you can't go in confidence,

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:48.616
and you can't leverage complexity
as a competitive advantage.

00:36:48.728 --> 00:36:50.760
That's what we bring
to our customers.

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:53.024
And so when we started
building this out,

00:36:53.024 --> 00:36:53.456
we said,

00:36:53.456 --> 00:36:55.520
well, what other things could we do?

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:59.544
We've been a leader in computer aided
simulation for over a decade,

00:36:59.672 --> 00:37:02.728
but we recently announced an agreement
to expand on this with Altair

00:37:02.728 --> 00:37:06.424
Engineering. Altair provides capabilities
for simulation.

00:37:06.552 --> 00:37:08.616
It's a $10 billion acquisition,

00:37:08.728 --> 00:37:11.552
the largest acquisition we've ever
done in the history of Siemens.

00:37:11.552 --> 00:37:13.366
And what they bring to us is,

00:37:13.366 --> 00:37:14.950
you saw earlier when
I took that part,

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:15.606
I said,

00:37:15.606 --> 00:37:16.510
make it lighter,

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:18.214
make sure I Keep the strength there.

00:37:18.214 --> 00:37:21.590
Altair then helps us understand other
things that happen in the real

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:22.782
world. For example,

00:37:22.926 --> 00:37:24.686
if I drop my phone,

00:37:24.878 --> 00:37:26.110
what happens?

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:28.014
How can I simulate that?

00:37:28.182 --> 00:37:31.774
I can simulate a crash of a vehicle
and know exactly how the vehicle's

00:37:31.774 --> 00:37:32.764
going to respond.

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:35.366
These are the things that
they bring to us.

00:37:35.366 --> 00:37:38.726
So no other company can provide as
much valuable data and insight to

00:37:38.726 --> 00:37:42.140
their customers through a
digital twin as Siemens.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.256
It's the reason so many people select
us for our software and our

00:37:46.256 --> 00:37:47.906
solutions that we have today.

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:53.632
I'm also excited about to talk about
a partnership we have with IBM and

00:37:53.632 --> 00:37:57.992
Accenture. What we're doing here is
creating a design and verification

00:37:58.056 --> 00:38:00.152
environment for software
defined vehicles.

00:38:00.296 --> 00:38:01.360
More and more products,

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:05.690
software is in that software defined
vehicle is a term used by very much

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:07.258
today in the automotive business.

00:38:07.258 --> 00:38:10.570
And what happens here is when you're
developing a product that has

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:12.190
software and hardware together,

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:14.230
they develop at different paces.

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:18.074
The problem is you need to have a relationship
between those two things

00:38:18.074 --> 00:38:19.394
because they are related.

00:38:19.418 --> 00:38:23.378
You've got to understand that linkage
that's there as you go forward.

00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:24.760
Consider, for example,

00:38:24.802 --> 00:38:26.150
the Sony headset.

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:28.162
When we're building this thing,

00:38:28.346 --> 00:38:31.316
we build it for work in
an office environment.

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:33.098
But now we're thinking,

00:38:33.098 --> 00:38:35.018
well, what if we go
into the factory?

00:38:35.018 --> 00:38:38.626
Well, the sound in the headset is going
to have to be amplified because

00:38:38.626 --> 00:38:40.282
the factory's noisier now.

00:38:40.306 --> 00:38:41.490
You need more power.

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:44.242
Is the integrated circuit going
to be able to handle that?

00:38:44.242 --> 00:38:45.826
Right. So you've got to think
about those things.

00:38:45.826 --> 00:38:48.954
You've got to think about electromagnetic
interference in the factory.

00:38:48.954 --> 00:38:53.930
You don't want to discover or find
that problem after you've started

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:57.064
fabrication of an integrated
circuit onto a wafer.

00:38:57.202 --> 00:38:58.980
If you find it at that point,

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:00.636
it's extremely expensive.

00:39:00.828 --> 00:39:04.612
We want to make sure we can do that
up front as you do the design

00:39:04.612 --> 00:39:07.460
process. And as more and more companies
are developing their own

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:08.588
integrated circuits,

00:39:08.684 --> 00:39:10.508
particularly even in
automotive today,

00:39:10.644 --> 00:39:11.940
they want to do this all up front.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:13.396
We call it shift left.

00:39:13.396 --> 00:39:16.980
Find the problems early so you can make
sure that you're not doing it

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:19.290
late in the design and manufacturing
process.

00:39:19.428 --> 00:39:21.132
So what we've done with Accenture,

00:39:21.132 --> 00:39:24.984
with IBM is we've defined a framework
that allows our customers,

00:39:25.032 --> 00:39:27.264
a cloud based solution to
be able to do this,

00:39:27.264 --> 00:39:28.152
to move quickly.

00:39:28.152 --> 00:39:31.448
Because we find we've built a way
to do end to end traceability.

00:39:31.448 --> 00:39:33.832
You make a change in the
hardware software,

00:39:33.832 --> 00:39:36.880
we can trace the two back together and
show exactly how you make those

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:40.180
decisions. We're helping our automotive
companies get the software right

00:39:40.208 --> 00:39:42.848
faster and get it out
with better quality.

00:39:42.968 --> 00:39:46.216
Again, it's an enabling factor.

00:39:46.248 --> 00:39:47.760
That's not just a step,

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.712
but a leap when you think about where
we're taking that with our

00:39:49.712 --> 00:39:51.246
customers. And by the way,

00:39:51.246 --> 00:39:54.846
you can see some of this at our booth
and see some of the demos at our

00:39:54.846 --> 00:39:58.610
booths here at CES and what we're
doing with this technology.

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:03.862
Peter spoke about startup companies.

00:40:03.966 --> 00:40:05.854
And I suppose if you think about it,

00:40:05.854 --> 00:40:08.494
the Wright brothers were the
ultimate startup company,

00:40:08.558 --> 00:40:10.538
right? Not a lot of capital,

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:12.630
gotta be agile,

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:14.170
gotta move fairly quickly.

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:17.670
And so what we're doing is to
help startup companies,

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:20.072
we're introducing a product
called Design Center.

00:40:20.216 --> 00:40:23.768
What we do at Design center is we
take our authoring capabilities.

00:40:23.768 --> 00:40:26.248
We have a tool called NX
for solid modeling.

00:40:26.248 --> 00:40:27.128
We've got Solid Edge.

00:40:27.128 --> 00:40:30.096
We've got other types of tools that
we use that are cloud based and so

00:40:30.096 --> 00:40:34.704
forth that allow our customers to be
able to grow with us and their data

00:40:34.704 --> 00:40:36.832
grows with them as we go forward.

00:40:36.832 --> 00:40:38.480
What do I mean by that?

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:42.632
Oftentimes a startup company will select
a piece of software and it works

00:40:42.632 --> 00:40:44.282
really well as the startup.

00:40:44.288 --> 00:40:46.398
And then as you start growing
and expanding,

00:40:46.398 --> 00:40:47.530
you need more.

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:53.150
And oftentimes what happens then is you've
got a major revolution you go

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:54.854
through. You've got to migrate data.

00:40:54.854 --> 00:40:56.774
You got all kinds of things
you have to deal with.

00:40:56.774 --> 00:40:59.342
We wanted to make sure that we don't
have that with our customers.

00:40:59.342 --> 00:41:00.398
So with companies like Jet,

00:41:00.398 --> 00:41:03.374
Zero can start quite small
and as they grow,

00:41:03.542 --> 00:41:06.422
really what we have is zero
interruption of the data.

00:41:06.422 --> 00:41:10.086
The data can move back and forth through
that entire process and make

00:41:10.086 --> 00:41:14.454
sure that we guarantee that it's an evolution
rather than a revolution in

00:41:14.462 --> 00:41:16.150
the way you deal with the software.

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:19.582
It also works for large companies with
their supply chains to be able to

00:41:19.582 --> 00:41:21.678
integrate because they could
be very small companies.

00:41:21.678 --> 00:41:24.494
You want to make sure the data you
produce in those companies is

00:41:24.494 --> 00:41:27.326
compatible with the larger companies
all the way through.

00:41:27.326 --> 00:41:29.902
Design center is the way we
will solve that problem.

00:41:29.902 --> 00:41:30.366
By the way,

00:41:30.366 --> 00:41:33.326
every one of those Sony headsets that
we ship to our customer will have

00:41:33.326 --> 00:41:37.170
these design capabilities included with
the headset as we go forward.

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:42.352
We're also here today to talk about
our Team Center Digital Reality

00:41:42.352 --> 00:41:46.180
Viewer. We bring the digital twin.

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:50.976
Again, we bring the digital
twin to the process.

00:41:51.128 --> 00:41:53.904
Nvidia makes it look photorealistic.

00:41:54.032 --> 00:41:56.216
I'll show you some examples of
how we think about that.

00:41:56.216 --> 00:41:58.840
If you think about 3D modeling
over the years,

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:03.082
really you interacted with models that
were kind of in basic colors.

00:42:03.256 --> 00:42:07.550
When you think about how you view the
product or view what's going on

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:09.670
with the colors in this case.

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:10.262
So, for example,

00:42:10.262 --> 00:42:11.030
an automobile,

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:14.410
if I want to see it in a
photorealistic mode,

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:16.046
in the past,

00:42:16.046 --> 00:42:18.294
you would go to a special
room called a cave,

00:42:18.294 --> 00:42:22.486
and the cave would have these projection
screens on the walls,

00:42:22.518 --> 00:42:23.142
the ceilings,

00:42:23.142 --> 00:42:23.878
everything else.

00:42:23.974 --> 00:42:24.686
And you could say,

00:42:24.686 --> 00:42:25.006
well, look,

00:42:25.006 --> 00:42:29.080
I want to see what the sun looks like
hitting a body panel or whatever.

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:32.152
But it was a very expensive process because
you had to go to this room to

00:42:32.152 --> 00:42:32.440
do it.

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:33.920
And by then you're limited.

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:35.752
Only a few people got to go.

00:42:35.752 --> 00:42:37.480
We looked at it and we said,

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:41.112
why are we not making this available
to everyone all the time?

00:42:41.112 --> 00:42:44.904
That's the work we've done with Nvidia
to be able to give it and provide

00:42:44.904 --> 00:42:46.448
the access to this anywhere.

00:42:46.448 --> 00:42:48.992
And you can see the digital twin,

00:42:49.056 --> 00:42:50.016
a real model.

00:42:50.016 --> 00:42:50.608
Every nut,

00:42:50.608 --> 00:42:52.048
bolt, screw of the thing is modeled.

00:42:52.048 --> 00:42:53.928
You know exactly how it's
going to go together.

00:42:53.928 --> 00:42:57.056
And then Nvidia helps us put it in
the background and makes it look,

00:42:57.056 --> 00:42:57.450
you know,

00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:59.390
photorealistic as you go forward.

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:03.714
So we've talked about
this digital twin,

00:43:03.762 --> 00:43:05.090
the physics behind it,

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:06.794
the idea of how we bring
it all together,

00:43:06.794 --> 00:43:09.434
how we leverage AI on top of this,

00:43:09.482 --> 00:43:12.306
Peter's going to take the next step and
shall we bring all these pieces

00:43:12.306 --> 00:43:15.930
together to really start making decisions
a lot faster with our

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:17.630
customers? Thank you so much.

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:21.550
Thank you.

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:31.948
So when we add industrial AI to the
technologies that Tony just talked

00:43:31.964 --> 00:43:35.948
about, like the most comprehensive
digital twin,

00:43:36.124 --> 00:43:39.196
we're actually able to accelerate
our path to,

00:43:39.348 --> 00:43:41.516
yes, the industrial metaverse.

00:43:41.708 --> 00:43:47.340
And that means that you not only get
the experience to get into your

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:49.030
factory in a digital world,

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:53.020
optimizing it for the real world
just a thousand times faster,

00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:57.650
you also get the opportunity to
ask questions along the way.

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:00.726
So let's come back to
our factory example,

00:44:00.726 --> 00:44:02.278
our factory worker.

00:44:02.454 --> 00:44:06.686
Let's assume you're the plant manager
and you are taking over in the

00:44:06.686 --> 00:44:11.238
morning and you actually want to know
what happened there last night?

00:44:11.374 --> 00:44:14.570
And was actually everything
properly corrected?

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:17.318
And these plan managers now,

00:44:17.374 --> 00:44:22.210
they are able to get these answers
and insights in real time.

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:27.974
And the only reason why that is possible
is all because of the industrial

00:44:28.022 --> 00:44:30.930
AI that works in the
background of this.

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:33.110
And at Siemens,

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:37.130
we are the leader in industrial AI.

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:41.810
And let me give you the three
reasons why we think so.

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.024
For one,

00:44:44.112 --> 00:44:47.940
Tony spoke about that we
have access to data,

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.050
and not just any data,

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.700
but specifically to very
relevant data.

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:59.056
Every third machine today in the world
that is on the shop floor can be

00:44:59.056 --> 00:45:01.180
connected through Siemens controls,

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:06.888
and we manage more design data
than anyone else out there.

00:45:06.944 --> 00:45:10.830
In the world with our lifecycle
management software.

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:15.780
So we have access to design and automation
data like no one else.

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:19.750
Second, it's not just
about the data,

00:45:20.290 --> 00:45:24.754
actually you have to have deep industrial
know how to make that very data

00:45:24.754 --> 00:45:30.586
useful because you have to understand
the pain points and the use cases

00:45:30.658 --> 00:45:33.216
of every single industry
that we serve,

00:45:33.378 --> 00:45:36.720
like the cooling systems in the buildings
I referenced earlier.

00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:41.764
And today we serve more than 25
industries from automotive,

00:45:41.892 --> 00:45:43.252
aerospace, to pharma,

00:45:43.316 --> 00:45:45.460
semiconductor, oil and
gas utilities,

00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:46.772
you name it.

00:45:46.956 --> 00:45:51.160
So we bring that deep understanding of
what really drives our customers.

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:52.772
And then lastly,

00:45:52.916 --> 00:45:54.548
let me emphasize,

00:45:54.724 --> 00:45:56.480
AI is not new.

00:45:56.860 --> 00:46:03.972
We have built industrial AI already
for decades and today we have more

00:46:03.996 --> 00:46:10.308
than 1,500 AI experts and we have a patent
portfolio of more than 3,000

00:46:10.364 --> 00:46:15.860
AI patents spanning everything from generative
AI to neural networks to

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:20.560
machine learning to blends of it
again all coming together.

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:27.832
And we see how this technology has the
potential to change the world for

00:46:27.856 --> 00:46:28.660
the better.

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:34.632
And that's why we are uniquely equipped
to deliver that piece in the

00:46:34.656 --> 00:46:35.700
industrial world.

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:44.600
So today you heard about Jet Zero and
why Jet Zero chose Siemens as its

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:45.592
technology partner.

00:46:45.656 --> 00:46:50.408
Because we are the only company that
can deliver the full set of

00:46:50.464 --> 00:46:55.460
technologies all the way from engineering
to production that they need to

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.788
transform air travel.

00:46:56.884 --> 00:46:58.534
Thank you Tom for that.

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:03.870
And you heard a lot about new technologies
that we're going to introduce

00:47:04.004 --> 00:47:05.044
this year.

00:47:05.212 --> 00:47:09.956
Technologies such as the ones that you
saw like the Siemens Industrial

00:47:09.988 --> 00:47:13.880
Copilot now also being available
on the industrial edge.

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:17.892
You saw the Sony Head mounted display
for Immersive engineering,

00:47:17.956 --> 00:47:23.040
the NXX Design Copilot Design center
for Small and Large and Team Center

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.820
Digital Reality Viewer.

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:32.448
So all of these technologies enable companies
big and small to make those

00:47:32.504 --> 00:47:37.456
leaps that we need those leaps
to become more competitive,

00:47:37.648 --> 00:47:40.544
more sustainable and more resilient.

00:47:40.672 --> 00:47:46.260
And that is technology that transform
the everyday for everyone.

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:46.960
Thank you.
