We want to retrieve the HTML code, so we use 00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 align:start position:0% want to retrieve the HTML code, so we use 00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.830 align:start position:0% want to retrieve the HTML code, so we use get. You can do that, and then set the body 00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 align:start position:0% get. You can do that, and then set the body 00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.390 align:start position:0% get. You can do that, and then set the body type to ro and the content type to jason. If 00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.149 align:start position:0% type to ro and the content type to jason. If 00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 align:start position:0% 00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:43.229 align:start position:0% you do that and click OK, you 00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 align:start position:0% you do that and click OK, you 00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.990 align:start position:0% you do that and click OK, you can do that. Then I'll run this once. If you click R once, the 00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 align:start position:0% can do that. Then I'll run this once. If you click R once, the 00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.270 align:start position:0% can do that. Then I'll run this once. If you click R once, the information from this site has been 00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 align:start position:0% information from this site has been 00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.390 align:start position:0% information from this site has been imported into the http module. If you 00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 align:start position:0% imported into the http module. If you 00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.309 align:start position:0% imported into the http module. If you look here, you can see that the data has 00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 align:start position:0% look here, you can see that the data has 00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.069 align:start position:0% look here, you can see that the data has all the HTML codes like this. We've imported a lot of 00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 align:start position:0% all the HTML codes like this. We've imported a lot of 00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.229 align:start position:0% all the HTML codes like this. We've imported a lot of information. If you look below, you 00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:59.069 align:start position:0% information. If you look below, you 00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.030 align:start position:0% 00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 align:start position:0% 00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.750 align:start position:0% can see that we've imported all the information, including the paper title and author link. But since it's 00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 align:start position:0% can see that we've imported all the information, including the paper title and author link. But since it's 00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.990 align:start position:0% can see that we've imported all the information, including the paper title and author link. But since it's HTML code, there's 00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 align:start position:0% HTML code, there's 00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.270 align:start position:0% HTML code, there's a lot of code information in addition to the text value. 00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 align:start position:0% a lot of code information in addition to the text value. 00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.509 align:start position:0% a lot of code information in addition to the text value. So, if you 00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 align:start position:0% So, if you 00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.229 align:start position:0% So, if you want to make this easier to work with, it's a 00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 align:start position:0% want to make this easier to work with, it's a 00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.589 align:start position:0% want to make this easier to work with, it's a good idea to convert it to text. To do 00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 align:start position:0% good idea to convert it to text. To do 00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.670 align:start position:0% good idea to convert it to text. To do that, go to the text parser and 00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.069 align:start position:0% that, go to the text parser and 00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 align:start position:0% 00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.590 align:start position:0% there's a module called HTML to Text. Click on that. The 00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 align:start position:0% there's a module called HTML to Text. Click on that. The 00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.349 align:start position:0% there's a module called HTML to Text. Click on that. The value here 00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 align:start position:0% value here 00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.270 align:start position:0% value here is the data value that came out as https. You can enter the data value. Do that, 00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 align:start position:0% is the data value that came out as https. You can enter the data value. Do that, 00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.030 align:start position:0% is the data value that came out as https. You can enter the data value. Do that, save it, and 00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 align:start position:0% save it, and 00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.469 align:start position:0% save it, and then 00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 align:start position:0% then 00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:27.990 align:start position:0% then run it again. If you run it again, the 00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.070 align:start position:0% run it again. If you run it again, the 00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 align:start position:0% 00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.550 align:start position:0% messy HTML codes that were in the front of the output are 00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 align:start position:0% messy HTML codes that were in the front of the output are 00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.950 align:start position:0% messy HTML codes that were in the front of the output are gone, and the texts are extracted like this. If you 00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 align:start position:0% gone, and the texts are extracted like this. If you 00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.070 align:start position:0% gone, and the texts are extracted like this. If you look here, you can see the 00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 align:start position:0% look here, you can see the 00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.950 align:start position:0% look here, you can see the title and the value are entered like this, and 00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 align:start position:0% title and the value are entered like this, and 00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.990 align:start position:0% title and the value are entered like this, and then the authors are listed here. Let 00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 align:start position:0% then the authors are listed here. Let 00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.790 align:start position:0% then the authors are listed here. Let 's go in and here, there's a link too, 00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 align:start position:0% 's go in and here, there's a link too, 00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.870 align:start position:0% 's go in and here, there's a link too, so you can see that the text value is extracted well. 00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.550 align:start position:0% so you can see that the text value is extracted well. 00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 align:start position:0% 00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.670 align:start position:0% Now, with this text, we want to 00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 align:start position:0% Now, with this text, we want to 00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.510 align:start position:0% Now, with this text, we want to extract only the title, author, and link values ​​of the paper, 00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 align:start position:0% extract only the title, author, and link values ​​of the paper, 00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.110 align:start position:0% extract only the title, author, and link values ​​of the paper, so you can do the data 00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 align:start position:0% so you can do the data 00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.189 align:start position:0% so you can do the data extraction task. In fact, 00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 align:start position:0% extraction task. In fact, 00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.510 align:start position:0% extraction task. In fact, in the past, in order to extract only the 00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 align:start position:0% in the past, in order to extract only the 00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.150 align:start position:0% in the past, in order to extract only the title, author, and link 00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 align:start position:0% title, author, and link 00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.150 align:start position:0% title, author, and link values ​​that we want from this output, we have to 00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 align:start position:0% values ​​that we want from this output, we have to 00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.749 align:start position:0% values ​​that we want from this output, we have to use the X that I covered in the previous video to do pattern 00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759 align:start position:0% use the X that I covered in the previous video to do pattern 00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:06.870 align:start position:0% use the X that I covered in the previous video to do pattern matching. In the 00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 align:start position:0% matching. In the 00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.390 align:start position:0% matching. In the case of a site like this, pattern matching is not as easy as it seems. That's 00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 align:start position:0% case of a site like this, pattern matching is not as easy as it seems. That's 00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.430 align:start position:0% case of a site like this, pattern matching is not as easy as it seems. That's because the title 00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 align:start position:0% because the title 00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.830 align:start position:0% because the title continues here, and here, Sia Chi 00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 align:start position:0% continues here, and here, Sia Chi 00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.990 align:start position:0% continues here, and here, Sia Chi Tang, this is where the author's name 00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 align:start position:0% Tang, this is where the author's name 00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.990 align:start position:0% Tang, this is where the author's name begins, but the title, the author, 00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 align:start position:0% begins, but the title, the author, 00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.150 align:start position:0% begins, but the title, the author, just has a space and is not properly separated. 00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 align:start position:0% just has a space and is not properly separated. 00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.110 align:start position:0% just has a space and is not properly separated. If it starts with a new paragraph, it would be 00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.990 align:start position:0% If it starts with a new paragraph, it would be 00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 align:start position:0% 00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.430 align:start position:0% good if it were separated like ath, but it is 00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 align:start position:0% good if it were separated like ath, but it is 00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.070 align:start position:0% good if it were separated like ath, but it is not separated and goes right in. 00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 align:start position:0% not separated and goes right in. 00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.309 align:start position:0% not separated and goes right in. So it's not as easy as you think to distinguish 00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.319 align:start position:0% So it's not as easy as you think to distinguish 00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:33.350 align:start position:0% So it's not as easy as you think to distinguish where the title ends and 00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0% where the title ends and 00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.510 align:start position:0% where the title ends and where it starts with X. 00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 align:start position:0% where it starts with X. 00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.390 align:start position:0% where it starts with X. So in the past, when I was 00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 align:start position:0% So in the past, when I was 00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.870 align:start position:0% So in the past, when I was doing this kind of work, I 00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 align:start position:0% doing this kind of work, I 00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.350 align:start position:0% doing this kind of work, I spent hours just making a line. But 00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 align:start position:0% spent hours just making a line. But 00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.550 align:start position:0% spent hours just making a line. But now, it's the AI ​​era. So when there are 00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 align:start position:0% now, it's the AI ​​era. So when there are 00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.270 align:start position:0% now, it's the AI ​​era. So when there are cases where you have to write such a complicated X, 00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 align:start position:0% cases where you have to write such a complicated X, 00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.230 align:start position:0% cases where you have to write such a complicated X, instead of using X, you just 00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 align:start position:0% instead of using X, you just 00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.469 align:start position:0% instead of using X, you just use AI to extract the data you want. You 00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 align:start position:0% use AI to extract the data you want. You 00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:52.350 align:start position:0% use AI to extract the data you want. You can extract it. So 00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.189 align:start position:0% can extract it. So 00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:55.790 align:start position:0% 00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 align:start position:0% 00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.510 align:start position:0% let's ask the BT team to extract the information we want. Then, 00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 align:start position:0% let's ask the BT team to extract the information we want. Then, 00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.870 align:start position:0% let's ask the BT team to extract the information we want. Then, select the PT module, 00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 align:start position:0% select the PT module, 00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.430 align:start position:0% select the PT module, click create, and try connecting. 00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0% click create, and try connecting. 00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.270 align:start position:0% click create, and try connecting. Ah, the model 00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 align:start position:0% Ah, the model 00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.510 align:start position:0% Ah, the model will be PT 45. And 00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 align:start position:0% will be PT 45. And 00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.189 align:start position:0% will be PT 45. And in the message, we will input the system and the user separately. To put it 00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199 align:start position:0% in the message, we will input the system and the user separately. To put it 00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:09.510 align:start position:0% in the message, we will input the system and the user separately. To put it simply, the 00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 align:start position:0% simply, the 00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.830 align:start position:0% simply, the system 00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 align:start position:0% system 00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.469 align:start position:0% system gives instructions before doing the most suitable work.

And 00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 align:start position:0% 00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:43.629 align:start position:0% I have specified that the output should be in the Jason format. And I have 00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 align:start position:0% I have specified that the output should be in the Jason format. And I have 00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:45.870 align:start position:0% I have specified that the output should be in the Jason format. And I have explained the rules for the Jason format a little more. It 00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.909 align:start position:0% explained the rules for the Jason format a little more. It 00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 align:start position:0% 00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:50.189 align:start position:0% starts and ends with brackets like this. If you do 00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:50.199 align:start position:0% starts and ends with brackets like this. If you do 00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:52.390 align:start position:0% starts and ends with brackets like this. If you do not add a sentence after this, Jason and the value 00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 align:start position:0% not add a sentence after this, Jason and the value 00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.110 align:start position:0% not add a sentence after this, Jason and the value Extract itself again. So I 00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.309 align:start position:0% Extract itself again. So I 00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:58.510 align:start position:0% 00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 align:start position:0% 00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.869 align:start position:0% instructed it not to attach this kind of thing, just output the actual JSON format output. Then, I 00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:00.879 align:start position:0% instructed it not to attach this kind of thing, just output the actual JSON format output. Then, I 00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.830 align:start position:0% instructed it not to attach this kind of thing, just output the actual JSON format output. Then, I used a user prompt here to 00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:02.840 align:start position:0% used a user prompt here to 00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.309 align:start position:0% used a user prompt here to write specific information. 00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0% write specific information. 00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:06.550 align:start position:0% write specific information. So, I emphasized that only the contents of the JSON file 00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0% So, I emphasized that only the contents of the JSON file 00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.110 align:start position:0% So, I emphasized that only the contents of the JSON file should be extracted. 00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 align:start position:0% should be extracted. 00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.230 align:start position:0% should be extracted. Usually, about 50 00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 align:start position:0% Usually, about 50 00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.950 align:start position:0% Usually, about 50 papers are displayed at once on the site. 00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960 align:start position:0% papers are displayed at once on the site. 00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.749 align:start position:0% papers are displayed at once on the site. So, since there are about 50, I specified that it should 00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:13.759 align:start position:0% So, since there are about 50, I specified that it should 00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:16.029 align:start position:0% So, since there are about 50, I specified that it should extract all 50 without stopping after doing a few. 00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:17.510 align:start position:0% extract all 50 without stopping after doing a few. 00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 align:start position:0% 00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.230 align:start position:0% Then, I inserted a flag. So, if the 00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:19.240 align:start position:0% Then, I inserted a flag. So, if the 00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.270 align:start position:0% Then, I inserted a flag. So, if the data input is like this, the 00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0% data input is like this, the 00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.909 align:start position:0% data input is like this, the output should come out like this. 00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:25.070 align:start position:0% output should come out like this. 00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080 align:start position:0% 00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.790 align:start position:0% Sometimes, if you don't insert a flag, the result value may 00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:27.800 align:start position:0% Sometimes, if you don't insert a flag, the result value may 00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.189 align:start position:0% Sometimes, if you don't insert a flag, the result value may not come out in the form we want. 00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199 align:start position:0% not come out in the form we want. 00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:30.869 align:start position:0% not come out in the form we want. So, if you 00:07:30.869 --> 00:07:30.879 align:start position:0% So, if you 00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:33.309 align:start position:0% So, if you insert a flag like this, you can 00:07:33.309 --> 00:07:33.319 align:start position:0% insert a flag like this, you can 00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:35.589 align:start position:0% insert a flag like this, you can continue to receive the desired values ​​more stably. 00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:35.599 align:start position:0% continue to receive the desired values ​​more stably. 00:07:35.599 --> 00:07:36.990 align:start position:0% continue to receive the desired values ​​more stably. And now, the 00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.000 align:start position:0% And now, the 00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.029 align:start position:0% And now, the most important thing is to insert the text value received 00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0% most important thing is to insert the text value received 00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:41.070 align:start position:0% most important thing is to insert the text value received from the website that we extracted with this text parser. 00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.629 align:start position:0% from the website that we extracted with this text parser. 00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 align:start position:0% 00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:44.510 align:start position:0% So now, I specify the website data. 00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 align:start position:0% So now, I specify the website data. 00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.189 align:start position:0% So now, I specify the website data. And the text is the 00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0% And the text is the 00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:48.510 align:start position:0% And the text is the text value from the text parser, and the 00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:48.520 align:start position:0% text value from the text parser, and the 00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.309 align:start position:0% text value from the text parser, and the token is 4096. I'll do it 00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:50.319 align:start position:0% token is 4096. I'll do it 00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:52.670 align:start position:0% token is 4096. I'll do it because there are a lot of examples and 00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:52.680 align:start position:0% because there are a lot of examples and 00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.830 align:start position:0% because there are a lot of examples and we need to 00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:54.840 align:start position:0% we need to 00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.629 align:start position:0% we need to extract information about several papers for the output, 00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639 align:start position:0% extract information about several papers for the output, 00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:58.589 align:start position:0% extract information about several papers for the output, so I'll increase the token value just in case. You can 00:07:58.589 --> 00:07:58.599 align:start position:0% so I'll increase the token value just in case. You can 00:07:58.599 --> 00:08:00.629 align:start position:0% so I'll increase the token value just in case. You can do this and 00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:00.639 align:start position:0% do this and 00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:02.550 align:start position:0% do this and save it. 00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0% save it. 00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.710 align:start position:0% save it. Then, we don't need to do anything like matching with X. 00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0% Then, we don't need to do anything like matching with X. 00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.710 align:start position:0% Then, we don't need to do anything like matching with X. Chachi PT will 00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0% Chachi PT will 00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.070 align:start position:0% Chachi PT will understand the prompt and extract 00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:09.080 align:start position:0% understand the prompt and extract 00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.350 align:start position:0% understand the prompt and extract only the values ​​we want from the text information in the JSON format. Let's 00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.360 align:start position:0% only the values ​​we want from the text information in the JSON format. Let's 00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.830 align:start position:0% only the values ​​we want from the text information in the JSON format. Let's run it once. It 00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840 align:start position:0% run it once. It 00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.469 align:start position:0% run it once. It went like this. If you 00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:15.479 align:start position:0% went like this. If you 00:08:15.479 --> 00:08:18.230 align:start position:0% went like this. If you look at the ret, it organizes 00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0% look at the ret, it organizes 00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.350 align:start position:0% look at the ret, it organizes several papers well in the JSON format by linking the title. 00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.550 align:start position:0% several papers well in the JSON format by linking the title. 00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0% 00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.029 align:start position:0% You can see that it's being extracted well. If 00:08:24.029 --> 00:08:26.350 align:start position:0% You can see that it's being extracted well. If 00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:26.360 align:start position:0% 00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.550 align:start position:0% you're not familiar with this yet, you need to create a connection if you want to use it in the latest PT 00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0% you're not familiar with this yet, you need to create a connection if you want to use it in the latest PT 00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.469 align:start position:0% you're not familiar with this yet, you need to create a connection if you want to use it in the latest PT Make. 00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0% Make. 00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:32.509 align:start position:0% Make. If you connect, you'll 00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:32.519 align:start position:0% If you connect, you'll 00:08:32.519 --> 00:08:34.389 align:start position:0% If you connect, you'll have an API key. So if you 00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:34.399 align:start position:0% have an API key. So if you 00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:36.310 align:start position:0% have an API key. So if you look at the beginning of my Make tutorial, I explained how to 00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:36.320 align:start position:0% look at the beginning of my Make tutorial, I explained how to 00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.709 align:start position:0% look at the beginning of my Make tutorial, I explained how to enter the API key. Please refer to it and 00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:41.269 align:start position:0% enter the API key. Please refer to it and 00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0% 00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:43.469 align:start position:0% create an API key first. You need to 00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:43.479 align:start position:0% create an API key first. You need to 00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:45.590 align:start position:0% create an API key first. You need to purchase Chachi PT API credits first. The 00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0% purchase Chachi PT API credits first. The 00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.230 align:start position:0% purchase Chachi PT API credits first. The minimum amount is $5, and if you 00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:47.240 align:start position:0% minimum amount is $5, and if you 00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.150 align:start position:0% minimum amount is $5, and if you purchase it, you need to enter the API key. If you 00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:49.160 align:start position:0% purchase it, you need to enter the API key. If you 00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.030 align:start position:0% purchase it, you need to enter the API key. If you enter the API key and save, the 00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0% enter the API key and save, the 00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.110 align:start position:0% enter the API key and save, the connection will be made. Then you 00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0% connection will be made. Then you 00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.870 align:start position:0% connection will be made. Then you can use it. So I checked 00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:54.880 align:start position:0% can use it. So I checked 00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.230 align:start position:0% can use it. So I checked that I can extract the ret well like this. 00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:57.240 align:start position:0% that I can extract the ret well like this. 00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.870 align:start position:0% that I can extract the ret well like this. It's very simple. If you 00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:58.880 align:start position:0% It's very simple. If you 00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.110 align:start position:0% It's very simple. If you make this yourself, it can be very difficult, but 00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.829 align:start position:0% make this yourself, it can be very difficult, but 00:09:02.829 --> 00:09:02.839 align:start position:0% 00:09:02.839 --> 00:09:04.949 align:start position:0% instead of using PTGA, you can organize that difficult task neatly. At 00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0% instead of using PTGA, you can organize that difficult task neatly. At 00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:06.630 align:start position:0% instead of using PTGA, you can organize that difficult task neatly. At this time, 00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0% this time, 00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.949 align:start position:0% this time, we wrote the prompt in English. Of course, it's okay to write it in Korean, but the 00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:11.350 align:start position:0% we wrote the prompt in English. Of course, it's okay to write it in Korean, but the 00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:11.360 align:start position:0% 00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.470 align:start position:0% thesis site itself is in English. 00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:13.480 align:start position:0% thesis site itself is in English. 00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.430 align:start position:0% thesis site itself is in English. And the work we have to do 00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0% And the work we have to do 00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.269 align:start position:0% And the work we have to do is also technical. We have to 00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0% is also technical. We have to 00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:19.150 align:start position:0% is also technical. We have to extract the information we want in Jason format. 00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:19.160 align:start position:0% extract the information we want in Jason format. 00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.949 align:start position:0% extract the information we want in Jason format. So when giving such instructions, it's 00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start position:0% So when giving such instructions, it's 00:09:20.959 --> 00:09:23.030 align:start position:0% So when giving such instructions, it's more accurate and you can get a more reliable output if you do it in English. That's 00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:25.430 align:start position:0% more accurate and you can get a more reliable output if you do it in English. That's 00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0% 00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.310 align:start position:0% why I intentionally wrote it in English. 00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.350 align:start position:0% why I intentionally wrote it in English. 00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.069 align:start position:0% 00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:31.079 align:start position:0% 00:09:31.079 --> 00:09:33.389 align:start position:0% I wrote it in the main text of the user prompt. So, I'll put the prompt in the video description so that you can 00:09:33.389 --> 00:09:35.150 align:start position:0% I wrote it in the main text of the user prompt. So, I'll put the prompt in the video description so that you can 00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:35.160 align:start position:0% 00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.269 align:start position:0% refer to it when you practice. 00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279 align:start position:0% refer to it when you practice. 00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:39.430 align:start position:0% refer to it when you practice. We 00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0% We 00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.910 align:start position:0% We received the information in Jason format. Then, if you save this 00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0% received the information in Jason format. Then, if you save this 00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.990 align:start position:0% received the information in Jason format. Then, if you save this in a database like a sheet and 00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0% in a database like a sheet and 00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.710 align:start position:0% in a database like a sheet and use it, it would be 00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.550 align:start position:0% use it, it would be 00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:47.560 align:start position:0% 00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.150 align:start position:0% good to do one more thing to save it. Right now, the 00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:49.160 align:start position:0% good to do one more thing to save it. Right now, the 00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.949 align:start position:0% good to do one more thing to save it. Right now, the ret is all in one value, but 00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:51.959 align:start position:0% ret is all in one value, but 00:09:51.959 --> 00:09:53.990 align:start position:0% ret is all in one value, but this is now It would 00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0% this is now It would 00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.990 align:start position:0% this is now It would be better to split it and assign each value by paper. 00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0% be better to split it and assign each value by paper. 00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.670 align:start position:0% be better to split it and assign each value by paper. So the way to split this is 00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0% So the way to split this is 00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.550 align:start position:0% So the way to split this is because we made it in a Jason format, so it would be 00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.790 align:start position:0% because we made it in a Jason format, so it would be 00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:01.800 align:start position:0% 00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.030 align:start position:0% good to use a function that organizes the data nicely in this Jason format. 00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:04.040 align:start position:0% good to use a function that organizes the data nicely in this Jason format. 00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.310 align:start position:0% good to use a function that organizes the data nicely in this Jason format. Go into Jason and there 00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0% Go into Jason and there 00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.790 align:start position:0% Go into Jason and there is Parse Jason and a module. So 00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:07.800 align:start position:0% is Parse Jason and a module. So 00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.910 align:start position:0% is Parse Jason and a module. So click Parse Jason and the Jason string is the ret value. 00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0% click Parse Jason and the Jason string is the ret value. 00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.630 align:start position:0% click Parse Jason and the Jason string is the ret value. We just came out 00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640 align:start position:0% We just came out 00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.670 align:start position:0% We just came out as a Jason string. So you can change the ret to a Jason string. 00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0% as a Jason string. So you can change the ret to a Jason string. 00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.470 align:start position:0% as a Jason string. So you can change the ret to a Jason string. After doing this, you can 00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480 align:start position:0% After doing this, you can 00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.509 align:start position:0% After doing this, you can connect the 00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0% connect the 00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:19.550 align:start position:0% connect the sheet. First, connect the sheet to Google Connection and 00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.560 align:start position:0% sheet. First, connect the sheet to Google Connection and 00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.350 align:start position:0% sheet. First, connect the sheet to Google Connection and select the drive. 00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0% select the drive. 00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.110 align:start position:0% select the drive. I 00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.120 align:start position:0% I 00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.949 align:start position:0% I made a sheet in advance because it is a web crawling example. You can 00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:27.190 align:start position:0% made a sheet in advance because it is a web crawling example. You can 00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0% 00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.310 align:start position:0% now designate the columns by crawling the AI ​​paper. 00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320 align:start position:0% now designate the columns by crawling the AI ​​paper. 00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.269 align:start position:0% now designate the columns by crawling the AI ​​paper. But I have 00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0% But I have 00:10:31.279 --> 00:10:32.990 align:start position:0% But I have n't received it as Jason yet, so the 00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000 align:start position:0% n't received it as Jason yet, so the 00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.710 align:start position:0% n't received it as Jason yet, so the columns don't appear. 00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0% columns don't appear. 00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.829 align:start position:0% columns don't appear. I'll try it again. Then, the 00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0% I'll try it again. Then, the 00:10:37.839 --> 00:10:40.269 align:start position:0% I'll try it again. Then, the Jason format that was included in one ret is 00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:40.279 align:start position:0% Jason format that was included in one ret is 00:10:40.279 --> 00:10:43.150 align:start position:0% Jason format that was included in one ret is divided into a bundle for each paper. If you 00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:43.160 align:start position:0% divided into a bundle for each paper. If you 00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.990 align:start position:0% divided into a bundle for each paper. If you divide it like this, it will be 00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.000 align:start position:0% divide it like this, it will be 00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.590 align:start position:0% divide it like this, it will be easier to process. And 00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:46.600 align:start position:0% easier to process. And 00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.910 align:start position:0% easier to process. And we can change the title ter link to the original 00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:48.920 align:start position:0% we can change the title ter link to the original 00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.550 align:start position:0% we can change the title ter link to the original hpt. Since you asked me to divide it like this, I 00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560 align:start position:0% hpt. Since you asked me to divide it like this, I 00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.230 align:start position:0% hpt. Since you asked me to divide it like this, I divided the Jason format well so 00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:53.240 align:start position:0% divided the Jason format well so 00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.230 align:start position:0% divided the Jason format well so that you can specify each column like this. 00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:55.240 align:start position:0% that you can specify each column like this. 00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.310 align:start position:0% that you can specify each column like this. Now, you have to paste this on the sheet. 00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:57.320 align:start position:0% Now, you have to paste this on the sheet. 00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.829 align:start position:0% Now, you have to paste this on the sheet. In the sheet, the update date will be 00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0% In the sheet, the update date will be 00:10:59.839 --> 00:11:01.629 align:start position:0% In the sheet, the update date will be updated today, so just 00:11:01.629 --> 00:11:01.639 align:start position:0% updated today, so just 00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:03.590 align:start position:0% updated today, so just select Now from Date and Time.

Just 00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.470 align:start position:0% put it in and change it to this. Just like before, we 00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:37.480 align:start position:0% like before, we 00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.110 align:start position:0% like before, we 'll set it to low JSON. 00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0% 'll set it to low JSON. 00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.790 align:start position:0% 'll set it to low JSON. And in the same way, we'll 00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:41.800 align:start position:0% And in the same way, we'll 00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.269 align:start position:0% And in the same way, we'll copy and paste the text parser. 00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0% copy and paste the text parser. 00:12:44.279 --> 00:12:46.230 align:start position:0% copy and paste the text parser. And we'll get the data value in front. In the same way, we only 00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:47.629 align:start position:0% And we'll get the data value in front. In the same way, we only 00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0% 00:12:47.639 --> 00:12:49.310 align:start position:0% need to extract the text anyway, so we set it the same way. 00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320 align:start position:0% need to extract the text anyway, so we set it the same way. 00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.310 align:start position:0% need to extract the text anyway, so we set it the same way. Then, let's run it first. 00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:51.320 align:start position:0% Then, let's run it first. 00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.790 align:start position:0% Then, let's run it first. Then, we extracted the values ​​that include multiple articles in the text. 00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.189 align:start position:0% Then, we extracted the values ​​that include multiple articles in the text. 00:12:56.189 --> 00:12:56.199 align:start position:0% 00:12:56.199 --> 00:12:59.230 align:start position:0% Here, we can 00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.430 align:start position:0% Here, we can 00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440 align:start position:0% 00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.870 align:start position:0% extract some data with the information. I don't want to, but here are the 00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0% extract some data with the information. I don't want to, but here are the 00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.990 align:start position:0% extract some data with the information. I don't want to, but here are the articles, and here 00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:05.000 align:start position:0% articles, and here 00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.430 align:start position:0% articles, and here is the link, right? https 00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:06.440 align:start position:0% is the link, right? https 00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.030 align:start position:0% is the link, right? https techcrunch.com, and here is the 00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:08.040 align:start position:0% techcrunch.com, and here is the 00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.269 align:start position:0% techcrunch.com, and here is the date, and then the title is the 00:13:10.269 --> 00:13:10.279 align:start position:0% date, and then the title is the 00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:12.750 align:start position:0% date, and then the title is the URL, and there are the URLs of the articles, 00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:12.760 align:start position:0% URL, and there are the URLs of the articles, 00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.949 align:start position:0% URL, and there are the URLs of the articles, and the values ​​are here, and there are also 00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:14.959 align:start position:0% and the values ​​are here, and there are also 00:13:14.959 --> 00:13:17.110 align:start position:0% and the values ​​are here, and there are also articles, so we have to 00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0% articles, so we have to 00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.670 align:start position:0% articles, so we have to extract these URLs and access each URL to 00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0% extract these URLs and access each URL to 00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.030 align:start position:0% extract these URLs and access each URL to extract the article information, so we 00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.230 align:start position:0% extract the article information, so we 00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0% 00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.750 align:start position:0% have to extract the URLs again this time. 00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:25.760 align:start position:0% have to extract the URLs again this time. 00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.629 align:start position:0% have to extract the URLs again this time. Of course, we can use Chaji PIT like before, but if you 00:13:27.629 --> 00:13:29.230 align:start position:0% Of course, we can use Chaji PIT like before, but if you 00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:29.240 align:start position:0% 00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.910 align:start position:0% look at the data, this 00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:30.920 align:start position:0% look at the data, this 00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.629 align:start position:0% look at the data, this is relatively simple. So we'll use X as a text parser to 00:13:33.629 --> 00:13:33.639 align:start position:0% is relatively simple. So we'll use X as a text parser to 00:13:33.639 --> 00:13:35.310 align:start position:0% is relatively simple. So we'll use X as a text parser to match. For 00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:35.320 align:start position:0% match. For 00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.430 align:start position:0% match. For these simple things, it's 00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0% these simple things, it's 00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.590 align:start position:0% these simple things, it's better to use X instead. Chaji PTGA is 00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0% better to use X instead. Chaji PTGA is 00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.829 align:start position:0% better to use X instead. Chaji PTGA is convenient, but anyway, we have to 00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0% convenient, but anyway, we have to 00:13:41.839 --> 00:13:43.870 align:start position:0% convenient, but anyway, we have to charge the API credit and use the API, 00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:43.880 align:start position:0% charge the API credit and use the API, 00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.910 align:start position:0% charge the API credit and use the API, so it costs money. It's not a 00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:45.920 align:start position:0% so it costs money. It's not a 00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.870 align:start position:0% so it costs money. It's not a big cost, but 00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.949 align:start position:0% big cost, but 00:13:49.949 --> 00:13:49.959 align:start position:0% 00:13:49.959 --> 00:13:52.230 align:start position:0% if you think you'll run this workflow often, it's better to use X directly for simple things in order to make it cost-effective. 00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:54.550 align:start position:0% if you think you'll run this workflow often, it's better to use X directly for simple things in order to make it cost-effective. 00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.560 align:start position:0% 00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.590 align:start position:0% So there's something called a match pattern in the text parser. 00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.430 align:start position:0% So there's something called a match pattern in the text parser. 00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.440 align:start position:0% 00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.790 align:start position:0% Click on the match pattern and enter the X expression here. If you 00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0% Click on the match pattern and enter the X expression here. If you 00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.110 align:start position:0% Click on the match pattern and enter the X expression here. If you look at it, it's 00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:04.120 align:start position:0% look at it, it's 00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.829 align:start position:0% look at it, it's https in capital letters, 00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:06.839 align:start position:0% https in capital letters, 00:14:06.839 --> 00:14:09.269 align:start position:0% https in capital letters, techlunch.com, and then the date value, and 00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0% techlunch.com, and then the date value, and 00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:10.710 align:start position:0% techlunch.com, and then the date value, and then the title values. 00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0% then the title values. 00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.069 align:start position:0% then the title values. So that You can think about it and 00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:13.079 align:start position:0% So that You can think about it and 00:14:13.079 --> 00:14:15.189 align:start position:0% So that You can think about it and match it. I 00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0% match it. I 00:14:15.199 --> 00:14:17.629 align:start position:0% match it. I created a response in advance. If you look here, the 00:14:17.629 --> 00:14:17.639 align:start position:0% created a response in advance. If you look here, the 00:14:17.639 --> 00:14:19.590 align:start position:0% created a response in advance. If you look here, the part in front is called URL, so I 00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:22.389 align:start position:0% part in front is called URL, so I 00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0% 00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:24.550 align:start position:0% specified that the value matched by the pattern should be saved as a key value pair called URL. The 00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:24.560 align:start position:0% specified that the value matched by the pattern should be saved as a key value pair called URL. The 00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.749 align:start position:0% specified that the value matched by the pattern should be saved as a key value pair called URL. The part after this is the 00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:26.759 align:start position:0% part after this is the 00:14:26.759 --> 00:14:28.590 align:start position:0% part after this is the mark that actually matches it. 00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:28.600 align:start position:0% mark that actually matches it. 00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.670 align:start position:0% mark that actually matches it. When you create this, it 00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:33.430 align:start position:0% When you create this, it 00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.870 align:start position:0% 00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0% 00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.350 align:start position:0% would be good to refer to the X tutorial video that I covered for basic knowledge about X. And now, 00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0% would be good to refer to the X tutorial video that I covered for basic knowledge about X. And now, 00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.870 align:start position:0% would be good to refer to the X tutorial video that I covered for basic knowledge about X. And now, when you actually create it, just give me the system PT 00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:39.880 align:start position:0% when you actually create it, just give me the system PT 00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.069 align:start position:0% when you actually create it, just give me the system PT text and say, "I 00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0% text and say, "I 00:14:42.079 --> 00:14:43.949 align:start position:0% text and say, "I want to get this here," and 00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:43.959 align:start position:0% want to get this here," and 00:14:43.959 --> 00:14:46.030 align:start position:0% want to get this here," and create the response. After you create it, the 00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:46.040 align:start position:0% create the response. After you create it, the 00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.629 align:start position:0% create the response. After you create it, the chat T may not always create the exact X expression 00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0% chat T may not always create the exact X expression 00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:49.990 align:start position:0% chat T may not always create the exact X expression at once. 00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0% at once. 00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.310 align:start position:0% at once. So now you have to test it. There is a 00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:52.949 align:start position:0% So now you have to test it. There is a 00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959 align:start position:0% 00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:54.790 align:start position:0% site called X101.com. 00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.800 align:start position:0% site called X101.com. 00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.710 align:start position:0% site called X101.com. Go here and put the X we created 00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0% Go here and put the X we created 00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.749 align:start position:0% Go here and put the X we created first on top. Then, there 00:14:59.749 --> 00:14:59.759 align:start position:0% first on top. Then, there 00:14:59.759 --> 00:15:01.790 align:start position:0% first on top. Then, there is the text to be extracted. Copy the text source 00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0% is the text to be extracted. Copy the text source 00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.790 align:start position:0% is the text to be extracted. Copy the text source here and put it below. It will 00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.710 align:start position:0% here and put it below. It will 00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:05.720 align:start position:0% 00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.150 align:start position:0% tell you the values ​​that are brought in as expressions in green. So you 00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.670 align:start position:0% tell you the values ​​that are brought in as expressions in green. So you 00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.550 align:start position:0% 00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0% 00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.189 align:start position:0% can easily test whether the X I created is working properly. If you 00:15:14.189 --> 00:15:14.199 align:start position:0% can easily test whether the X I created is working properly. If you 00:15:14.199 --> 00:15:16.350 align:start position:0% can easily test whether the X I created is working properly. If you do not test it like this and continue to execute operations in Make, it 00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:18.590 align:start position:0% do not test it like this and continue to execute operations in Make, it 00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0% 00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.269 align:start position:0% may incur additional costs. So, 00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:20.279 align:start position:0% may incur additional costs. So, 00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:22.629 align:start position:0% may incur additional costs. So, test it with X101 first, and 00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0% test it with X101 first, and 00:15:22.639 --> 00:15:25.110 align:start position:0% test it with X101 first, and if it is extracted properly, you 00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:27.430 align:start position:0% if it is extracted properly, you 00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0% 00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.030 align:start position:0% can enter it as a pattern in the text parser here. So we 00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0% can enter it as a pattern in the text parser here. So we 00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.790 align:start position:0% can enter it as a pattern in the text parser here. So we confirmed that it works well. 00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0% confirmed that it works well. 00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.870 align:start position:0% confirmed that it works well. I will enter this value on the video explanation day. 00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0% I will enter this value on the video explanation day. 00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.230 align:start position:0% I will enter this value on the video explanation day. So, 00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240 align:start position:0% So, 00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.350 align:start position:0% So, after entering it like this, you have to do a global match on this pattern. 00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0% after entering it like this, you have to do a global match on this pattern. 00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.710 align:start position:0% after entering it like this, you have to do a global match on this pattern. Because if you 00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:37.720 align:start position:0% Because if you 00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.670 align:start position:0% Because if you don't do a global match, you will be finished if you find only one. 00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:39.680 align:start position:0% don't do a global match, you will be finished if you find only one. 00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.710 align:start position:0% don't do a global match, you will be finished if you find only one. But we 00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:41.720 align:start position:0% But we 00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.389 align:start position:0% But we want to find all the URLs, so 00:15:43.389 --> 00:15:43.399 align:start position:0% want to find all the URLs, so 00:15:43.399 --> 00:15:45.069 align:start position:0% want to find all the URLs, so do a global match. We will not do a case-sensitive. We 00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:46.509 align:start position:0% do a global match. We will not do a case-sensitive. We 00:15:46.509 --> 00:15:46.519 align:start position:0% 00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:48.189 align:start position:0% will not distinguish between the substitution characters. Of course, we 00:15:48.189 --> 00:15:48.199 align:start position:0% will not distinguish between the substitution characters. Of course, we 00:15:48.199 --> 00:15:50.030 align:start position:0% will not distinguish between the substitution characters. Of course, we specified it in capital letters here, but 00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.040 align:start position:0% specified it in capital letters here, but 00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.990 align:start position:0% specified it in capital letters here, but just in case, we will not do a case-sensitive. 00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0% just in case, we will not do a case-sensitive. 00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.309 align:start position:0% just in case, we will not do a case-sensitive. Then, the most important thing is to 00:15:53.309 --> 00:15:53.319 align:start position:0% Then, the most important thing is to 00:15:53.319 --> 00:15:54.910 align:start position:0% Then, the most important thing is to enter the text. 00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:54.920 align:start position:0% enter the text. 00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.870 align:start position:0% enter the text. From which text will this be extracted? 00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0% From which text will this be extracted? 00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.590 align:start position:0% From which text will this be extracted? Enter the text extracted from the text parser like this. 00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:58.600 align:start position:0% Enter the text extracted from the text parser like this. 00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.150 align:start position:0% Enter the text extracted from the text parser like this. Then, it will extract all the URLs. Let's 00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:01.160 align:start position:0% Then, it will extract all the URLs. Let's 00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.550 align:start position:0% Then, it will extract all the URLs. Let's run it once. 00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:03.560 align:start position:0% run it once. 00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.509 align:start position:0% run it once. If you look at it like this, you can see that the article URL is extracted well in a bundle like 1 2 3 4. 00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:07.910 align:start position:0% If you look at it like this, you can see that the article URL is extracted well in a bundle like 1 2 3 4. 00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0% 00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.829 align:start position:0% Then, if you go into 00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0% Then, if you go into 00:16:09.839 --> 00:16:12.269 align:start position:0% Then, if you go into each URL and 00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:12.279 align:start position:0% each URL and 00:16:12.279 --> 00:16:14.629 align:start position:0% each URL and make an http request again, you can 00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0% make an http request again, you can 00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:17.069 align:start position:0% make an http request again, you can get the HTML code for each article page. 00:16:17.069 --> 00:16:17.079 align:start position:0% get the HTML code for each article page. 00:16:17.079 --> 00:16:18.670 align:start position:0% get the HTML code for each article page. So, 00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:18.680 align:start position:0% So, 00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.389 align:start position:0% So, you can do that now. To do that First of all, 00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0% you can do that now. To do that First of all, 00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:22.829 align:start position:0% you can do that now. To do that First of all, this URL is in uppercase. I'll 00:16:22.829 --> 00:16:22.839 align:start position:0% this URL is in uppercase. I'll 00:16:22.839 --> 00:16:24.710 align:start position:0% this URL is in uppercase. I'll convert it to lowercase. This is 00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0% convert it to lowercase. This is 00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.550 align:start position:0% convert it to lowercase. This is because if it's in uppercase, the 00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0% because if it's in uppercase, the 00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.389 align:start position:0% because if it's in uppercase, the http request 00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:28.399 align:start position:0% http request 00:16:28.399 --> 00:16:30.230 align:start position:0% http request won't work properly. So I'll convert it to lowercase first. 00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:32.670 align:start position:0% won't work properly. So I'll convert it to lowercase first. 00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680 align:start position:0% 00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.269 align:start position:0% There's a set called veri for lowercase. So you 00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:34.279 align:start position:0% There's a set called veri for lowercase. So you 00:16:34.279 --> 00:16:36.550 align:start position:0% There's a set called veri for lowercase. So you create a new variable. You 00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:36.560 align:start position:0% create a new variable. You 00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.309 align:start position:0% create a new variable. You create a nore case URL. There's a 00:16:38.309 --> 00:16:38.319 align:start position:0% create a nore case URL. There's a 00:16:38.319 --> 00:16:40.629 align:start position:0% create a nore case URL. There's a formula for lore. And if you 00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0% formula for lore. And if you 00:16:40.639 --> 00:16:43.150 align:start position:0% formula for lore. And if you wrap the URL value in lore, it 00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:43.160 align:start position:0% wrap the URL value in lore, it 00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.829 align:start position:0% wrap the URL value in lore, it will now be in lowercase. This is how you 00:16:44.829 --> 00:16:44.839 align:start position:0% will now be in lowercase. This is how you 00:16:44.839 --> 00:16:47.470 align:start position:0% will now be in lowercase. This is how you get lowercase. Now, you make an http 00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:47.480 align:start position:0% get lowercase. Now, you make an http 00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.749 align:start position:0% get lowercase. Now, you make an http request again. You 00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0% request again. You 00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:52.030 align:start position:0% request again. You get the lore case URL. You can get the 00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:52.040 align:start position:0% get the lore case URL. You can get the 00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.590 align:start position:0% get the lore case URL. You can get the html value again by converting this back to lore. 00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:56.629 align:start position:0% html value again by converting this back to lore. 00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0% 00:16:56.639 --> 00:16:58.870 align:start position:0% I'll run it again up to here. Then, if you look at the 00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0% I'll run it again up to here. Then, if you look at the 00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.710 align:start position:0% I'll run it again up to here. Then, if you look at the values ​​you got, I 00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:01.720 align:start position:0% values ​​you got, I 00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.710 align:start position:0% values ​​you got, I 've converted all the URLs to lowercase. After converting, I've 00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0% 've converted all the URLs to lowercase. After converting, I've 00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.230 align:start position:0% 've converted all the URLs to lowercase. After converting, I've individually got the html values. 00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240 align:start position:0% individually got the html values. 00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.069 align:start position:0% individually got the html values. If you look at the data you got, it's been 00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0% If you look at the data you got, it's been 00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:09.990 align:start position:0% If you look at the data you got, it's been extracted like this. Since 00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000 align:start position:0% extracted like this. Since 00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.309 align:start position:0% extracted like this. Since there are html codes, you have to convert them to text 00:17:11.309 --> 00:17:12.949 align:start position:0% there are html codes, you have to convert them to text 00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0% 00:17:12.959 --> 00:17:15.270 align:start position:0% first. I'll 00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0% first. I'll 00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.390 align:start position:0% first. I'll convert the data to text again. After converting, if you look 00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:17.400 align:start position:0% convert the data to text again. After converting, if you look 00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.429 align:start position:0% convert the data to text again. After converting, if you look at the text, you'll see 00:17:20.429 --> 00:17:20.439 align:start position:0% at the text, you'll see 00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:22.949 align:start position:0% at the text, you'll see something like this in front of the menu. He's got a sign 00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0% something like this in front of the menu. He's got a sign 00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:25.270 align:start position:0% something like this in front of the menu. He's got a sign image. And at the very end, you'll see this 00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0% image. And at the very end, you'll see this 00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.870 align:start position:0% image. And at the very end, you'll see this article information, too. Additionally, there are 00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:27.880 align:start position:0% article information, too. Additionally, there are 00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.110 align:start position:0% article information, too. Additionally, there are various topics and 00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.120 align:start position:0% various topics and 00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.350 align:start position:0% various topics and various texts attached under the site, 00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:32.360 align:start position:0% various texts attached under the site, 00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.830 align:start position:0% various texts attached under the site, so I will ask AI to summarize the information for each article and 00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:34.840 align:start position:0% so I will ask AI to summarize the information for each article and 00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.990 align:start position:0% so I will ask AI to summarize the information for each article and output it, but 00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.000 align:start position:0% output it, but 00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.990 align:start position:0% output it, but before that, 00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000 align:start position:0% before that, 00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.310 align:start position:0% before that, there are unnecessary parts in the text extracted, so I 00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:43.430 align:start position:0% there are unnecessary parts in the text extracted, so I 00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0% 00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.710 align:start position:0% will cut out the part above and the part after the article. I will 00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0% will cut out the part above and the part after the article. I will 00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.070 align:start position:0% will cut out the part above and the part after the article. I will leave only the necessary parts and 00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0% leave only the necessary parts and 00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.350 align:start position:0% leave only the necessary parts and ask AI to summarize them, so it will be 00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:50.360 align:start position:0% ask AI to summarize them, so it will be 00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.390 align:start position:0% ask AI to summarize them, so it will be easier for AI to work. The fact 00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0% easier for AI to work. The fact 00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.270 align:start position:0% easier for AI to work. The fact that AI is easy to work with 00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:54.280 align:start position:0% that AI is easy to work with 00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.470 align:start position:0% that AI is easy to work with ultimately increases 00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0% ultimately increases 00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.470 align:start position:0% ultimately increases the probability that we can always receive the values ​​we want reliably. 00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0% the probability that we can always receive the values ​​we want reliably. 00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.029 align:start position:0% the probability that we can always receive the values ​​we want reliably. So I will 00:18:00.029 --> 00:18:00.039 align:start position:0% So I will 00:18:00.039 --> 00:18:02.149 align:start position:0% So I will preprocess the data, and I 00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:04.149 align:start position:0% preprocess the data, and I 00:18:04.149 --> 00:18:04.159 align:start position:0% 00:18:04.159 --> 00:18:05.789 align:start position:0% will use the three barriers as before. So I will save a new variable again. I 00:18:05.789 --> 00:18:08.070 align:start position:0% will use the three barriers as before. So I will save a new variable again. I 00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.070 align:start position:0% 00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0% 00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.149 align:start position:0% want to extract only the news information, and I will use a formula to 00:18:12.149 --> 00:18:12.159 align:start position:0% want to extract only the news information, and I will use a formula to 00:18:12.159 --> 00:18:14.270 align:start position:0% want to extract only the news information, and I will use a formula to cut out the desired value. Above, 00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0% cut out the desired value. Above, 00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.270 align:start position:0% cut out the desired value. Above, how I will cut it is, this address is included. 00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:16.280 align:start position:0% how I will cut it is, this address is included. 00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.350 align:start position:0% how I will cut it is, this address is included. This is the address of the article. The 00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:18.360 align:start position:0% This is the address of the article. The 00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.350 align:start position:0% This is the address of the article. The address of the article is included four times. From the 00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:20.360 align:start position:0% address of the article is included four times. From the 00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.149 align:start position:0% address of the article is included four times. From the first part here, it 00:18:22.149 --> 00:18:24.110 align:start position:0% first part here, it 00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0% 00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.270 align:start position:0% includes the entire article content. So I will 00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0% includes the entire article content. So I will 00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.750 align:start position:0% includes the entire article content. So I will split it first based on the URL and bring only the latter part. 00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:28.760 align:start position:0% split it first based on the URL and bring only the latter part. 00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.789 align:start position:0% split it first based on the URL and bring only the latter part. Then, as 00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:30.799 align:start position:0% Then, as 00:18:30.799 --> 00:18:33.909 align:start position:0% Then, as you can see at the end, There is a topic. 00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0% you can see at the end, There is a topic. 00:18:33.919 --> 00:18:35.590 align:start position:0% you can see at the end, There is a topic. What does this topic mean? If you go into the article, the 00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0% What does this topic mean? If you go into the article, the 00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.669 align:start position:0% What does this topic mean? If you go into the article, the upper part is where we 00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0% upper part is where we 00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:39.430 align:start position:0% upper part is where we cut the ES, and the latter part is written at the end 00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:39.440 align:start position:0% cut the ES, and the latter part is written at the end 00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.070 align:start position:0% cut the ES, and the latter part is written at the end like this. It's always like 00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:41.080 align:start position:0% like this. It's always like 00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.029 align:start position:0% like this. It's always like that. We'll cut it again in the topic section. 00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0% that. We'll cut it again in the topic section. 00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:45.029 align:start position:0% that. We'll cut it again in the topic section. Then, mainly, 00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0% Then, mainly, 00:18:45.039 --> 00:18:47.310 align:start position:0% Then, mainly, only the content related to this article will remain. We'll preprocess it like that. 00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:47.320 align:start position:0% only the content related to this article will remain. We'll preprocess it like that. 00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.190 align:start position:0% only the content related to this article will remain. We'll preprocess it like that. So, this tool will come and 00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0% So, this tool will come and 00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.990 align:start position:0% So, this tool will come and split it into two criteria. If you 00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:51.000 align:start position:0% split it into two criteria. If you 00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.990 align:start position:0% split it into two criteria. If you look like this, there's the text here. 00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.000 align:start position:0% look like this, there's the text here. 00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.470 align:start position:0% look like this, there's the text here. We'll split the text value that we got by matching the pattern in front 00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:55.480 align:start position:0% We'll split the text value that we got by matching the pattern in front 00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.310 align:start position:0% We'll split the text value that we got by matching the pattern in front first. There's the 00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0% first. There's the 00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.230 align:start position:0% first. There's the URL value. We 00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.750 align:start position:0% URL value. We 00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0% 00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.590 align:start position:0% got the lower case URL from Berry earlier. We got it here. So, we 00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0% got the lower case URL from Berry earlier. We got it here. So, we 00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.510 align:start position:0% got the lower case URL from Berry earlier. We got it here. So, we split the URL first. 00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0% split the URL first. 00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.390 align:start position:0% split the URL first. After splitting, slicing means 00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:07.400 align:start position:0% After splitting, slicing means 00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.789 align:start position:0% After splitting, slicing means which range of 00:19:09.789 --> 00:19:09.799 align:start position:0% which range of 00:19:09.799 --> 00:19:11.669 align:start position:0% which range of pieces we're going to use among the split values. We'll 00:19:11.669 --> 00:19:11.679 align:start position:0% pieces we're going to use among the split values. We'll 00:19:11.679 --> 00:19:13.510 align:start position:0% pieces we're going to use among the split values. We'll use it from the second one. 00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0% use it from the second one. 00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.310 align:start position:0% use it from the second one. Because when the first unique comes out, we 00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:15.320 align:start position:0% Because when the first unique comes out, we 00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.310 align:start position:0% Because when the first unique comes out, we want to discard the one above it, so we'll 00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:17.320 align:start position:0% want to discard the one above it, so we'll 00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.630 align:start position:0% want to discard the one above it, so we'll use it from the second one. And the next one is 00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:19.640 align:start position:0% use it from the second one. And the next one is 00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.669 align:start position:0% use it from the second one. And the next one is empty. This empty space means everything to the end. 00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:21.679 align:start position:0% empty. This empty space means everything to the end. 00:19:21.679 --> 00:19:22.909 align:start position:0% empty. This empty space means everything to the end. So, we'll 00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:22.919 align:start position:0% So, we'll 00:19:22.919 --> 00:19:24.909 align:start position:0% So, we'll bring everything from the second one to the end, and then we'll 00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:24.919 align:start position:0% bring everything from the second one to the end, and then we'll 00:19:24.919 --> 00:19:26.750 align:start position:0% bring everything from the second one to the end, and then we'll join it. We did a join and 00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0% join it. We did a join and 00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.990 align:start position:0% join it. We did a join and just did a join without putting anything in. The 00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:29.000 align:start position:0% just did a join without putting anything in. The 00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.870 align:start position:0% just did a join without putting anything in. The values ​​were sliced ​​and 00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0% values ​​were sliced ​​and 00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.669 align:start position:0% values ​​were sliced ​​and brought in pieces, right? We 00:19:32.669 --> 00:19:32.679 align:start position:0% brought in pieces, right? We 00:19:32.679 --> 00:19:34.070 align:start position:0% brought in pieces, right? We combine all those pieces. We combine them into one and split them 00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0% combine all those pieces. We combine them into one and split them 00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.950 align:start position:0% combine all those pieces. We combine them into one and split them again by topic. 00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:35.960 align:start position:0% again by topic. 00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.789 align:start position:0% again by topic. And using get, the 00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:37.799 align:start position:0% And using get, the 00:19:37.799 --> 00:19:39.750 align:start position:0% And using get, the first part of the split 00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:41.990 align:start position:0% first part of the split 00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0% 00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.549 align:start position:0% means the values ​​before the topic. So if 00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0% means the values ​​before the topic. So if 00:19:43.559 --> 00:19:45.990 align:start position:0% means the values ​​before the topic. So if you do this for the values ​​before the topic, you 00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.000 align:start position:0% you do this for the values ​​before the topic, you 00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.750 align:start position:0% you do this for the values ​​before the topic, you can extract only the content of the article. 00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0% can extract only the content of the article. 00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.230 align:start position:0% can extract only the content of the article. Let's run it again. 00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0% Let's run it again. 00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.510 align:start position:0% Let's run it again. Then, we bring it and 00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:52.520 align:start position:0% Then, we bring it and 00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.669 align:start position:0% Then, we bring it and change the lowercase URL, bring in the HTML for each article again, 00:19:54.669 --> 00:19:54.679 align:start position:0% change the lowercase URL, bring in the HTML for each article again, 00:19:54.679 --> 00:19:56.510 align:start position:0% change the lowercase URL, bring in the HTML for each article again, change the text, and then 00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0% change the text, and then 00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.789 align:start position:0% change the text, and then cut it to only the part we want. 00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0% cut it to only the part we want. 00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:00.430 align:start position:0% cut it to only the part we want. Let's compare the first article. 00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:00.440 align:start position:0% Let's compare the first article. 00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.029 align:start position:0% Let's compare the first article. Then, we start with Jetive AI at the beginning, 00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0% Then, we start with Jetive AI at the beginning, 00:20:03.039 --> 00:20:05.549 align:start position:0% Then, we start with Jetive AI at the beginning, and at the end, CEO Net 00:20:05.549 --> 00:20:05.559 align:start position:0% and at the end, CEO Net 00:20:05.559 --> 00:20:07.230 align:start position:0% and at the end, CEO Net Freedman Netman. You can see that the 00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:07.240 align:start position:0% Freedman Netman. You can see that the 00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.870 align:start position:0% Freedman Netman. You can see that the article information is well loaded like this. 00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.310 align:start position:0% article information is well loaded like this. 00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:11.320 align:start position:0% 00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.710 align:start position:0% Of course, I split it by topic here, but 00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:13.720 align:start position:0% Of course, I split it by topic here, but 00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.070 align:start position:0% Of course, I split it by topic here, but if you do this, the 00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0% if you do this, the 00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.789 align:start position:0% if you do this, the word Fixline may be used first in another sentence and 00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0% word Fixline may be used first in another sentence and 00:20:18.799 --> 00:20:21.149 align:start position:0% word Fixline may be used first in another sentence and may be cut incorrectly. 00:20:21.149 --> 00:20:21.159 align:start position:0% may be cut incorrectly. 00:20:21.159 --> 00:20:23.870 align:start position:0% may be cut incorrectly. But usually, it would be difficult to 00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0% But usually, it would be difficult to 00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.950 align:start position:0% But usually, it would be difficult to find a case where the article talks like that, so 00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0% find a case where the article talks like that, so 00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.750 align:start position:0% find a case where the article talks like that, so I 00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:28.760 align:start position:0% I 00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.830 align:start position:0% I did it like this. If you actually use it 00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:30.840 align:start position:0% did it like this. If you actually use it 00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.230 align:start position:0% did it like this. If you actually use it like this, and the article is 00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0% like this, and the article is 00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.350 align:start position:0% like this, and the article is not included properly, If you do that, you 00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:34.360 align:start position:0% not included properly, If you do that, you 00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.430 align:start position:0% not included properly, If you do that, you can just change the split criteria. 00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:36.440 align:start position:0% can just change the split criteria. 00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.310 align:start position:0% can just change the split criteria. For now, we'll try 00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0% For now, we'll try 00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.270 align:start position:0% For now, we'll try using this because it seems to work well.

Just parse it as Jason and 00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.950 align:start position:0% will attach a Jason parser here in advance. Just parse it as Jason and receive the chat ret. Then, I will 00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:23.960 align:start position:0% receive the chat ret. Then, I will 00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.950 align:start position:0% receive the chat ret. Then, I will run it again like this. So, if you 00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:25.960 align:start position:0% run it again like this. So, if you 00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.789 align:start position:0% run it again like this. So, if you look at it like this, it is in Jason format. Let's 00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0% look at it like this, it is in Jason format. Let's 00:22:28.799 --> 00:22:30.909 align:start position:0% look at it like this, it is in Jason format. Let's do the title date summary well. You 00:22:30.909 --> 00:22:30.919 align:start position:0% do the title date summary well. You 00:22:30.919 --> 00:22:32.789 align:start position:0% do the title date summary well. You can see that the value is received like this. 00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0% can see that the value is received like this. 00:22:32.799 --> 00:22:35.029 align:start position:0% can see that the value is received like this. Then, do the top. Anyway, we have to 00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0% Then, do the top. Anyway, we have to 00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:36.870 align:start position:0% Then, do the top. Anyway, we have to connect the sheet again. Let's 00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0% connect the sheet again. Let's 00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.230 align:start position:0% connect the sheet again. Let's connect the sheet again with AD row. 00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:39.240 align:start position:0% connect the sheet again with AD row. 00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.070 align:start position:0% connect the sheet again with AD row. So, I 00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:41.080 align:start position:0% So, I 00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.830 align:start position:0% So, I 'll update the sheet. This time, it's a tech 00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:42.840 align:start position:0% 'll update the sheet. This time, it's a tech 00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.870 align:start position:0% 'll update the sheet. This time, it's a tech news sheet. Here, the date date 00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:45.880 align:start position:0% news sheet. Here, the date date 00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.630 align:start position:0% news sheet. Here, the date date title title summary summary. The link is intentionally 00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0% title title summary summary. The link is intentionally 00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.430 align:start position:0% title title summary summary. The link is intentionally organized. Anyway, we 00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:52.149 align:start position:0% organized. Anyway, we 00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0% 00:22:52.159 --> 00:22:53.789 align:start position:0% have the URL of the lower case organized here. Let's designate it as this. Do 00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:53.799 align:start position:0% have the URL of the lower case organized here. Let's designate it as this. Do 00:22:53.799 --> 00:22:55.430 align:start position:0% have the URL of the lower case organized here. Let's designate it as this. Do this. Now, let's 00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.110 align:start position:0% this. Now, let's 00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0% 00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.070 align:start position:0% run it once to update the sheet. 00:22:59.070 --> 00:22:59.080 align:start position:0% run it once to update the sheet. 00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.510 align:start position:0% run it once to update the sheet. If you press Once again, the tech news will be updated in the sheet like this. 00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0% If you press Once again, the tech news will be updated in the sheet like this. 00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.710 align:start position:0% If you press Once again, the tech news will be updated in the sheet like this. Then, you 00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:06.269 align:start position:0% Then, you 00:23:06.269 --> 00:23:06.279 align:start position:0% 00:23:06.279 --> 00:23:08.029 align:start position:0% can see that the contents are summarized and printed well by article. 00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:08.039 align:start position:0% can see that the contents are summarized and printed well by article. 00:23:08.039 --> 00:23:09.909 align:start position:0% can see that the contents are summarized and printed well by article. If you want to give black points, you 00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:12.390 align:start position:0% If you want to give black points, you 00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0% 00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.669 align:start position:0% can also request Chez Pitihandal. Anyway, you 00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:14.679 align:start position:0% can also request Chez Pitihandal. Anyway, you 00:23:14.679 --> 00:23:16.950 align:start position:0% can also request Chez Pitihandal. Anyway, you can see that it's organized well like this and the glaze is extracted. 00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0% can see that it's organized well like this and the glaze is extracted. 00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.390 align:start position:0% can see that it's organized well like this and the glaze is extracted. Oh, I made the request too 00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0% Oh, I made the request too 00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.350 align:start position:0% Oh, I made the request too often and the ray limit was hit. 00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:20.360 align:start position:0% often and the ray limit was hit. 00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.029 align:start position:0% often and the ray limit was hit. But now, if you don't do it this often, the 00:23:22.029 --> 00:23:22.039 align:start position:0% But now, if you don't do it this often, the 00:23:22.039 --> 00:23:24.350 align:start position:0% But now, if you don't do it this often, the limit is 00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360 align:start position:0% limit is 00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.070 align:start position:0% limit is not that big. So 00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0% not that big. So 00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.830 align:start position:0% not that big. So when you test, in fact, you do 00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0% when you test, in fact, you do 00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.789 align:start position:0% when you test, in fact, you do n't do several at once like this. You only output it 00:23:29.789 --> 00:23:29.799 align:start position:0% n't do several at once like this. You only output it 00:23:29.799 --> 00:23:32.190 align:start position:0% n't do several at once like this. You only output it when you're done. Before you run it, it 00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.430 align:start position:0% when you're done. Before you run it, it 00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0% 00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.950 align:start position:0% might be better to test it by extracting the content to one or so. There 00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:35.960 align:start position:0% might be better to test it by extracting the content to one or so. There 00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.549 align:start position:0% might be better to test it by extracting the content to one or so. There might be a limit like this. 00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:37.559 align:start position:0% might be a limit like this. 00:23:37.559 --> 00:23:39.950 align:start position:0% might be a limit like this. Anyway, you can see that it is updated well in the sheet now. 00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960 align:start position:0% Anyway, you can see that it is updated well in the sheet now. 00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.990 align:start position:0% Anyway, you can see that it is updated well in the sheet now. And 00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0% And 00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.190 align:start position:0% And right now, we are just adding to the sheet, 00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:44.200 align:start position:0% right now, we are just adding to the sheet, 00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.269 align:start position:0% right now, we are just adding to the sheet, but if we 00:23:46.269 --> 00:23:46.279 align:start position:0% but if we 00:23:46.279 --> 00:23:48.590 align:start position:0% but if we run this periodically, we do 00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:50.310 align:start position:0% run this periodically, we do 00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0% 00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.269 align:start position:0% n't want to update the same article. In that case, I brought in the lower-level link. 00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:52.279 align:start position:0% n't want to update the same article. In that case, I brought in the lower-level link. 00:23:52.279 --> 00:23:55.190 align:start position:0% n't want to update the same article. In that case, I brought in the lower-level link. If the link is included when you 00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0% If the link is included when you 00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.230 align:start position:0% If the link is included when you bring in the sheet link and compare it with it, you can filter 00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.070 align:start position:0% bring in the sheet link and compare it with it, you can filter 00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.080 align:start position:0% 00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.789 align:start position:0% it so that the surface does not move to the next step. I think it would be 00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:03.470 align:start position:0% it so that the surface does not move to the next step. I think it would be 00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:05.269 align:start position:0% 00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:05.279 align:start position:0% 00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:07.070 align:start position:0% good to refer to the make videos that I have made before for the filtering work. 00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0% good to refer to the make videos that I have made before for the filtering work. 00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.110 align:start position:0% good to refer to the make videos that I have made before for the filtering work. So, we looked at 00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0% So, we looked at 00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.549 align:start position:0% So, we looked at going into the link for the static website, 00:24:11.549 --> 00:24:11.559 align:start position:0% going into the link for the static website, 00:24:11.559 --> 00:24:13.310 align:start position:0% going into the link for the static website, checking the content, and even summarizing it and 00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:13.320 align:start position:0% checking the content, and even summarizing it and 00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.029 align:start position:0% checking the content, and even summarizing it and updating the sheet. 00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0% updating the sheet. 00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:17.190 align:start position:0% updating the sheet. But, as we said earlier, there are dynamic 00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0% But, as we said earlier, there are dynamic 00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.149 align:start position:0% But, as we said earlier, there are dynamic websites as well as static websites. In the case of 00:24:19.149 --> 00:24:19.159 align:start position:0% websites as well as static websites. In the case of 00:24:19.159 --> 00:24:21.870 align:start position:0% websites as well as static websites. In the case of dynamic websites, the 00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:21.880 align:start position:0% dynamic websites, the 00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.549 align:start position:0% dynamic websites, the information we want is not all displayed at once in the HTML. 00:24:23.549 --> 00:24:23.559 align:start position:0% information we want is not all displayed at once in the HTML. 00:24:23.559 --> 00:24:25.470 align:start position:0% information we want is not all displayed at once in the HTML. So, 00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:25.480 align:start position:0% So, 00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.710 align:start position:0% So, we cannot extract the information we want with an http request like this. I will 00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:30.070 align:start position:0% we cannot extract the information we want with an http request like this. I will 00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0% 00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.990 align:start position:0% show you once.

If you look on the left, you 00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:41.789 align:start position:0% look on the left, you 00:25:41.789 --> 00:25:43.470 align:start position:0% 00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:43.480 align:start position:0% 00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.149 align:start position:0% 'll see something called Store. This store is kind of like Apple's App Store or Google's Google Play Store. 00:25:45.149 --> 00:25:45.159 align:start position:0% 'll see something called Store. This store is kind of like Apple's App Store or Google's Google Play Store. 00:25:45.159 --> 00:25:47.029 align:start position:0% 'll see something called Store. This store is kind of like Apple's App Store or Google's Google Play Store. Here, we can 00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0% Here, we can 00:25:47.039 --> 00:25:49.710 align:start position:0% Here, we can select and use the scraper that helps us crawl the web. The 00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:49.720 align:start position:0% select and use the scraper that helps us crawl the web. The 00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.909 align:start position:0% select and use the scraper that helps us crawl the web. The cost and 00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0% cost and 00:25:51.919 --> 00:25:54.029 align:start position:0% cost and such are different for each service. 00:25:54.029 --> 00:25:54.039 align:start position:0% such are different for each service. 00:25:54.039 --> 00:25:55.950 align:start position:0% such are different for each service. There is, so you 00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:55.960 align:start position:0% There is, so you 00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.310 align:start position:0% There is, so you can think of it as selecting what you want and using it. 00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0% can think of it as selecting what you want and using it. 00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.630 align:start position:0% can think of it as selecting what you want and using it. Each service corresponding to the concept of each app is called an 00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0% Each service corresponding to the concept of each app is called an 00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.830 align:start position:0% Each service corresponding to the concept of each app is called an actor. So 00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:02.840 align:start position:0% actor. So 00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.029 align:start position:0% actor. So we can use this actor for web crawling. 00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0% we can use this actor for web crawling. 00:26:05.039 --> 00:26:06.430 align:start position:0% we can use this actor for web crawling. So, 00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:06.440 align:start position:0% So, 00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.630 align:start position:0% So, for example, if you select what you want to use in the store 00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0% for example, if you select what you want to use in the store 00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.990 align:start position:0% for example, if you select what you want to use in the store here and start and 00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.000 align:start position:0% here and start and 00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.070 align:start position:0% here and start and run it, or if you favorite it with a star, it will be 00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:15.470 align:start position:0% run it, or if you favorite it with a star, it will be 00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:15.480 align:start position:0% 00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.350 align:start position:0% displayed like this on my actor screen. So you 00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:17.360 align:start position:0% displayed like this on my actor screen. So you 00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.590 align:start position:0% displayed like this on my actor screen. So you can think of this as the concept of an app. 00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.600 align:start position:0% can think of this as the concept of an app. 00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.830 align:start position:0% can think of this as the concept of an app. This is a service concept where the 00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0% This is a service concept where the 00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.990 align:start position:0% This is a service concept where the code is all written for web crawling. 00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:25.789 align:start position:0% code is all written for web crawling. 00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0% 00:26:25.799 --> 00:26:28.310 align:start position:0% As the name of the service suggests, the mission of this part is to 00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:30.750 align:start position:0% As the name of the service suggests, the mission of this part is to 00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:30.760 align:start position:0% 00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.470 align:start position:0% APIize all website information. It 00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:36.789 align:start position:0% APIize all website information. It 00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:38.950 align:start position:0% 00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0% 00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.029 align:start position:0% is like a user manual that helps you easily use information from API services. However, not all websites are 00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0% is like a user manual that helps you easily use information from API services. However, not all websites are 00:26:41.039 --> 00:26:42.990 align:start position:0% is like a user manual that helps you easily use information from API services. However, not all websites are well-organized and usable with APIs. 00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:44.430 align:start position:0% well-organized and usable with APIs. 00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:44.440 align:start position:0% 00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.510 align:start position:0% So you 00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:46.520 align:start position:0% So you 00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.750 align:start position:0% So you can think of this part as helping you with that. In this actor, we 00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.029 align:start position:0% can think of this part as helping you with that. In this actor, we 00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:50.039 align:start position:0% 00:26:50.039 --> 00:26:52.470 align:start position:0% select what we want to use, enter additional input information, and 00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:52.480 align:start position:0% select what we want to use, enter additional input information, and 00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.750 align:start position:0% select what we want to use, enter additional input information, and then press Start to 00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:54.760 align:start position:0% then press Start to 00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.549 align:start position:0% then press Start to run the code. 00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0% run the code. 00:26:56.559 --> 00:26:58.909 align:start position:0% run the code. Once it is run, you can check the execution information in the store. 00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0% Once it is run, you can check the execution information in the store. 00:26:58.919 --> 00:27:00.389 align:start position:0% Once it is run, you can check the execution information in the store. Then, 00:27:00.389 --> 00:27:02.590 align:start position:0% Then, 00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:02.600 align:start position:0% 00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.110 align:start position:0% the information obtained by running the crawl will be stored in the storage. That's right, the 00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:04.120 align:start position:0% the information obtained by running the crawl will be stored in the storage. That's right, the 00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.830 align:start position:0% the information obtained by running the crawl will be stored in the storage. That's right, the information from the website is 00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:05.840 align:start position:0% information from the website is 00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.630 align:start position:0% information from the website is accumulated here as storage, and this 00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:07.640 align:start position:0% accumulated here as storage, and this 00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.470 align:start position:0% accumulated here as storage, and this accumulated data is now connected to Make, 00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0% accumulated data is now connected to Make, 00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.830 align:start position:0% accumulated data is now connected to Make, so you can utilize the data in Make, and there 00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:12.310 align:start position:0% so you can utilize the data in Make, and there 00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0% 00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.950 align:start position:0% 's also something called a schedule. 00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:13.960 align:start position:0% 's also something called a schedule. 00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.549 align:start position:0% 's also something called a schedule. If you set a schedule, you can use a specific actor as a 00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0% If you set a schedule, you can use a specific actor as a 00:27:16.559 --> 00:27:18.789 align:start position:0% If you set a schedule, you can use a specific actor as a daily or weekly. You 00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:20.510 align:start position:0% daily or weekly. You 00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0% 00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.310 align:start position:0% can select an actor like this, and you 00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:24.909 align:start position:0% can select an actor like this, and you 00:27:24.909 --> 00:27:24.919 align:start position:0% 00:27:24.919 --> 00:27:26.630 align:start position:0% can use it to run it periodically. 00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0% can use it to run it periodically. 00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.190 align:start position:0% can use it to run it periodically. This is a simple 00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.200 align:start position:0% This is a simple 00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.710 align:start position:0% This is a simple explanation of the wave, and the wave provides credits for free up to dollars every month. 00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:32.720 align:start position:0% explanation of the wave, and the wave provides credits for free up to dollars every month. 00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.470 align:start position:0% explanation of the wave, and the wave provides credits for free up to dollars every month. So you can 00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0% So you can 00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.630 align:start position:0% So you can actually run most personal projects 00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640 align:start position:0% actually run most personal projects 00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.350 align:start position:0% actually run most personal projects for free. Of course, 00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:38.360 align:start position:0% for free. Of course, 00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.710 align:start position:0% for free. Of course, in the store, instead of this free campaign, there is a 00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:40.720 align:start position:0% in the store, instead of this free campaign, there is a 00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.870 align:start position:0% in the store, instead of this free campaign, there is a concept of rent, so you 00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0% concept of rent, so you 00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.110 align:start position:0% concept of rent, so you have to pay a subscription fee to use the actor. If you 00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:47.110 align:start position:0% have to pay a subscription fee to use the actor. If you 00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0% 00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.590 align:start position:0% don't use that, you can use dollars for free, 00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0% don't use that, you can use dollars for free, 00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.470 align:start position:0% don't use that, you can use dollars for free, so 00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:51.480 align:start position:0% so 00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.549 align:start position:0% so I think it would be good to follow along. Now, we're going to 00:27:53.549 --> 00:27:53.559 align:start position:0% I think it would be good to follow along. Now, we're going to 00:27:53.559 --> 00:27:55.710 align:start position:0% I think it would be good to follow along. Now, we're going to crawl a dynamic website using this file. If you 00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:57.630 align:start position:0% crawl a dynamic website using this file. If you 00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:57.640 align:start position:0% 00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.470 align:start position:0% type in web scraper in the store, the first thing that comes up is this.

You can just delete the example. The 00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0% can just delete the example. The 00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.190 align:start position:0% can just delete the example. The next most important thing is that 00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:36.200 align:start position:0% next most important thing is that 00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.909 align:start position:0% next most important thing is that we need to get the HTML information. After 00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0% we need to get the HTML information. After 00:28:37.919 --> 00:28:39.750 align:start position:0% we need to get the HTML information. After JavaScript runs on the dynamic website, you need to 00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0% JavaScript runs on the dynamic website, you need to 00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.230 align:start position:0% JavaScript runs on the dynamic website, you need to get the HTML value. To do 00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0% get the HTML value. To do 00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.230 align:start position:0% get the HTML value. To do that, you will specify the condition like this and the 00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0% that, you will specify the condition like this and the 00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.470 align:start position:0% that, you will specify the condition like this and the page HTML value. 00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:49.149 align:start position:0% page HTML value. 00:28:49.149 --> 00:28:49.159 align:start position:0% 00:28:49.159 --> 00:28:51.070 align:start position:0% Specify the screen that appears in the document web browser, and in it, 00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:53.190 align:start position:0% Specify the screen that appears in the document web browser, and in it, 00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0% 00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.310 align:start position:0% write the code like this: element, then outer HTML.

And 00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:57.029 align:start position:0% write the code like this: element, then outer HTML. And at the end, you need to put a semicolon. If you 00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0% at the end, you need to put a semicolon. If you 00:28:57.039 --> 00:28:59.269 align:start position:0% at the end, you need to put a semicolon. If you do this, this will save the HTML code 00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0% do this, this will save the HTML code 00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:01.630 align:start position:0% do this, this will save the HTML code in the variable variable called page HTML. 00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:03.430 align:start position:0% in the variable variable called page HTML. 00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0% 00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.310 align:start position:0% After saving it, 00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:05.320 align:start position:0% After saving it, 00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.149 align:start position:0% After saving it, just add the page HTML to the return value. If you 00:29:07.149 --> 00:29:07.159 align:start position:0% just add the page HTML to the return value. If you 00:29:07.159 --> 00:29:09.269 align:start position:0% just add the page HTML to the return value. If you add it like this. Now, 00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0% add it like this. Now, 00:29:09.279 --> 00:29:11.630 align:start position:0% add it like this. Now, when the actor returns, after the JavaScript is executed on the dynamic website, the 00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:13.549 align:start position:0% when the actor returns, after the JavaScript is executed on the dynamic website, the 00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:13.559 align:start position:0% 00:29:13.559 --> 00:29:15.870 align:start position:0% HTML value of the website is loaded. 00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:15.880 align:start position:0% HTML value of the website is loaded. 00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.789 align:start position:0% HTML value of the website is loaded. So, 00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:17.799 align:start position:0% So, 00:29:17.799 --> 00:29:20.070 align:start position:0% So, output it as a value called page HTML. Specify it like this and 00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.080 align:start position:0% output it as a value called page HTML. Specify it like this and 00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.750 align:start position:0% output it as a value called page HTML. Specify it like this and then just press start and you're 00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0% then just press start and you're 00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.509 align:start position:0% then just press start and you're done. But, we 00:29:23.509 --> 00:29:23.519 align:start position:0% done. But, we 00:29:23.519 --> 00:29:25.509 align:start position:0% done. But, we need to get the value from Make, right? 00:29:25.509 --> 00:29:25.519 align:start position:0% need to get the value from Make, right? 00:29:25.519 --> 00:29:27.149 align:start position:0% need to get the value from Make, right? To get it, you need to set it up. 00:29:27.149 --> 00:29:27.159 align:start position:0% To get it, you need to set it up. 00:29:27.159 --> 00:29:29.310 align:start position:0% To get it, you need to set it up. First, select the hook in the F5 module. If you 00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:29.320 align:start position:0% First, select the hook in the F5 module. If you 00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.590 align:start position:0% First, select the hook in the F5 module. If you try it, you 00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0% try it, you 00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.110 align:start position:0% try it, you need to make a connection first. For the connection, you 00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0% need to make a connection first. For the connection, you 00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.230 align:start position:0% need to make a connection first. For the connection, you need to enter the API token. If you 00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:35.240 align:start position:0% need to enter the API token. If you 00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:38.070 align:start position:0% need to enter the API token. If you go into the settings here, there is an API 00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.080 align:start position:0% go into the settings here, there is an API 00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.269 align:start position:0% go into the settings here, there is an API integration. Here, 00:29:40.269 --> 00:29:40.279 align:start position:0% integration. Here, 00:29:40.279 --> 00:29:42.070 align:start position:0% integration. Here, give it a new token and create one with a web scraper. You 00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.350 align:start position:0% give it a new token and create one with a web scraper. You 00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:44.360 align:start position:0% 00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.389 align:start position:0% can copy and use this. Just copy and paste it. 00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0% can copy and use this. Just copy and paste it. 00:29:46.399 --> 00:29:48.269 align:start position:0% can copy and use this. Just copy and paste it. When you create a connection, you will be asked to select the terminal. 00:29:48.269 --> 00:29:48.279 align:start position:0% When you create a connection, you will be asked to select the terminal. 00:29:48.279 --> 00:29:50.590 align:start position:0% When you create a connection, you will be asked to select the terminal. Select the actor as a web scraper. 00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:50.600 align:start position:0% Select the actor as a web scraper. 00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.110 align:start position:0% Select the actor as a web scraper. We have already set it up. 00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:52.120 align:start position:0% We have already set it up. 00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.230 align:start position:0% We have already set it up. Next, you 00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0% Next, you 00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.870 align:start position:0% Next, you need to add one more file. You need to press get. 00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:57.470 align:start position:0% need to add one more file. You need to press get. 00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:57.480 align:start position:0% 00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.389 align:start position:0% What is get ice? I said that when we 00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399 align:start position:0% What is get ice? I said that when we 00:29:59.399 --> 00:30:01.990 align:start position:0% What is get ice? I said that when we run a file, the content that was run is 00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0% run a file, the content that was run is 00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.149 align:start position:0% run a file, the content that was run is stored in the storage. The information 00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:04.159 align:start position:0% stored in the storage. The information 00:30:04.159 --> 00:30:06.269 align:start position:0% stored in the storage. The information is now a dataset. So, 00:30:06.269 --> 00:30:06.279 align:start position:0% is now a dataset. So, 00:30:06.279 --> 00:30:08.190 align:start position:0% is now a dataset. So, we can create one. When you run an actor, you 00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:08.200 align:start position:0% we can create one. When you run an actor, you 00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.710 align:start position:0% we can create one. When you run an actor, you get the ID value generated by it, and you 00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720 align:start position:0% get the ID value generated by it, and you 00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.269 align:start position:0% get the ID value generated by it, and you get the information stored in that ID and 00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0% get the information stored in that ID and 00:30:13.279 --> 00:30:14.710 align:start position:0% get the information stored in that ID and use it in Make. 00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0% use it in Make. 00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.509 align:start position:0% use it in Make. So you have to save the ID. 00:30:16.509 --> 00:30:16.519 align:start position:0% So you have to save the ID. 00:30:16.519 --> 00:30:18.630 align:start position:0% So you have to save the ID. Now, the first thing is to detect that the actor is running. If it is 00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640 align:start position:0% Now, the first thing is to detect that the actor is running. If it is 00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.710 align:start position:0% Now, the first thing is to detect that the actor is running. If it is running, the 00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0% running, the 00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.070 align:start position:0% running, the ID value is the default dataset 00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:23.080 align:start position:0% ID value is the default dataset 00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.710 align:start position:0% ID value is the default dataset ID. You can specify this. 00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0% ID. You can specify this. 00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.630 align:start position:0% ID. You can specify this. And you can set how many values ​​you want to get. I'll 00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:28.389 align:start position:0% And you can set how many values ​​you want to get. I'll 00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0% 00:30:28.399 --> 00:30:30.909 align:start position:0% do up to ten. I'll 00:30:30.909 --> 00:30:30.919 align:start position:0% do up to ten. I'll 00:30:30.919 --> 00:30:32.789 align:start position:0% do up to ten. I'll put the clock back here and test it. 00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:32.799 align:start position:0% put the clock back here and test it. 00:30:32.799 --> 00:30:35.470 align:start position:0% put the clock back here and test it. Then, I'll run the crawler in Pa and 00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:35.480 align:start position:0% Then, I'll run the crawler in Pa and 00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.590 align:start position:0% Then, I'll run the crawler in Pa and get the values ​​in Make. I'll 00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:39.389 align:start position:0% get the values ​​in Make. I'll 00:30:39.389 --> 00:30:39.399 align:start position:0% 00:30:39.399 --> 00:30:42.310 align:start position:0% turn on the Make scenario like this and set it to detect when a new actor runs in Pa and 00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:44.190 align:start position:0% turn on the Make scenario like this and set it to detect when a new actor runs in Pa and 00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:44.200 align:start position:0% 00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.029 align:start position:0% get the dataset items. I'll 00:30:46.029 --> 00:30:46.039 align:start position:0% get the dataset items. I'll 00:30:46.039 --> 00:30:48.070 align:start position:0% get the dataset items. I'll start the web scraper in that state. 00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0% start the web scraper in that state. 00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.909 align:start position:0% start the web scraper in that state. Then, Make 00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0% Then, Make 00:30:49.919 --> 00:30:52.230 align:start position:0% Then, Make should receive this. Then, FIFA rolls like this. 00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.240 align:start position:0% should receive this. Then, FIFA rolls like this. 00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.710 align:start position:0% should receive this. Then, FIFA rolls like this. When the process is complete, Make 00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:56.990 align:start position:0% When the process is complete, Make 00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0% 00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.149 align:start position:0% recognizes that it was run like this. And it 00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0% recognizes that it was run like this. And it 00:30:59.159 --> 00:31:01.430 align:start position:0% recognizes that it was run like this. And it gets the HTML. If you look here, the 00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0% gets the HTML. If you look here, the 00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.509 align:start position:0% gets the HTML. If you look here, the product values ​​are all displayed. 00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0% product values ​​are all displayed. 00:31:03.519 --> 00:31:05.509 align:start position:0% product values ​​are all displayed. Unlike before, the product values 00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:05.519 align:start position:0% Unlike before, the product values 00:31:05.519 --> 00:31:07.389 align:start position:0% Unlike before, the product values seem to be displayed well. This is the P file. 00:31:07.389 --> 00:31:07.399 align:start position:0% seem to be displayed well. This is the P file. 00:31:07.399 --> 00:31:09.990 align:start position:0% seem to be displayed well. This is the P file. It crawled the dynamic website and 00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0% It crawled the dynamic website and 00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.190 align:start position:0% It crawled the dynamic website and now we're going to convert this into text again. We're going to 00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:13.710 align:start position:0% now we're going to convert this into text again. We're going to 00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:13.720 align:start position:0% 00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.070 align:start position:0% convert it into text using a text parser. It's the page 00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:15.080 align:start position:0% convert it into text using a text parser. It's the page 00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.950 align:start position:0% convert it into text using a text parser. It's the page HTML value. 00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0% HTML value. 00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.909 align:start position:0% HTML value. And then we have to keep 00:31:18.909 --> 00:31:18.919 align:start position:0% And then we have to keep 00:31:18.919 --> 00:31:20.269 align:start position:0% And then we have to keep making the latter part and test it. 00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:20.279 align:start position:0% making the latter part and test it. 00:31:20.279 --> 00:31:22.389 align:start position:0% making the latter part and test it. So let's cut this out and bring in the lightning bolt. If you 00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:24.430 align:start position:0% So let's cut this out and bring in the lightning bolt. If you 00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:26.629 align:start position:0% 00:31:26.629 --> 00:31:26.639 align:start position:0% 00:31:26.639 --> 00:31:28.590 align:start position:0% look at the data ID value in the storage of the file when we test it here, it's this. We're going to 00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:30.310 align:start position:0% look at the data ID value in the storage of the file when we test it here, it's this. We're going to 00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0% 00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.149 align:start position:0% bring in the dataset ID value that we ran and put it here. Because 00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0% bring in the dataset ID value that we ran and put it here. Because 00:31:32.159 --> 00:31:34.190 align:start position:0% bring in the dataset ID value that we ran and put it here. Because we're going to run it multiple times, and if we watch the file every time and 00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0% we're going to run it multiple times, and if we watch the file every time and 00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.629 align:start position:0% we're going to run it multiple times, and if we watch the file every time and run the file again, 00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:37.639 align:start position:0% run the file again, 00:31:37.639 --> 00:31:40.070 align:start position:0% run the file again, credits will be consumed in the file. 00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0% credits will be consumed in the file. 00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.070 align:start position:0% credits will be consumed in the file. So 00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0% So 00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.590 align:start position:0% So since we already have the data, we're going to bring it in the hard code 00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0% since we already have the data, we're going to bring it in the hard code 00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.269 align:start position:0% since we already have the data, we're going to bring it in the hard code every time and work on it. So let's 00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0% every time and work on it. So let's 00:31:45.279 --> 00:31:46.789 align:start position:0% every time and work on it. So let's run it again. 00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0% run it again. 00:31:46.799 --> 00:31:48.310 align:start position:0% run it again. Now, we 00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.320 align:start position:0% Now, we 00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.350 align:start position:0% Now, we just get the value from the dataset ID and 00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:50.360 align:start position:0% just get the value from the dataset ID and 00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.950 align:start position:0% just get the value from the dataset ID and convert it to a text value. If you 00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:51.960 align:start position:0% convert it to a text value. If you 00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.629 align:start position:0% convert it to a text value. If you look here, 00:31:53.629 --> 00:31:53.639 align:start position:0% look here, 00:31:53.639 --> 00:31:55.750 align:start position:0% look here, all the services are printed out like this. 00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:55.760 align:start position:0% all the services are printed out like this. 00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.190 align:start position:0% all the services are printed out like this. With this, we're going to extract the four values ​​of the product services, the 00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0% With this, we're going to extract the four values ​​of the product services, the 00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.190 align:start position:0% With this, we're going to extract the four values ​​of the product services, the update date, the product name, the 00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:00.200 align:start position:0% update date, the product name, the 00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.470 align:start position:0% update date, the product name, the price, the rating, and the link. 00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:04.350 align:start position:0% price, the rating, and the link. 00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:04.360 align:start position:0% 00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.269 align:start position:0% Here, too, 00:32:06.269 --> 00:32:06.279 align:start position:0% Here, too, 00:32:06.279 --> 00:32:10.629 align:start position:0% Here, too, we're going to extract the final 00:32:10.629 --> 00:32:10.639 align:start position:0% 00:32:10.639 --> 00:32:13.590 align:start position:0% PT month, the same as before. It would be good to give it to you. So, I want to first extract the 00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0% PT month, the same as before. It would be good to give it to you. So, I want to first extract the 00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.070 align:start position:0% PT month, the same as before. It would be good to give it to you. So, I want to first extract the parts in front and extract only this list part 00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:18.269 align:start position:0% parts in front and extract only this list part 00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:20.110 align:start position:0% 00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:22.710 align:start position:0% 00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:25.389 align:start position:0% 00:32:25.389 --> 00:32:27.190 align:start position:0% 00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:29.269 align:start position:0% 00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0% 00:32:29.279 --> 00:32:31.190 align:start position:0% by removing the parts in front. I will do that. If you look here, there is a CPC ad. This CPC ad appears here first. Before this CPC ad appears, there is no need. So I will first split it with a Psik ad and extract the data. 00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0% by removing the parts in front. I will do that. If you look here, there is a CPC ad. This CPC ad appears here first. Before this CPC ad appears, there is no need. So I will first split it with a Psik ad and extract the data. 00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.190 align:start position:0% by removing the parts in front. I will do that. If you look here, there is a CPC ad. This CPC ad appears here first. Before this CPC ad appears, there is no need. So I will first split it with a Psik ad and extract the data. And if you look below, 00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0% And if you look below, 00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.149 align:start position:0% And if you look below, there is a customer center text. After this, there is 00:32:36.149 --> 00:32:36.159 align:start position:0% there is a customer center text. After this, there is 00:32:36.159 --> 00:32:38.029 align:start position:0% there is a customer center text. After this, there is no need. So I will add it to the customer center again. I will 00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:39.789 align:start position:0% no need. So I will add it to the customer center again. I will 00:32:39.789 --> 00:32:39.799 align:start position:0% 00:32:39.799 --> 00:32:42.029 align:start position:0% extract the three variable product lists. 00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:42.039 align:start position:0% extract the three variable product lists. 00:32:42.039 --> 00:32:44.310 align:start position:0% extract the three variable product lists. It is similar to before. 00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.389 align:start position:0% It is similar to before. 00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0% 00:32:46.399 --> 00:32:48.430 align:start position:0% I will play with the CPC ad in the text. Then, I will slice it and throw away the 00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:48.440 align:start position:0% I will play with the CPC ad in the text. Then, I will slice it and throw away the 00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.029 align:start position:0% I will play with the CPC ad in the text. Then, I will slice it and throw away the part in front of the CPC ad. 00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0% part in front of the CPC ad. 00:32:50.039 --> 00:32:52.149 align:start position:0% part in front of the CPC ad. After that, I will start from part 2 and 00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0% After that, I will start from part 2 and 00:32:52.159 --> 00:32:54.149 align:start position:0% After that, I will start from part 2 and bring it to the end. I will join it 00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0% bring it to the end. I will join it 00:32:54.159 --> 00:32:56.310 align:start position:0% bring it to the end. I will join it with a blank space like this and merge the split part. 00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:58.070 align:start position:0% with a blank space like this and merge the split part. 00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0% 00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.870 align:start position:0% After merging, I will split it again and 00:32:59.870 --> 00:32:59.880 align:start position:0% After merging, I will split it again and 00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.870 align:start position:0% After merging, I will split it again and divide it by the customer center. For example, I will 00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:01.880 align:start position:0% divide it by the customer center. For example, I will 00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.269 align:start position:0% divide it by the customer center. For example, I will output only the part before the first part, where the customer center appears. I 00:33:04.269 --> 00:33:05.789 align:start position:0% output only the part before the first part, where the customer center appears. I 00:33:05.789 --> 00:33:05.799 align:start position:0% 00:33:05.799 --> 00:33:08.269 align:start position:0% will run it like this. Then, the output 00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:08.279 align:start position:0% will run it like this. Then, the output 00:33:08.279 --> 00:33:11.470 align:start position:0% will run it like this. Then, the output seems to be cut to some extent. Then, I 00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:14.230 align:start position:0% seems to be cut to some extent. Then, I 00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0% 00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.389 align:start position:0% want to divide the list items by service. If I want to divide it, 00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0% want to divide the list items by service. If I want to divide it, 00:33:16.399 --> 00:33:19.389 align:start position:0% want to divide the list items by service. If I want to divide it, what criteria should I use to divide it? If you 00:33:19.389 --> 00:33:19.399 align:start position:0% what criteria should I use to divide it? If you 00:33:19.399 --> 00:33:21.310 align:start position:0% what criteria should I use to divide it? If you look for a pattern to see if you can divide by product, 00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:23.509 align:start position:0% look for a pattern to see if you can divide by product, 00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0% 00:33:23.519 --> 00:33:25.870 align:start position:0% there's this 99,000 won one, and then there's this premium monetization one 00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:25.880 align:start position:0% there's this 99,000 won one, and then there's this premium monetization one 00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.149 align:start position:0% there's this 99,000 won one, and then there's this premium monetization one for 900,000 won. 00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:28.159 align:start position:0% for 900,000 won. 00:33:28.159 --> 00:33:31.310 align:start position:0% for 900,000 won. So if you divide by this W 24 value, you 00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:33.590 align:start position:0% So if you divide by this W 24 value, you 00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0% 00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.310 align:start position:0% can divide the products one by one. So let's divide the items by that value. Let's call it a 00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:37.190 align:start position:0% can divide the products one by one. So let's divide the items by that value. Let's call it a 00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0% 00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.110 align:start position:0% list item. 00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:42.029 align:start position:0% list item. 00:33:42.029 --> 00:33:42.039 align:start position:0% 00:33:42.039 --> 00:33:43.870 align:start position:0% Let's designate the product list as 214 brackets. So 00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:43.880 align:start position:0% Let's designate the product list as 214 brackets. So 00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.870 align:start position:0% Let's designate the product list as 214 brackets. So after dividing it like this, let's run it again. 00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:45.880 align:start position:0% after dividing it like this, let's run it again. 00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.110 align:start position:0% after dividing it like this, let's run it again. Then, yes, it's divided into list items like this. 00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:50.509 align:start position:0% Then, yes, it's divided into list items like this. 00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0% 00:33:50.519 --> 00:33:52.870 align:start position:0% Now, we need to organize this and 00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:52.880 align:start position:0% Now, we need to organize this and 00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.950 align:start position:0% Now, we need to organize this and put it in the sheet. If you don't want to run it all at once 00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0% put it in the sheet. If you don't want to run it all at once 00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.870 align:start position:0% put it in the sheet. If you don't want to run it all at once but divide it separately, you can 00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:59.750 align:start position:0% but divide it separately, you can 00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0% 00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.710 align:start position:0% use the iterator to divide what's entered as one output. 00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:03.549 align:start position:0% use the iterator to divide what's entered as one output. 00:34:03.549 --> 00:34:03.559 align:start position:0% 00:34:03.559 --> 00:34:04.990 align:start position:0% So let's do that. Then, 00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:05.000 align:start position:0% So let's do that. Then, 00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.950 align:start position:0% So let's do that. Then, go to flow control and 00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0% go to flow control and 00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.950 align:start position:0% go to flow control and press iterator. Select the array, the items, the 00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:08.960 align:start position:0% press iterator. Select the array, the items, the 00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.629 align:start position:0% press iterator. Select the array, the items, the entire items. 00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639 align:start position:0% entire items. 00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:12.750 align:start position:0% entire items. Then, it will receive the array value, receive it 00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:12.760 align:start position:0% Then, it will receive the array value, receive it 00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.869 align:start position:0% Then, it will receive the array value, receive it as a list item, split it, and divide it. It divides the 00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0% as a list item, split it, and divide it. It divides the 00:34:14.879 --> 00:34:16.950 align:start position:0% as a list item, split it, and divide it. It divides the bundle into several parts. If you 00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0% bundle into several parts. If you 00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.629 align:start position:0% bundle into several parts. If you run it again, you can see several parts 00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:18.639 align:start position:0% run it again, you can see several parts 00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:20.550 align:start position:0% run it again, you can see several parts like this. I divided it into bundles. You 00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.560 align:start position:0% like this. I divided it into bundles. You 00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.030 align:start position:0% like this. I divided it into bundles. You can see that it is well divided. 00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:22.040 align:start position:0% can see that it is well divided. 00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.190 align:start position:0% can see that it is well divided. Then, let's run the PTL for each of these and 00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:26.669 align:start position:0% Then, let's run the PTL for each of these and 00:34:26.669 --> 00:34:26.679 align:start position:0% 00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:28.589 align:start position:0% request that the data be organized in the format we want and extracted. 00:34:28.589 --> 00:34:28.599 align:start position:0% request that the data be organized in the format we want and extracted. 00:34:28.599 --> 00:34:30.629 align:start position:0% request that the data be organized in the format we want and extracted. This time, since it is a short task, I will 00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0% This time, since it is a short task, I will 00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:32.349 align:start position:0% This time, since it is a short task, I will give it 20 48. I 00:34:32.349 --> 00:34:34.149 align:start position:0% give it 20 48. I 00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0% 00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:37.270 align:start position:0% will also put in the system and user prompt. This time, the web, and 00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:37.280 align:start position:0% will also put in the system and user prompt. This time, the web, and 00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.750 align:start position:0% will also put in the system and user prompt. This time, the web, and now the values ​​we want. 00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0% now the values ​​we want. 00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.829 align:start position:0% now the values ​​we want. Get the product name, rate link. 00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:40.839 align:start position:0% Get the product name, rate link. 00:34:40.839 --> 00:34:43.349 align:start position:0% Get the product name, rate link. Output it in Jason format. Do 00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0% Output it in Jason format. Do 00:34:43.359 --> 00:34:45.629 align:start position:0% Output it in Jason format. Do not put this Jason value in the rate. And 00:34:45.629 --> 00:34:45.639 align:start position:0% not put this Jason value in the rate. And 00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:47.149 align:start position:0% not put this Jason value in the rate. And here, I put in an example. I 00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:49.430 align:start position:0% here, I put in an example. I 00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0% 00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.270 align:start position:0% put in two flags to show how it should come out. 00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0% put in two flags to show how it should come out. 00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.909 align:start position:0% put in two flags to show how it should come out. There are cases with rates and cases without. 00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:52.919 align:start position:0% There are cases with rates and cases without. 00:34:52.919 --> 00:34:54.829 align:start position:0% There are cases with rates and cases without. So I divided the cases with and without weight and 00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:54.839 align:start position:0% So I divided the cases with and without weight and 00:34:54.839 --> 00:34:56.629 align:start position:0% So I divided the cases with and without weight and put them in. 00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0% put them in. 00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:58.349 align:start position:0% put them in. Then, it will be easier to work with the chart. 00:34:58.349 --> 00:34:58.359 align:start position:0% Then, it will be easier to work with the chart. 00:34:58.359 --> 00:35:00.109 align:start position:0% Then, it will be easier to work with the chart. Then, at the end, we 00:35:00.109 --> 00:35:00.119 align:start position:0% Then, at the end, we 00:35:00.119 --> 00:35:01.510 align:start position:0% Then, at the end, we need to put in the actual website data. 00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0% need to put in the actual website data. 00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.270 align:start position:0% need to put in the actual website data. So, with the website data, I will 00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:05.030 align:start position:0% So, with the website data, I will 00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0% 00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.990 align:start position:0% put in the value value extracted by the iterator ES. Then, the 00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:07.000 align:start position:0% put in the value value extracted by the iterator ES. Then, the 00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.550 align:start position:0% put in the value value extracted by the iterator ES. Then, the PT will extract the content here. It will be a 00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:09.560 align:start position:0% PT will extract the content here. It will be a 00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.390 align:start position:0% PT will extract the content here. It will be a Jason file. Then, if you pass it again and 00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0% Jason file. Then, if you pass it again and 00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.030 align:start position:0% Jason file. Then, if you pass it again and receive this value as it is, 00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.040 align:start position:0% receive this value as it is, 00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.510 align:start position:0% receive this value as it is, please receive it and then connect it to the sheet. 00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:14.520 align:start position:0% please receive it and then connect it to the sheet. 00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.790 align:start position:0% please receive it and then connect it to the sheet. Okay, this is the 00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:15.800 align:start position:0% Okay, this is the 00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.470 align:start position:0% Okay, this is the same, so 00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0% same, so 00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.030 align:start position:0% same, so let's move on quickly. Let's run it again and test it. 00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:23.109 align:start position:0% let's move on quickly. Let's run it again and test it. 00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0% 00:35:23.119 --> 00:35:25.589 align:start position:0% I'll put in the name, price, and link to the top. 00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0% I'll put in the name, price, and link to the top. 00:35:25.599 --> 00:35:27.230 align:start position:0% I'll put in the name, price, and link to the top. Then I'll connect it again and run it once. I'll 00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0% Then I'll connect it again and run it once. I'll 00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.870 align:start position:0% Then I'll connect it again and run it once. I'll 00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:30.829 align:start position:0% 00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:33.430 align:start position:0% 00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:35.470 align:start position:0% 00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:37.670 align:start position:0% 00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:38.950 align:start position:0% 00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:40.870 align:start position:0% 00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:43.150 align:start position:0% 00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:43.160 align:start position:0% 00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.349 align:start position:0% put in the ones with stars and not put in the ones without stars, so I'll add the products well now. Oh, there are 35. You can see that the services are being added well. And now, when you actually use it, you can connect it like this. After connecting, change the dataset ID back 00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0% put in the ones with stars and not put in the ones without stars, so I'll add the products well now. Oh, there are 35. You can see that the services are being added well. And now, when you actually use it, you can connect it like this.

Today, we looked at how to crawl both static and dynamic websites 00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0% Today, we looked at how to crawl both static and dynamic websites 00:35:50.079 --> 00:35:52.510 align:start position:0% Today, we looked at how to crawl both static and dynamic websites using Make, Chachi PT, and P files. 00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:55.150 align:start position:0% using Make, Chachi PT, and P files. 00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:57.150 align:start position:0% 00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.160 align:start position:0% 00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.030 align:start position:0% In fact, you can do web crawling 00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0% In fact, you can do web crawling 00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.309 align:start position:0% In fact, you can do web crawling in other ways without using Make. You can 00:36:01.309 --> 00:36:01.319 align:start position:0% in other ways without using Make. You can 00:36:01.319 --> 00:36:03.470 align:start position:0% in other ways without using Make. You can create the code yourself and 00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0% create the code yourself and 00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.109 align:start position:0% create the code yourself and use it while maintaining it. 00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:05.119 align:start position:0% use it while maintaining it. 00:36:05.119 --> 00:36:07.150 align:start position:0% use it while maintaining it. Or, 00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:07.160 align:start position:0% Or, 00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.390 align:start position:0% Or, there are external services that help with web crawling itself. You can 00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:09.400 align:start position:0% there are external services that help with web crawling itself. You can 00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.150 align:start position:0% there are external services that help with web crawling itself. You can use those paid services and 00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0% use those paid services and 00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.030 align:start position:0% use those paid services and request web crawling. 00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.040 align:start position:0% request web crawling. 00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.190 align:start position:0% request web crawling. But now, creating the code 00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0% But now, creating the code 00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.230 align:start position:0% But now, creating the code requires some development knowledge, and the HTML 00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:17.240 align:start position:0% requires some development knowledge, and the HTML 00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.270 align:start position:0% requires some development knowledge, and the HTML code will continue to be updated. So you 00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:21.109 align:start position:0% code will continue to be updated. So you 00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0% 00:36:21.119 --> 00:36:22.550 align:start position:0% have to keep modifying the code accordingly. That's how it works properly. 00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0% have to keep modifying the code accordingly. That's how it works properly. 00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.190 align:start position:0% have to keep modifying the code accordingly. That's how it works properly. Since you can crawl, you 00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:24.200 align:start position:0% Since you can crawl, you 00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.150 align:start position:0% Since you can crawl, you have to study a lot about development, and 00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0% have to study a lot about development, and 00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.109 align:start position:0% have to study a lot about development, and there are disadvantages in that it uses a lot of resources. 00:36:28.109 --> 00:36:28.119 align:start position:0% there are disadvantages in that it uses a lot of resources. 00:36:28.119 --> 00:36:29.950 align:start position:0% there are disadvantages in that it uses a lot of resources. In the case of external services, it is 00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:31.750 align:start position:0% In the case of external services, it is 00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0% 00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.550 align:start position:0% likely to cost more than using FP files. 00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:33.560 align:start position:0% likely to cost more than using FP files. 00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.230 align:start position:0% likely to cost more than using FP files. Also, there are some restrictions on the information being crawled and the 00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:35.240 align:start position:0% Also, there are some restrictions on the information being crawled and the 00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.630 align:start position:0% Also, there are some restrictions on the information being crawled and the format in which it is output. 00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:37.640 align:start position:0% format in which it is output. 00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.270 align:start position:0% format in which it is output. Also, it 00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0% Also, it 00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.910 align:start position:0% Also, it may be difficult to automate using something like Make, 00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:40.920 align:start position:0% may be difficult to automate using something like Make, 00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.230 align:start position:0% may be difficult to automate using something like Make, so there may be 00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:43.240 align:start position:0% so there may be 00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:45.230 align:start position:0% so there may be limitations in using it as an element to create an automated workflow. 00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240 align:start position:0% limitations in using it as an element to create an automated workflow. 00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.950 align:start position:0% limitations in using it as an element to create an automated workflow. So, the 00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0% So, the 00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.430 align:start position:0% So, the web crawling 00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0% web crawling 00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.230 align:start position:0% web crawling method that compensates for these shortcomings is the web crawling method that 00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.240 align:start position:0% method that compensates for these shortcomings is the web crawling method that 00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.030 align:start position:0% method that compensates for these shortcomings is the web crawling method that uses Make, AI, and Pa that I introduced today.
