Then, let’s set the assistant name and system 00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 align:start position:0% Then, let’s set the assistant name and system 00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.429 align:start position:0% Then, let’s set the assistant name and system instructions. Since we will 00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 align:start position:0% instructions. Since we will 00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:11.309 align:start position:0% instructions. Since we will create meeting minutes now, let’s 00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 align:start position:0% create meeting minutes now, let’s 00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.350 align:start position:0% create meeting minutes now, let’s create a meeting note generator. 00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 align:start position:0% create a meeting note generator. 00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.670 align:start position:0% create a meeting note generator. And for the system 00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 align:start position:0% And for the system 00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.990 align:start position:0% And for the system instructions, 00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.150 align:start position:0% instructions, 00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 align:start position:0% 00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.390 align:start position:0% you can explain in detail the process of what you want this assistant to do. 00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 align:start position:0% you can explain in detail the process of what you want this assistant to do. 00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.830 align:start position:0% you can explain in detail the process of what you want this assistant to do. I created it in advance. 00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 align:start position:0% I created it in advance. 00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.510 align:start position:0% I created it in advance. So, if I show you this, I 00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 align:start position:0% So, if I show you this, I 00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.550 align:start position:0% So, if I show you this, I wrote it in English. The reason I wrote it in English is because 00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.710 align:start position:0% wrote it in English. The reason I wrote it in English is because 00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 align:start position:0% 00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.390 align:start position:0% when we use this assistant, we often use various tools. We need to 00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.670 align:start position:0% when we use this assistant, we often use various tools. We need to 00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 align:start position:0% 00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.710 align:start position:0% be able to use these tools well when necessary. So, I 00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 align:start position:0% be able to use these tools well when necessary. So, I 00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.629 align:start position:0% be able to use these tools well when necessary. So, I gave such instructions. When giving instructions, I thought it would be 00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 align:start position:0% gave such instructions. When giving instructions, I thought it would be 00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.390 align:start position:0% gave such instructions. When giving instructions, I thought it would be easier to understand if I gave instructions in English, so I 00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 align:start position:0% easier to understand if I gave instructions in English, so I 00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.469 align:start position:0% easier to understand if I gave instructions in English, so I wrote them in English. 00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 align:start position:0% wrote them in English. 00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.270 align:start position:0% wrote them in English. However, now, for things like minutes, they should be written in Korean. 00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.390 align:start position:0% However, now, for things like minutes, they should be written in Korean. 00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 align:start position:0% 00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.510 align:start position:0% So, the first instruction was that 00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0% So, the first instruction was that 00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.990 align:start position:0% So, the first instruction was that responses should always be in Korean. 00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 align:start position:0% responses should always be in Korean. 00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.150 align:start position:0% responses should always be in Korean. And another important thing is that 00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 align:start position:0% And another important thing is that 00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.550 align:start position:0% And another important thing is that I specified the file name like this. 00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 align:start position:0% I specified the file name like this. 00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.390 align:start position:0% I specified the file name like this. We will upload a template of how we want the minutes to be 00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0% We will upload a template of how we want the minutes to be 00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.390 align:start position:0% We will upload a template of how we want the minutes to be written. 00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 align:start position:0% written. 00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.629 align:start position:0% written. So, I 00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:02.629 align:start position:0% So, I 00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0% 00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.350 align:start position:0% specified the exact file name to be uploaded and specified that it should be written using the structure as is. 00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.430 align:start position:0% specified the exact file name to be uploaded and specified that it should be written using the structure as is. 00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 align:start position:0% 00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.710 align:start position:0% And I will 00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 align:start position:0% And I will 00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.350 align:start position:0% And I will create a file called Miro that knows industry terms and 00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 align:start position:0% create a file called Miro that knows industry terms and 00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.150 align:start position:0% create a file called Miro that knows industry terms and upload it. In there, 00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.790 align:start position:0% upload it. In there, 00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.790 align:start position:0% 00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 align:start position:0% 00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.430 align:start position:0% there are terms that are commonly used in certain industries, such as abbreviations. There 00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.270 align:start position:0% there are terms that are commonly used in certain industries, such as abbreviations. There 00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.150 align:start position:0% 00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 align:start position:0% 00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.909 align:start position:0% may be cases where PTGA does not interpret them properly. So, to prevent that from happening, if you organize the 00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 align:start position:0% may be cases where PTGA does not interpret them properly. So, to prevent that from happening, if you organize the 00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.550 align:start position:0% may be cases where PTGA does not interpret them properly. So, to prevent that from happening, if you organize the industry terms separately and include them, you 00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.749 align:start position:0% industry terms separately and include them, you 00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 align:start position:0% 00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:30.390 align:start position:0% can create a higher quality Pay 6. That is why I 00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0% can create a higher quality Pay 6. That is why I 00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.150 align:start position:0% can create a higher quality Pay 6. That is why I mentioned that work. 00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 align:start position:0% mentioned that work. 00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.710 align:start position:0% mentioned that work. When you mention it like this, it is better to write in detail about which file to refer to. 00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.749 align:start position:0% When you mention it like this, it is better to write in detail about which file to refer to. 00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0% 00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:37.189 align:start position:0% The next important thing is 00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 align:start position:0% The next important thing is 00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:39.749 align:start position:0% The next important thing is formatting. We will do it later. 00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 align:start position:0% formatting. We will do it later. 00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:41.510 align:start position:0% formatting. We will do it later. Since I'm going to write a case study in Google Doc, I 00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.830 align:start position:0% Since I'm going to write a case study in Google Doc, I 00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 align:start position:0% 00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.670 align:start position:0% asked for a response in HTML synth.

This is 00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 align:start position:0% This is 00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.350 align:start position:0% This is called a markdown file, so it 00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0% called a markdown file, so it 00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.869 align:start position:0% called a markdown file, so it has an .md extension. We will use a markdown file 00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:15.879 align:start position:0% has an .md extension. We will use a markdown file 00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:17.430 align:start position:0% has an .md extension. We will use a markdown file this time. This 00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 align:start position:0% this time. This 00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.869 align:start position:0% this time. This markdown file is a text format developed for writing documents. The 00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:22.029 align:start position:0% markdown file is a text format developed for writing documents. The 00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:24.469 align:start position:0% 00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0% 00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:26.990 align:start position:0% difference from a basic txt file is that you 00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.230 align:start position:0% difference from a basic txt file is that you 00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.240 align:start position:0% 00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.670 align:start position:0% can adjust the size of the text header like this, like sharp or sharp sharp. You can 00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:30.680 align:start position:0% can adjust the size of the text header like this, like sharp or sharp sharp. You can 00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.749 align:start position:0% can adjust the size of the text header like this, like sharp or sharp sharp. You can also express a black point with a stick like this, 00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:32.759 align:start position:0% also express a black point with a stick like this, 00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:34.909 align:start position:0% also express a black point with a stick like this, express text boldness, 00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:34.919 align:start position:0% express text boldness, 00:07:34.919 --> 00:07:36.830 align:start position:0% express text boldness, express italics, and all of these things. 00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 align:start position:0% express italics, and all of these things. 00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.550 align:start position:0% express italics, and all of these things. So if you express it like that, it will be 00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.430 align:start position:0% So if you express it like that, it will be 00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.589 align:start position:0% 00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:44.749 align:start position:0% 00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:44.759 align:start position:0% 00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:46.110 align:start position:0% more helpful for AI to understand the importance or priority of the context than when it recognizes all text as equal. So 00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.110 align:start position:0% more helpful for AI to understand the importance or priority of the context than when it recognizes all text as equal. So 00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120 align:start position:0% 00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.430 align:start position:0% let's save it as a markdown file and upload it. Once the two 00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0% let's save it as a markdown file and upload it. Once the two 00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.589 align:start position:0% let's save it as a markdown file and upload it. Once the two files are ready, you need to upload them. 00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:52.909 align:start position:0% files are ready, you need to upload them. 00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 align:start position:0% 00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:54.790 align:start position:0% If you want to upload them, click here. 00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0% If you want to upload them, click here. 00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.629 align:start position:0% If you want to upload them, click here.

Then, we just 00:08:16.749 --> 00:08:16.759 align:start position:0% Then, we just 00:08:16.759 --> 00:08:18.390 align:start position:0% Then, we just uploaded the file by dragging it, and when we 00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:18.400 align:start position:0% uploaded the file by dragging it, and when we 00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.070 align:start position:0% uploaded the file by dragging it, and when we activated the file search function that I showed you earlier and 00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.080 align:start position:0% activated the file search function that I showed you earlier and 00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.270 align:start position:0% activated the file search function that I showed you earlier and uploaded the file, it automatically 00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0% uploaded the file, it automatically 00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.029 align:start position:0% uploaded the file, it automatically created a vector embedding and saved the vector converted information in the 00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:26.039 align:start position:0% created a vector embedding and saved the vector converted information in the 00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:28.350 align:start position:0% created a vector embedding and saved the vector converted information in the vector DB. 00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:28.360 align:start position:0% vector DB. 00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.469 align:start position:0% vector DB. So you can do this easily. If you 00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0% So you can do this easily. If you 00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:32.190 align:start position:0% So you can do this easily. If you set it like this, you have 00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:32.200 align:start position:0% set it like this, you have 00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.310 align:start position:0% set it like this, you have already completed the assistant. 00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0% already completed the assistant. 00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.110 align:start position:0% already completed the assistant. Finally, if you look below here, there 00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120 align:start position:0% Finally, if you look below here, there 00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.149 align:start position:0% Finally, if you look below here, there is a temper. You 00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:39.159 align:start position:0% is a temper. You 00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.269 align:start position:0% is a temper. You can set the degree of freedom for the temper. I 00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0% can set the degree of freedom for the temper. I 00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:44.430 align:start position:0% can set the degree of freedom for the temper. I will set this to around 0.2. 00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:44.440 align:start position:0% will set this to around 0.2. 00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.350 align:start position:0% will set this to around 0.2. Because we are writing the minutes, we do 00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:47.750 align:start position:0% Because we are writing the minutes, we do 00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0% 00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.630 align:start position:0% not need such creative answers. It is 00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:49.640 align:start position:0% not need such creative answers. It is 00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.670 align:start position:0% not need such creative answers. It is important to give accurate answers, so I 00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0% important to give accurate answers, so I 00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.190 align:start position:0% important to give accurate answers, so I lowered the temper 2 a bit. 00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0% lowered the temper 2 a bit. 00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.509 align:start position:0% lowered the temper 2 a bit. Then, you can easily do this. I 00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:55.519 align:start position:0% Then, you can easily do this. I 00:08:55.519 --> 00:08:57.389 align:start position:0% Then, you can easily do this. I created an assistant, and 00:08:57.389 --> 00:08:57.399 align:start position:0% created an assistant, and 00:08:57.399 --> 00:08:59.110 align:start position:0% created an assistant, and then what's the next step? We'll 00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0% then what's the next step? We'll 00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.230 align:start position:0% then what's the next step? We'll record the meeting content and 00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:01.240 align:start position:0% record the meeting content and 00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.670 align:start position:0% record the meeting content and upload it. So 00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:04.990 align:start position:0% upload it. So 00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:05.000 align:start position:0% 00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.710 align:start position:0% let's create a Notion table for the upload as an example. I 00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.949 align:start position:0% let's create a Notion table for the upload as an example. I 00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:10.910 align:start position:0% 00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:10.920 align:start position:0% 00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.150 align:start position:0% created a database with a High Lock list on a page called High Lock. Here, I entered the meeting agenda, the meeting 00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:13.160 align:start position:0% created a database with a High Lock list on a page called High Lock. Here, I entered the meeting agenda, the meeting 00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.670 align:start position:0% created a database with a High Lock list on a page called High Lock. Here, I entered the meeting agenda, the meeting date, attendees, and the 00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0% date, attendees, and the 00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.550 align:start position:0% date, attendees, and the meeting audio recording. Now, I 00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:17.560 align:start position:0% meeting audio recording. Now, I 00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.389 align:start position:0% meeting audio recording. Now, I uploaded the audio recording file. 00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:19.399 align:start position:0% uploaded the audio recording file. 00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:21.350 align:start position:0% uploaded the audio recording file. Then, I set the stage so that it would be created when I 00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start position:0% Then, I set the stage so that it would be created when I 00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.590 align:start position:0% Then, I set the stage so that it would be created when I clicked the creation request button for whether to write. 00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.310 align:start position:0% clicked the creation request button for whether to write. 00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0% 00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.829 align:start position:0% Finally, I configured it so that I could link to Paylo here, so that when I 00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:28.790 align:start position:0% Finally, I configured it so that I could link to Paylo here, so that when I 00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0% 00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.550 align:start position:0% created the meeting minutes, I could include a link that I could check here. 00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.590 align:start position:0% created the meeting minutes, I could include a link that I could check here. 00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:32.600 align:start position:0% 00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.310 align:start position:0% Now, I need to be 00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0% Now, I need to be 00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.470 align:start position:0% Now, I need to be able to access and utilize this in Make. 00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0% able to access and utilize this in Make. 00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.829 align:start position:0% able to access and utilize this in Make. So, I input the Notion module. 00:09:38.829 --> 00:09:38.839 align:start position:0% So, I input the Notion module. 00:09:38.839 --> 00:09:40.350 align:start position:0% So, I input the Notion module. What we want here is the 00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:40.360 align:start position:0% What we want here is the 00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.030 align:start position:0% What we want here is the watch database item. This is a 00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.509 align:start position:0% watch database item. This is a 00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:46.310 align:start position:0% 00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.509 align:start position:0% 00:09:48.509 --> 00:09:48.519 align:start position:0% 00:09:48.519 --> 00:09:50.310 align:start position:0% module that detects and retrieves when an item is created in a specific database in Notion. So, I'm going to 00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:50.320 align:start position:0% module that detects and retrieves when an item is created in a specific database in Notion. So, I'm going to 00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.310 align:start position:0% module that detects and retrieves when an item is created in a specific database in Notion. So, I'm going to set this up. To set it up, you 00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0% set this up. To set it up, you 00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.590 align:start position:0% set this up. To set it up, you first need to make this connection. If you 00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0% first need to make this connection. If you 00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.710 align:start position:0% first need to make this connection. If you click on it, you'll see that it's called Public, which is 00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:56.720 align:start position:0% click on it, you'll see that it's called Public, which is 00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.110 align:start position:0% click on it, you'll see that it's called Public, which is usually called Internal, or Internal Pro. Since you'll be using it a lot, you need to 00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120 align:start position:0% usually called Internal, or Internal Pro. Since you'll be using it a lot, you need to 00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.710 align:start position:0% usually called Internal, or Internal Pro. Since you'll be using it a lot, you need to set up the internal settings and 00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0% set up the internal settings and 00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.310 align:start position:0% set up the internal settings and enter the integration token here. 00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0% enter the integration token here. 00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.990 align:start position:0% enter the integration token here. So, you need to create a token first. 00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.000 align:start position:0% So, you need to create a token first. 00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.949 align:start position:0% So, you need to create a token first. Once you create a token, 00:10:05.949 --> 00:10:05.959 align:start position:0% Once you create a token, 00:10:05.959 --> 00:10:08.630 align:start position:0% Once you create a token, go to Notion Settings on the left and there's a 00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640 align:start position:0% go to Notion Settings on the left and there's a 00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.190 align:start position:0% go to Notion Settings on the left and there's a connection section. If you look below, 00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:12.509 align:start position:0% connection section. If you look below, 00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:12.519 align:start position:0% 00:10:12.519 --> 00:10:13.870 align:start position:0% there's something called develop or manage integration. 00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:13.880 align:start position:0% there's something called develop or manage integration. 00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.670 align:start position:0% there's something called develop or manage integration. So, click on Settings. 00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0% So, click on Settings. 00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.829 align:start position:0% So, click on Settings.

Okay, if you 00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0% Okay, if you 00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.829 align:start position:0% Okay, if you want to check that the ID is correct, start with this 1A 4719 00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0% want to check that the ID is correct, start with this 1A 4719 00:11:31.839 --> 00:11:33.829 align:start position:0% want to check that the ID is correct, start with this 1A 4719 F. If you 00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0% F. If you 00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:35.870 align:start position:0% F. If you look at the paylong list, you can see that the URL 1A 00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0% look at the paylong list, you can see that the URL 1A 00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.670 align:start position:0% look at the paylong list, you can see that the URL 1A 4719 F is correct. 00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.389 align:start position:0% 4719 F is correct. 00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0% 00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:42.350 align:start position:0% And I'm going to retrieve only two at a time. 00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0% And I'm going to retrieve only two at a time. 00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.629 align:start position:0% And I'm going to retrieve only two at a time. Oh, and I'm 00:11:44.629 --> 00:11:44.639 align:start position:0% Oh, and I'm 00:11:44.639 --> 00:11:46.750 align:start position:0% Oh, and I'm going to use this time as the update time. 00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:46.760 align:start position:0% going to use this time as the update time. 00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.870 align:start position:0% going to use this time as the update time. Because we want to detect not only when it was initially created 00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:48.880 align:start position:0% Because we want to detect not only when it was initially created 00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.629 align:start position:0% Because we want to detect not only when it was initially created but also when it's updated, I 00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:52.150 align:start position:0% but also when it's updated, I 00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.190 align:start position:0% 00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:54.200 align:start position:0% 00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.310 align:start position:0% think it would be better to retrieve it based on the update. Set it like this and once, 00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.320 align:start position:0% think it would be better to retrieve it based on the update. Set it like this and once, 00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.550 align:start position:0% think it would be better to retrieve it based on the update. Set it like this and once, update the meeting agenda like this and retrieve it. 00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0% update the meeting agenda like this and retrieve it. 00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.030 align:start position:0% update the meeting agenda like this and retrieve it. Run once. 00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:00.040 align:start position:0% Run once. 00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.790 align:start position:0% Run once. Then, like this. You 00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0% Then, like this. You 00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.430 align:start position:0% Then, like this. You can see that it is fetching the updated information. 00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.440 align:start position:0% can see that it is fetching the updated information. 00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.269 align:start position:0% can see that it is fetching the updated information. So now if we upload the voice recording 00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0% So now if we upload the voice recording 00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:07.110 align:start position:0% So now if we upload the voice recording file here, it will 00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.120 align:start position:0% file here, it will 00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.829 align:start position:0% file here, it will create the minutes. So 00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:08.839 align:start position:0% create the minutes. So 00:12:08.839 --> 00:12:11.350 align:start position:0% create the minutes. So I uploaded a file as an example. 00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0% I uploaded a file as an example. 00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.389 align:start position:0% I uploaded a file as an example. Then if we 00:12:13.389 --> 00:12:13.399 align:start position:0% Then if we 00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:14.790 align:start position:0% Then if we run it again here, it 00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:14.800 align:start position:0% run it again here, it 00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.110 align:start position:0% run it again here, it will fetch the file. We 00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:16.120 align:start position:0% will fetch the file. We 00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.069 align:start position:0% will fetch the file. We have fetched the file like this, but we need to download the file to 00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0% have fetched the file like this, but we need to download the file to 00:12:18.079 --> 00:12:19.470 align:start position:0% have fetched the file like this, but we need to download the file to use it. 00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:19.480 align:start position:0% use it. 00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.509 align:start position:0% use it. So if we want to download the file that we uploaded on the web, we can 00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:24.470 align:start position:0% So if we want to download the file that we uploaded on the web, we can 00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0% 00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.030 align:start position:0% use the http module. There is a module called Get-a-file. You 00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.150 align:start position:0% use the http module. There is a module called Get-a-file. You 00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.160 align:start position:0% 00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.550 align:start position:0% can enter the URL here. There is a URL for the voice recording file in Notion. Just 00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:31.560 align:start position:0% can enter the URL here. There is a URL for the voice recording file in Notion. Just 00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.389 align:start position:0% can enter the URL here. There is a URL for the voice recording file in Notion. Just enter the URL. 00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:33.399 align:start position:0% enter the URL. 00:12:33.399 --> 00:12:35.069 align:start position:0% enter the URL. Then, 00:12:35.069 --> 00:12:35.079 align:start position:0% Then, 00:12:35.079 --> 00:12:36.910 align:start position:0% Then, when the file comes into Notion, you can download it. 00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:38.870 align:start position:0% when the file comes into Notion, you can download it. 00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0% 00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.870 align:start position:0% I will organize the module names up to this point. Next, you 00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880 align:start position:0% I will organize the module names up to this point. Next, you 00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.030 align:start position:0% I will organize the module names up to this point. Next, you need to set a filter. We 00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:42.040 align:start position:0% need to set a filter. We 00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.269 align:start position:0% need to set a filter. We will detect this based on the update. 00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0% will detect this based on the update. 00:12:44.279 --> 00:12:46.509 align:start position:0% will detect this based on the update. So, only those that have uploaded the voice recording file 00:12:46.509 --> 00:12:46.519 align:start position:0% So, only those that have uploaded the voice recording file 00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:49.030 align:start position:0% So, only those that have uploaded the voice recording file and 00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0% and 00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.430 align:start position:0% and entered the minutes creation request stage in the writing status will be 00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0% entered the minutes creation request stage in the writing status will be 00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.590 align:start position:0% entered the minutes creation request stage in the writing status will be downloaded. 00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0% downloaded. 00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.430 align:start position:0% downloaded. If it is before the request or 00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0% If it is before the request or 00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.590 align:start position:0% If it is before the request or the minutes have already been created, you 00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.350 align:start position:0% the minutes have already been created, you 00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0% 00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.430 align:start position:0% should not download it again even if there is a change in any data. So, 00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.750 align:start position:0% should not download it again even if there is a change in any data. So, 00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.629 align:start position:0% 00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:05.639 align:start position:0% 00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:07.829 align:start position:0% let's set a filter to execute the latter part only if you want. The filter is whether to request minutes creation. 00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0% let's set a filter to execute the latter part only if you want. The filter is whether to request minutes creation. 00:13:07.839 --> 00:13:09.829 align:start position:0% let's set a filter to execute the latter part only if you want. The filter is whether to request minutes creation. First, the minutes. There 00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0% First, the minutes. There 00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:12.110 align:start position:0% First, the minutes. There must be a URL in the file. If it 00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.120 align:start position:0% must be a URL in the file. If it 00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.030 align:start position:0% must be a URL in the file. If it exists, and the stage for whether to write the end is a 00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0% exists, and the stage for whether to write the end is a 00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.350 align:start position:0% exists, and the stage for whether to write the end is a request to create minutes, we will filter and pass it 00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0% request to create minutes, we will filter and pass it 00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.150 align:start position:0% request to create minutes, we will filter and pass it on. So, 00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:19.160 align:start position:0% on. So, 00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.750 align:start position:0% on. So, we have downloaded the voice recording file like this. 00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:20.760 align:start position:0% we have downloaded the voice recording file like this. 00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.870 align:start position:0% we have downloaded the voice recording file like this. Then, we need to convert the voice recording file 00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0% Then, we need to convert the voice recording file 00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.829 align:start position:0% Then, we need to convert the voice recording file into text. 00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839 align:start position:0% into text. 00:13:24.839 --> 00:13:26.310 align:start position:0% into text. So, we will do that, 00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0% So, we will do that, 00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.550 align:start position:0% So, we will do that, but before that, we will use the sleep module to 00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0% but before that, we will use the sleep module to 00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.790 align:start position:0% but before that, we will use the sleep module to delay by about 5 seconds. The 00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0% delay by about 5 seconds. The 00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.670 align:start position:0% delay by about 5 seconds. The reason for setting it like this is that we 00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.310 align:start position:0% reason for setting it like this is that we 00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0% 00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.430 align:start position:0% can upload multiple files to Notion at once. Then, if 00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:36.440 align:start position:0% can upload multiple files to Notion at once. Then, if 00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.829 align:start position:0% can upload multiple files to Notion at once. Then, if we have five files loaded here, they will be 00:13:38.829 --> 00:13:38.839 align:start position:0% we have five files loaded here, they will be 00:13:38.839 --> 00:13:40.910 align:start position:0% we have five files loaded here, they will be executed in succession. 00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:40.920 align:start position:0% executed in succession. 00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.870 align:start position:0% executed in succession. Then, since the chat beauty module 00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0% Then, since the chat beauty module 00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.670 align:start position:0% Then, since the chat beauty module can be accessed too quickly and many times, we will delay 00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:44.680 align:start position:0% can be accessed too quickly and many times, we will delay 00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.829 align:start position:0% can be accessed too quickly and many times, we will delay a bit so that it does not reach the API limit. 00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0% a bit so that it does not reach the API limit. 00:13:46.839 --> 00:13:48.550 align:start position:0% a bit so that it does not reach the API limit. Next, we will 00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0% Next, we will 00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.710 align:start position:0% Next, we will convert it into text. 00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0% convert it into text. 00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.710 align:start position:0% convert it into text.

This time, it's a bit more complicated 00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:27.400 align:start position:0% This time, it's a bit more complicated 00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.390 align:start position:0% This time, it's a bit more complicated system, so 00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0% system, so 00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.029 align:start position:0% system, so before creating an assistant, it would be good to first look at the goals of this assistant and the 00:19:32.029 --> 00:19:32.039 align:start position:0% before creating an assistant, it would be good to first look at the goals of this assistant and the 00:19:32.039 --> 00:19:34.590 align:start position:0% before creating an assistant, it would be good to first look at the goals of this assistant and the tools and information needed to achieve those goals. 00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:36.390 align:start position:0% tools and information needed to achieve those goals. 00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0% 00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.870 align:start position:0% First, it would be good to have a guide on what kind of title, video description, and 00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0% First, it would be good to have a guide on what kind of title, video description, and 00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.950 align:start position:0% First, it would be good to have a guide on what kind of title, video description, and tags are good. 00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0% tags are good. 00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.470 align:start position:0% tags are good. So I'll create that guide 00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0% So I'll create that guide 00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.990 align:start position:0% So I'll create that guide document first. And 00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.000 align:start position:0% document first. And 00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.270 align:start position:0% document first. And then, although the guide is important, I think I can write it 00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:46.280 align:start position:0% then, although the guide is important, I think I can write it 00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.669 align:start position:0% then, although the guide is important, I think I can write it smarter if there are actual usage examples. 00:19:48.669 --> 00:19:50.070 align:start position:0% smarter if there are actual usage examples. 00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0% 00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.870 align:start position:0% So I'll add the 00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:51.880 align:start position:0% So I'll add the 00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.350 align:start position:0% So I'll add the video titles, video descriptions, and tags that actually performed well on YouTube. 00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:56.029 align:start position:0% video titles, video descriptions, and tags that actually performed well on YouTube. 00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0% 00:19:56.039 --> 00:19:57.990 align:start position:0% This time, I 00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0% This time, I 00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.070 align:start position:0% This time, I 'll first set up the basic structure of the assistant. Also, press Create. 00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080 align:start position:0% 'll first set up the basic structure of the assistant. Also, press Create. 00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.990 align:start position:0% 'll first set up the basic structure of the assistant. Also, press Create. This time, since we're 00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.000 align:start position:0% This time, since we're 00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.630 align:start position:0% This time, since we're creating YouTube metadata, I've 00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:05.990 align:start position:0% creating YouTube metadata, I've 00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0% 00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.590 align:start position:0% set up the YouTube metadata generator.

I created a sheet called Trending List in the 9c table of citizen development. 00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.630 align:start position:0% called Trending List in the 9c table of citizen development. 00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:47.310 align:start position:0% 00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:47.320 align:start position:0% 00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.190 align:start position:0% Here, you can see 00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0% Here, you can see 00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.350 align:start position:0% Here, you can see various video data. 00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0% various video data. 00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.029 align:start position:0% various video data. I will use this and 00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0% I will use this and 00:22:53.039 --> 00:22:54.789 align:start position:0% I will use this and set the filter. If you think about it, 00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0% set the filter. If you think about it, 00:22:54.799 --> 00:22:56.669 align:start position:0% set the filter. If you think about it, we want to create good metadata anyway. 00:22:56.669 --> 00:22:58.070 align:start position:0% we want to create good metadata anyway. 00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0% 00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.830 align:start position:0% So, it would 00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840 align:start position:0% So, it would 00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.190 align:start position:0% So, it would be better to upload good examples and use them as reference. So, I 00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:03.990 align:start position:0% be better to upload good examples and use them as reference. So, I 00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0% 00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.950 align:start position:0% created a checklist. Among these videos, I 00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:08.230 align:start position:0% created a checklist. Among these videos, I 00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.240 align:start position:0% 00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.269 align:start position:0% added only the good videos as true values. So, I will upload only the true values. The 00:23:10.269 --> 00:23:12.430 align:start position:0% added only the good videos as true values. So, I will upload only the true values. The 00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:12.440 align:start position:0% 00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.710 align:start position:0% sorting will be updated by descending the most recent data. Then, when we say that the 00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:16.710 align:start position:0% sorting will be updated by descending the most recent data. Then, when we say that the 00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720 align:start position:0% 00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.430 align:start position:0% videos continue to accumulate, we will update by bringing in the most recent ones first, so we can 00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.830 align:start position:0% videos continue to accumulate, we will update by bringing in the most recent ones first, so we can 00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840 align:start position:0% 00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.830 align:start position:0% continue to bring in the latest data and update. For 00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:24.669 align:start position:0% continue to bring in the latest data and update. For 00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:24.679 align:start position:0% 00:23:24.679 --> 00:23:26.669 align:start position:0% the limit, we 00:23:26.669 --> 00:23:26.679 align:start position:0% the limit, we 00:23:26.679 --> 00:23:28.470 align:start position:0% the limit, we need to test it first, so let's make it two. 00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0% need to test it first, so let's make it two. 00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.390 align:start position:0% need to test it first, so let's make it two. Then, let's bring in the video data like this. 00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0% Then, let's bring in the video data like this. 00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.510 align:start position:0% Then, let's bring in the video data like this. Let's try R once. Let's 00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:32.520 align:start position:0% Let's try R once. Let's 00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.990 align:start position:0% Let's try R once. Let's divide the two values ​​into bundles like this and 00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:36.870 align:start position:0% divide the two values ​​into bundles like this and 00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0% 00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.269 align:start position:0% bring in all the values ​​of the row like this. But, let's format the values 00:23:39.269 --> 00:23:39.279 align:start position:0% bring in all the values ​​of the row like this. But, let's format the values 00:23:39.279 --> 00:23:41.830 align:start position:0% bring in all the values ​​of the row like this. But, let's format the values by video in JSON format. I'll 00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:41.840 align:start position:0% by video in JSON format. I'll 00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.549 align:start position:0% by video in JSON format. I'll convert it. To do that, 00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0% convert it. To do that, 00:23:43.559 --> 00:23:46.029 align:start position:0% convert it. To do that, type Jason and do create Jason. 00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:46.039 align:start position:0% type Jason and do create Jason. 00:23:46.039 --> 00:23:47.830 align:start position:0% type Jason and do create Jason. But before you do that, if you 00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0% But before you do that, if you 00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.350 align:start position:0% But before you do that, if you think about it, if you bring in the latest 50 or 00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:50.360 align:start position:0% think about it, if you bring in the latest 50 or 00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.950 align:start position:0% think about it, if you bring in the latest 50 or so and update them, 00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:53.269 align:start position:0% so and update them, 00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0% 00:23:53.279 --> 00:23:54.750 align:start position:0% there may be videos that have already been updated. 00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:54.760 align:start position:0% there may be videos that have already been updated. 00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.950 align:start position:0% there may be videos that have already been updated. So you have to exclude those videos and 00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0% So you have to exclude those videos and 00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.630 align:start position:0% So you have to exclude those videos and update the vector DV. 00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0% update the vector DV. 00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.430 align:start position:0% update the vector DV. So 00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0% So 00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.029 align:start position:0% So let's first set up a module that can check for duplicates. 00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0% let's first set up a module that can check for duplicates. 00:24:03.039 --> 00:24:05.350 align:start position:0% let's first set up a module that can check for duplicates. Then, before this, let's get range values ​​in front and 00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:06.950 align:start position:0% Then, before this, let's get range values ​​in front and 00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0% 00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.310 align:start position:0% filter the duplicate values ​​first. 00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:09.320 align:start position:0% filter the duplicate values ​​first. 00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.990 align:start position:0% filter the duplicate values ​​first. Let's pull the world forward and use the 00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0% Let's pull the world forward and use the 00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.149 align:start position:0% Let's pull the world forward and use the upload list, which was a trending list earlier. 00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:15.789 align:start position:0% upload list, which was a trending list earlier. 00:24:15.789 --> 00:24:15.799 align:start position:0% 00:24:15.799 --> 00:24:17.750 align:start position:0% What is this upload list? It's a sheet that updates what was updated when you update the vector DB later. 00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:20.390 align:start position:0% What is this upload list? It's a sheet that updates what was updated when you update the vector DB later. 00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0% 00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.870 align:start position:0% So 00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:21.880 align:start position:0% So 00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.830 align:start position:0% So if it's uploaded here, you 00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0% if it's uploaded here, you 00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.590 align:start position:0% if it's uploaded here, you can check that it's already entered information. 00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.600 align:start position:0% can check that it's already entered information. 00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.510 align:start position:0% can check that it's already entered information. What are you going to get here? 00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:29.310 align:start position:0% What are you going to get here? 00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:29.320 align:start position:0% 00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.029 align:start position:0% Since we're going to check for duplicates by video ID, 00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:31.039 align:start position:0% Since we're going to check for duplicates by video ID, 00:24:31.039 --> 00:24:32.710 align:start position:0% Since we're going to check for duplicates by video ID, let's get column B. And there's a header, and the 00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0% let's get column B. And there's a header, and the 00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.310 align:start position:0% let's get column B. And there's a header, and the first column is the header. So if you 00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:36.950 align:start position:0% first column is the header. So if you 00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0% 00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.149 align:start position:0% get the video ID values ​​like this, you'll merge them into one array. 00:24:39.149 --> 00:24:39.159 align:start position:0% get the video ID values ​​like this, you'll merge them into one array. 00:24:39.159 --> 00:24:40.750 align:start position:0% get the video ID values ​​like this, you'll merge them into one array. So you can do that combining 00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:40.760 align:start position:0% So you can do that combining 00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.269 align:start position:0% So you can do that combining work with array ligera. 00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:45.190 align:start position:0% work with array ligera. 00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0% 00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.990 align:start position:0% You can select the video ID here. 00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:47.000 align:start position:0% You can select the video ID here. 00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.149 align:start position:0% You can select the video ID here. Let's select and group them. Then we 00:24:49.149 --> 00:24:49.159 align:start position:0% Let's select and group them. Then we 00:24:49.159 --> 00:24:51.029 align:start position:0% Let's select and group them. Then we need to filter only the new videos. We 00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:51.039 align:start position:0% need to filter only the new videos. We 00:24:51.039 --> 00:24:52.830 align:start position:0% need to filter only the new videos. We will check if the videos are duplicated and 00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.630 align:start position:0% will check if the videos are duplicated and 00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0% 00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.310 align:start position:0% filter if the data is entered correctly. 00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:58.070 align:start position:0% filter if the data is entered correctly. 00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0% 00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.070 align:start position:0% There is an array that has been grouped. We will select this. 00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:02.230 align:start position:0% There is an array that has been grouped. We will select this. 00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0% 00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.789 align:start position:0% If you hover the mouse over the video ID value, the row is now 00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:03.799 align:start position:0% If you hover the mouse over the video ID value, the row is now 00:25:03.799 --> 00:25:05.950 align:start position:0% If you hover the mouse over the video ID value, the row is now 1. So, you can set it to 1. 00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:05.960 align:start position:0% 1. So, you can set it to 1. 00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.549 align:start position:0% 1. So, you can set it to 1. Then, there are 00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559 align:start position:0% Then, there are 00:25:07.559 --> 00:25:09.230 align:start position:0% Then, there are various video IDs in this entire array. We will 00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:11.149 align:start position:0% various video IDs in this entire array. We will 00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:11.159 align:start position:0% 00:25:11.159 --> 00:25:13.070 align:start position:0% extract them using the map and 00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.080 align:start position:0% extract them using the map and 00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.549 align:start position:0% extract them using the map and make them into a single list. 00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0% make them into a single list. 00:25:14.559 --> 00:25:16.909 align:start position:0% make them into a single list. Then, if the 00:25:16.909 --> 00:25:18.630 align:start position:0% Then, if the 00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:20.470 align:start position:0% 00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0% 00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.389 align:start position:0% video ID value that we get from the sheet is not included in this array, it 00:25:22.389 --> 00:25:24.470 align:start position:0% video ID value that we get from the sheet is not included in this array, it 00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0% 00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.870 align:start position:0% will pass the filtering. And while doing so, we will 00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0% will pass the filtering. And while doing so, we will 00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.190 align:start position:0% will pass the filtering. And while doing so, we will check if there are some values. It would be 00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:31.230 align:start position:0% check if there are some values. It would be 00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:31.240 align:start position:0% 00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.149 align:start position:0% better to upload only the values ​​that are necessary. The 00:25:33.149 --> 00:25:33.159 align:start position:0% better to upload only the values ​​that are necessary. The 00:25:33.159 --> 00:25:35.470 align:start position:0% better to upload only the values ​​that are necessary. The most important thing is to have the title and video description. 00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:35.480 align:start position:0% most important thing is to have the title and video description. 00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.389 align:start position:0% most important thing is to have the title and video description. So, 00:25:37.389 --> 00:25:39.590 align:start position:0% So, 00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0% 00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.310 align:start position:0% we will filter the values ​​so that only the ones that are entered are updated. 00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:41.320 align:start position:0% we will filter the values ​​so that only the ones that are entered are updated. 00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.830 align:start position:0% we will filter the values ​​so that only the ones that are entered are updated. Then, we 00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0% Then, we 00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.909 align:start position:0% Then, we need to convert the data in the sheet to the JSON format. 00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:45.919 align:start position:0% need to convert the data in the sheet to the JSON format. 00:25:45.919 --> 00:25:48.070 align:start position:0% need to convert the data in the sheet to the JSON format. When converting, click the icon and 00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080 align:start position:0% When converting, click the icon and 00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.870 align:start position:0% When converting, click the icon and set the data structure. 00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:49.880 align:start position:0% set the data structure. 00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.070 align:start position:0% set the data structure. Then, Here, 00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0% Then, Here, 00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.070 align:start position:0% Then, Here, if I want to put in a channel ID, I can 00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.080 align:start position:0% if I want to put in a channel ID, I can 00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.029 align:start position:0% if I want to put in a channel ID, I can put the name as channel ID and 00:25:56.029 --> 00:25:57.789 align:start position:0% put the name as channel ID and 00:25:57.789 --> 00:25:57.799 align:start position:0% 00:25:57.799 --> 00:25:59.830 align:start position:0% decide whether the type should be text or something else. And 00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0% decide whether the type should be text or something else. And 00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.710 align:start position:0% decide whether the type should be text or something else. And whether it's a required value or a 00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:01.720 align:start position:0% whether it's a required value or a 00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.710 align:start position:0% whether it's a required value or a line break, you can specify all the values ​​you 00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720 align:start position:0% line break, you can specify all the values ​​you 00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.990 align:start position:0% line break, you can specify all the values ​​you want to put in the ad item like this. 00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:08.190 align:start position:0% want to put in the ad item like this. 00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:08.200 align:start position:0% 00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.190 align:start position:0% I created it in advance. I'll 00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:10.200 align:start position:0% I created it in advance. I'll 00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.070 align:start position:0% I created it in advance. I'll show you what it was created. If you look at it, you can see the 00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0% show you what it was created. If you look at it, you can see the 00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.630 align:start position:0% show you what it was created. If you look at it, you can see the channel ID, video ID, title, 00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640 align:start position:0% channel ID, video ID, title, 00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.590 align:start position:0% channel ID, video ID, title, description, category ID, 00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:16.600 align:start position:0% description, category ID, 00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.830 align:start position:0% description, category ID, duration, views, 00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0% duration, views, 00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.549 align:start position:0% duration, views, subscriptions, likes, com, 00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0% subscriptions, likes, com, 00:26:19.559 --> 00:26:21.470 align:start position:0% subscriptions, likes, com, and normaliz views and 00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0% and normaliz views and 00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.029 align:start position:0% and normaliz views and engagement. I 00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0% engagement. I 00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:24.590 align:start position:0% engagement. I created combine text. What I'd 00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0% created combine text. What I'd 00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.950 align:start position:0% created combine text. What I'd like to explain here is the no-rae 00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0% like to explain here is the no-rae 00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.389 align:start position:0% like to explain here is the no-rae view and the Jimen score. In fact, if you have 00:26:29.389 --> 00:26:29.399 align:start position:0% view and the Jimen score. In fact, if you have 00:26:29.399 --> 00:26:32.310 align:start position:0% view and the Jimen score. In fact, if you have more subscribers, you'll 00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.320 align:start position:0% more subscribers, you'll 00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.389 align:start position:0% more subscribers, you'll usually get a lot of views. So you can 00:26:34.389 --> 00:26:36.549 align:start position:0% usually get a lot of views. So you can 00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559 align:start position:0% 00:26:36.559 --> 00:26:38.149 align:start position:0% think of it as a value that adjusts the number of views to the number of subscribers. So 00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0% think of it as a value that adjusts the number of views to the number of subscribers. So 00:26:38.159 --> 00:26:40.110 align:start position:0% think of it as a value that adjusts the number of views to the number of subscribers. So even if the number of views is relatively low, you can 00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.669 align:start position:0% even if the number of views is relatively low, you can 00:26:42.669 --> 00:26:44.870 align:start position:0% 00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0% 00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.269 align:start position:0% think of it as an indicator that helps you evaluate the performance of a channel with few subscribers. The engagement 00:26:46.269 --> 00:26:46.279 align:start position:0% think of it as an indicator that helps you evaluate the performance of a channel with few subscribers. The engagement 00:26:46.279 --> 00:26:47.990 align:start position:0% think of it as an indicator that helps you evaluate the performance of a channel with few subscribers. The engagement score is also 00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0% score is also 00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.310 align:start position:0% score is also scored by referring to comments and likes. 00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:start position:0% scored by referring to comments and likes. 00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.070 align:start position:0% scored by referring to comments and likes. But even then, the score was given by 00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0% But even then, the score was given by 00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.430 align:start position:0% But even then, the score was given by considering the number of subscribers. 00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:54.440 align:start position:0% considering the number of subscribers. 00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.909 align:start position:0% considering the number of subscribers. And lastly, 00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0% And lastly, 00:26:55.919 --> 00:26:58.230 align:start position:0% And lastly, There's something called combined text. What this is is, 00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0% There's something called combined text. What this is is, 00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.990 align:start position:0% There's something called combined text. What this is is, all the values ​​we put in before, and 00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0% all the values ​​we put in before, and 00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.710 align:start position:0% all the values ​​we put in before, and this is a text that combines them into one. 00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:01.720 align:start position:0% this is a text that combines them into one. 00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.870 align:start position:0% this is a text that combines them into one. This is also for AI vector 00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:03.880 align:start position:0% This is also for AI vector 00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.430 align:start position:0% This is also for AI vector db's related information, so that it can be 00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:06.440 align:start position:0% db's related information, so that it can be 00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.510 align:start position:0% db's related information, so that it can be found more easily. One column 00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0% found more easily. One column 00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.029 align:start position:0% found more easily. One column simply combines all the values. 00:27:10.029 --> 00:27:10.039 align:start position:0% simply combines all the values. 00:27:10.039 --> 00:27:11.750 align:start position:0% simply combines all the values. So I set that value. 00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0% So I set that value. 00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.269 align:start position:0% So I set that value. So now let's set it like this and 00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:13.279 align:start position:0% So now let's set it like this and 00:27:13.279 --> 00:27:15.389 align:start position:0% So now let's set it like this and put the actual value in here. 00:27:15.389 --> 00:27:15.399 align:start position:0% put the actual value in here. 00:27:15.399 --> 00:27:17.430 align:start position:0% put the actual value in here. Channel ID, channel ID, 00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0% Channel ID, channel ID, 00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.630 align:start position:0% Channel ID, channel ID, video video ID, title, 00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:19.640 align:start position:0% video video ID, title, 00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.190 align:start position:0% video video ID, title, title, description. Now, the 00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:22.200 align:start position:0% title, description. Now, the 00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.310 align:start position:0% title, description. Now, the tag tag is just a single 00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0% tag tag is just a single 00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.830 align:start position:0% tag tag is just a single string with a text value. Since 00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0% string with a text value. Since 00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.590 align:start position:0% string with a text value. Since this tag was 00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0% this tag was 00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.190 align:start position:0% this tag was created as an array type, we 00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.200 align:start position:0% created as an array type, we 00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.870 align:start position:0% created as an array type, we need to convert it to an array type. 00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0% need to convert it to an array type. 00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.710 align:start position:0% need to convert it to an array type. If you split it, it 00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:32.720 align:start position:0% If you split it, it 00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.669 align:start position:0% If you split it, it will be converted to an array type. So since it's separated by a comma, if you 00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:36.470 align:start position:0% will be converted to an array type. So since it's separated by a comma, if you 00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0% 00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.590 align:start position:0% separate it with a comma and a space, it will be 00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:40.509 align:start position:0% separate it with a comma and a space, it will be 00:27:40.509 --> 00:27:40.519 align:start position:0% 00:27:40.519 --> 00:27:42.870 align:start position:0% automatically converted to an array separated by a comma. I 00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0% automatically converted to an array separated by a comma. I 00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.389 align:start position:0% automatically converted to an array separated by a comma. I 'll specify the rest. Then, 00:27:44.389 --> 00:27:44.399 align:start position:0% 'll specify the rest. Then, 00:27:44.399 --> 00:27:46.669 align:start position:0% 'll specify the rest. Then, at the end, you can put the combined text. 00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0% at the end, you can put the combined text. 00:27:46.679 --> 00:27:48.509 align:start position:0% at the end, you can put the combined text. And for this Jason 00:27:48.509 --> 00:27:48.519 align:start position:0% And for this Jason 00:27:48.519 --> 00:27:51.590 align:start position:0% And for this Jason format, I'll make the indentation two spaces so that it looks better. 00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:53.310 align:start position:0% format, I'll make the indentation two spaces so that it looks better. 00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:53.320 align:start position:0% 00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.149 align:start position:0% Okay. This is how I created the Jason format. I'll 00:27:55.149 --> 00:27:56.789 align:start position:0% Okay. This is how I created the Jason format. I'll 00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0% 00:27:56.799 --> 00:27:58.669 align:start position:0% test it out. If you look at it, you 00:27:58.669 --> 00:28:00.990 align:start position:0% test it out. If you look at it, you 00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:01.000 align:start position:0% 00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.830 align:start position:0% can see that it's organized well as a Jason string and extracted. Now, I 00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:05.310 align:start position:0% can see that it's organized well as a Jason string and extracted. Now, I 00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:05.320 align:start position:0% 00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.269 align:start position:0% have to update the vector DB. To update it, you 00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:09.149 align:start position:0% have to update the vector DB. To update it, you 00:28:09.149 --> 00:28:09.159 align:start position:0% 00:28:09.159 --> 00:28:10.870 align:start position:0% have to upload the file to the Open AI server. So, 00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0% have to upload the file to the Open AI server. So, 00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.830 align:start position:0% have to upload the file to the Open AI server. So, there's something called an Open AI upload file. 00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:12.840 align:start position:0% there's something called an Open AI upload file. 00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.789 align:start position:0% there's something called an Open AI upload file.

You can set that task. 00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0% You can set that task. 00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.789 align:start position:0% You can set that task. Just map this appropriately. 00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:02.549 align:start position:0% Just map this appropriately. 00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:02.559 align:start position:0% 00:29:02.559 --> 00:29:04.630 align:start position:0% Let's run this. 00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0% Let's run this. 00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.430 align:start position:0% Let's run this. If you look at the YouTube metadata in the storage, there's only the guideline document. 00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:08.710 align:start position:0% If you look at the YouTube metadata in the storage, there's only the guideline document. 00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0% 00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.430 align:start position:0% Let's update it once. 00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:10.440 align:start position:0% Let's update it once. 00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.110 align:start position:0% Let's update it once. Then, since the limit is set to two, only 00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.120 align:start position:0% Then, since the limit is set to two, only 00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.430 align:start position:0% Then, since the limit is set to two, only two files will be 00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0% two files will be 00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.789 align:start position:0% two files will be updated. Two 00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0% updated. Two 00:29:14.799 --> 00:29:16.590 align:start position:0% updated. Two have been updated. Two have entered the sheet like this. If you 00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.789 align:start position:0% have been updated. Two have entered the sheet like this. If you 00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0% 00:29:18.799 --> 00:29:20.470 align:start position:0% refresh the storage like this, two videos have 00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:20.480 align:start position:0% refresh the storage like this, two videos have 00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.230 align:start position:0% refresh the storage like this, two videos have entered. So you 00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0% entered. So you 00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.549 align:start position:0% entered. So you can see that it's being collected well. Now, there 00:29:23.549 --> 00:29:23.559 align:start position:0% can see that it's being collected well. Now, there 00:29:23.559 --> 00:29:25.830 align:start position:0% can see that it's being collected well. Now, there are 30 videos here, 00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0% are 30 videos here, 00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.110 align:start position:0% are 30 videos here, so let's update all of them with a limit of 30. Since the 00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:29.669 align:start position:0% so let's update all of them with a limit of 30. Since the 00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679 align:start position:0% 00:29:29.679 --> 00:29:32.430 align:start position:0% header here is A1, it doesn't recognize the A column and 00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:32.440 align:start position:0% header here is A1, it doesn't recognize the A column and 00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.549 align:start position:0% header here is A1, it doesn't recognize the A column and B 1 well, 00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:37.470 align:start position:0% B 1 well, 00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:37.480 align:start position:0% 00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.950 align:start position:0% so let's set it to the B1 header. Now, merge the video IDs 00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0% so let's set it to the B1 header. Now, merge the video IDs 00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.990 align:start position:0% so let's set it to the B1 header. Now, merge the video IDs into an array. So 00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0% into an array. So 00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.590 align:start position:0% into an array. So set it like this. And 00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0% set it like this. And 00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.310 align:start position:0% set it like this. And modify this so that the row value in the filter array 00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0% modify this so that the row value in the filter array 00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.549 align:start position:0% modify this so that the row value in the filter array is 0. So, 00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0% is 0. So, 00:29:49.559 --> 00:29:51.830 align:start position:0% is 0. So, with 0, only two files 00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0% with 0, only two files 00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.990 align:start position:0% with 0, only two files are updated. 00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0% are updated. 00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.350 align:start position:0% are updated. Let's update the rest. If you 00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0% Let's update the rest. If you 00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.950 align:start position:0% Let's update the rest. If you run it like this, two You 00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0% run it like this, two You 00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.149 align:start position:0% run it like this, two You 've already updated it, so I passed the 00:29:59.149 --> 00:29:59.159 align:start position:0% 've already updated it, so I passed the 00:29:59.159 --> 00:30:01.310 align:start position:0% 've already updated it, so I passed the first two because they are duplicates, and I'm going to 00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:03.310 align:start position:0% first two because they are duplicates, and I'm going to 00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:03.320 align:start position:0% 00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.350 align:start position:0% start updating the rest. This 00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0% start updating the rest. This 00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.389 align:start position:0% start updating the rest. This update is complete, and if you refresh the storage, you 00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:09.830 align:start position:0% update is complete, and if you refresh the storage, you 00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0% 00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.350 align:start position:0% can see that the videos have been added. We've now 00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.710 align:start position:0% can see that the videos have been added. We've now 00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:13.720 align:start position:0% 00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.789 align:start position:0% created something that automatically updates vector TV data. So 00:30:15.789 --> 00:30:18.230 align:start position:0% created something that automatically updates vector TV data. So 00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:20.029 align:start position:0% 00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0% 00:30:20.039 --> 00:30:21.990 align:start position:0% let's create actual metadata based on the sound data and receive it. Let's create one more scenario. 00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0% let's create actual metadata based on the sound data and receive it. Let's create one more scenario. 00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.990 align:start position:0% let's create actual metadata based on the sound data and receive it. Let's create one more scenario. Now, let's create metadata. 00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.000 align:start position:0% Now, let's create metadata. 00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.549 align:start position:0% Now, let's create metadata. Usually, 00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:25.559 align:start position:0% Usually, 00:30:25.559 --> 00:30:28.149 align:start position:0% Usually, when using an assistant, it's convenient to connect a specific tool and 00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0% when using an assistant, it's convenient to connect a specific tool and 00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:30.310 align:start position:0% when using an assistant, it's convenient to connect a specific tool and send a request. 00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0% send a request. 00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:32.389 align:start position:0% send a request. When we created the meeting minutes earlier, we used Notion, but 00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0% When we created the meeting minutes earlier, we used Notion, but 00:30:32.399 --> 00:30:34.190 align:start position:0% When we created the meeting minutes earlier, we used Notion, but this time, we'll use Slack. The 00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:34.200 align:start position:0% this time, we'll use Slack. The 00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.350 align:start position:0% this time, we'll use Slack. The most used Slack module 00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:38.190 align:start position:0% most used Slack module 00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:38.200 align:start position:0% 00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.630 align:start position:0% is Watch New, as you can see below.

Among them, I 00:31:06.629 --> 00:31:06.639 align:start position:0% appear. Among them, I 00:31:06.639 --> 00:31:08.430 align:start position:0% appear. Among them, I created a channel called AI YouTube Metadata. 00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:08.440 align:start position:0% created a channel called AI YouTube Metadata. 00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.549 align:start position:0% created a channel called AI YouTube Metadata. Here, when I throw a YouTube topic in a Slack message, the 00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0% Here, when I throw a YouTube topic in a Slack message, the 00:31:10.559 --> 00:31:13.029 align:start position:0% Here, when I throw a YouTube topic in a Slack message, the Choi PT 00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:13.039 align:start position:0% Choi PT 00:31:13.039 --> 00:31:14.909 align:start position:0% Choi PT Assistant receives it and 00:31:14.909 --> 00:31:14.919 align:start position:0% Assistant receives it and 00:31:14.919 --> 00:31:16.870 align:start position:0% Assistant receives it and recommends video metadata. 00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0% recommends video metadata. 00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.230 align:start position:0% recommends video metadata. Let's implement it 00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0% Let's implement it 00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.269 align:start position:0% Let's implement it this way. Let's run Web 6 and 00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:20.279 align:start position:0% this way. Let's run Web 6 and 00:31:20.279 --> 00:31:21.710 align:start position:0% this way. Let's run Web 6 and send another message. When I 00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0% send another message. When I 00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.710 align:start position:0% send another message. When I send a message, it will be 00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:23.720 align:start position:0% send a message, it will be 00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.830 align:start position:0% send a message, it will be received like this. This is a test message. You 00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0% received like this. This is a test message. You 00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.350 align:start position:0% received like this. This is a test message. You can see that the value is being received properly. 00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0% can see that the value is being received properly. 00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.909 align:start position:0% can see that the value is being received properly. So now the connection is successful. 00:31:28.909 --> 00:31:28.919 align:start position:0% So now the connection is successful. 00:31:28.919 --> 00:31:31.470 align:start position:0% So now the connection is successful. Then, we can receive this data and 00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:31.480 align:start position:0% Then, we can receive this data and 00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.669 align:start position:0% Then, we can receive this data and run the assistant. Let's create a message assistant again. 00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:35.110 align:start position:0% run the assistant. Let's create a message assistant again. 00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0% 00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.470 align:start position:0% We will go into the project we created, 00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:37.480 align:start position:0% We will go into the project we created, 00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.669 align:start position:0% We will go into the project we created, set the assistant settings, and 00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0% set the assistant settings, and 00:31:39.679 --> 00:31:41.590 align:start position:0% set the assistant settings, and enter a prompt. Here, the prompt is to 00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:43.470 align:start position:0% enter a prompt. Here, the prompt is to 00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:43.480 align:start position:0% 00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.310 align:start position:0% simply write the metadata in Korean. 00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:45.320 align:start position:0% simply write the metadata in Korean. 00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.029 align:start position:0% simply write the metadata in Korean. Next, I set it to respond only in the JSON format, like this, for the JSON file. 00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:48.950 align:start position:0% Next, I set it to respond only in the JSON format, like this, for the JSON file. 00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0% 00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.549 align:start position:0% And I will also set the tool choice 00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:50.559 align:start position:0% And I will also set the tool choice 00:31:50.559 --> 00:31:52.269 align:start position:0% And I will also set the tool choice to just file search. But you 00:31:52.269 --> 00:31:52.279 align:start position:0% to just file search. But you 00:31:52.279 --> 00:31:54.269 align:start position:0% to just file search. But you shouldn't always run this. If you 00:31:54.269 --> 00:31:54.279 align:start position:0% shouldn't always run this. If you 00:31:54.279 --> 00:31:56.509 align:start position:0% shouldn't always run this. If you think about it, if you run every message that comes in here, the 00:31:56.509 --> 00:31:58.549 align:start position:0% think about it, if you run every message that comes in here, the 00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0% 00:31:58.559 --> 00:32:00.750 align:start position:0% assistant will 00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:00.760 align:start position:0% assistant will 00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.110 align:start position:0% assistant will keep calling the API code for things that aren't YouTube topics. 00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0% keep calling the API code for things that aren't YouTube topics. 00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.990 align:start position:0% keep calling the API code for things that aren't YouTube topics. Okay, so it's a waste, so let's set a rule. 00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:06.710 align:start position:0% Okay, so it's a waste, so let's set a rule. 00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:08.870 align:start position:0% 00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:10.549 align:start position:0% 00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0% 00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:12.070 align:start position:0% I think it would be good to filter it so that the assistant runs only when the value of 00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:14.310 align:start position:0% I think it would be good to filter it so that the assistant runs only when the value of 00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0% 00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.310 align:start position:0% YouTube topic is entered. So, let's set a filter so that the topic keyword check runs the assistant only when the value of YouTube topic 땡땡요 is entered in this text value. 00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:19.269 align:start position:0% YouTube topic is entered. So, let's set a filter so that the topic keyword check runs the assistant only when the value of YouTube topic 땡땡요 is entered in this text value. 00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:20.950 align:start position:0% 00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0% 00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.830 align:start position:0% And when the assistant is run, it 00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:25.389 align:start position:0% And when the assistant is run, it 00:32:25.389 --> 00:32:25.399 align:start position:0% 00:32:25.399 --> 00:32:27.870 align:start position:0% will output in the JSON file format. We will parse it into a JSON value. 00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:27.880 align:start position:0% will output in the JSON file format. We will parse it into a JSON value. 00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.389 align:start position:0% will output in the JSON file format. We will parse it into a JSON value. Parsing this 00:32:29.389 --> 00:32:31.350 align:start position:0% Parsing this 00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:31.360 align:start position:0% 00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.029 align:start position:0% means that it will be separated so that we can use it well. Then, we 00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0% means that it will be separated so that we can use it well. Then, we 00:32:33.039 --> 00:32:35.070 align:start position:0% means that it will be separated so that we can use it well. Then, we need to send a message again in Slack. 00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:35.080 align:start position:0% need to send a message again in Slack. 00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.029 align:start position:0% need to send a message again in Slack. So, 00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:39.590 align:start position:0% So, 00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.710 align:start position:0% 00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:41.720 align:start position:0% 00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.430 align:start position:0% let's send a message to the comment thread here if there is a message in the channel. To do that, you need to 00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0% let's send a message to the comment thread here if there is a message in the channel. To do that, you need to 00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.950 align:start position:0% let's send a message to the comment thread here if there is a message in the channel. To do that, you need to create a connection first. I 00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0% create a connection first. I 00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.310 align:start position:0% create a connection first. I will select the connection as Bo. This is because this 00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:47.320 align:start position:0% will select the connection as Bo. This is because this 00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.430 align:start position:0% will select the connection as Bo. This is because this answer is not given by a specific individual. 00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:51.590 align:start position:0% answer is not given by a specific individual. 00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0% 00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.750 align:start position:0% There is a separate bot that generates this video metadata. If the bot 00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0% There is a separate bot that generates this video metadata. If the bot 00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.870 align:start position:0% There is a separate bot that generates this video metadata. If the bot answers, it will be natural. So, I will 00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:55.880 align:start position:0% answers, it will be natural. So, I will 00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.830 align:start position:0% answers, it will be natural. So, I will set up the bot. To set up the bot, 00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0% set up the bot. To set up the bot, 00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.470 align:start position:0% set up the bot. To set up the bot, click like this. It will 00:32:59.470 --> 00:32:59.480 align:start position:0% click like this. It will 00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.029 align:start position:0% click like this. It will create a bot connection. Here, if you 00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:02.029 align:start position:0% create a bot connection. Here, if you 00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0% 00:33:02.039 --> 00:33:04.110 align:start position:0% look at show adv settings, you will see that the client ID and client secret are 00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:04.120 align:start position:0% look at show adv settings, you will see that the client ID and client secret are 00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.669 align:start position:0% look at show adv settings, you will see that the client ID and client secret are derived from the bot. First, you need to create the information transaction Z Bo. To 00:33:06.669 --> 00:33:08.750 align:start position:0% derived from the bot. First, you need to create the information transaction Z Bo. To 00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:08.760 align:start position:0% 00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.190 align:start position:0% create a bot, 00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0% create a bot, 00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.950 align:start position:0% create a bot, go to api.slack.com, 00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:11.960 align:start position:0% go to api.slack.com, 00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.870 align:start position:0% go to api.slack.com, go to your apps, and 00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:13.880 align:start position:0% go to your apps, and 00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.110 align:start position:0% go to your apps, and create a new app. 00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0% create a new app. 00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.830 align:start position:0% create a new app. From scch, set the app name here.

Let's do one more. We recently 00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0% Let's do one more. We recently 00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.670 align:start position:0% Let's do one more. We recently released Claude 3.7 Sonai. So I'll 00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0% released Claude 3.7 Sonai. So I'll 00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.950 align:start position:0% released Claude 3.7 Sonai. So I'll throw it out as a topic related to that. 00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:45.960 align:start position:0% throw it out as a topic related to that. 00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.829 align:start position:0% throw it out as a topic related to that. 00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0% 00:36:47.839 --> 00:36:50.349 align:start position:0% Then, there were comments, and you 00:36:50.349 --> 00:36:52.670 align:start position:0% Then, there were comments, and you 00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:55.270 align:start position:0% 00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0% 00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.550 align:start position:0% can see that they recommend video titles and video description tags. But here, the 00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:57.560 align:start position:0% can see that they recommend video titles and video description tags. But here, the 00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.990 align:start position:0% can see that they recommend video titles and video description tags. But here, the title is too simple, or the video 00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0% title is too simple, or the video 00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.069 align:start position:0% title is too simple, or the video description is too short, or the tags are 00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0% description is too short, or the tags are 00:37:02.079 --> 00:37:03.910 align:start position:0% description is too short, or the tags are There are 15, but if you want to recommend about 30, 00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:06.030 align:start position:0% There are 15, but if you want to recommend about 30, 00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:08.349 align:start position:0% 00:37:08.349 --> 00:37:08.359 align:start position:0% 00:37:08.359 --> 00:37:10.510 align:start position:0% you can change the instruction value in the assistant that I previously set up. If you 00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:10.520 align:start position:0% you can change the instruction value in the assistant that I previously set up. If you 00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.630 align:start position:0% you can change the instruction value in the assistant that I previously set up. If you don't like the result, you can modify it 00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640 align:start position:0% don't like the result, you can modify it 00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.470 align:start position:0% don't like the result, you can modify it in detail. You can make it the 00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0% in detail. You can make it the 00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.910 align:start position:0% in detail. You can make it the style you want by tuning it. 00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:16.920 align:start position:0% style you want by tuning it. 00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.470 align:start position:0% style you want by tuning it. However, this 00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0% However, this 00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.030 align:start position:0% However, this assistant has an API limit. 00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0% assistant has an API limit. 00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.309 align:start position:0% assistant has an API limit. So if you request too many characters at once, you 00:37:23.309 --> 00:37:23.319 align:start position:0% So if you request too many characters at once, you 00:37:23.319 --> 00:37:25.349 align:start position:0% So if you request too many characters at once, you may reach the limit. 00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0% may reach the limit. 00:37:25.359 --> 00:37:27.109 align:start position:0% may reach the limit. In particular, in the case of this video description, you 00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0% In particular, in the case of this video description, you 00:37:27.119 --> 00:37:29.349 align:start position:0% In particular, in the case of this video description, you may write it infinitely long. 00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:29.359 align:start position:0% may write it infinitely long. 00:37:29.359 --> 00:37:31.309 align:start position:0% may write it infinitely long. That's why I 00:37:31.309 --> 00:37:31.319 align:start position:0% That's why I 00:37:31.319 --> 00:37:33.510 align:start position:0% That's why I made it short on purpose, but if you 00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0% made it short on purpose, but if you 00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.750 align:start position:0% made it short on purpose, but if you set it long, you may reach the limit. 00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0% set it long, you may reach the limit. 00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.510 align:start position:0% set it long, you may reach the limit. So in that case, 00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0% So in that case, 00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.870 align:start position:0% So in that case, there are two ways. One is, you 00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:42.309 align:start position:0% there are two ways. One is, you 00:37:42.309 --> 00:37:42.319 align:start position:0% 00:37:42.319 --> 00:37:44.190 align:start position:0% may receive only one or two recommendations instead of three. 00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:44.200 align:start position:0% may receive only one or two recommendations instead of three. 00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.829 align:start position:0% may receive only one or two recommendations instead of three.

It 00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:04.440 align:start position:0% video description will be based on that reply. It 00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.390 align:start position:0% video description will be based on that reply. It recommends three more for number 1, and if you 00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0% recommends three more for number 1, and if you 00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.430 align:start position:0% recommends three more for number 1, and if you choose one of them, it 00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:08.440 align:start position:0% choose one of them, it 00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.309 align:start position:0% choose one of them, it recommends another tag for that number. You can also 00:38:10.309 --> 00:38:10.319 align:start position:0% recommends another tag for that number.
