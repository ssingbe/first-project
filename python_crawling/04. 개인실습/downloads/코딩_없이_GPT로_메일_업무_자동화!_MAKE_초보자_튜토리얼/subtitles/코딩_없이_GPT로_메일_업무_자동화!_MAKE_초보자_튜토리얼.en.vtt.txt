Then, when the button is checked, I'm going to try to automate the process of retrieving the 00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759 align:start position:0% when the button is checked, I'm going to try to automate the process of retrieving the 00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:59.550 align:start position:0% when the button is checked, I'm going to try to automate the process of retrieving the information of the completed row and 00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 align:start position:0% information of the completed row and 00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.270 align:start position:0% information of the completed row and sending it to Gmail. 00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.670 align:start position:0% sending it to Gmail. 00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 align:start position:0% 00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.510 align:start position:0% When the Gmail transmission is completed, I want to be able to see at a 00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 align:start position:0% When the Gmail transmission is completed, I want to be able to see at a 00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.550 align:start position:0% When the Gmail transmission is completed, I want to be able to see at a glance whether the email was properly sent on the sheet. 00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0% glance whether the email was properly sent on the sheet. 00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.990 align:start position:0% glance whether the email was properly sent on the sheet. So, let's create an automation process by dividing it into two steps in the form of 00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 align:start position:0% So, let's create an automation process by dividing it into two steps in the form of 00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.029 align:start position:0% So, let's create an automation process by dividing it into two steps in the form of updating the sheet again whether the transfer was completed. 00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:11.990 align:start position:0% updating the sheet again whether the transfer was completed. 00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.029 align:start position:0% 00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 align:start position:0% 00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:15.550 align:start position:0% Now, 00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.309 align:start position:0% Now, 00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:19.510 align:start position:0% 00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520 align:start position:0% 00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.350 align:start position:0% let's build a process to write an email draft according to this flow. The 00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0% let's build a process to write an email draft according to this flow. The 00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.390 align:start position:0% let's build a process to write an email draft according to this flow. The first thing to do to write an email draft is to retrieve the sheet containing the new row information. 00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 align:start position:0% first thing to do to write an email draft is to retrieve the sheet containing the new row information. 00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.189 align:start position:0% first thing to do to write an email draft is to retrieve the sheet containing the new row information. So, you need to 00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0% So, you need to 00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:26.710 align:start position:0% So, you need to configure the sheet first. 00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 align:start position:0% configure the sheet first. 00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.029 align:start position:0% configure the sheet first. So, I've created a sheet like this as an example. 00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0% So, I've created a sheet like this as an example. 00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:31.550 align:start position:0% So, I've created a sheet like this as an example. In this exercise, I'll assume that I'm the 00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560 align:start position:0% In this exercise, I'll assume that I'm the 00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.909 align:start position:0% In this exercise, I'll assume that I'm the owner of a ramen restaurant called Mr. Gu Ramen. Let's 00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:35.830 align:start position:0% owner of a ramen restaurant called Mr. Gu Ramen. Let's 00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.270 align:start position:0% 00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.189 align:start position:0% 00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:41.749 align:start position:0% 00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0% 00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:43.189 align:start position:0% assume that I want to automate the process of limiting marketing by contacting various influencers to promote this ramen. In that case, I 00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:44.990 align:start position:0% assume that I want to automate the process of limiting marketing by contacting various influencers to promote this ramen. In that case, I 00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000 align:start position:0% 00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.029 align:start position:0% 'll have to enter the creators' emails, and then I'll organize the influencer's channel 00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0% 'll have to enter the creators' emails, and then I'll organize the influencer's channel 00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:49.149 align:start position:0% 'll have to enter the creators' emails, and then I'll organize the influencer's channel name and platform channel link 00:07:49.149 --> 00:07:49.159 align:start position:0% name and platform channel link 00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:51.430 align:start position:0% name and platform channel link information. 00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.440 align:start position:0% information. 00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.029 align:start position:0% information. Based on that information, I'll write the subject and body of the email. 00:07:54.029 --> 00:07:54.039 align:start position:0% Based on that information, I'll write the subject and body of the email. 00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:55.670 align:start position:0% Based on that information, I'll write the subject and body of the email. And there, I'll edit the 00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0% And there, I'll edit the 00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.110 align:start position:0% And there, I'll edit the information that I want to edit. If there is, 00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0% information that I want to edit. If there is, 00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.950 align:start position:0% information that I want to edit. If there is, modify it and then check the checkbox for mail check. 00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.110 align:start position:0% modify it and then check the checkbox for mail check. 00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120 align:start position:0% 00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.909 align:start position:0% Then, check it. Then, we will create a process that can send the mail. 00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:04.749 align:start position:0% Then, check it. Then, we will create a process that can send the mail. 00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:04.759 align:start position:0% 00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:07.270 align:start position:0% When the mail is sent, mark it as Yes in the mail send. 00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:09.390 align:start position:0% When the mail is sent, mark it as Yes in the mail send. 00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:09.400 align:start position:0% 00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.390 align:start position:0% So, as an example, I 00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.400 align:start position:0% So, as an example, I 00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.830 align:start position:0% So, as an example, I filled in one row first. Then, we need to create a module to check if 00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840 align:start position:0% filled in one row first. Then, we need to create a module to check if 00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.469 align:start position:0% filled in one row first. Then, we need to create a module to check if it can be loaded properly by entering the Make. 00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:16.189 align:start position:0% it can be loaded properly by entering the Make. 00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0% 00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:18.390 align:start position:0% Select the sheet module. 00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:18.400 align:start position:0% Select the sheet module. 00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.270 align:start position:0% Select the sheet module. Then, 00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0% Then, 00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.469 align:start position:0% Then, select the option called Watch New Rose and set an action to monitor when a new row is added. If you have 00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:24.430 align:start position:0% select the option called Watch New Rose and set an action to monitor when a new row is added. If you have 00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.309 align:start position:0% 00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:26.319 align:start position:0% 00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:28.350 align:start position:0% not connected an account at first, 00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.469 align:start position:0% not connected an account at first, 00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0% 00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:31.990 align:start position:0% you can connect your account with Sign with Google. 00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0% you can connect your account with Sign with Google. 00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.469 align:start position:0% you can connect your account with Sign with Google. Once connected, you can find the sheet I created by starting 00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:34.479 align:start position:0% Once connected, you can find the sheet I created by starting 00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:36.709 align:start position:0% Once connected, you can find the sheet I created by starting with the sheet ID. 00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0% with the sheet ID. 00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:38.269 align:start position:0% with the sheet ID. This is how I created the outbound mail 00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:38.279 align:start position:0% This is how I created the outbound mail 00:08:38.279 --> 00:08:40.509 align:start position:0% This is how I created the outbound mail automation line sheet. In it, 00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:40.519 align:start position:0% automation line sheet. In it, 00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:42.670 align:start position:0% automation line sheet. In it, select the worksheet for outbound. There is a 00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:42.680 align:start position:0% select the worksheet for outbound. There is a 00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.910 align:start position:0% select the worksheet for outbound. There is a header designation. 00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:44.920 align:start position:0% header designation. 00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.550 align:start position:0% header designation. We use A1 ES H1. 00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:47.560 align:start position:0% We use A1 ES H1. 00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.750 align:start position:0% We use A1 ES H1. Since it is the first action anyway, you 00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.670 align:start position:0% Since it is the first action anyway, you 00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0% 00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.750 align:start position:0% can use the default value that is set. Now, the limit is important. 00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0% can use the default value that is set. Now, the limit is important. 00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.110 align:start position:0% can use the default value that is set. Now, the limit is important. What is the limit? Once we set the trigger and it is 00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:56.120 align:start position:0% What is the limit? Once we set the trigger and it is 00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.389 align:start position:0% What is the limit? Once we set the trigger and it is executed, we want to get a certain number of 00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:58.399 align:start position:0% executed, we want to get a certain number of 00:08:58.399 --> 00:09:00.430 align:start position:0% executed, we want to get a certain number of new rows. This 00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:00.440 align:start position:0% new rows. This 00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.430 align:start position:0% new rows. This is an option to decide whether to perform the task. For example, if 00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:02.440 align:start position:0% is an option to decide whether to perform the task. For example, if 00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.389 align:start position:0% is an option to decide whether to perform the task. For example, if we added a new row before the new trigger, if we 00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:06.750 align:start position:0% we added a new row before the new trigger, if we 00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:06.760 align:start position:0% 00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.670 align:start position:0% set it to 2, only two of them will be 00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:08.680 align:start position:0% set it to 2, only two of them will be 00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.990 align:start position:0% set it to 2, only two of them will be retrieved and worked on first. 00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0% retrieved and worked on first. 00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.829 align:start position:0% retrieved and worked on first. And then two more will be 00:09:11.829 --> 00:09:11.839 align:start position:0% And then two more will be 00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:13.350 align:start position:0% And then two more will be worked on later in the next trigger. The 00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.990 align:start position:0% worked on later in the next trigger. The 00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0% 00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.030 align:start position:0% reason for setting a limit like this is that when we add a new row and 00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0% reason for setting a limit like this is that when we add a new row and 00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.110 align:start position:0% reason for setting a limit like this is that when we add a new row and work on the sheet, the 00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0% work on the sheet, the 00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.150 align:start position:0% work on the sheet, the information may not be complete. 00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.160 align:start position:0% information may not be complete. 00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.030 align:start position:0% information may not be complete. So if we added ten, the ninth and 00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0% So if we added ten, the ninth and 00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.110 align:start position:0% So if we added ten, the ninth and tenth rows have 00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.120 align:start position:0% tenth rows have 00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.110 align:start position:0% tenth rows have been added, but the complete information has not been entered yet, and 00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0% been added, but the complete information has not been entered yet, and 00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.030 align:start position:0% been added, but the complete information has not been entered yet, and additional modifications may be made. 00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0% additional modifications may be made. 00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.190 align:start position:0% additional modifications may be made. So 00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0% So 00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.470 align:start position:0% So if you want to divide the work into steps and work on it, you can 00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480 align:start position:0% if you want to divide the work into steps and work on it, you can 00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.389 align:start position:0% if you want to divide the work into steps and work on it, you can set the limit appropriately like this. 00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0% set the limit appropriately like this. 00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:37.069 align:start position:0% set the limit appropriately like this. We will first 00:09:37.069 --> 00:09:37.079 align:start position:0% We will first 00:09:37.079 --> 00:09:39.150 align:start position:0% We will first set it to the default value of 2 and test it. 00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:39.160 align:start position:0% set it to the default value of 2 and test it. 00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.710 align:start position:0% set it to the default value of 2 and test it. Do this. Now, we will 00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.949 align:start position:0% Do this. Now, we will 00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0% 00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:44.509 align:start position:0% first set where to detect the new row. Let's 00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:44.519 align:start position:0% first set where to detect the new row. Let's 00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:46.110 align:start position:0% first set where to detect the new row. Let's just set it to All. 00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:46.120 align:start position:0% just set it to All. 00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.430 align:start position:0% just set it to All.

First, I 00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0% guides. First, I 00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:18.949 align:start position:0% guides. First, I started with the word title and 00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0% started with the word title and 00:13:18.959 --> 00:13:21.949 align:start position:0% started with the word title and wrote the email title. Then, I 00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:21.959 align:start position:0% wrote the email title. Then, I 00:13:21.959 --> 00:13:23.590 align:start position:0% wrote the email title. Then, I wrote the body. Then, I set the content that should be included in the body. 00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:25.350 align:start position:0% wrote the body. Then, I set the content that should be included in the body. 00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0% 00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.949 align:start position:0% Finally, I 00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:29.150 align:start position:0% Finally, I 00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.160 align:start position:0% 00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.150 align:start position:0% set it to write the signature information at the end of the email. After setting it like this, I will 00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:32.949 align:start position:0% set it to write the signature information at the end of the email. After setting it like this, I will 00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0% 00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:34.990 align:start position:0% write the user prompt in Message 2. 00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:35.000 align:start position:0% write the user prompt in Message 2. 00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.310 align:start position:0% write the user prompt in Message 2. Now, I will ask them to write the actual email. 00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0% Now, I will ask them to write the actual email. 00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.150 align:start position:0% Now, I will ask them to write the actual email. So I asked them to write the email. I asked them to 00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:39.160 align:start position:0% So I asked them to write the email. I asked them to 00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.269 align:start position:0% So I asked them to write the email. I asked them to explain the advantages 00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0% explain the advantages 00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.389 align:start position:0% explain the advantages and told them that the influencer's content 00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:43.399 align:start position:0% and told them that the influencer's content 00:13:43.399 --> 00:13:45.110 align:start position:0% and told them that the influencer's content would be a good fit for our product. 00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0% would be a good fit for our product. 00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.069 align:start position:0% would be a good fit for our product. Then, 00:13:47.069 --> 00:13:47.079 align:start position:0% Then, 00:13:47.079 --> 00:13:49.350 align:start position:0% Then, when sending the email, it would be good to refer to the influencer's channel name and channel 00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360 align:start position:0% when sending the email, it would be good to refer to the influencer's channel name and channel 00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.310 align:start position:0% when sending the email, it would be good to refer to the influencer's channel name and channel link. 00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:51.320 align:start position:0% link. 00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.509 align:start position:0% link. So I will name the influencer and give them a name. But the 00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:55.269 align:start position:0% So I will name the influencer and give them a name. But the 00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:55.279 align:start position:0% 00:13:55.279 --> 00:13:57.470 align:start position:0% names will be different for each row imported from this sheet. 00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:57.480 align:start position:0% names will be different for each row imported from this sheet. 00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.670 align:start position:0% names will be different for each row imported from this sheet. So when I enter the message value here, I 00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0% So when I enter the message value here, I 00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.790 align:start position:0% So when I enter the message value here, I can select the value like this. 00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0% can select the value like this. 00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.230 align:start position:0% can select the value like this. Then, for the column values ​​like this. If you 00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0% Then, for the column values ​​like this. If you 00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.069 align:start position:0% Then, for the column values ​​like this. If you hover your mouse over it like this, you 00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:08.710 align:start position:0% hover your mouse over it like this, you 00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0% 00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.030 align:start position:0% can see that this module on the left is throbbing. This 00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0% can see that this module on the left is throbbing. This 00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.110 align:start position:0% can see that this module on the left is throbbing. This means that it is getting the value of the module now. So 00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0% means that it is getting the value of the module now. So 00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.829 align:start position:0% means that it is getting the value of the module now. So the name here is Influencer Citizen Individual 00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0% the name here is Influencer Citizen Individual 00:14:15.839 --> 00:14:17.790 align:start position:0% the name here is Influencer Citizen Individual 9 o'clock. If you can get the value, that 00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:17.800 align:start position:0% 9 o'clock. If you can get the value, that 00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.550 align:start position:0% 9 o'clock. If you can get the value, that will be the name. Next, you 00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:21.430 align:start position:0% will be the name. Next, you 00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0% 00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.269 align:start position:0% will specify the platform for the channel you are running. It will be running a YouTube channel. 00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0% will specify the platform for the channel you are running. It will be running a YouTube channel. 00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:25.590 align:start position:0% will specify the platform for the channel you are running. It will be running a YouTube channel. Next, the channel link. The channel link 00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:25.600 align:start position:0% Next, the channel link. The channel link 00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.310 align:start position:0% Next, the channel link. The channel link value is here. The channel link 00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:27.320 align:start position:0% value is here. The channel link 00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.350 align:start position:0% value is here. The channel link is as follows. So you can set it to write an email with reference to this. 00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:31.030 align:start position:0% is as follows. So you can set it to write an email with reference to this. 00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0% 00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.829 align:start position:0% Then, you can set a different prompt by using the value we brought in from the sheet 00:14:32.829 --> 00:14:32.839 align:start position:0% Then, you can set a different prompt by using the value we brought in from the sheet 00:14:32.839 --> 00:14:35.310 align:start position:0% Then, you can set a different prompt by using the value we brought in from the sheet each time. 00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:35.320 align:start position:0% each time. 00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.829 align:start position:0% each time. So 00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:36.839 align:start position:0% So 00:14:36.839 --> 00:14:38.949 align:start position:0% So set it like this. Max tokens are 00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:38.959 align:start position:0% set it like this. Max tokens are 00:14:38.959 --> 00:14:41.110 align:start position:0% set it like this. Max tokens are how many tokens you want to use at a time when writing an email. You 00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:43.230 align:start position:0% how many tokens you want to use at a time when writing an email. You 00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:43.240 align:start position:0% 00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.509 align:start position:0% can control the amount of email. We will just 00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0% can control the amount of email. We will just 00:14:44.519 --> 00:14:46.550 align:start position:0% can control the amount of email. We will just set it to a generous 4,000. 00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0% set it to a generous 4,000. 00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.629 align:start position:0% set it to a generous 4,000. I set it like this. 00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:50.350 align:start position:0% I set it like this. 00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:50.360 align:start position:0% 00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.189 align:start position:0% After the email is written like this, the 00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0% After the email is written like this, the 00:14:52.199 --> 00:14:54.949 align:start position:0% After the email is written like this, the content of the email needs to be updated in the subject draft in this sheet. 00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:56.829 align:start position:0% content of the email needs to be updated in the subject draft in this sheet. 00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:56.839 align:start position:0% 00:14:56.839 --> 00:14:59.189 align:start position:0% Before updating, let's 00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0% Before updating, let's 00:14:59.199 --> 00:15:00.710 align:start position:0% Before updating, let's test it again to 00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0% test it again to 00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.590 align:start position:0% test it again to see if the email is written properly.

If there is, I 00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519 align:start position:0% If there is, I 00:16:13.519 --> 00:16:15.790 align:start position:0% If there is, I want to get only the main text content, excluding the value. 00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:15.800 align:start position:0% want to get only the main text content, excluding the value. 00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.069 align:start position:0% want to get only the main text content, excluding the value. And in the title, I want to get 00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0% And in the title, I want to get 00:16:18.079 --> 00:16:20.710 align:start position:0% And in the title, I want to get only the actual title, excluding the title value. 00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0% only the actual title, excluding the title value. 00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.230 align:start position:0% only the actual title, excluding the title value. So you have to do that. For that, 00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.110 align:start position:0% So you have to do that. For that, 00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0% 00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.949 align:start position:0% select this and use the formula. 00:16:25.949 --> 00:16:25.959 align:start position:0% select this and use the formula. 00:16:25.959 --> 00:16:27.910 align:start position:0% select this and use the formula. Here, you 00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0% Here, you 00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.949 align:start position:0% Here, you can get answers from the services in the asterisk, and 00:16:29.949 --> 00:16:32.670 align:start position:0% can get answers from the services in the asterisk, and 00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680 align:start position:0% 00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.870 align:start position:0% we can use various functions. Among them, 00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0% we can use various functions. Among them, 00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.350 align:start position:0% we can use various functions. Among them, we are going to 00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0% we are going to 00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.990 align:start position:0% we are going to use the string and index OO among the text-related functions. If you 00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0% use the string and index OO among the text-related functions. If you 00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.230 align:start position:0% use the string and index OO among the text-related functions. If you use a string, you can 00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:45.110 align:start position:0% use a string, you can 00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0% 00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.470 align:start position:0% cut and get only a certain part from the content message. We will 00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:49.389 align:start position:0% cut and get only a certain part from the content message. We will 00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:51.590 align:start position:0% 00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0% 00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.150 align:start position:0% use the index OO to decide where to cut and get from the message. The index OO is the 00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0% use the index OO to decide where to cut and get from the message. The index OO is the 00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.749 align:start position:0% use the index OO to decide where to cut and get from the message. The index OO is the first number value of the index where the main text is inserted. 00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:59.069 align:start position:0% first number value of the index where the main text is inserted. 00:16:59.069 --> 00:16:59.079 align:start position:0% 00:16:59.079 --> 00:17:01.550 align:start position:0% Then, this value will be imported into the content. 00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:01.560 align:start position:0% Then, this value will be imported into the content. 00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.870 align:start position:0% Then, this value will be imported into the content. But in that case, the values ​​after that 00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:03.880 align:start position:0% But in that case, the values ​​after that 00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.029 align:start position:0% But in that case, the values ​​after that will be included. 00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:06.039 align:start position:0% will be included. 00:17:06.039 --> 00:17:08.069 align:start position:0% will be included. So, one, two, three. There is a asterisk here, but this 00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0% So, one, two, three. There is a asterisk here, but this 00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:10.230 align:start position:0% So, one, two, three. There is a asterisk here, but this asterisk 00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0% asterisk 00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.750 align:start position:0% asterisk may not always be included. 00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0% may not always be included. 00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.669 align:start position:0% may not always be included. So for now, 00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0% So for now, 00:17:13.679 --> 00:17:15.429 align:start position:0% So for now, let's add one or three. Then, add a 00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:15.439 align:start position:0% let's add one or three. Then, add a 00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:17.909 align:start position:0% let's add one or three. Then, add a plus to the index imported into the main text. You ca 00:17:17.909 --> 00:17:17.919 align:start position:0% plus to the index imported into the main text. You ca 00:17:17.919 --> 00:17:19.870 align:start position:0% plus to the index imported into the main text. You ca n't enter text directly, so you 00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:22.189 align:start position:0% n't enter text directly, so you 00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0% 00:17:22.199 --> 00:17:24.110 align:start position:0% have to select it in the math function here. Let's select it and set it as plus 3. I 00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:25.630 align:start position:0% have to select it in the math function here. Let's select it and set it as plus 3. I 00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:25.640 align:start position:0% 00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.750 align:start position:0% created a formula like this. If I explain it, 00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:27.760 align:start position:0% created a formula like this. If I explain it, 00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.990 align:start position:0% created a formula like this. If I explain it, this is the content created by Choi Chi PT, and I 00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:32.270 align:start position:0% this is the content created by Choi Chi PT, and I 00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:32.280 align:start position:0% 00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.350 align:start position:0% want to get only a part of that content, so I get the index value 00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:34.360 align:start position:0% want to get only a part of that content, so I get the index value 00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.830 align:start position:0% want to get only a part of that content, so I get the index value of the value of the body 땡땡 through the index of. 00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:36.840 align:start position:0% of the value of the body 땡땡 through the index of. 00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.510 align:start position:0% of the value of the body 땡땡 through the index of. And 00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520 align:start position:0% And 00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.750 align:start position:0% And this is now three letters, 땡땡가사, so I 00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:40.760 align:start position:0% this is now three letters, 땡땡가사, so I 00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.630 align:start position:0% this is now three letters, 땡땡가사, so I added 3. So I 00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:45.029 align:start position:0% added 3. So I 00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0% 00:17:45.039 --> 00:17:47.070 align:start position:0% made it in a format that only cuts and gets the content after this body 땡땡. I 00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:47.080 align:start position:0% made it in a format that only cuts and gets the content after this body 땡땡. I 00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.870 align:start position:0% made it in a format that only cuts and gets the content after this body 땡땡. I 'll test it like this. 00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880 align:start position:0% 'll test it like this. 00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.669 align:start position:0% 'll test it like this. Now, in order to find a new value again, I 00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:50.679 align:start position:0% Now, in order to find a new value again, I 00:17:50.679 --> 00:17:52.470 align:start position:0% Now, in order to find a new value again, I 'll set it to OL and run it from the beginning. 00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0% 'll set it to OL and run it from the beginning. 00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.270 align:start position:0% 'll set it to OL and run it from the beginning. Then, you 00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.190 align:start position:0% Then, you 00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200 align:start position:0% 00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.110 align:start position:0% can actually check how it's created in the body column of the sheet. 00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0% can actually check how it's created in the body column of the sheet. 00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.230 align:start position:0% can actually check how it's created in the body column of the sheet. As you can see, it looks like this. The 00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:01.240 align:start position:0% As you can see, it looks like this. The 00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.510 align:start position:0% As you can see, it looks like this. The email content looks like this. It looks like only the body content is 00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0% email content looks like this. It looks like only the body content is 00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.190 align:start position:0% email content looks like this. It looks like only the body content is cut and comes out well. Then, 00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0% cut and comes out well. Then, 00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.230 align:start position:0% cut and comes out well. Then, you can set the subject the same way. 00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:07.240 align:start position:0% you can set the subject the same way. 00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.710 align:start position:0% you can set the subject the same way. You can set it the same way. 00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0% You can set it the same way. 00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.510 align:start position:0% You can set it the same way. How are you going to create this subject n? 00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:10.520 align:start position:0% How are you going to create this subject n? 00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.390 align:start position:0% How are you going to create this subject n? This time, I'm going to use a string, so it 00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0% This time, I'm going to use a string, so it 00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.310 align:start position:0% This time, I'm going to use a string, so it 's a little more complicated. 00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320 align:start position:0% 's a little more complicated. 00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.990 align:start position:0% 's a little more complicated.

You can't bring it again, 00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:19.480 align:start position:0% body. You can't bring it again, 00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.230 align:start position:0% body. You can't bring it again, so this time you have to specify both the beginning and the end. 00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.789 align:start position:0% so this time you have to specify both the beginning and the end. 00:18:23.789 --> 00:18:23.799 align:start position:0% 00:18:23.799 --> 00:18:25.870 align:start position:0% Earlier, the main text, 3, of the main text, 3, is 00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:27.950 align:start position:0% Earlier, the main text, 3, of the main text, 3, is 00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:27.960 align:start position:0% 00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.549 align:start position:0% just bringing the content after that, so 00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:29.559 align:start position:0% just bringing the content after that, so 00:18:29.559 --> 00:18:31.789 align:start position:0% just bringing the content after that, so when using the string, you only specified the starting point, 00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:33.830 align:start position:0% when using the string, you only specified the starting point, 00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0% 00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.630 align:start position:0% but this time, you have to set when you want to end it. I 00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.390 align:start position:0% but this time, you have to set when you want to end it. I 00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:37.400 align:start position:0% 00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.070 align:start position:0% 'll explain this after I create it. I set it like this. If you 00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:39.080 align:start position:0% 'll explain this after I create it. I set it like this. If you 00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.310 align:start position:0% 'll explain this after I create it. I set it like this. If you look here, the message says to 00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.870 align:start position:0% look here, the message says to 00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:43.880 align:start position:0% 00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.190 align:start position:0% bring the title 3, which is the starting and ending point, plus 3, from there, and 00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200 align:start position:0% bring the title 3, which is the starting and ending point, plus 3, from there, and 00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.750 align:start position:0% bring the title 3, which is the starting and ending point, plus 3, from there, and bring from after the title 3, and the 00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:48.760 align:start position:0% bring from after the title 3, and the 00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.750 align:start position:0% bring from after the title 3, and the end includes the main text, which 00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0% end includes the main text, which 00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.789 align:start position:0% end includes the main text, which means to end it in front of that. 00:18:53.789 --> 00:18:53.799 align:start position:0% means to end it in front of that. 00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.190 align:start position:0% means to end it in front of that. So I set it like this. If you 00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0% So I set it like this. If you 00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.470 align:start position:0% So I set it like this. If you look here, there's a 00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0% look here, there's a 00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.350 align:start position:0% look here, there's a space here. So if there 00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:01.830 align:start position:0% space here. So if there 00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0% 00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.710 align:start position:0% 's a space at the beginning and the end, I'll wrap it with a formula that removes it. 00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0% 's a space at the beginning and the end, I'll wrap it with a formula that removes it. 00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.230 align:start position:0% 's a space at the beginning and the end, I'll wrap it with a formula that removes it.

If you wrap it with this, if there's a 00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0% formula. If you wrap it with this, if there's a 00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.270 align:start position:0% formula. If you wrap it with this, if there's a space at the beginning and the end of the sentence, 00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:12.280 align:start position:0% space at the beginning and the end of the sentence, 00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.789 align:start position:0% space at the beginning and the end of the sentence, it will be removed. So you can set it like this. 00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0% it will be removed. So you can set it like this. 00:19:13.799 --> 00:19:15.230 align:start position:0% it will be removed. So you can set it like this. So if you 00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0% So if you 00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.430 align:start position:0% So if you use this formula, It 00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0% use this formula, It 00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.870 align:start position:0% use this formula, It may seem a bit burdensome at first, but this is 00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:22.310 align:start position:0% may seem a bit burdensome at first, but this is 00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0% 00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.590 align:start position:0% not that different from setting up a formula on a sheet. So, 00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:24.600 align:start position:0% not that different from setting up a formula on a sheet. So, 00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.870 align:start position:0% not that different from setting up a formula on a sheet. So, when you use it like this, 00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0% when you use it like this, 00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.029 align:start position:0% when you use it like this, there are various formulas. If you select this, an 00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0% there are various formulas. If you select this, an 00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:30.669 align:start position:0% there are various formulas. If you select this, an explanation of how to use it will 00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:30.679 align:start position:0% explanation of how to use it will 00:19:30.679 --> 00:19:32.549 align:start position:0% explanation of how to use it will appear. If you ask the chat room or 00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0% appear. If you ask the chat room or 00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:35.430 align:start position:0% appear. If you ask the chat room or something, you can learn how to use it. I 00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:37.230 align:start position:0% something, you can learn how to use it. I 00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.510 align:start position:0% 00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.520 align:start position:0% 00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.390 align:start position:0% think it would be good to refer to it and write it like this. And here, 00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400 align:start position:0% think it would be good to refer to it and write it like this. And here, 00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.909 align:start position:0% think it would be good to refer to it and write it like this. And here, there is an AI function. I think you can ask the AI ​​function about 00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0% there is an AI function. I think you can ask the AI ​​function about 00:19:43.919 --> 00:19:45.390 align:start position:0% there is an AI function. I think you can ask the AI ​​function about formulas. So, I 00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:46.909 align:start position:0% formulas. So, I 00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:49.310 align:start position:0% 00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:49.320 align:start position:0% 00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.710 align:start position:0% set it like this. Then, let's set it again and run it from the beginning. The 00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:54.950 align:start position:0% set it like this. Then, let's set it again and run it from the beginning. The 00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0% 00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.110 align:start position:0% title and body are well- 00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:58.120 align:start position:0% title and body are well- 00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.710 align:start position:0% title and body are well- picked, but 00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0% picked, but 00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.190 align:start position:0% picked, but there are cases where there are two asterisks. I'll 00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0% there are cases where there are two asterisks. I'll 00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.909 align:start position:0% there are cases where there are two asterisks. I'll ask the prompt to remove this. I'll 00:20:06.909 --> 00:20:06.919 align:start position:0% ask the prompt to remove this. I'll 00:20:06.919 --> 00:20:09.230 align:start position:0% ask the prompt to remove this. I'll specify it like this and 00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.240 align:start position:0% specify it like this and 00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:14.310 align:start position:0% specify it like this and upload it again. 00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0% 00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.029 align:start position:0% Then, you can see that the title and 00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0% Then, you can see that the title and 00:20:17.039 --> 00:20:19.549 align:start position:0% Then, you can see that the title and body are properly generated. 00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:19.559 align:start position:0% body are properly generated. 00:20:19.559 --> 00:20:21.830 align:start position:0% body are properly generated. So far, we've built a 00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0% So far, we've built a 00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.990 align:start position:0% So far, we've built a process to automate the task of writing emails. 00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.000 align:start position:0% process to automate the task of writing emails. 00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.230 align:start position:0% process to automate the task of writing emails. So now, the 00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0% So now, the 00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.230 align:start position:0% So now, the email draft has been created like this. 00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.240 align:start position:0% email draft has been created like this. 00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.029 align:start position:0% email draft has been created like this. Of course, there may be things we want to modify here. 00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:31.039 align:start position:0% Of course, there may be things we want to modify here. 00:20:31.039 --> 00:20:32.950 align:start position:0% Of course, there may be things we want to modify here. So, 00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0% So, 00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.549 align:start position:0% So, we'll modify it in the form we want and 00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:35.559 align:start position:0% we'll modify it in the form we want and 00:20:35.559 --> 00:20:38.909 align:start position:0% we'll modify it in the form we want and then 00:20:38.909 --> 00:20:38.919 align:start position:0% then 00:20:38.919 --> 00:20:40.789 align:start position:0% then check the mail. Let's make it a box. 00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0% check the mail. Let's make it a box. 00:20:40.799 --> 00:20:42.950 align:start position:0% check the mail. Let's make it a box. Then, when this is checked, 00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0% Then, when this is checked, 00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.110 align:start position:0% Then, when this is checked, when this is checked in Make, 00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:47.630 align:start position:0% when this is checked in Make, 00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0% 00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.510 align:start position:0% we want to set up the automation task that actually sends the email to the email. 00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0% we want to set up the automation task that actually sends the email to the email. 00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.270 align:start position:0% we want to set up the automation task that actually sends the email to the email. Then, in the case of the process of writing the email, this watch new 00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0% Then, in the case of the process of writing the email, this watch new 00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.990 align:start position:0% Then, in the case of the process of writing the email, this watch new rose, 00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:55.149 align:start position:0% rose, 00:20:55.149 --> 00:20:55.159 align:start position:0% 00:20:55.159 --> 00:20:57.430 align:start position:0% if you click on the clock-shaped trigger, it is set to check every 15 minutes. The 00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.470 align:start position:0% if you click on the clock-shaped trigger, it is set to check every 15 minutes. The 00:20:59.470 --> 00:20:59.480 align:start position:0% 00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.990 align:start position:0% fastest time is 15 minutes. 00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:01.000 align:start position:0% fastest time is 15 minutes. 00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.070 align:start position:0% fastest time is 15 minutes. And 00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:03.080 align:start position:0% And 00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.990 align:start position:0% And instead of this interval, you can run it every day or 00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:05.000 align:start position:0% instead of this interval, you can run it every day or 00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.870 align:start position:0% instead of this interval, you can run it every day or every week. For 00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0% every week. For 00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.470 align:start position:0% every week. For now, let 00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480 align:start position:0% now, let 00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.630 align:start position:0% now, let 's set it to 15 minutes. 00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0% 's set it to 15 minutes. 00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.830 align:start position:0% 's set it to 15 minutes. Then, the second step is to 00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0% Then, the second step is to 00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.750 align:start position:0% Then, the second step is to create a new scenario. 00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:14.760 align:start position:0% create a new scenario. 00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.430 align:start position:0% create a new scenario. So this time, let's 00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440 align:start position:0% So this time, let's 00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.950 align:start position:0% So this time, let's create another new scenario. 00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:17.960 align:start position:0% create another new scenario. 00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.870 align:start position:0% create another new scenario. This time, let's 00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0% This time, let's 00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.909 align:start position:0% This time, let's create a scenario called outbound email sending. 00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:22.919 align:start position:0% create a scenario called outbound email sending. 00:21:22.919 --> 00:21:25.149 align:start position:0% create a scenario called outbound email sending. And this time, what we need to do in the sheet is 00:21:25.149 --> 00:21:27.470 align:start position:0% And this time, what we need to do in the sheet is 00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:27.480 align:start position:0% 00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.669 align:start position:0% to check if the value of a specific cell has changed. So 00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0% to check if the value of a specific cell has changed. So 00:21:29.679 --> 00:21:31.149 align:start position:0% to check if the value of a specific cell has changed. So instead of watch new rose, it's 00:21:31.149 --> 00:21:31.159 align:start position:0% instead of watch new rose, it's 00:21:31.159 --> 00:21:33.430 align:start position:0% instead of watch new rose, it's already created. 00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:35.230 align:start position:0% already created. 00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:36.669 align:start position:0% 00:21:36.669 --> 00:21:38.230 align:start position:0% 00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0% 00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.470 align:start position:0% Let's use watch change, which can monitor if a specific value changes. Then, a 00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0% Let's use watch change, which can monitor if a specific value changes. Then, a 00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.070 align:start position:0% Let's use watch change, which can monitor if a specific value changes. Then, a button 00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080 align:start position:0% button 00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.830 align:start position:0% button will pop up to create a web page. When a specific part of the row 00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0% will pop up to create a web page. When a specific part of the row 00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.029 align:start position:0% will pop up to create a web page. When a specific part of the row changes, it will be detected. So, to 00:21:46.029 --> 00:21:46.039 align:start position:0% changes, it will be detected. So, to 00:21:46.039 --> 00:21:48.310 align:start position:0% changes, it will be detected. So, to bring it into Make, you 00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0% bring it into Make, you 00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.669 align:start position:0% bring it into Make, you have to use this webtoon. Webf can, 00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0% have to use this webtoon. Webf can, 00:21:49.679 --> 00:21:52.390 align:start position:0% have to use this webtoon. Webf can, to put it simply, is 00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.400 align:start position:0% to put it simply, is 00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.269 align:start position:0% to put it simply, is a kind of mailbox-like thing on the internet. 00:21:54.269 --> 00:21:54.279 align:start position:0% a kind of mailbox-like thing on the internet. 00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:56.110 align:start position:0% a kind of mailbox-like thing on the internet. So, when we 00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:56.120 align:start position:0% So, when we 00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.549 align:start position:0% So, when we receive a new email, a mailbox is a 00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0% receive a new email, a mailbox is a 00:21:58.559 --> 00:22:00.510 align:start position:0% receive a new email, a mailbox is a place where we can receive it. So, for 00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:00.520 align:start position:0% place where we can receive it. So, for 00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.710 align:start position:0% place where we can receive it. So, for webtoons, we create a URL, and 00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0% webtoons, we create a URL, and 00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.110 align:start position:0% webtoons, we create a URL, and that URL address 00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0% that URL address 00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.630 align:start position:0% that URL address acts like a mailbox. If someone 00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:07.640 align:start position:0% acts like a mailbox. If someone 00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.950 align:start position:0% acts like a mailbox. If someone sends information there, it 00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:09.960 align:start position:0% sends information there, it 00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.669 align:start position:0% sends information there, it acts as an address that can receive it. So, if you 00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0% acts as an address that can receive it. So, if you 00:22:11.679 --> 00:22:13.789 align:start position:0% acts as an address that can receive it. So, if you click on Create Web, Mail 00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:13.799 align:start position:0% click on Create Web, Mail 00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:16.070 align:start position:0% click on Create Web, Mail Complete will create a webf. 00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0% Complete will create a webf. 00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.789 align:start position:0% Complete will create a webf. Then, it will create an address like this. 00:22:17.789 --> 00:22:17.799 align:start position:0% Then, it will create an address like this. 00:22:17.799 --> 00:22:19.710 align:start position:0% Then, it will create an address like this. Then, copy this address first. 00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:19.720 align:start position:0% Then, copy this address first. 00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.350 align:start position:0% Then, copy this address first. Then, click OK. If 00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0% Then, click OK. If 00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.350 align:start position:0% Then, click OK. If we send data to the address we copied earlier, it 00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0% we send data to the address we copied earlier, it 00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.669 align:start position:0% we send data to the address we copied earlier, it can retrieve the value. 00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0% can retrieve the value. 00:22:25.679 --> 00:22:27.070 align:start position:0% can retrieve the value. Just like 00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:27.080 align:start position:0% Just like 00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.950 align:start position:0% Just like when an email is sent from a mailbox, we can receive it and 00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0% when an email is sent from a mailbox, we can receive it and 00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.710 align:start position:0% when an email is sent from a mailbox, we can receive it and open it. This 00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0% open it. This 00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.269 align:start position:0% open it. This acts as a box that receives it. 00:22:32.269 --> 00:22:32.279 align:start position:0% acts as a box that receives it. 00:22:32.279 --> 00:22:33.750 align:start position:0% acts as a box that receives it. Now, we have to be able to send an email. 00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.950 align:start position:0% Now, we have to be able to send an email. 00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:35.960 align:start position:0% 00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.950 align:start position:0% In the sheet that we set, we have to set the function so that we can send an email. But, you 00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:39.669 align:start position:0% In the sheet that we set, we have to set the function so that we can send an email. But, you 00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:39.679 align:start position:0% 00:22:39.679 --> 00:22:41.870 align:start position:0% can't do that right away.

You can enter the sheet name, and 00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:13.960 align:start position:0% You can enter the sheet name, and 00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.350 align:start position:0% You can enter the sheet name, and then the range is 00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:16.360 align:start position:0% then the range is 00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.190 align:start position:0% then the range is in which range you want to receive when the value changes. 00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:20.789 align:start position:0% in which range you want to receive when the value changes. 00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0% 00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:22.310 align:start position:0% So 00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0% So 00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.269 align:start position:0% So if this is not specified, a trigger will be generated when any value is modified in this sheet. 00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:24.279 align:start position:0% if this is not specified, a trigger will be generated when any value is modified in this sheet. 00:23:24.279 --> 00:23:26.310 align:start position:0% if this is not specified, a trigger will be generated when any value is modified in this sheet. But we 00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0% But we 00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.470 align:start position:0% But we don't need to do that. We just need 00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0% don't need to do that. We just need 00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.549 align:start position:0% don't need to do that. We just need to trigger when the column called Mail Check changes. 00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0% to trigger when the column called Mail Check changes. 00:23:30.559 --> 00:23:32.269 align:start position:0% to trigger when the column called Mail Check changes. So for G2 ES, 00:23:32.269 --> 00:23:32.279 align:start position:0% So for G2 ES, 00:23:32.279 --> 00:23:34.630 align:start position:0% So for G2 ES, for now, let's set the range to around g1000. 00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:35.990 align:start position:0% for now, let's set the range to around g1000. 00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0% 00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.390 align:start position:0% Set it like this and save it. Now the settings are 00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0% Set it like this and save it. Now the settings are 00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.269 align:start position:0% Set it like this and save it. Now the settings are complete. When setting this, please 00:23:40.269 --> 00:23:40.279 align:start position:0% complete. When setting this, please 00:23:40.279 --> 00:23:42.310 align:start position:0% complete. When setting this, please note that you must set this 00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.320 align:start position:0% note that you must set this 00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.269 align:start position:0% note that you must set this in the Chrome browser to 00:23:44.269 --> 00:23:44.279 align:start position:0% in the Chrome browser to 00:23:44.279 --> 00:23:46.470 align:start position:0% in the Chrome browser to set it properly. If you 00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0% set it properly. If you 00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.950 align:start position:0% set it properly. If you do it in a browser other than Chrome, the settings may not be saved properly. It 00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0% do it in a browser other than Chrome, the settings may not be saved properly. It 00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.630 align:start position:0% do it in a browser other than Chrome, the settings may not be saved properly. It might not work, so I 00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0% might not work, so I 00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.470 align:start position:0% might not work, so I recommend using Chrome. 00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0% recommend using Chrome. 00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.110 align:start position:0% recommend using Chrome. After setting it like this, 00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:55.789 align:start position:0% After setting it like this, 00:23:55.789 --> 00:23:55.799 align:start position:0% 00:23:55.799 --> 00:23:57.430 align:start position:0% let's test if it can be loaded properly here. So 00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0% let's test if it can be loaded properly here. So 00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.510 align:start position:0% let's test if it can be loaded properly here. So run this. 00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0% run this. 00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.149 align:start position:0% run this. Now the outer perimeter is ready to receive data. Then, 00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0% Now the outer perimeter is ready to receive data. Then, 00:24:02.159 --> 00:24:03.990 align:start position:0% Now the outer perimeter is ready to receive data. Then, in this state, let's 00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0% in this state, let's 00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.110 align:start position:0% in this state, let's change the G2 value. 00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120 align:start position:0% change the G2 value. 00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.710 align:start position:0% change the G2 value. Then, since the G2 value has 00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0% Then, since the G2 value has 00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.430 align:start position:0% Then, since the G2 value has changed, you can see that the value is fetched like this. The 00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:12.310 align:start position:0% changed, you can see that the value is fetched like this. The 00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.320 align:start position:0% 00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.470 align:start position:0% values ​​have been fetched like this. Now, 00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0% values ​​have been fetched like this. Now, 00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.350 align:start position:0% values ​​have been fetched like this. Now, we can send an email based on the fetched values. 00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:18.909 align:start position:0% we can send an email based on the fetched values. 00:24:18.909 --> 00:24:18.919 align:start position:0% 00:24:18.919 --> 00:24:21.029 align:start position:0% Since there are all these contents here, let's link the email. 00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0% Since there are all these contents here, let's link the email. 00:24:21.039 --> 00:24:22.870 align:start position:0% Since there are all these contents here, let's link the email. Select Gmail. You 00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:24.950 align:start position:0% Select Gmail. You 00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0% 00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.789 align:start position:0% can select Send Email. You can select Email. 00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0% can select Send Email. You can select Email. 00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:28.789 align:start position:0% can select Send Email. You can select Email. Now, before sending here, I 00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0% Now, before sending here, I 00:24:28.799 --> 00:24:30.990 align:start position:0% Now, before sending here, I want to add filtering. What filtering is, 00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:31.000 align:start position:0% want to add filtering. What filtering is, 00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.029 align:start position:0% want to add filtering. What filtering is, when the value of the column changes, we 00:24:34.029 --> 00:24:34.039 align:start position:0% when the value of the column changes, we 00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:35.789 align:start position:0% when the value of the column changes, we trigger it. But 00:24:35.789 --> 00:24:35.799 align:start position:0% trigger it. But 00:24:35.799 --> 00:24:38.110 align:start position:0% trigger it. But change means the value 00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:38.120 align:start position:0% change means the value 00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.110 align:start position:0% change means the value can be deleted or unchecked. 00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:40.120 align:start position:0% can be deleted or unchecked. 00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.909 align:start position:0% can be deleted or unchecked. So, it's 00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:41.919 align:start position:0% So, it's 00:24:41.919 --> 00:24:44.710 align:start position:0% So, it's not an action that checks the form that we want. This 00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0% not an action that checks the form that we want. This 00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.230 align:start position:0% not an action that checks the form that we want. This cell can be modified in other ways. 00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:47.240 align:start position:0% cell can be modified in other ways. 00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.230 align:start position:0% cell can be modified in other ways. In that case, we 00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:49.240 align:start position:0% In that case, we 00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.710 align:start position:0% In that case, we shouldn't send an email. So, 00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0% shouldn't send an email. So, 00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.389 align:start position:0% shouldn't send an email. So, let's filter it. 00:24:52.389 --> 00:24:52.399 align:start position:0% let's filter it. 00:24:52.399 --> 00:24:54.350 align:start position:0% let's filter it. When filtering, use the module like this. 00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:54.360 align:start position:0% When filtering, use the module like this. 00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.310 align:start position:0% When filtering, use the module like this. There is an extension shape between the modules. 00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.320 align:start position:0% There is an extension shape between the modules. 00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.990 align:start position:0% There is an extension shape between the modules. If you click on this, you can set up a filter. 00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0% If you click on this, you can set up a filter. 00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.630 align:start position:0% If you click on this, you can set up a filter. Here, I 00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0% Here, I 00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.710 align:start position:0% Here, I will set the mail check true. 00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:01.720 align:start position:0% will set the mail check true. 00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.789 align:start position:0% will set the mail check true. So, here, the value is set to low value. 00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:06.669 align:start position:0% So, here, the value is set to low value. 00:25:06.669 --> 00:25:06.679 align:start position:0% 00:25:06.679 --> 00:25:08.510 align:start position:0% When this checkbox is checked, you 00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520 align:start position:0% When this checkbox is checked, you 00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.470 align:start position:0% When this checkbox is checked, you can see that the value is brought as true. I will set it to 00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480 align:start position:0% can see that the value is brought as true. I will set it to 00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.310 align:start position:0% can see that the value is brought as true. I will set it to send an email only when the checkbox is checked. 00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320 align:start position:0% send an email only when the checkbox is checked. 00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.950 align:start position:0% send an email only when the checkbox is checked. But now, 00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:13.960 align:start position:0% But now, 00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.909 align:start position:0% But now, to make it safer, I will 00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0% to make it safer, I will 00:25:15.919 --> 00:25:17.350 align:start position:0% to make it safer, I will add one more end. I will add an additional 00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:17.360 align:start position:0% add one more end. I will add an additional 00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.149 align:start position:0% add one more end. I will add an additional condition. 00:25:19.149 --> 00:25:19.159 align:start position:0% condition. 00:25:19.159 --> 00:25:21.549 align:start position:0% condition. Even if the checkbox is checked, if this mail send column is 00:25:21.549 --> 00:25:21.559 align:start position:0% Even if the checkbox is checked, if this mail send column is 00:25:21.559 --> 00:25:23.870 align:start position:0% Even if the checkbox is checked, if this mail send column is Yes, the 00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0% Yes, the 00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.310 align:start position:0% Yes, the email has already been sent. I 00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:30.190 align:start position:0% 00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:32.750 align:start position:0% 00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:32.760 align:start position:0% 00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.750 align:start position:0% will add one more condition to send an email only when the value in the send column is empty. So, 00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:34.760 align:start position:0% will add one more condition to send an email only when the value in the send column is empty. So, 00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.870 align:start position:0% will add one more condition to send an email only when the value in the send column is empty. So, when the value of the h column is a null value, I will 00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:36.880 align:start position:0% when the value of the h column is a null value, I will 00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.269 align:start position:0% when the value of the h column is a null value, I will set it to be 00:25:39.269 --> 00:25:39.279 align:start position:0% set it to be 00:25:39.279 --> 00:25:41.590 align:start position:0% set it to be empty. If you go into the gear like this, the null value knows something. 00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0% empty. If you go into the gear like this, the null value knows something. 00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.950 align:start position:0% empty. If you go into the gear like this, the null value knows something. So, hl mail send is a 00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:43.960 align:start position:0% So, hl mail send is a 00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.070 align:start position:0% So, hl mail send is a column value that has not been sent yet, 00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0% column value that has not been sent yet, 00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.710 align:start position:0% column value that has not been sent yet, and also, if the mail check is checked, I will 00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0% and also, if the mail check is checked, I will 00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.269 align:start position:0% and also, if the mail check is checked, I will send the Gmail only when it is checked. 00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:53.070 align:start position:0% send the Gmail only when it is checked. 00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:53.080 align:start position:0% 00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.710 align:start position:0% I set it like this. And 00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0% I set it like this. And 00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.430 align:start position:0% I set it like this. And then Now, the most important thing about Gmail settings is 00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:56.440 align:start position:0% then Now, the most important thing about Gmail settings is 00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.430 align:start position:0% then Now, the most important thing about Gmail settings is sending emails. 00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:58.440 align:start position:0% sending emails. 00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.990 align:start position:0% sending emails. Let's set up that option. Okay, 00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0% Let's set up that option. Okay, 00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.789 align:start position:0% Let's set up that option. Okay, now you have to connect your email first. For 00:26:01.789 --> 00:26:01.799 align:start position:0% now you have to connect your email first. For 00:26:01.799 --> 00:26:04.190 align:start position:0% now you have to connect your email first. For business emails, 00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:05.909 align:start position:0% business emails, 00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:07.510 align:start position:0% 00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0% 00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.950 align:start position:0% there are emails that end with the company name instead of @gmail.com. 00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:09.960 align:start position:0% there are emails that end with the company name instead of @gmail.com. 00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.230 align:start position:0% there are emails that end with the company name instead of @gmail.com. In that case, you can just add it and sign in to 00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0% In that case, you can just add it and sign in to 00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.389 align:start position:0% In that case, you can just add it and sign in to use it right away. 00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:14.399 align:start position:0% use it right away. 00:26:14.399 --> 00:26:16.389 align:start position:0% use it right away. However, for personal emails that 00:26:16.389 --> 00:26:16.399 align:start position:0% However, for personal emails that 00:26:16.399 --> 00:26:18.990 align:start position:0% However, for personal emails that end with @gmail, you have to 00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:19.000 align:start position:0% end with @gmail, you have to 00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.190 align:start position:0% end with @gmail, you have to get permission from Google. 00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.200 align:start position:0% get permission from Google. 00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.669 align:start position:0% get permission from Google. So requesting permission and connecting 00:26:24.669 --> 00:26:24.679 align:start position:0% So requesting permission and connecting 00:26:24.679 --> 00:26:26.389 align:start position:0% So requesting permission and connecting is a little more difficult. 00:26:26.389 --> 00:26:26.399 align:start position:0% is a little more difficult. 00:26:26.399 --> 00:26:28.669 align:start position:0% is a little more difficult. So for now, 00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0% So for now, 00:26:28.679 --> 00:26:30.149 align:start position:0% So for now, I will explain it additionally for those who need it last. For 00:26:30.149 --> 00:26:31.870 align:start position:0% I will explain it additionally for those who need it last. For 00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:31.880 align:start position:0% 00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.029 align:start position:0% now, let's assume that the connection is made and 00:26:34.029 --> 00:26:34.039 align:start position:0% now, let's assume that the connection is made and 00:26:34.039 --> 00:26:35.510 align:start position:0% now, let's assume that the connection is made and proceed. 00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0% proceed. 00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.070 align:start position:0% proceed. If you want to test it with a personal account, I recommend that you refer 00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:39.070 align:start position:0% If you want to test it with a personal account, I recommend that you refer 00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:39.080 align:start position:0% 00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.190 align:start position:0% to the part later where I explain how to connect Gmail. You 00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:41.200 align:start position:0% to the part later where I explain how to connect Gmail. You 00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.710 align:start position:0% to the part later where I explain how to connect Gmail. You should be 00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0% should be 00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.590 align:start position:0% should be familiar with it now. 00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:44.600 align:start position:0% familiar with it now. 00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.950 align:start position:0% familiar with it now. The recipient who sends it like this is the one who 00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960 align:start position:0% The recipient who sends it like this is the one who 00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.549 align:start position:0% The recipient who sends it like this is the one who specified all the values ​​in this sheet. 00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:49.559 align:start position:0% specified all the values ​​in this sheet. 00:26:49.559 --> 00:26:51.909 align:start position:0% specified all the values ​​in this sheet. In this low value, a. Now, the email value. 00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:51.919 align:start position:0% In this low value, a.

Let's set whether it was sent or not. For now, I'll 00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880 align:start position:0% Let's set whether it was sent or not. For now, I'll 00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.510 align:start position:0% Let's set whether it was sent or not. For now, I'll put it in my email. Yes, 00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:06.520 align:start position:0% put it in my email. Yes, 00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.350 align:start position:0% put it in my email. Yes, set it like this and save it. Let's 00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:10.269 align:start position:0% set it like this and save it. Let's 00:27:10.269 --> 00:27:10.279 align:start position:0% 00:27:10.279 --> 00:27:13.830 align:start position:0% run it to see how the email is transferred. 00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0% 00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.510 align:start position:0% Now, I've done the trigger, but 00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:16.520 align:start position:0% Now, I've done the trigger, but 00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.549 align:start position:0% Now, I've done the trigger, but if you look, this is filtered, so the value is 00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:19.559 align:start position:0% if you look, this is filtered, so the value is 00:27:19.559 --> 00:27:21.510 align:start position:0% if you look, this is filtered, so the value is not sent to the email module. Why is that? 00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0% not sent to the email module. Why is that? 00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.470 align:start position:0% not sent to the email module. Why is that? The value is correct now, but 00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0% The value is correct now, but 00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.070 align:start position:0% The value is correct now, but I unchecked the checkbox, "True Summer." When I unchecked it, the 00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:27.080 align:start position:0% I unchecked the checkbox, "True Summer." When I unchecked it, the 00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.070 align:start position:0% I unchecked the checkbox, "True Summer." When I unchecked it, the information was received, but the filtering 00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:29.080 align:start position:0% information was received, but the filtering 00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.549 align:start position:0% information was received, but the filtering did not pass, so the email was not transferred. 00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:32.190 align:start position:0% did not pass, so the email was not transferred. 00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:34.269 align:start position:0% 00:27:34.269 --> 00:27:34.279 align:start position:0% 00:27:34.279 --> 00:27:35.909 align:start position:0% But if we set it again and check this again this time, it will pass this time. It 00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0% But if we set it again and check this again this time, it will pass this time. It 00:27:35.919 --> 00:27:38.029 align:start position:0% But if we set it again and check this again this time, it will pass this time. It passed because it met the condition, and 00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:38.039 align:start position:0% passed because it met the condition, and 00:27:38.039 --> 00:27:39.830 align:start position:0% passed because it met the condition, and now the email has been sent. The 00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0% now the email has been sent. The 00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.310 align:start position:0% now the email has been sent. The content was transferred like this. 00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0% content was transferred like this. 00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.350 align:start position:0% content was transferred like this. Let's check this in the email. It 00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:44.360 align:start position:0% Let's check this in the email. It 00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.870 align:start position:0% Let's check this in the email. It will appear like this. But if you 00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:45.880 align:start position:0% will appear like this. But if you 00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.070 align:start position:0% will appear like this. But if you look here, everything else is good, but the 00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0% look here, everything else is good, but the 00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.149 align:start position:0% look here, everything else is good, but the spacing is not reflected at all. If the 00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0% spacing is not reflected at all. If the 00:27:50.159 --> 00:27:52.630 align:start position:0% spacing is not reflected at all. If the email is sent like this, it will obviously 00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0% email is sent like this, it will obviously 00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.789 align:start position:0% email is sent like this, it will obviously not look good. So we need to fix this now. The 00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0% not look good. So we need to fix this now. The 00:27:54.799 --> 00:27:56.669 align:start position:0% not look good. So we need to fix this now. The enter key is 00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:56.679 align:start position:0% enter key is 00:27:56.679 --> 00:27:58.509 align:start position:0% enter key is not reflected at all. We need to fix that now. 00:27:58.509 --> 00:27:58.519 align:start position:0% not reflected at all. We need to fix that now. 00:27:58.519 --> 00:28:00.630 align:start position:0% not reflected at all. We need to fix that now. So if you 00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:00.640 align:start position:0% So if you 00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.750 align:start position:0% So if you look at the content here, the value seems to be entered correctly, but 00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:start position:0% look at the content here, the value seems to be entered correctly, but 00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.110 align:start position:0% look at the content here, the value seems to be entered correctly, but in this format. It's not being printed right now. The 00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0% in this format. It's not being printed right now. The 00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.190 align:start position:0% in this format. It's not being printed right now. The reason is because in the email, if you 00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0% reason is because in the email, if you 00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.590 align:start position:0% reason is because in the email, if you look at the contents of the email, it 00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0% look at the contents of the email, it 00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.509 align:start position:0% look at the contents of the email, it says that you can use HTML tags, 00:28:11.509 --> 00:28:11.519 align:start position:0% says that you can use HTML tags, 00:28:11.519 --> 00:28:14.110 align:start position:0% says that you can use HTML tags, so you need to change the space to HTML format. The 00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:16.070 align:start position:0% so you need to change the space to HTML format. The 00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0% 00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.870 align:start position:0% method of changing it is not that difficult. Just 00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:17.880 align:start position:0% method of changing it is not that difficult. Just 00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.909 align:start position:0% method of changing it is not that difficult. Just use the place and 00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0% use the place and 00:28:19.919 --> 00:28:21.669 align:start position:0% use the place and change the space value to something else. 00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0% change the space value to something else. 00:28:21.679 --> 00:28:23.310 align:start position:0% change the space value to something else. So for the replace, 00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:23.320 align:start position:0% So for the replace, 00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.310 align:start position:0% So for the replace, first put in the main text and then 00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0% first put in the main text and then 00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.630 align:start position:0% first put in the main text and then set the space value first. If you 00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0% set the space value first. If you 00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.470 align:start position:0% set the space value first. If you look at the text here, there 00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0% look at the text here, there 00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.310 align:start position:0% look at the text here, there is something called a new line. To be exact, a 00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0% is something called a new line. To be exact, a 00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.750 align:start position:0% is something called a new line. To be exact, a space means a single space and a new line 00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:33.710 align:start position:0% space means a single space and a new line 00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0% 00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.630 align:start position:0% means three lines, but this is 00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0% means three lines, but this is 00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.029 align:start position:0% means three lines, but this is not displayed right now. So, if you 00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:39.789 align:start position:0% not displayed right now. So, if you 00:28:39.789 --> 00:28:42.669 align:start position:0% 00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:42.679 align:start position:0% 00:28:42.679 --> 00:28:44.750 align:start position:0% set this to BR /, which means a new line in the HTML tag, it 00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:44.760 align:start position:0% set this to BR /, which means a new line in the HTML tag, it 00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.830 align:start position:0% set this to BR /, which means a new line in the HTML tag, it is a tag that leaves a single line in the HTML tag. If you replace it with this, the 00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:48.950 align:start position:0% is a tag that leaves a single line in the HTML tag. If you replace it with this, the 00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0% 00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.470 align:start position:0% email will actually be sent properly. Then, if you set it like this 00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0% email will actually be sent properly. Then, if you set it like this 00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.789 align:start position:0% email will actually be sent properly. Then, if you set it like this first and update the 00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0% first and update the 00:28:52.799 --> 00:28:55.110 align:start position:0% first and update the value of Yes in the mail send when you send an email in the sheet, it would 00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0% value of Yes in the mail send when you send an email in the sheet, it would 00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.029 align:start position:0% value of Yes in the mail send when you send an email in the sheet, it would be good. Let's 00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0% be good. Let's 00:28:57.039 --> 00:28:58.789 align:start position:0% be good. Let's link it up and then test it once. 00:28:58.789 --> 00:29:00.789 align:start position:0% link it up and then test it once. 00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0% 00:29:00.799 --> 00:29:02.710 align:start position:0% When you send an email in the mail send column, it will be displayed as Yes. 00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0% When you send an email in the mail send column, it will be displayed as Yes. 00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.509 align:start position:0% When you send an email in the mail send column, it will be displayed as Yes. When you set that, go back to the sheet. Go in and 00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:04.519 align:start position:0% When you set that, go back to the sheet. Go in and 00:29:04.519 --> 00:29:06.750 align:start position:0% When you set that, go back to the sheet. Go in and this time we need to update the data in the row. 00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:06.760 align:start position:0% this time we need to update the data in the row. 00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.630 align:start position:0% this time we need to update the data in the row. So 00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0% So 00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.350 align:start position:0% So select the Google Sheet module and 00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:10.360 align:start position:0% select the Google Sheet module and 00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.470 align:start position:0% select the Google Sheet module and search for update. There 00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0% search for update. There 00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.590 align:start position:0% search for update. There is an update row. Set this. Then 00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:14.600 align:start position:0% is an update row. Set this. Then 00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.310 align:start position:0% is an update row. Set this. Then we 00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0% we 00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.230 align:start position:0% we will search for the sheet we will update. Select it and 00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0% will search for the sheet we will update. Select it and 00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.310 align:start position:0% will search for the sheet we will update. Select it and set the row number. There is 00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320 align:start position:0% set the row number. There is 00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.430 align:start position:0% set the row number. There is no row ID here, but there 00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:22.440 align:start position:0% no row ID here, but there 00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.950 align:start position:0% no row ID here, but there is a row registry when receiving web pro. Row start is for 00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0% is a row registry when receiving web pro. Row start is for 00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.789 align:start position:0% is a row registry when receiving web pro. Row start is for each row, 00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0% each row, 00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:28.669 align:start position:0% each row, so select Row start. 00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0% so select Row start. 00:29:28.679 --> 00:29:30.310 align:start position:0% so select Row start. Then, for the 00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0% Then, for the 00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.830 align:start position:0% Then, for the content to be updated, set the value in Mail Send to 00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:32.840 align:start position:0% content to be updated, set the value in Mail Send to 00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.549 align:start position:0% content to be updated, set the value in Mail Send to Yes. Just 00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0% Yes. Just 00:29:34.559 --> 00:29:36.269 align:start position:0% Yes. Just enter the value Yes. Set it like this and 00:29:36.269 --> 00:29:36.279 align:start position:0% enter the value Yes. Set it like this and 00:29:36.279 --> 00:29:38.149 align:start position:0% enter the value Yes. Set it like this and save it. 00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0% save it. 00:29:38.159 --> 00:29:40.269 align:start position:0% save it. Then, from the beginning, let's test 00:29:40.269 --> 00:29:40.279 align:start position:0% Then, from the beginning, let's test 00:29:40.279 --> 00:29:42.470 align:start position:0% Then, from the beginning, let's test getting data from a new row, 00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0% getting data from a new row, 00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.990 align:start position:0% getting data from a new row, sending an email, and updating that the email sending is complete. 00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:46.789 align:start position:0% sending an email, and updating that the email sending is complete. 00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0% 00:29:46.799 --> 00:29:48.350 align:start position:0% Now that we have 00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0% Now that we have 00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.149 align:start position:0% Now that we have this set up, you just need to 00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0% this set up, you just need to 00:29:50.159 --> 00:29:51.549 align:start position:0% this set up, you just need to schedule it. 00:29:51.549 --> 00:29:51.559 align:start position:0% schedule it. 00:29:51.559 --> 00:29:53.950 align:start position:0% schedule it. Let's turn on scheduling. I 00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:53.960 align:start position:0% Let's turn on scheduling. I 00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.990 align:start position:0% Let's turn on scheduling. I turned on scheduling. Next, we will first go to the daily writing scenario that 00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0% turned on scheduling. Next, we will first go to the daily writing scenario that 00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.029 align:start position:0% turned on scheduling. Next, we will first go to the daily writing scenario that receives new data and writes an email draft. 00:29:58.029 --> 00:30:00.029 align:start position:0% receives new data and writes an email draft. 00:30:00.029 --> 00:30:00.039 align:start position:0% 00:30:00.039 --> 00:30:01.909 align:start position:0% Let's run it first here. 00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0% Let's run it first here. 00:30:01.919 --> 00:30:04.190 align:start position:0% Let's run it first here. Of course, this 00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:04.200 align:start position:0% Of course, this 00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.590 align:start position:0% Of course, this will run every 15 minutes with Watch News. I can set it up, 00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:06.600 align:start position:0% will run every 15 minutes with Watch News. I can set it up, 00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.950 align:start position:0% will run every 15 minutes with Watch News. I can set it up, but then I'll have to wait 15 minutes. 00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:07.960 align:start position:0% but then I'll have to wait 15 minutes. 00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.669 align:start position:0% but then I'll have to wait 15 minutes. So, let's 00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0% So, let's 00:30:09.679 --> 00:30:11.590 align:start position:0% So, let's write the email and execute it directly. 00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:13.470 align:start position:0% write the email and execute it directly. 00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:13.480 align:start position:0% 00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.310 align:start position:0% Since Web 6 is already scheduled, let's 00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:15.320 align:start position:0% Since Web 6 is already scheduled, let's 00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.990 align:start position:0% Since Web 6 is already scheduled, let's check that it's sent out every day when we check it. 00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:18.430 align:start position:0% check that it's sent out every day when we check it. 00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:18.440 align:start position:0% 00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.230 align:start position:0% Let's actually add one more row here. 00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0% Let's actually add one more row here. 00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.669 align:start position:0% Let's actually add one more row here. This time, I'll just make it number 2. I 00:30:22.669 --> 00:30:22.679 align:start position:0% This time, I'll just make it number 2. I 00:30:22.679 --> 00:30:24.870 align:start position:0% This time, I'll just make it number 2. I 've specified two like 1 and 2. I'll 00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0% 've specified two like 1 and 2. I'll 00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.789 align:start position:0% 've specified two like 1 and 2. I'll delete all the subject and body and 00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0% delete all the subject and body and 00:30:26.799 --> 00:30:28.549 align:start position:0% delete all the subject and body and receive it again. So, these 00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:30.149 align:start position:0% receive it again. So, these 00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:32.549 align:start position:0% 00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:34.710 align:start position:0% 00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:41.669 align:start position:0% 00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0% 00:30:41.679 --> 00:30:44.149 align:start position:0% two are set now. In the practice, I'll check it from the beginning by going to Well to Start and executing it once. I've brought in two values ​​like this. I 00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0% two are set now. In the practice, I'll check it from the beginning by going to Well to Start and executing it once. I've brought in two values ​​like this. I 00:30:44.159 --> 00:30:46.269 align:start position:0% two are set now.

The 00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:07.909 align:start position:0% can skip this part. The 00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0% 00:32:07.919 --> 00:32:09.710 align:start position:0% reason why you need to set up game email additionally is that 00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:09.720 align:start position:0% reason why you need to set up game email additionally is that 00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.950 align:start position:0% reason why you need to set up game email additionally is that using this module is the same concept as being 00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:11.960 align:start position:0% using this module is the same concept as being 00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.350 align:start position:0% using this module is the same concept as being able to use the API of that service. As I 00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:14.360 align:start position:0% able to use the API of that service. As I 00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.990 align:start position:0% able to use the API of that service. As I mentioned, 00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0% mentioned, 00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.430 align:start position:0% mentioned, Google has blocked 00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:20.389 align:start position:0% Google has blocked 00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0% 00:32:20.399 --> 00:32:22.750 align:start position:0% API Make from automatically using personal emails for privacy reasons. 00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:22.760 align:start position:0% API Make from automatically using personal emails for privacy reasons. 00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.590 align:start position:0% API Make from automatically using personal emails for privacy reasons. So we 00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:26.350 align:start position:0% So we 00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:26.360 align:start position:0% 00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.149 align:start position:0% need to manually configure this so that we can use it. So, 00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0% need to manually configure this so that we can use it. So, 00:32:28.159 --> 00:32:30.389 align:start position:0% need to manually configure this so that we can use it. So, in order to do that, we need something additional. 00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0% in order to do that, we need something additional. 00:32:30.399 --> 00:32:32.549 align:start position:0% in order to do that, we need something additional. So when you add it, you ca 00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:32.559 align:start position:0% So when you add it, you ca 00:32:32.559 --> 00:32:34.870 align:start position:0% So when you add it, you ca n't just sign in. You need to 00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0% n't just sign in. You need to 00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.750 align:start position:0% n't just sign in. You need to go to Earth Settings, 00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:36.760 align:start position:0% go to Earth Settings, 00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.070 align:start position:0% go to Earth Settings, add a client ID and client secret, 00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:39.080 align:start position:0% add a client ID and client secret, 00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.669 align:start position:0% add a client ID and client secret, sign in, and connect your account. 00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0% sign in, and connect your account. 00:32:41.679 --> 00:32:43.230 align:start position:0% sign in, and connect your account.

You don't need one with 'On', so I'll exclude that and add 00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0% don't need one with 'On', so I'll exclude that and add 00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.349 align:start position:0% don't need one with 'On', so I'll exclude that and add mail.google.com, modify, 00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:08.359 align:start position:0% mail.google.com, modify, 00:35:08.359 --> 00:35:10.990 align:start position:0% mail.google.com, modify, compose, metadata, insert, send, and so on. 00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:11.000 align:start position:0% compose, metadata, insert, send, and so on. 00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.670 align:start position:0% compose, metadata, insert, send, and so on. Now, I'll 00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:12.680 align:start position:0% Now, I'll 00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.470 align:start position:0% Now, I'll add more. And you just need to add things like send, 00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0% add more. And you just need to add things like send, 00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.470 align:start position:0% add more. And you just need to add things like send, label, setting, basic, sharing, 00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0% label, setting, basic, sharing, 00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.190 align:start position:0% label, setting, basic, sharing, read only. 00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:18.200 align:start position:0% read only. 00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.069 align:start position:0% read only. Basically, you 00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0% Basically, you 00:35:20.079 --> 00:35:21.790 align:start position:0% Basically, you can add everything except 'on'. 00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:21.800 align:start position:0% can add everything except 'on'. 00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.910 align:start position:0% can add everything except 'on'. Then, you can update. 00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0% Then, you can update. 00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.470 align:start position:0% Then, you can update. Then, you've set it so that Make can do all the tasks that can be done via email. 00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:27.150 align:start position:0% Then, you've set it so that Make can do all the tasks that can be done via email. 00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.160 align:start position:0% 00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.870 align:start position:0% Then, you can save and continue. 00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0% Then, you can save and continue. 00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.069 align:start position:0% Then, you can save and continue. Now, the settings are done. 00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0% Now, the settings are done. 00:35:31.079 --> 00:35:33.310 align:start position:0% Now, the settings are done. Next, the settings. If you did, I needed an 00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:33.320 align:start position:0% Next, the settings. If you did, I needed an 00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.910 align:start position:0% Next, the settings. If you did, I needed an ID and key that I could use earlier. 00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:34.920 align:start position:0% ID and key that I could use earlier. 00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.710 align:start position:0% ID and key that I could use earlier. Now, you need to add them. 00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0% Now, you need to add them. 00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.550 align:start position:0% Now, you need to add them. So, 00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0% So, 00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:39.990 align:start position:0% So, come into the section called "s" and click "create 00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0% come into the section called "s" and click "create 00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.750 align:start position:0% come into the section called "s" and click "create crential."

It's 00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:06.870 align:start position:0% add restricted yogurt. It's 00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0% 00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.150 align:start position:0% better to paste https. Then, you can 00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0% better to paste https. Then, you can 00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.390 align:start position:0% better to paste https. Then, you can create it. 00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:09.400 align:start position:0% create it. 00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.069 align:start position:0% create it. If you create it, a client ID and client 00:36:11.069 --> 00:36:11.079 align:start position:0% If you create it, a client ID and client 00:36:11.079 --> 00:36:13.150 align:start position:0% If you create it, a client ID and client seek are created. You can copy and paste it as is. 00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:15.190 align:start position:0% seek are created. You can copy and paste it as is. 00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0% 00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.950 align:start position:0% Paste it here and press 00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0% Paste it here and press 00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.630 align:start position:0% Paste it here and press sign-in to connect. 00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:19.640 align:start position:0% sign-in to connect. 00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.670 align:start position:0% sign-in to connect. Now, you can connect your personal account. 00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0% Now, you can connect your personal account. 00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.190 align:start position:0% Now, you can connect your personal account. At this time, you need to be careful. For 00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0% At this time, you need to be careful. For 00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.870 align:start position:0% At this time, you need to be careful. For example, a personal Gmail account 00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0% example, a personal Gmail account 00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.670 align:start position:0% example, a personal Gmail account needs to be approved every 7 days. 00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0% needs to be approved every 7 days. 00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.510 align:start position:0% needs to be approved every 7 days. So, if we automate work and have to 00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0% So, if we automate work and have to 00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.829 align:start position:0% So, if we automate work and have to re-apply every 7 days, it's very 00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0% re-apply every 7 days, it's very 00:36:31.839 --> 00:36:34.430 align:start position:0% re-apply every 7 days, it's very inconvenient. So, in fact, personal accounts are 00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:36.309 align:start position:0% inconvenient. So, in fact, personal accounts are 00:36:36.309 --> 00:36:36.319 align:start position:0% 00:36:36.319 --> 00:36:38.270 align:start position:0% not really suitable for daily automation. Of course, if you 00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:38.280 align:start position:0% not really suitable for daily automation. Of course, if you 00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:41.750 align:start position:0% not really suitable for daily automation. Of course, if you look here, you can see that the public app needs to be approved every 7 days. If you 00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:44.190 align:start position:0% look here, you can see that the public app needs to be approved every 7 days. If you 00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:44.200 align:start position:0% 00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.309 align:start position:0% change the status to production, it says that you don't need to do that. 00:36:46.309 --> 00:36:46.319 align:start position:0% change the status to production, it says that you don't need to do that. 00:36:46.319 --> 00:36:48.829 align:start position:0% change the status to production, it says that you don't need to do that. So, if you go 00:36:48.829 --> 00:36:48.839 align:start position:0% So, if you go 00:36:48.839 --> 00:36:51.349 align:start position:0% So, if you go to the OS consensus screen in the Google Cloud Console and change the 00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0% to the OS consensus screen in the Google Cloud Console and change the 00:36:51.359 --> 00:36:53.550 align:start position:0% to the OS consensus screen in the Google Cloud Console and change the app from testing 00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:53.560 align:start position:0% app from testing 00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.390 align:start position:0% app from testing to production, you 00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:55.400 align:start position:0% to production, you 00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.550 align:start position:0% to production, you can change it. 00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:57.560 align:start position:0% can change it. 00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.109 align:start position:0% can change it. I changed it now and it 00:36:59.109 --> 00:36:59.119 align:start position:0% I changed it now and it 00:36:59.119 --> 00:37:00.990 align:start position:0% I changed it now and it says back to testing, but 00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:01.000 align:start position:0% says back to testing, but 00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.069 align:start position:0% says back to testing, but if it was originally in testing status, this You can choose to publish in production. If you 00:37:03.069 --> 00:37:04.390 align:start position:0% if it was originally in testing status, this You can choose to publish in production. If you 00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400 align:start position:0% 00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.790 align:start position:0% choose, it won't be published right away. It'll ask you to 00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:09.030 align:start position:0% choose, it won't be published right away. It'll ask you to 00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:11.069 align:start position:0% 00:37:11.069 --> 00:37:13.790 align:start position:0% 00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:16.550 align:start position:0% 00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:18.510 align:start position:0% 00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:20.950 align:start position:0% 00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:23.150 align:start position:0% 00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0% 00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.150 align:start position:0% verify. If you just press the publish button like this and use it, you don't have to do it on a weekly basis. Make provides guidance in the explanation here. However, what they're saying here 00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:25.160 align:start position:0% verify. If you just press the publish button like this and use it, you don't have to do it on a weekly basis. Make provides guidance in the explanation here. However, what they're saying here 00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.990 align:start position:0% verify. If you just press the publish button like this and use it, you don't have to do it on a weekly basis. Make provides guidance in the explanation here. However, what they're saying here is that we can't guarantee that this will continue because we don't know how Google will handle it. So, it would be good to keep in mind that personal 00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:27.000 align:start position:0% is that we can't guarantee that this will continue because we don't know how Google will handle it.
