that's one way 00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 align:start position:0% this is possible I guess that's one way 00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.750 align:start position:0% this is possible I guess that's one way we can spur the Next Generation to kind 00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 align:start position:0% we can spur the Next Generation to kind 00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.750 align:start position:0% we can spur the Next Generation to kind of create more uh Innovative changes to 00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 align:start position:0% of create more uh Innovative changes to 00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.229 align:start position:0% of create more uh Innovative changes to the environment and I guess that's going 00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 align:start position:0% the environment and I guess that's going 00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.710 align:start position:0% the environment and I guess that's going to have a future generation so uh 00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 align:start position:0% to have a future generation so uh 00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.070 align:start position:0% to have a future generation so uh Flint's mission is to build the world's 00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 align:start position:0%
