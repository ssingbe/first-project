00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:26.960
Home of the Future has to protect,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.963
be flexible and be responsive.

00:00:31.047 --> 00:00:34.050
Samsung is ready to meet these challenges.

00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:43.860
Making the promise of the connected Smart Home a reality.

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:52.235
We will seed

00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:55.288
and support the next generation of technology.

00:00:56.305 --> 00:01:01.711
IoT, AI, AR an autonomous driving.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.415
AI is revolutionizing

00:01:06.415 --> 00:01:09.418
what our connected devices can do.

00:01:13.923 --> 00:01:17.460
We will continue to focus on future technologies

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.164
that are safe and responsible.

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:33.542
For AI to be transformational.

00:01:33.542 --> 00:01:38.614
Its capabilities must be safe and accessible to all.

00:01:56.515 --> 00:01:57.716
Good afternoon.

00:01:57.716 --> 00:02:03.105
Please welcome CEO and Head of Device Experience
Division at Samsung Electronics.

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:06.124
JH Han.

00:02:16.385 --> 00:02:17.703
Hello.

00:02:17.703 --> 00:02:20.789
Welcome to  CES 2025.

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:25.644
It's great to see you again!

00:02:26.061 --> 00:02:30.599
Last year we shared our vision of ‘AI for all’

00:02:31.466 --> 00:02:35.420
Really combining the intelligence
and connected devices

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.474
to create unparalleled experience for everyone.

00:02:41.126 --> 00:02:42.093
It’s a vision

00:02:42.093 --> 00:02:45.096
that actually started in 2014

00:02:45.096 --> 00:02:46.932
when we said, right here at CES,

00:02:48.183 --> 00:02:52.053
that our homes would be smart in a decade.

00:02:54.022 --> 00:02:55.140
today.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.743
I want to redefine what home means to us

00:02:58.743 --> 00:03:03.665
and introduce our roadmap for ‘Home AI’.

00:03:06.184 --> 00:03:07.886
For the past ten years,

00:03:07.886 --> 00:03:12.724
we have led innovation in the home,
making your home smarter

00:03:13.174 --> 00:03:16.161
with every step forward.

00:03:16.678 --> 00:03:19.681
With SmartThings, your connected TVs

00:03:20.098 --> 00:03:22.951
mobile devices and home appliances 

00:03:22.951 --> 00:03:25.954
even cooktops and robot vacuums

00:03:26.554 --> 00:03:31.876
can work together 
to help make life more comfortable.

00:03:33.244 --> 00:03:35.813
Technologies like Calm Onboarding

00:03:35.813 --> 00:03:39.984
can automatically recognize and connect devices

00:03:40.735 --> 00:03:45.273
helping users make the most of their smart home experience

00:03:47.191 --> 00:03:51.112
And it's more than 340 SmartThings partners,

00:03:53.181 --> 00:03:57.068
the possibilities are greater than ever.

00:03:58.653 --> 00:04:01.656
Now it's time to take the next step

00:04:01.656 --> 00:04:03.558
and share how we will again

00:04:03.558 --> 00:04:08.930
reshape our industry with ‘Home AI’

00:04:10.881 --> 00:04:13.884
First and foremost,

00:04:13.884 --> 00:04:16.671
our top priority

00:04:16.671 --> 00:04:21.025
will always be safety and security.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.313
Samsung Knox was about 10 years ago

00:04:26.313 --> 00:04:30.201
a mobile security platform that has evolved

00:04:30.201 --> 00:04:33.754
into a comprehensive security system.

00:04:35.523 --> 00:04:38.526
And the new Knox Matrix Dashboard

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:41.962
makes it even more intuitive

00:04:42.062 --> 00:04:45.065
to manage your Home AI security.

00:04:46.617 --> 00:04:49.353
We are also expanding Knox Vault

00:04:49.353 --> 00:04:52.323
to include the home appliances

00:04:52.323 --> 00:04:57.511
such as refrigerators, ovens, washers and more.

00:05:00.364 --> 00:05:03.634
As in mobile devices and TVs, 

00:05:03.634 --> 00:05:06.620
home appliances with comparable hardware

00:05:07.654 --> 00:05:10.641
will protect sensitive data

00:05:10.641 --> 00:05:13.644
from the hardware up.

00:05:14.545 --> 00:05:17.731
Second, the way we live is evolving, 

00:05:17.731 --> 00:05:21.001
and with it, the role of the home, too.

00:05:23.103 --> 00:05:26.089
Single person households,

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:28.075
shared houses

00:05:28.075 --> 00:05:29.776
roommates and pets,

00:05:29.776 --> 00:05:31.978
and multi-generational families.

00:05:33.263 --> 00:05:35.315
in various forms,

00:05:35.315 --> 00:05:39.386
We rest, walk, exercise and create at home.

00:05:41.421 --> 00:05:43.523
These changes mean

00:05:43.523 --> 00:05:46.977
personalization is all the more important.

00:05:49.312 --> 00:05:51.047
With Home AI,

00:05:51.047 --> 00:05:53.400
Samsung is creating experiences

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.270
that go beyond connection and automation.

00:05:59.256 --> 00:06:02.993
Home AI can help you save time as well as energy

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.580
It can help you keep your family and your home safe,

00:06:08.932 --> 00:06:12.719
and it can recommend what you need
before you even know it

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.323
to live better, easier, and simpler.

00:06:19.292 --> 00:06:20.960
By understanding

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.812
all of these unique needs

00:06:22.812 --> 00:06:27.684
Home AI can infuse more comfort and joy

00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:30.637
into your life.

00:06:31.471 --> 00:06:35.942
Truly, Samsung is leading the Home AI revolution

00:06:36.442 --> 00:06:39.829
by harnessing expertise across the device

00:06:40.713 --> 00:06:43.700
components and software.

00:06:44.884 --> 00:06:48.755
I'm proud of how we introduced

00:06:48.755 --> 00:06:52.492
new technologies and intelligence to the Home,

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.879
conducted the Things, and set the standard

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:59.882
for the Home of the Future.

00:07:01.617 --> 00:07:05.605
We will continue this journey of Home AI leadership,

00:07:06.506 --> 00:07:09.775
not just for the next decade,

00:07:09.775 --> 00:07:13.195
but for the next century.

00:07:15.231 --> 00:07:18.234
And we don't stop at the Home.

00:07:18.234 --> 00:07:20.336
My colleagues have to share

00:07:20.336 --> 00:07:23.372
how we are working to expand

00:07:23.372 --> 00:07:27.209
the benefits of Home AI into other industries

00:07:27.209 --> 00:07:30.212
and into society, too.

00:07:31.497 --> 00:07:34.500
Shall we jump in?

00:07:38.787 --> 00:07:40.372
Enjoy!

00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:55.804
Please.

00:07:55.804 --> 00:07:57.022
Welcome to the stage.

00:07:57.022 --> 00:08:00.809
Head of connected experience center
at Samsung Electronics America.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.530
Jonathan Gabrio

00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:10.469
Hello.

00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:13.472
It's the age of Home AI.

00:08:13.739 --> 00:08:16.558
and as JH just mentioned, Samsung

00:08:16.558 --> 00:08:19.711
has been charting this path for the last decade.

00:08:20.696 --> 00:08:22.915
We've brought intelligent,

00:08:22.915 --> 00:08:26.068
powerful, and personalized experiences,

00:08:26.068 --> 00:08:29.521
leveraging every breakthrough advancement
we could dream up

00:08:29.521 --> 00:08:32.524
to make AI work for you.

00:08:33.425 --> 00:08:37.579
Now, your devices are smart and they're connected.

00:08:38.697 --> 00:08:41.400
They have learned your likes and dislikes,

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.820
your routines,
your health concerns and medical details.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.939
Even your voice.

00:08:47.939 --> 00:08:52.677
With data like this, it's critical
that we ensure it's managed securely

00:08:54.062 --> 00:08:57.866
For as long as we've been investing
in intelligent connectivity.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:02.871
We've also been investing in strong security.

00:09:04.205 --> 00:09:07.943
Knox is Samsung's comprehensive security platform

00:09:07.943 --> 00:09:10.945
that helps keep your Home AI safe.

00:09:12.364 --> 00:09:15.867
Knox matrix uses blockchain technology

00:09:15.867 --> 00:09:19.671
so your devices work together
to protect each other from security threats.

00:09:21.022 --> 00:09:25.710
If a device is compromised, your Knox Secured
home will know which one to isolate,

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:28.713
keeping the rest of your smart home safe.

00:09:29.731 --> 00:09:32.116
And when information is passed across devices, 

00:09:32.116 --> 00:09:34.085
Knox Credentials Sync

00:09:34.085 --> 00:09:38.640
ensures that data can only be encrypted
and decrypted on the user's devices.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.009
so nobody but the user can see it.

00:09:41.009 --> 00:09:45.079
even if a server or an account is compromised.

00:09:46.281 --> 00:09:49.133
And with the new Knox Matrix Dashboard,

00:09:49.133 --> 00:09:51.602
you can see the status of all your devices

00:09:51.602 --> 00:09:57.058
and even prompt security updates
right from your connected screen equipped device.

00:09:57.091 --> 00:10:01.829
Whether it's a smartphone, tablet,
TV, refrigerator, laundry combo, you get the idea.

00:10:03.564 --> 00:10:05.032
As for Knox Vault,

00:10:05.032 --> 00:10:08.035
we will extend it beyond mobile devices and TVs

00:10:08.035 --> 00:10:11.038
to our home appliances.

00:10:11.272 --> 00:10:15.176
Knox vault uses the technology
from our secure processors

00:10:15.176 --> 00:10:19.347
to isolate your most sensitive details

00:10:19.614 --> 00:10:22.850
like PINs, passwords, and biometrics from other details

00:10:23.217 --> 00:10:25.186
so your data is kept securely and separately,

00:10:25.186 --> 00:10:27.688
increasing security.

00:10:29.073 --> 00:10:33.244
And as AI makes the need for security and privacy greater,

00:10:33.244 --> 00:10:36.630
we're also leveraging smarter technologies
for security solutions, too.

00:10:37.515 --> 00:10:41.902
Edge AI, collects diverse data
from your connected devices, 

00:10:41.902 --> 00:10:46.891
and analyzes real time contacts to orchestrate
how they work together.

00:10:48.242 --> 00:10:49.894
The key is,

00:10:49.894 --> 00:10:54.081
Edge AI processes this data within your local network

00:10:54.081 --> 00:10:57.084
so your information stays at home.

00:10:57.785 --> 00:10:59.903
So, as your experiences

00:10:59.903 --> 00:11:02.973
get more intuitive and your days get more simple,

00:11:02.973 --> 00:11:06.777
you never have to feel lost in managing your data.

00:11:08.395 --> 00:11:09.146
Now, of course,

00:11:09.146 --> 00:11:12.332
the data we're protecting is different for everyone

00:11:12.332 --> 00:11:14.968
depending on how you use your devices.

00:11:14.968 --> 00:11:19.790
For me, I'm juggling schedules with my kids
and meal prepping for the entire family.

00:11:20.491 --> 00:11:23.577
But maybe you're trying to keep 
your electricity bill low,

00:11:23.577 --> 00:11:28.348
or you're a freelancer going from coffee shop,
to an office, to home, and back.

00:11:29.666 --> 00:11:31.735
In every case,

00:11:31.735 --> 00:11:35.339
our teams are working to create solutions
that work for you.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.894
To create a world 
where technology doesn't ask you to change,

00:11:40.894 --> 00:11:43.947
but adapts to the life that you've created.

00:11:45.082 --> 00:11:49.903
We call this experience Home AI.

00:11:49.903 --> 00:11:52.472
Powered by your SmartThings connected devices.

00:11:52.472 --> 00:11:57.327
Home AI creates an intelligent ecosystem
that learns, understands,

00:11:57.327 --> 00:12:00.680
and adapts to how you and your loved ones

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.682
live, work, and entertain.

00:12:03.633 --> 00:12:07.470
The first step is streamlining
how you interact with your devices.

00:12:09.005 --> 00:12:13.343
Samsung provides an integrated software experience
across their connected devices,

00:12:13.343 --> 00:12:18.181
enabling them to work better together
and enhancing the AI experience.

00:12:19.416 --> 00:12:22.402
That experience is One UI

00:12:23.186 --> 00:12:25.188
First introduced in the smartphone.

00:12:25.188 --> 00:12:28.958
One UI has been expanded
to cover the entire ecosystem, 

00:12:29.309 --> 00:12:31.678
including  TVs and home appliances.

00:12:31.678 --> 00:12:35.098
Designed to create a cohesive
and harmonious user experience.

00:12:35.098 --> 00:12:40.103
One UI also supports software updates for up
to seven years, bringing consistency

00:12:40.103 --> 00:12:42.405
to your Home AII experiences.

00:12:43.289 --> 00:12:47.427
These streamlined, personalized services come to life with AI.

00:12:48.561 --> 00:12:52.715
Say your parents living with you
and they use high contrast setting on their phone

00:12:53.066 --> 00:12:56.703
when they ask the refrigerator's
food list for grocery recommendations,

00:12:56.703 --> 00:12:59.856
or the bespoke air laundry combo
to recommend a new cycle.

00:13:00.239 --> 00:13:02.658
Thanks to Bixby and One UI, 

00:13:02.658 --> 00:13:06.446
it will automatically display everything in high contrast mode.

00:13:06.446 --> 00:13:07.497
Just like your phone.

00:13:09.115 --> 00:13:13.136
This is made possible by bringing 
speaker recognition to Bixby,

00:13:13.136 --> 00:13:15.755
so it can recognize individual voices

00:13:15.755 --> 00:13:18.741
and identify each member of your household

00:13:18.741 --> 00:13:21.844
to respond to their commands in a way that works

00:13:21.844 --> 00:13:23.212
for them.

00:13:25.047 --> 00:13:28.884
Powered by spatial AI, SmartThings ambient sensing

00:13:28.884 --> 00:13:33.305
will go beyond just understanding 
your commands to process context,

00:13:33.873 --> 00:13:36.359
so will route your requests to the right devices,

00:13:36.359 --> 00:13:39.362
rooms, and features, all automatically.

00:13:39.845 --> 00:13:43.199
This means Home AI will know
when you’ve fallen asleep ,watching a movie

00:13:43.649 --> 00:13:45.751
and turn off the lights,

00:13:46.352 --> 00:13:48.354
or after you’ve blow dried your hair,

00:13:48.354 --> 00:13:51.357
It will be able to send in the robot vacuum
to do a targeted clean,

00:13:52.892 --> 00:13:56.061
And if you're away,
it will keep you updated on your pets.

00:13:56.061 --> 00:13:59.064
Just like a video diary!

00:14:00.382 --> 00:14:02.601
There's more our AI can do to help you not

00:14:02.601 --> 00:14:05.704
just enjoy those little moments,
but save for the big ones too.

00:14:06.538 --> 00:14:10.259
With home insight and smart things,
you can have a better handle

00:14:10.259 --> 00:14:14.029
on your electricity usage across
all of your SmartThings connected devices.

00:14:14.463 --> 00:14:18.634
Optimize when you turn things on and off and lower
those electricity bills.

00:14:18.634 --> 00:14:20.369
That can be a huge cost savings.

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:23.055
I'm also happy to share 

00:14:23.055 --> 00:14:26.492
that our energy demand response program
with Smart Things, called Flex Connect,

00:14:26.842 --> 00:14:29.845
is coming to even more homes in the United States.

00:14:30.479 --> 00:14:31.880
With Flex Connect

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:36.835
Smarting incentivizes users in New York and California
to enroll in devices

00:14:36.835 --> 00:14:40.789
and use SmartThings energy
to decrease strain on the electricity grids.

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:45.143
Users can even redeem their Samsung 
Rewards points from Flex Connect

00:14:45.143 --> 00:14:48.146
on their next Samsung.com purchase.

00:14:49.214 --> 00:14:54.419
Now, Flex Connect will also be coming to select regions 
in Texas in 2025, helping address

00:14:54.419 --> 00:14:57.539
electrical grid needs in the state.

00:14:58.824 --> 00:15:02.661
With Home AI,
we help you save both energy and time.

00:15:03.662 --> 00:15:06.031
We're adding up all those little moments

00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:08.700
so you can spend more time doing 
what matters to you most.

00:15:09.801 --> 00:15:12.954
One way where just using their
or you're boosting your productivity

00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:15.390
that I'm excited to share today

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:19.194
is our new Galaxy Book 5 Pro 
and Galaxy Book 5 360.

00:15:19.561 --> 00:15:22.564
Our latest AI PCs.

00:15:23.431 --> 00:15:27.852
Galaxy Book 5 Pro and Galaxy Book 5 360 
offer even more choice

00:15:27.852 --> 00:15:30.171
for users who want next level performance

00:15:30.171 --> 00:15:33.174
for productivity, creativity, and connectivity.

00:15:34.793 --> 00:15:38.446
AI Select helps you access 
quality search results

00:15:38.446 --> 00:15:43.384
faster and easier
while browsing, shopping or viewing.

00:15:45.053 --> 00:15:48.389
You can seamlessly work across 
your smartphone or tablet PC

00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:53.278
with features like Samsung Studio to edit creative
projects at home and on the go or wherever.

00:15:53.278 --> 00:15:55.430
Inspiration strikes.

00:15:56.214 --> 00:15:59.884
And new Storage Share lets you move files

00:15:59.884 --> 00:16:03.004
between your Galaxy smartphone, 
your tablet and your PC

00:16:03.021 --> 00:16:06.024
into one complete bank of storage.

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:11.396
Now, to do all of this, Galaxy Book 5 Pro
and Galaxy Book 5 360

00:16:11.396 --> 00:16:14.632
are powered by the latest Intel Core Ultra processors

00:16:15.116 --> 00:16:18.986
and we have the CEO of Intel products,
Michelle Johnson Holthaus.

00:16:18.986 --> 00:16:19.921
To tell you more.

00:16:21.589 --> 00:16:23.858
Hi everyone. Michelle Johnston Holthaus here-

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:27.812
interim co-CEO of Intel and CEO of Intel Products.

00:16:27.812 --> 00:16:32.300
It's great to be partnering with Samsung,
one of our most innovative collaborators.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:38.472
AI is fundamentally transforming,
reshaping and restructuring the PC experience.

00:16:38.472 --> 00:16:41.659
with groundbreaking products like Intel Core Ultra,

00:16:41.659 --> 00:16:44.261
customers are seeing the benefits of AI PCs

00:16:44.261 --> 00:16:47.064
nearly immediately – saving time

00:16:47.064 --> 00:16:49.333
providing more secure business experiences,

00:16:49.333 --> 00:16:51.235
and driving efficiencies.

00:16:51.235 --> 00:16:55.339
Millions of these computers are deployed in the market already.

00:16:55.339 --> 00:17:00.661
At the core of every great IPC is an exceptional PC,

00:17:00.661 --> 00:17:04.565
and we're proud to have Samsung as
a valued partner on this journey.

00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:08.419
2025 promises to be even more exciting

00:17:08.419 --> 00:17:10.154
through our core engineering efforts,

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:13.874
we've created the Samsung Galaxy Book 5 Pro, 

00:17:13.874 --> 00:17:18.796
designed to elevate creativity and productivity for its users.

00:17:18.796 --> 00:17:23.384
And we’re taking it a step further this year – 
we're expanding beyond B2C 

00:17:23.384 --> 00:17:28.439
and taking AI PCs, like the Galaxy Book, to businesses globally.

00:17:28.439 --> 00:17:30.641
Congrats to Team Samsung

00:17:30.641 --> 00:17:34.228
on the launch of the Galaxy Book5 Pro!

00:17:34.228 --> 00:17:37.731
This brand embodies innovation and progress,

00:17:37.731 --> 00:17:39.917
and Intel looks forward to many more years of

00:17:39.917 --> 00:17:42.886
creating groundbreaking products together.

00:17:42.886 --> 00:17:44.538
Thank you for having me.

00:17:45.005 --> 00:17:48.925
Please welcome to the stage
Senior Vice President of Digital Health Team

00:17:48.925 --> 00:17:51.478
at Samsung Electronics Hon Park.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.985
Hi everyone.

00:17:58.985 --> 00:18:01.555
You've heard a lot about Home AI,

00:18:01.555 --> 00:18:06.143
How we're integrating smarter features
into our existing experiences to enhance your life.

00:18:07.711 --> 00:18:11.998
I'm excited to be here to talk to you
about how our connected devices, combined

00:18:11.998 --> 00:18:16.920
with Samsung Health, 
help you take control of your health and wellness.

00:18:17.938 --> 00:18:22.108
You may be familiar with our wearables
like the Galaxy Wing and Galaxy Watch

00:18:22.676 --> 00:18:25.462
that work alongside our smartphones

00:18:25.462 --> 00:18:28.415
to integrate the sensors that monitor heart rate,

00:18:28.415 --> 00:18:31.401
stress, sleep, and so much more.

00:18:32.152 --> 00:18:38.441
But what truly sets Samsung Health apart
is how these devices come together and integrate seamlessly,

00:18:38.441 --> 00:18:40.643
not just with mobile products,

00:18:40.643 --> 00:18:43.530
but across your entire home.

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:46.199
We're all busy, and keeping ourselves

00:18:46.199 --> 00:18:49.202
and our families healthy can be challenging.

00:18:50.003 --> 00:18:54.958
Our vision is to use AI
and all the connected devices at home,

00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:58.161
and create a truly an End-to-End health experience,

00:18:58.895 --> 00:19:02.365
making it easier to help you create healthier habits

00:19:02.365 --> 00:19:04.534
and detect abnormalities earlier on.

00:19:05.969 --> 00:19:11.124
Plus, we're working with industry leading partners 
to use our home AI insights

00:19:11.124 --> 00:19:14.794
to create a more personal,
seamless health experiences.

00:19:16.112 --> 00:19:20.633
I'm very happy to announce that one of
these efforts is our continued work with Dexcom.

00:19:21.534 --> 00:19:26.639
Dexcom biosensors
track glucose, providing people with accurate,

00:19:26.639 --> 00:19:30.243
timely insights into our food, medication, sleep,

00:19:30.243 --> 00:19:32.495
and exercise impact our health.

00:19:33.045 --> 00:19:37.550
In the future, Integrating these insights 
with Samsung's AI appliances

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:40.403
SmartThings and Samsung Health.

00:19:40.403 --> 00:19:45.891
We envision a new, more personalized way
to empower millions more people

00:19:45.891 --> 00:19:49.745
to manage their diabetes
and overall metabolic health.

00:19:50.546 --> 00:19:53.816
With partners like these, we can offer a truly

00:19:53.816 --> 00:19:56.819
end-to-end  health experience
right from your living room.

00:19:58.104 --> 00:20:01.173
Let's take a look at two ways this comes to life.

00:20:01.824 --> 00:20:04.710
The first is sleep.

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:10.015
As all of you know, globally about
62% of the adults say they don't get enough sleep.

00:20:10.699 --> 00:20:12.601
We all know that poor sleep

00:20:12.601 --> 00:20:16.355
leads to increased physical and mental health problems

00:20:16.355 --> 00:20:18.741
and that a good night's sleep is essential

00:20:18.741 --> 00:20:21.744
to your health and wellness.

00:20:22.077 --> 00:20:25.197
With the data from your Galaxy Ring or Galaxy Watch,

00:20:25.197 --> 00:20:29.752
Samsung Health uses AI 
to recommend ways to address your concerns.

00:20:30.686 --> 00:20:33.322
So, say you're having difficulty falling asleep

00:20:33.322 --> 00:20:36.992
and waking up “hot” at 3am every night.

00:20:37.409 --> 00:20:38.277
Samsung Health,

00:20:38.277 --> 00:20:43.982
hand in hand with SmartThings, can help
automatically optimize your sleeping environment.

00:20:43.982 --> 00:20:47.069
For example, 
you can have your blinds closed before you go to bed,

00:20:47.069 --> 00:20:50.789
or turn down your thermostat
by a couple of degrees at 2:30 a.m.

00:20:51.056 --> 00:20:53.942
to see if this improves your sleep

00:20:53.942 --> 00:20:57.212
or if you're waking up tired consistently.

00:20:57.479 --> 00:21:00.999
It may be related to a medical
condition called sleep apnea.

00:21:01.983 --> 00:21:04.119
Our Galaxy Watch with Samsung Health

00:21:04.119 --> 00:21:07.472
can detect signs of moderate to severe sleep apnea,

00:21:07.472 --> 00:21:12.093
and if your data shows any concerning trends, 
Samsung Health will recommend

00:21:12.093 --> 00:21:15.080
that you consult your doctor to learn more.

00:21:16.314 --> 00:21:21.269
Of course, nutrition is also an important factor to our health.

00:21:21.269 --> 00:21:24.022
Samsung Health and Samsung Food

00:21:24.022 --> 00:21:27.125
makes it easier for you to eat healthier at home.

00:21:27.125 --> 00:21:31.279
For example, if you're following a diet,
you can include your goals in Samsung Health

00:21:31.947 --> 00:21:35.583
and Samsung Food will be able to recommend
appropriate recipes

00:21:35.583 --> 00:21:39.354
based on the ingredients
that you have in the Family Hub fridge.

00:21:40.372 --> 00:21:45.293
You'll also be able to receive an AI based summary
and insights of your nutrition trends.

00:21:45.293 --> 00:21:49.798
So if you're missing certain nutrients
or over indexing on others,

00:21:49.798 --> 00:21:54.786
you can receive recommendations
and take the guesswork out of meal planning.

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.572
As we look to the future,

00:21:57.572 --> 00:22:01.843
connected health power by AI 
can help us make sense of our data,

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:07.649
and empower us to make a meaningful
and powerful positive difference 

00:22:07.649 --> 00:22:10.251
in how we live our lives.

00:22:10.251 --> 00:22:11.753
I look forward to seeing you at our booth

00:22:11.753 --> 00:22:15.506
to show you how Samsung will help care for
you and your loved ones.

00:22:15.506 --> 00:22:16.641
Thank you very much.

00:22:18.443 --> 00:22:20.995
Please
welcome to the Stage Corporate communications

00:22:20.995 --> 00:22:24.031
professional at Samsung Electronics America,

00:22:24.031 --> 00:22:27.034
Alana Gomez Solis.

00:22:29.937 --> 00:22:31.389
Hello CES!

00:22:34.192 --> 00:22:35.493
As you've heard,

00:22:35.493 --> 00:22:38.763
Samsung's Home AI is making a big difference

00:22:38.763 --> 00:22:41.749
in how we use the smart devices we have at home.

00:22:42.416 --> 00:22:46.871
But figuring out where to start
that can feel complicated.

00:22:47.555 --> 00:22:50.091
So I challenge myself

00:22:50.091 --> 00:22:53.461
to integrate AI into my life in my apartment.

00:22:53.728 --> 00:22:55.613
And as many ways as I could.

00:22:56.764 --> 00:23:00.534
Now I'm here to share some of those tips and tricks

00:23:00.534 --> 00:23:04.555
that help make my busy days in New York
so much easier.

00:23:04.889 --> 00:23:07.892
From morning tonight.

00:23:09.109 --> 00:23:12.112
Now let's start on a Monday morning.

00:23:12.563 --> 00:23:14.281
While I catch up on my emails,

00:23:14.281 --> 00:23:17.284
I'm usually thinking about meal planning for the week

00:23:17.735 --> 00:23:21.388
and all of the chores that I put off over the weekend.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.175
To be honest, it can be a little stressful.

00:23:25.175 --> 00:23:28.162
But with AI on Samsung's latest TVs,

00:23:28.912 --> 00:23:34.101
my new refrigerators,
9 inch AI home, and the bespoke AI laundry combo

00:23:34.651 --> 00:23:37.704
crossing things off my to do list is a lot easier.

00:23:39.389 --> 00:23:43.494
While enjoying my morning coffee in the kitchen,
I use my Refrigerator's

00:23:43.494 --> 00:23:47.965
AI home screen to check my schedule for the day
and the weather forecast.

00:23:48.182 --> 00:23:51.001
So I can pick out the perfect outfit

00:23:52.436 --> 00:23:53.554
during lunch.

00:23:53.554 --> 00:23:56.540
I always check in on my dog Pierre.

00:23:57.291 --> 00:23:59.793
his lovely friend, my jet bot combo.

00:23:59.793 --> 00:24:03.664
I will pay him a visit
so I can see through its camera

00:24:03.664 --> 00:24:07.584
on my SmartThings app 
that he is, of course, taking a nap.

00:24:08.735 --> 00:24:13.073
And after a long day at work,
I look forward to trying new recipes.

00:24:13.073 --> 00:24:17.394
So I love that I can easily
see what's in my fridge from the food list

00:24:17.394 --> 00:24:20.397
made by AI vision inside.

00:24:21.381 --> 00:24:23.483
My refrigerator screen shows me that

00:24:23.483 --> 00:24:27.087
I have just enough spinach, eggs, and tomatoes,

00:24:27.454 --> 00:24:30.624
but I need to order more milk
through Instacart for tomorrow morning

00:24:32.242 --> 00:24:33.360
when I'm ready to cook.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:38.615
I search for the recipe and send it over
to the seven inch AI home screen on my range.

00:24:39.449 --> 00:24:42.652
This lets me easily
follow the perfect quiche recipe.

00:24:42.652 --> 00:24:44.187
I've been dying to make.

00:24:44.187 --> 00:24:46.773
No skipped steps or missed ingredients

00:24:48.358 --> 00:24:49.375
after dinner.

00:24:49.375 --> 00:24:52.562
Before I get too relaxed, I need to do my laundry,

00:24:52.862 --> 00:24:55.865
which used to be my least favorite chore.

00:24:56.749 --> 00:24:59.002
The bespoke AI laundry combo

00:24:59.002 --> 00:25:04.140
a washer and dryer in a single unit is perfect

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.143
for making the best use of my apartment space.

00:25:08.011 --> 00:25:10.313
Now I can finally binge

00:25:10.313 --> 00:25:13.316
a few episodes of my comfort show.

00:25:13.349 --> 00:25:15.485
But listen, I have to admit

00:25:15.485 --> 00:25:19.889
I'm guilty of taking out my phone,
falling down the internet rabbit hole,

00:25:19.889 --> 00:25:23.209
searching every guest actor
I know I've seen before.

00:25:23.693 --> 00:25:26.696
I just can't remember from where.

00:25:26.913 --> 00:25:29.832
Well, with the click to search feature,

00:25:29.832 --> 00:25:34.821
I can just push the AI button on my remote
and get information on the actor.

00:25:35.254 --> 00:25:40.109
Other shows they've been in, and even recommended
shows just like the one I'm watching.

00:25:40.676 --> 00:25:42.895
So no more rabbit holes!

00:25:44.397 --> 00:25:45.298
Of course,

00:25:45.298 --> 00:25:49.619
having a great picture is still so important to me
when watching TV,

00:25:49.619 --> 00:25:54.840
but it can get annoying if I have to
change the picture mode and the settings

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.843
Every time I watch a different show.

00:25:58.828 --> 00:26:04.550
Samsung's new AI mode works behind the scenes 
to detect the content you're watching 

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:06.202
and automatically optimize

00:26:06.202 --> 00:26:11.924
both picture and sound 
based on your viewing environment or preferences.

00:26:14.426 --> 00:26:16.295
Samsung is also using AI

00:26:16.295 --> 00:26:19.348
in other ways to make things more personal.

00:26:19.348 --> 00:26:23.369
I spent a ton of time
making sure my apartment reflects my style,

00:26:23.752 --> 00:26:26.755
and that includes the art I put on my walls

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.476
with the generative wallpaper feature.

00:26:30.476 --> 00:26:33.445
Your compatible Samsung TV can instantly

00:26:33.445 --> 00:26:36.448
create pictures that match your taste.

00:26:36.632 --> 00:26:39.635
And starting this year,

00:26:40.135 --> 00:26:43.072
all Samsung QLED TVs,

00:26:43.072 --> 00:26:48.210
along with the Frame
and micro LED will feature Samsung Art store

00:26:48.544 --> 00:26:52.648
with over 3,000 pieces of art
that you can display anywhere.

00:26:52.648 --> 00:26:54.533
You have a compatible Samsung TV.

00:26:55.984 --> 00:26:59.004
It's like bringing the best of MOMA

00:26:59.004 --> 00:27:02.241
and Musee d'Orsay right to your living room.

00:27:03.325 --> 00:27:06.411
Actually, it's just that.

00:27:06.712 --> 00:27:10.766
Well, you know
how time flies, especially when watching TV,

00:27:10.766 --> 00:27:13.769
but it's really time to finish my laundry.

00:27:15.053 --> 00:27:17.222
Since the bespoke I laundry combo

00:27:17.222 --> 00:27:22.110
completed the cycle without me
having to switch it from washing to drying,

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:25.764
I was able to enjoy the entire show without interruption.

00:27:27.449 --> 00:27:32.454
It also comes with a seven inch screen
for ultimate multitasking,

00:27:32.454 --> 00:27:36.274
which means I can turn on music
or answer a phone call

00:27:36.274 --> 00:27:41.263
directly from the combo
while I organize my fresh, clean clothes.

00:27:43.148 --> 00:27:47.585
We've talked a lot about 
how intelligence makes life more convenient,

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:51.723
and now I want to share

00:27:51.723 --> 00:27:55.260
just one more way we're combining intelligence

00:27:55.944 --> 00:27:59.013
and technology into one tiny,

00:27:59.931 --> 00:28:03.001
cute, and seriously smart bundle.

00:28:04.469 --> 00:28:06.905
I'm happy to announce that Ballie,

00:28:06.905 --> 00:28:10.024
the smart AI companion, will be available

00:28:10.024 --> 00:28:13.011
in the first half of 2025.

00:28:17.415 --> 00:28:22.437
Ballie is an AI home companion
that continuously learns and evolves

00:28:22.437 --> 00:28:27.925
to understand and get to know you,
providing personalized experience over time.

00:28:30.411 --> 00:28:35.583
With AI and our latest appliances
and screen experiences throughout my home.

00:28:35.583 --> 00:28:39.921
I can make every day a little easier
and a little more me.

00:28:41.005 --> 00:28:44.075
I hope you can find a few similar ways to do the same.

00:28:44.692 --> 00:28:47.695
Thank you.

00:29:01.826 --> 00:29:03.411
Please welcome to the Stage

00:29:03.411 --> 00:29:07.715
Display product marketing professional
at Samsung Electronics America.

00:29:07.715 --> 00:29:10.701
Sean Michael.

00:29:15.122 --> 00:29:16.774
Hi, everyone.

00:29:16.774 --> 00:29:20.694
So far you've heard of Samsung is embedding
AI across the home

00:29:20.694 --> 00:29:23.697
to make your life
more enjoyable and easier to manage.

00:29:24.331 --> 00:29:29.420
I am thrilled to be here today
to share a few incredible new ways

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.389
SmartThings is going beyond your home

00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:35.459
to bring intelligence to everyday, everywhere.

00:29:36.543 --> 00:29:37.378
Let's start

00:29:37.378 --> 00:29:40.681
with our B2B solution, SmartThings Pro,

00:29:41.732 --> 00:29:42.950
introduced last June.

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:46.954
SmartThings Pro, with compatible devices, 
can make everything

00:29:47.254 --> 00:29:52.176
from your hotel room to your favorite store
just as customizable as your living room.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.213
We created Smart Things Pro to bring the same

00:29:56.213 --> 00:29:59.583
AI powered digital solutions to business partners.

00:29:59.583 --> 00:30:02.569
As SmartThings brings to millions of consumers.

00:30:02.936 --> 00:30:05.122
So with SmartThings Pro,

00:30:05.122 --> 00:30:08.492
businesses have a one-stop AI-based solution.

00:30:09.242 --> 00:30:13.647
better manage your energy usage,
proactively identify devices

00:30:13.647 --> 00:30:19.086
with maintenance needs, and ultimately take control
of your connected devices and services.

00:30:19.586 --> 00:30:23.006
Whether you're managing multifamily
residential buildings,

00:30:23.006 --> 00:30:26.009
schools, hotels or retail stores,

00:30:27.594 --> 00:30:30.781
say you own a few shops
and they all open at 10AM

00:30:31.615 --> 00:30:32.482
today.

00:30:32.482 --> 00:30:35.585
You might get to your first store at eight to clean.

00:30:35.585 --> 00:30:40.290
Turn the heat up, set the music,
boot up all your devices and get things organized

00:30:41.041 --> 00:30:43.893
before you drive across town at
nine and do it all over again

00:30:45.095 --> 00:30:46.796
with SmartThings Pro.

00:30:46.796 --> 00:30:49.799
All of this can be set up automatically.

00:30:50.517 --> 00:30:54.320
managing multiple locations is seriously simplified,

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.323
helping you save energy and time.

00:30:57.724 --> 00:31:01.411
Or if you're managing a hotel,
Smart Things Pro can offer

00:31:01.411 --> 00:31:05.965
personalized experiences
tailored to each guest preferences.

00:31:05.965 --> 00:31:10.703
Using AI from lighting to temperature, humidity,
even ambient sounds at night,

00:31:10.703 --> 00:31:16.059
Smart Things Pro will ensure their room
gives them a home away from home comfort.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:21.297
For office managers and bigger businesses,
we're working with partners

00:31:21.297 --> 00:31:26.185
to build a new on premise
future space platform for buildings

00:31:26.185 --> 00:31:30.540
and large offices called FIT.

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:33.659
Built to better understand the building’s space
and infrastructure,

00:31:33.659 --> 00:31:36.979
FIT will give you new ways to personalize

00:31:36.979 --> 00:31:40.083
and optimize an office layout.

00:31:40.083 --> 00:31:43.402
Use less AC equipment for a cleaner look

00:31:43.402 --> 00:31:48.741
while reducing electricity costs by controlling
the sunlight coming in and the heating coming out.

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.562
As we look to the future.

00:31:52.562 --> 00:31:55.648
Another new SmartThings collaboration set to make waves is

00:31:55.648 --> 00:31:58.985
with Samsung Heavy Industries.

00:31:59.885 --> 00:32:04.040
Yes, that means SmartThings is coming to ships.

00:32:04.991 --> 00:32:09.145
SmartThings for ships is a new integration
that uses Matter,

00:32:09.145 --> 00:32:12.214
the connectivity standard
to connect with compatible ships.

00:32:12.631 --> 00:32:14.433
Wow. Indeed.

00:32:14.433 --> 00:32:16.852
Start your engine, set the temperature

00:32:16.852 --> 00:32:20.790
and turn on lights with pre sailing mode,
saving the captain

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:23.876
and crew's time and energy to get ready to set sail

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:26.195
while you're on the way.

00:32:26.195 --> 00:32:31.500
Get a complete
look at your ship's compatible power AC systems,

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:35.604
air quality, fire and smoke alarms with care mode.

00:32:36.121 --> 00:32:38.941
Plus, when you're not on the go,

00:32:38.941 --> 00:32:43.495
protection mode is constantly monitoring
for any abnormal activities

00:32:43.495 --> 00:32:46.498
and will alert you immediately if something is off.

00:32:47.166 --> 00:32:49.852
Just like managing your smart home,

00:32:49.852 --> 00:32:52.855
Smart Things for ships gives you all these insights

00:32:52.855 --> 00:32:55.858
with just a glance at the SmartThings
Pro dashboard.

00:32:56.642 --> 00:32:59.895
It makes it easy to stay in control so you

00:32:59.895 --> 00:33:04.049
can be your own captain, 
or at least stay up to date if they are away.

00:33:05.484 --> 00:33:08.704
Of course, not all of us here have a boat.

00:33:09.621 --> 00:33:11.723
But what's really exciting

00:33:11.723 --> 00:33:15.510
is that we're bringing SmartThings Pro 
to a whole new category.

00:33:16.078 --> 00:33:18.964
It demonstrates just how far we've come

00:33:18.964 --> 00:33:21.800
since Samsung set up to connect all devices.

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.803
Way back in 2014.

00:33:25.253 --> 00:33:28.623
we have one more SmartThings integration to share

00:33:28.623 --> 00:33:30.092
when you're on the go.

00:33:30.092 --> 00:33:35.514
SmartThings can still provide the intuitive,
integrated experience as you have at home,

00:33:35.514 --> 00:33:37.616
but now in your car.

00:33:38.633 --> 00:33:40.836
We're working with Hyundai Motor Group

00:33:40.836 --> 00:33:43.822
to bring smart things to your Hyundai EVs.

00:33:43.889 --> 00:33:46.024
With the power of Home AI.

00:33:46.024 --> 00:33:49.494
SmartThings can recommend the best time
to charge your EV

00:33:49.494 --> 00:33:53.932
based on your schedule,
electricity prices, and more.

00:33:54.749 --> 00:33:57.385
Or if there's a power outage in your neighborhood,

00:33:57.385 --> 00:34:03.425
Smart Things Energy will activate battery backup mode,
and together with AI energy mode,

00:34:03.425 --> 00:34:08.913
your car can intelligently power
your home and prioritize the essentials.

00:34:10.849 --> 00:34:12.200
Say you've lost your car

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:15.620
in a crowded parking lot
after maybe holiday shopping.

00:34:16.921 --> 00:34:20.275
Smart Things Find can now help locate your vehicles

00:34:20.275 --> 00:34:23.278
and show them in the SmartThings app.

00:34:23.945 --> 00:34:27.131
These are just some of the ways our Home AI vision

00:34:27.131 --> 00:34:29.901
extends far beyond the home.

00:34:29.901 --> 00:34:32.904
To make life a little bit easier everywhere we go.

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:37.592
Of course, I can't mention automotives

00:34:37.592 --> 00:34:40.344
without bringing up Harman.

00:34:40.344 --> 00:34:45.116
Last year at CES,
we showed you how Harman's ready products

00:34:45.116 --> 00:34:48.152
used AI for better in-cabin experiences.

00:34:48.903 --> 00:34:51.355
These technologies will get even better.

00:34:51.355 --> 00:34:54.892
We're exploring new in-vehicle avatars

00:34:54.892 --> 00:35:00.081
that work with Harman Ready Care 
and Ready Vision to be your digital copilot,

00:35:00.598 --> 00:35:04.185
anticipating what you need and responding naturally

00:35:04.185 --> 00:35:06.537
through voice and visuals

00:35:06.537 --> 00:35:08.422
so you can focus on the road.

00:35:08.939 --> 00:35:11.876
These avatars make the in-vehicle experience friendlier,

00:35:11.876 --> 00:35:14.362
more approachable, and easier to navigate.

00:35:14.362 --> 00:35:18.682
Plus,
they can be customized to match any brand identity

00:35:19.233 --> 00:35:24.171
so vehicle manufacturers can match them
to the lineup's latest look and feel.

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.675
Whether you're on the road

00:35:27.675 --> 00:35:32.479
or planning an island-hopping vacation,
our SmartThings integrations

00:35:32.479 --> 00:35:36.383
bring our home AI vision to much more

00:35:36.383 --> 00:35:38.402
than your living room.

00:35:39.119 --> 00:35:42.439
It's all about using AI to make life easier

00:35:42.439 --> 00:35:45.592
for you, your customers, and for all.

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:49.463
I'm excited for you to try out these experiences
at our booth tomorrow.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.365
Thank you.

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:54.635
Please welcome to the stage

00:35:54.635 --> 00:35:58.672
Vice President of Corporate Sustainability Center
at Samsung Electronics

00:35:58.672 --> 00:36:01.675
InHee Chung.

00:36:08.632 --> 00:36:10.551
Hello everyone!

00:36:10.551 --> 00:36:13.554
It's great to be back on the CES stage.

00:36:14.488 --> 00:36:18.809
All of the innovations you've heard about today
are supported by a commitment

00:36:18.809 --> 00:36:23.280
to harness the power of technology
for a better, more inclusive world.

00:36:24.414 --> 00:36:26.733
Let's take AI a game changer

00:36:26.733 --> 00:36:29.720
for making life simpler and more convenient.

00:36:30.303 --> 00:36:34.925
And the benefits of
AI must extend not just to some, but to all.

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.195
One way we're doing this

00:36:38.195 --> 00:36:42.299
is by introducing diverse
and enhanced accessibility features

00:36:42.299 --> 00:36:45.302
with our AI powered devices and services.

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:51.575
From the moment you start to set up
a new appliance, like a laundry combo,

00:36:51.575 --> 00:36:54.844
you can sync accessibility settings 
on your mobile phone.

00:36:56.429 --> 00:37:00.050
Also, Bixby can recognize each member 
of your household

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:03.003
just by their voice.

00:37:03.003 --> 00:37:04.621
Thanks to this feature,

00:37:04.621 --> 00:37:09.242
your intelligent home will know
when to display your text in high contrast

00:37:09.242 --> 00:37:13.580
across each device
or automatically provide a voice guide

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:16.583
for family members with low vision.

00:37:17.333 --> 00:37:19.953
This will be available for our home appliances

00:37:19.953 --> 00:37:22.956
with touch screens
from the first half of this year.

00:37:24.924 --> 00:37:28.928
We've also used AI to improve our audio subtitles

00:37:28.928 --> 00:37:30.980
available for seven languages

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:33.983
in select TVs and smart monitors,

00:37:35.068 --> 00:37:39.472
Before, our audio subtitles 
played over the original content.

00:37:40.523 --> 00:37:42.992
Now AI knows to separate

00:37:42.992 --> 00:37:46.012
and reduce the volume of the foreign dialog,

00:37:46.012 --> 00:37:49.015
but not the background sounds and effects.

00:37:49.799 --> 00:37:53.035
This allows for a seamless viewing experience

00:37:53.035 --> 00:37:56.789
while the subtitles are read out 
in the language you choose.

00:37:58.925 --> 00:38:01.344
As we look to the future,

00:38:01.344 --> 00:38:04.347
we're also innovating for the next generation.

00:38:05.615 --> 00:38:08.784
Samsung has been running programs
to give young leaders

00:38:08.784 --> 00:38:11.787
opportunities to explore new technologies.

00:38:13.255 --> 00:38:18.361
So for tomorrow is our annual competition,
now in 66 countries,

00:38:18.361 --> 00:38:22.081
that has challenged more than 2.6 million students

00:38:22.081 --> 00:38:25.951
to use science, technology, engineering and math,

00:38:25.951 --> 00:38:29.255
or Stem to bring ideas to life 

00:38:29.255 --> 00:38:33.359
and directly address challenges in their communities.

00:38:34.527 --> 00:38:38.731
During the Olympic and Paralympic Games Paris 2024,

00:38:38.731 --> 00:38:42.234
we have ten teams 
from the solve for tomorrow winners

00:38:42.234 --> 00:38:45.654
who demonstrate the spirit of the Olympics
and invited them

00:38:45.654 --> 00:38:49.858
to a launch ceremony with International Olympic
and Paralympic Committees.

00:38:51.627 --> 00:38:54.697
Together, we are activating a digital community

00:38:54.697 --> 00:38:58.650
that leveragesthe transformative power
of sports and technology

00:38:59.184 --> 00:39:02.187
to make a meaningful difference.

00:39:03.305 --> 00:39:06.708
We have also worked with nearly 180,000 young people 

00:39:06.708 --> 00:39:08.427
across 33 countries

00:39:08.427 --> 00:39:11.430
as part of the Samsung Innovation Campus program.

00:39:12.297 --> 00:39:14.967
Samsung Innovation Campus helps train young people

00:39:14.967 --> 00:39:18.470
 entering the workforce
and emerging technologies like AI

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:24.393
IoT and big data alongside the soft skills 
needed when starting a new job.

00:39:25.944 --> 00:39:28.013
Beyond these programs at Samsung,

00:39:28.013 --> 00:39:32.517
we also work with incredible partners
who share our sustainability goals.

00:39:34.086 --> 00:39:36.355
I am delighted to introduce Achim Steiner

00:39:36.355 --> 00:39:39.441
from the United Nations Development Program.

00:39:39.441 --> 00:39:42.127
Let's hear from Achim to share more.

00:39:42.661 --> 00:39:43.962
My name is Adam Steiner.

00:39:43.962 --> 00:39:46.998
I had the United Nations Development Program,

00:39:46.998 --> 00:39:48.650
also known as UNDP.

00:39:49.017 --> 00:39:49.968
Five years ago,

00:39:49.968 --> 00:39:51.903
Samsung and UNDP embarked

00:39:51.903 --> 00:39:53.388
on a bold journeybto harness

00:39:53.388 --> 00:39:55.006
the power of ‘technology for good’.

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:56.558
Together, we created

00:39:56.558 --> 00:39:59.094
the Samsung Global Goals App.

00:39:59.844 --> 00:40:01.212
To date, the app has raised

00:40:01.212 --> 00:40:04.616
over 20 million dollars for the Global Goals

00:40:04.616 --> 00:40:07.569
thanks to the nearly 300 million users

00:40:07.569 --> 00:40:11.539
who are using a Galaxy smartphone, tablet or watch,

00:40:11.539 --> 00:40:13.258
This initiative is a testament

00:40:13.258 --> 00:40:14.759
to the power of technology

00:40:14.759 --> 00:40:17.712
in enabling people to take meaningful action,

00:40:17.712 --> 00:40:20.882
whether it's tackling poverty, driving climate action 

00:40:20.882 --> 00:40:23.735
or advancing gender equality.

00:40:23.735 --> 00:40:25.120
Moreover, through Samsung's

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:27.005
cutting edge galaxy technology,

00:40:27.005 --> 00:40:29.691
mentorship and networking opportunities,

00:40:29.691 --> 00:40:32.243
our Joint Generation 17 program

00:40:32.243 --> 00:40:34.445
is empowering extraordinary young leaders

00:40:34.445 --> 00:40:35.630
across the world

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:37.715
while mobilizing their communities

00:40:37.715 --> 00:40:39.584
to advance the global goals.

00:40:40.285 --> 00:40:41.286
I'm deeply proud

00:40:41.286 --> 00:40:44.439
of what we have achieved together so far.

00:40:44.439 --> 00:40:47.108
Let's continue forging new digital pathways

00:40:47.108 --> 00:40:50.611
that connect us to a sustainable future for all.

00:40:50.611 --> 00:40:52.830
Thank you and back to you.

00:40:53.915 --> 00:40:56.033
Thank you. Achim!

00:40:56.033 --> 00:40:59.153
We believe that technology plays a crucial role

00:40:59.153 --> 00:41:01.923
in creating a better society for everyone.

00:41:03.191 --> 00:41:06.711
We will continue to work 
with global partners, including UNDP,

00:41:06.711 --> 00:41:08.462
so that technology can create

00:41:08.462 --> 00:41:11.465
a sustainable society for future generations.

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:15.653
Now let me bring JH back to the stage.

00:41:47.902 --> 00:41:51.305
Our vision for Home AI

00:41:51.305 --> 00:41:54.825
goes beyond the concept of a ‘Smart Home.’

00:41:56.126 --> 00:41:59.430
The ‘Intelligent Home’ will understand you 

00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:03.050
recognizing family members
and making recommendations 

00:42:03.834 --> 00:42:07.104
based on usage patterns.

00:42:07.104 --> 00:42:10.491
It will provide truly personalized services

00:42:11.241 --> 00:42:14.244
tailored to your needs.

00:42:14.611 --> 00:42:17.614
I can't wait for you to experience

00:42:18.866 --> 00:42:22.469
Samsung’s Home AI at our booth!

00:42:24.905 --> 00:42:26.123

00:42:38.251 --> 00:42:41.254
