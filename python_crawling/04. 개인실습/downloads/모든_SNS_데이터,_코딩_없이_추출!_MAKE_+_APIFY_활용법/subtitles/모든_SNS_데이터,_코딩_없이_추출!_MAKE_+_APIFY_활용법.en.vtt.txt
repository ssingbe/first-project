It 00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 align:start position:0% 00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.710 align:start position:0% was put in in advance, 00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 align:start position:0% was put in in advance, 00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.589 align:start position:0% was put in in advance, and the analysis target is which 00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 align:start position:0% and the analysis target is which 00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.550 align:start position:0% and the analysis target is which company or which keyword these keywords are being 00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 align:start position:0% company or which keyword these keywords are being 00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.509 align:start position:0% company or which keyword these keywords are being analyzed for, and we have classified them separately. 00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 align:start position:0% analyzed for, and we have classified them separately. 00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.190 align:start position:0% analyzed for, and we have classified them separately. Today, we will 00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.670 align:start position:0% Today, we will 00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.910 align:start position:0% 00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.190 align:start position:0% 00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 align:start position:0% 00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.030 align:start position:0% bring in data from the channels of Starbucks and Nike, global companies that are uploading content on various platforms. In the case of keywords, since it 00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 align:start position:0% bring in data from the channels of Starbucks and Nike, global companies that are uploading content on various platforms. In the case of keywords, since it 00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.149 align:start position:0% bring in data from the channels of Starbucks and Nike, global companies that are uploading content on various platforms. In the case of keywords, since it is winter these days, many people are interested in long padding or 00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 align:start position:0% is winter these days, many people are interested in long padding or 00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:43.190 align:start position:0% is winter these days, many people are interested in long padding or humidifiers. 00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 align:start position:0% humidifiers. 00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.110 align:start position:0% humidifiers. So, we will collect 00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 align:start position:0% So, we will collect 00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.910 align:start position:0% So, we will collect SNS data for these two keywords. 00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 align:start position:0% SNS data for these two keywords. 00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.470 align:start position:0% SNS data for these two keywords. And 00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 align:start position:0% And 00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.350 align:start position:0% And in the crawling data worksheet, 00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 align:start position:0% in the crawling data worksheet, 00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.589 align:start position:0% in the crawling data worksheet, we have created a worksheet that collects data based on keywords of interest and 00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 align:start position:0% we have created a worksheet that collects data based on keywords of interest and 00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.589 align:start position:0% we have created a worksheet that collects data based on keywords of interest and updates the sheet. 00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:56.350 align:start position:0% updates the sheet. 00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 align:start position:0% 00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.190 align:start position:0% So, if you look at the contents, you can see when it was updated, the 00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 align:start position:0% So, if you look at the contents, you can see when it was updated, the 00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.550 align:start position:0% So, if you look at the contents, you can see when it was updated, the classification is based on the platform keyword and which 00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 align:start position:0% classification is based on the platform keyword and which 00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.550 align:start position:0% classification is based on the platform keyword and which keyword was used, and 00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 align:start position:0% keyword was used, and 00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.309 align:start position:0% keyword was used, and if you can get the number of subscribers and followers, you can get it. And the 00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:06.869 align:start position:0% if you can get the number of subscribers and followers, you can get it. And the 00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:08.869 align:start position:0% 00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 align:start position:0% 00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.789 align:start position:0% basic information related to the content, such as the upload date, content ID, title, views, comments, likes, 00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 align:start position:0% basic information related to the content, such as the upload date, content ID, title, views, comments, likes, 00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.630 align:start position:0% basic information related to the content, such as the upload date, content ID, title, views, comments, likes, videos, or content URLs, of course, you will 00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 align:start position:0% videos, or content URLs, of course, you will 00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.630 align:start position:0% videos, or content URLs, of course, you will need them. So, we have divided the columns like this. 00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 align:start position:0% need them. So, we have divided the columns like this. 00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.150 align:start position:0% need them. So, we have divided the columns like this. And the data analysis 00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 align:start position:0% And the data analysis 00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.469 align:start position:0% And the data analysis worksheet is a sheet that updates the 00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 align:start position:0% worksheet is a sheet that updates the 00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.189 align:start position:0% worksheet is a sheet that updates the data analysis based on the crawling data collected later. 00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:24.670 align:start position:0% data analysis based on the crawling data collected later. 00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 align:start position:0% 00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.390 align:start position:0% So, 00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 align:start position:0% So, 00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.670 align:start position:0% So, first, in order to remove duplicates from the existing crawling data, 00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 align:start position:0% first, in order to remove duplicates from the existing crawling data, 00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.150 align:start position:0% first, in order to remove duplicates from the existing crawling data, first, crawl the 00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 align:start position:0% first, crawl the 00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.909 align:start position:0% first, crawl the data. You have to import it. You 00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:33.870 align:start position:0% data. You have to import it. You 00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 align:start position:0% 00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.550 align:start position:0% have to import the crawling data sheet. I'll delete some of the content and 00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 align:start position:0% have to import the crawling data sheet. I'll delete some of the content and 00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.150 align:start position:0% have to import the crawling data sheet. I'll delete some of the content and leave it at that. 00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 align:start position:0% leave it at that. 00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.830 align:start position:0% leave it at that. Then, I 00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 align:start position:0% Then, I 00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.070 align:start position:0% Then, I want to import the sheet data. 00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 align:start position:0% want to import the sheet data. 00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.110 align:start position:0% want to import the sheet data. Rather than filtering, I want to import all the data that falls within that range. 00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.990 align:start position:0% Rather than filtering, I want to import all the data that falls within that range. 00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 align:start position:0% 00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.749 align:start position:0% So in that case, go to the sheet module and 00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:49.150 align:start position:0% So in that case, go to the sheet module and 00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 align:start position:0% 00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.550 align:start position:0% select get range values. So, 00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 align:start position:0% select get range values. So, 00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.990 align:start position:0% select get range values. So, select this. For the sheet, select the 00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 align:start position:0% select this. For the sheet, select the 00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.830 align:start position:0% select this. For the sheet, select the SNS crawling sheet that I created. 00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 align:start position:0% SNS crawling sheet that I created. 00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.310 align:start position:0% SNS crawling sheet that I created. We 00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 align:start position:0% We 00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.189 align:start position:0% We want to import from the crawling data. And we 00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:00.590 align:start position:0% want to import from the crawling data. And we 00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 align:start position:0% 00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.790 align:start position:0% 'll import the data from the blue level to the content ID. This content 00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 align:start position:0% 'll import the data from the blue level to the content ID. This content 00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.950 align:start position:0% 'll import the data from the blue level to the content ID. This content ID is the most important column. 00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 align:start position:0% ID is the most important column. 00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.350 align:start position:0% ID is the most important column. We'll remove duplicate data later based on the ID value. You can import it because 00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 align:start position:0% We'll remove duplicate data later based on the ID value. You can import it because 00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.189 align:start position:0% We'll remove duplicate data later based on the ID value. You can import it because the 00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 align:start position:0% the 00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.629 align:start position:0% the column is included. I'll 00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 align:start position:0% column is included. I'll 00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.029 align:start position:0% column is included. I'll import it like this and select up to F. The 00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:16.110 align:start position:0% import it like this and select up to F. The 00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 align:start position:0% 00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.550 align:start position:0% header is the first row. We 00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 align:start position:0% header is the first row. We 00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.150 align:start position:0% header is the first row. We don't need the first row, so I'll work with B2. 00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 align:start position:0% don't need the first row, so I'll work with B2. 00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.390 align:start position:0% don't need the first row, so I'll work with B2. B2. Now, I 00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 align:start position:0% B2. Now, I 00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.870 align:start position:0% B2. Now, I 've set it up to ten thousand. If you run it once, you'll 00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 align:start position:0% 've set it up to ten thousand. If you run it once, you'll 00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.150 align:start position:0% 've set it up to ten thousand. If you run it once, you'll see 19. 00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 align:start position:0% see 19. 00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.710 align:start position:0% see 19. So now, each bundle is 00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 align:start position:0% So now, each bundle is 00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.270 align:start position:0% So now, each bundle is created for each row. So the data is 00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 align:start position:0% created for each row. So the data is 00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.270 align:start position:0% created for each row. So the data is like this. 00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 align:start position:0% like this. 00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.270 align:start position:0% like this. When we set the duplicate removal filter later, 00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 align:start position:0% When we set the duplicate removal filter later, 00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.150 align:start position:0% When we set the duplicate removal filter later, when there is newly crawled data, it's the 00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 align:start position:0% when there is newly crawled data, it's the 00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.270 align:start position:0% when there is newly crawled data, it's the entire content here. You want to check if 00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0% entire content here. You want to check if 00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.189 align:start position:0% entire content here. You want to check if there is a single value included in the ID, 00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 align:start position:0% there is a single value included in the ID, 00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:44.790 align:start position:0% there is a single value included in the ID, so 00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 align:start position:0% so 00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.710 align:start position:0% so rather than dividing it like this, it is better to merge the content ID 00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 align:start position:0% rather than dividing it like this, it is better to merge the content ID 00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.550 align:start position:0% rather than dividing it like this, it is better to merge the content ID values ​​into one. 00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 align:start position:0% values ​​into one. 00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.270 align:start position:0% values ​​into one. So when you want to merge this, you 00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 align:start position:0% So when you want to merge this, you 00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.670 align:start position:0% So when you want to merge this, you can use the ray regulator. 00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 align:start position:0% can use the ray regulator. 00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.950 align:start position:0% can use the ray regulator. In the flow control, do the array regulator, and 00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0% In the flow control, do the array regulator, and 00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.870 align:start position:0% In the flow control, do the array regulator, and of course, in the source module, get 00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 align:start position:0% of course, in the source module, get 00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.430 align:start position:0% of course, in the source module, get range values. And here, you can 00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 align:start position:0% range values. And here, you can 00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.430 align:start position:0% range values. And here, you can merge it with the content ID value. 00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 align:start position:0% merge it with the content ID value. 00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.110 align:start position:0% merge it with the content ID value. Set it like this, 00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 align:start position:0% Set it like this, 00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.909 align:start position:0% Set it like this, click OK, and run it again. You 00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:07.150 align:start position:0% click OK, and run it again. You 00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.430 align:start position:0% 00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 align:start position:0% 00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.270 align:start position:0% can see that the 19 values ​​were each divided, but they are included in one array. 00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 align:start position:0% can see that the 19 values ​​were each divided, but they are included in one array. 00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.670 align:start position:0% can see that the 19 values ​​were each divided, but they are included in one array. So if you do this, you can easily compare and filter the 00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 align:start position:0% So if you do this, you can easily compare and filter the 00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.990 align:start position:0% So if you do this, you can easily compare and filter the crawled values ​​for each ray later. 00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.270 align:start position:0% crawled values ​​for each ray later. 00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0% 00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.550 align:start position:0% So create it like this. 00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 align:start position:0% So create it like this. 00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.749 align:start position:0% So create it like this. Next, you need to call the 00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 align:start position:0% Next, you need to call the 00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:22.950 align:start position:0% Next, you need to call the keyword values ​​that you will actually crawl from the sheet. 00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 align:start position:0% keyword values ​​that you will actually crawl from the sheet. 00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.510 align:start position:0% keyword values ​​that you will actually crawl from the sheet. So we 00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 align:start position:0% So we 00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.029 align:start position:0% So we will proceed with that task. Of course, you 00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 align:start position:0% will proceed with that task. Of course, you 00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:28.550 align:start position:0% will proceed with that task. Of course, you need to create a sheet module again. Here, this time, I will 00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0% need to create a sheet module again. Here, this time, I will 00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.270 align:start position:0% need to create a sheet module again. Here, this time, I will do search rose. I will do set 00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 align:start position:0% do search rose. I will do set 00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.510 align:start position:0% do search rose. I will do set rose. 00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 align:start position:0% rose. 00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.710 align:start position:0% rose. This time, there is a crawling target. 00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0% This time, there is a crawling target. 00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.510 align:start position:0% This time, there is a crawling target. Click on the crawling target. Then, filter it and 00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 align:start position:0% Click on the crawling target. Then, filter it and 00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.110 align:start position:0% Click on the crawling target. Then, filter it and only get cases where the classification value exists. 00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0% only get cases where the classification value exists. 00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.029 align:start position:0% only get cases where the classification value exists. So 00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0% So 00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:42.710 align:start position:0% So click exist. So 00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0% click exist. So 00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.350 align:start position:0% click exist. So only if there is a classification. We will fetch rows and 00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.350 align:start position:0% only if there is a classification. We will fetch rows and 00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 align:start position:0% 00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.070 align:start position:0% specify the order to fetch in the order in which they are in the row number row. The 00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 align:start position:0% specify the order to fetch in the order in which they are in the row number row. The 00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.230 align:start position:0% specify the order to fetch in the order in which they are in the row number row. The limit is only about 20. 00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 align:start position:0% limit is only about 20. 00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.550 align:start position:0% limit is only about 20. We have crawled 00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 align:start position:0% We have crawled 00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.670 align:start position:0% We have crawled up to 17, so we will fetch up to 20. 00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.309 align:start position:0% up to 17, so we will fetch up to 20. 00:06:57.309 --> 00:06:57.319 align:start position:0% 00:06:57.319 --> 00:06:58.950 align:start position:0% Set it like this and save it. 00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 align:start position:0% Set it like this and save it. 00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.309 align:start position:0% Set it like this and save it. Then, if we run it again, 00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 align:start position:0% Then, if we run it again, 00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:03.909 align:start position:0% Then, if we run it again, we will bring all the values ​​we will crawl in the output 00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 align:start position:0% we will bring all the values ​​we will crawl in the output 00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:05.950 align:start position:0% we will bring all the values ​​we will crawl in the output as a bundle. We can 00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.270 align:start position:0% as a bundle. We can 00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 align:start position:0% 00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.790 align:start position:0% proceed with crawling these. However, as you can see here, the 00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 align:start position:0% proceed with crawling these. However, as you can see here, the 00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.150 align:start position:0% proceed with crawling these. However, as you can see here, the URL keyword and the 00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.160 align:start position:0% URL keyword and the 00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.070 align:start position:0% URL keyword and the crawling method will be different for each platform. 00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.080 align:start position:0% crawling method will be different for each platform. 00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.790 align:start position:0% crawling method will be different for each platform. Therefore, we need to set them differently in the PA. 00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.270 align:start position:0% Therefore, we need to set them differently in the PA. 00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 align:start position:0% 00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.990 align:start position:0% In that case, you 00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 align:start position:0% In that case, you 00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.749 align:start position:0% In that case, you can create a router. A router 00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:22.759 align:start position:0% can create a router. A router 00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:25.189 align:start position:0% can create a router. A router is a kind of if condition. You can set it by dividing it into conditional statements, such as “ 00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0% is a kind of if condition. You can set it by dividing it into conditional statements, such as “ 00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:27.830 align:start position:0% is a kind of if condition. You can set it by dividing it into conditional statements, such as “ run this in case A, 00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0% run this in case A, 00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.790 align:start position:0% run this in case A, run this in case B, run this in case C.” 00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.710 align:start position:0% run this in case B, run this in case C.” 00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.189 align:start position:0% 00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 align:start position:0% 00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:34.749 align:start position:0% However, if we think about it, we can 00:07:34.749 --> 00:07:36.550 align:start position:0% However, if we think about it, we can 00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:36.560 align:start position:0% 00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.430 align:start position:0% divide it by URL qu keyword first, and then 00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:38.440 align:start position:0% divide it by URL qu keyword first, and then 00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.070 align:start position:0% divide it by URL qu keyword first, and then divide it by platform. You 00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.469 align:start position:0% divide it by platform. You 00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 align:start position:0% 00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:44.230 align:start position:0% can create one, two, or three routers like this. 00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 align:start position:0% can create one, two, or three routers like this. 00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.230 align:start position:0% can create one, two, or three routers like this. Depending on the case, that may be better. It might be useful, but 00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 align:start position:0% Depending on the case, that may be better. It might be useful, but 00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.909 align:start position:0% Depending on the case, that may be better. It might be useful, but right now we 00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 align:start position:0% right now we 00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:49.950 align:start position:0% right now we have a fixed number of platforms anyway, and these 00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:49.960 align:start position:0% have a fixed number of platforms anyway, and these 00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.350 align:start position:0% have a fixed number of platforms anyway, and these conditions aren't that complicated. 00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:52.360 align:start position:0% conditions aren't that complicated. 00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.510 align:start position:0% conditions aren't that complicated. It's just URL, keyword, platform, 00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.510 align:start position:0% It's just URL, keyword, platform, 00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0% 00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.029 align:start position:0% so we can divide it by that, so instead of making three like this, we'll 00:07:58.029 --> 00:07:58.039 align:start position:0% so we can divide it by that, so instead of making three like this, we'll 00:07:58.039 --> 00:08:00.110 align:start position:0% so we can divide it by that, so instead of making three like this, we'll combine them all into one. 00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.120 align:start position:0% combine them all into one. 00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.670 align:start position:0% combine them all into one. Then, we can 00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0% Then, we can 00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.869 align:start position:0% Then, we can save some of the router's operation cost and 00:08:03.869 --> 00:08:03.879 align:start position:0% save some of the router's operation cost and 00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:05.710 align:start position:0% save some of the router's operation cost and be more efficient. 00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:05.720 align:start position:0% be more efficient. 00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.430 align:start position:0% be more efficient. So, we'll make only one router. 00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:09.230 align:start position:0% So, we'll make only one router. 00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.240 align:start position:0% 00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.869 align:start position:0% Click on Add and press Flow Control Router. Then, it's 00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0% Click on Add and press Flow Control Router. Then, it's 00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:12.589 align:start position:0% Click on Add and press Flow Control Router. Then, it's basically divided into two. 00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:12.599 align:start position:0% basically divided into two. 00:08:12.599 --> 00:08:14.710 align:start position:0% basically divided into two. Our current platform is four URLs and four 00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720 align:start position:0% Our current platform is four URLs and four 00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.670 align:start position:0% Our current platform is four URLs and four keywords, so you can make a total of eight 00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:16.680 align:start position:0% keywords, so you can make a total of eight 00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.309 align:start position:0% keywords, so you can make a total of eight here and connect them. 00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:18.319 align:start position:0% here and connect them. 00:08:18.319 --> 00:08:20.230 align:start position:0% here and connect them. First, 00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.350 align:start position:0% First, 00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:22.360 align:start position:0% 00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.790 align:start position:0% let's set up crawling based on URL on the YouTube platform. Before that, 00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.510 align:start position:0% let's set up crawling based on URL on the YouTube platform. Before that, 00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:26.520 align:start position:0% 00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.430 align:start position:0% let's name the modules. Right-click here and 00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0% let's name the modules. Right-click here and 00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.070 align:start position:0% let's name the modules. Right-click here and say Delegate. You 00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:31.080 align:start position:0% say Delegate. You 00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.190 align:start position:0% say Delegate. You can change the names of the modules here. 00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0% can change the names of the modules here. 00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.149 align:start position:0% can change the names of the modules here. The first is to check the crawling data 00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:35.159 align:start position:0% The first is to check the crawling data 00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:37.389 align:start position:0% The first is to check the crawling data ID. The second is to get the crawling target. 00:08:37.389 --> 00:08:37.399 align:start position:0% ID. The second is to get the crawling target. 00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:39.149 align:start position:0% ID. The second is to get the crawling target. Next, 00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:39.159 align:start position:0% Next, 00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.029 align:start position:0% Next, let's set up the filter here. I 00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:43.909 align:start position:0% let's set up the filter here. I 00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0% 00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:45.310 align:start position:0% want to send only the URL YouTube crawlers to this side. 00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:45.320 align:start position:0% want to send only the URL YouTube crawlers to this side. 00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.070 align:start position:0% want to send only the URL YouTube crawlers to this side. Of course, in the rolling target check, the 00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:48.080 align:start position:0% Of course, in the rolling target check, the 00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.470 align:start position:0% Of course, in the rolling target check, the classification should be URL. The 00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0% classification should be URL. The 00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.829 align:start position:0% classification should be URL. The platform should be YouTube. Here's how to set it up. 00:08:52.829 --> 00:08:52.839 align:start position:0% platform should be YouTube. Here's how to set it up. 00:08:52.839 --> 00:08:54.750 align:start position:0% platform should be YouTube. Here's how to set it up. Then, if the blue value is URL and the 00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:54.760 align:start position:0% Then, if the blue value is URL and the 00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.829 align:start position:0% Then, if the blue value is URL and the platform is also URL, it will 00:08:56.829 --> 00:08:56.839 align:start position:0% platform is also URL, it will 00:08:56.839 --> 00:08:58.630 align:start position:0% platform is also URL, it will come over here. 00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:58.640 align:start position:0% come over here. 00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.790 align:start position:0% come over here. In the rest, it will go to now. First, let's 00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0% In the rest, it will go to now. First, let's 00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.750 align:start position:0% In the rest, it will go to now. First, let's set up the URL YouTube crawling site. 00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:02.760 align:start position:0% set up the URL YouTube crawling site. 00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.430 align:start position:0% set up the URL YouTube crawling site. Now, 00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:04.440 align:start position:0% Now, 00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.990 align:start position:0% Now, in order to crawl, we will use a service called Pa. 00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:07.000 align:start position:0% in order to crawl, we will use a service called Pa. 00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.509 align:start position:0% in order to crawl, we will use a service called Pa. Simply put, FIFA 00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0% Simply put, FIFA 00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:11.509 align:start position:0% Simply put, FIFA generates code when we crawl and 00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0% generates code when we crawl and 00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:13.350 align:start position:0% generates code when we crawl and runs a script. Pa is a service that helps 00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.910 align:start position:0% runs a script. Pa is a service that helps 00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:15.920 align:start position:0% 00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.150 align:start position:0% people who don't know much about code to easily set up and 00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.160 align:start position:0% people who don't know much about code to easily set up and 00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.430 align:start position:0% people who don't know much about code to easily set up and crawl by turning that crawling code into a service. If 00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.269 align:start position:0% crawl by turning that crawling code into a service. If 00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:25.150 align:start position:0% 00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:25.160 align:start position:0% 00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.590 align:start position:0% you are curious about the specific usage of Pa, it would be good to refer to the previous video. 00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0% you are curious about the specific usage of Pa, it would be good to refer to the previous video. 00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.430 align:start position:0% you are curious about the specific usage of Pa, it would be good to refer to the previous video. Today, we 00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:29.440 align:start position:0% Today, we 00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.190 align:start position:0% Today, we will use it right away. Then, 00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0% will use it right away. Then, 00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.190 align:start position:0% will use it right away. Then, select the FIF module here and connect it. 00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:start position:0% select the FIF module here and connect it. 00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.870 align:start position:0% select the FIF module here and connect it. Before connecting, let's first 00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0% Before connecting, let's first 00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.069 align:start position:0% Before connecting, let's first go to the F5 website and set it up. If you go to 00:09:37.069 --> 00:09:37.079 align:start position:0% go to the F5 website and set it up. If you go to 00:09:37.079 --> 00:09:39.430 align:start position:0% go to the F5 website and set it up. If you go to ff.com and 00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0% ff.com and 00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.389 align:start position:0% ff.com and sign up, 00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:41.399 align:start position:0% sign up, 00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:43.389 align:start position:0% sign up, there is a place called FIF Store. 00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:43.399 align:start position:0% there is a place called FIF Store. 00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:45.470 align:start position:0% there is a place called FIF Store. We want to crawl YouTube data first. 00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:45.480 align:start position:0% We want to crawl YouTube data first. 00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.630 align:start position:0% We want to crawl YouTube data first. Then, if you type in YouTube, 00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.750 align:start position:0% Then, if you type in YouTube, 00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:49.760 align:start position:0% 00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.710 align:start position:0% there are various scrapers that have already been created. 00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720 align:start position:0% there are various scrapers that have already been created. 00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.710 align:start position:0% there are various scrapers that have already been created. We can choose the one we want and 00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:53.720 align:start position:0% We can choose the one we want and 00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.269 align:start position:0% We can choose the one we want and use. We will now 00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:56.829 align:start position:0% use. We will now 00:09:56.829 --> 00:09:56.839 align:start position:0% 00:09:56.839 --> 00:09:58.389 align:start position:0% use the first scraper that most people are using. Now, 00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0% use the first scraper that most people are using. Now, 00:09:58.399 --> 00:10:00.069 align:start position:0% use the first scraper that most people are using. Now, Since this is the actor we will be using, if you 00:10:00.069 --> 00:10:00.079 align:start position:0% Since this is the actor we will be using, if you 00:10:00.079 --> 00:10:02.269 align:start position:0% Since this is the actor we will be using, if you click on the star icon here and add it to your favorites, you can 00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279 align:start position:0% click on the star icon here and add it to your favorites, you can 00:10:02.279 --> 00:10:04.190 align:start position:0% click on the star icon here and add it to your favorites, you can find it quickly.

For reference, when you practice, you should be aware that in the 00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.389 align:start position:0% reference, when you practice, you should be aware that in the 00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0% 00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:10.829 align:start position:0% case of SNS crawlers, there are many models that charge a fee 00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:10.839 align:start position:0% case of SNS crawlers, there are many models that charge a fee 00:10:10.839 --> 00:10:13.990 align:start position:0% case of SNS crawlers, there are many models that charge a fee based on the results used, such as Paper Reit in Pi. 00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:16.310 align:start position:0% based on the results used, such as Paper Reit in Pi. 00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0% 00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.790 align:start position:0% Here, in the case of YouTube scrapers, 00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:17.800 align:start position:0% Here, in the case of YouTube scrapers, 00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.790 align:start position:0% Here, in the case of YouTube scrapers, if you look, it 00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0% if you look, it 00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.590 align:start position:0% if you look, it says that $5 is charged when 1,000 videos are 00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.790 align:start position:0% says that $5 is charged when 1,000 videos are 00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.870 align:start position:0% 00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.790 align:start position:0% 00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.310 align:start position:0% 00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:33.069 align:start position:0% 00:10:33.069 --> 00:10:33.079 align:start position:0% 00:10:33.079 --> 00:10:34.990 align:start position:0% retrieved. So, if you think about it based on the exchange rate of about 14,400 won, it is about 7 won per video. However, this is not charged right away when we run it. It is charged when we reach 000 videos. So, you do 00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.389 align:start position:0% retrieved. So, if you think about it based on the exchange rate of about 14,400 won, it is about 7 won per video. However, this is not charged right away when we run it. It is charged when we reach 000 videos. So, you do 00:10:37.389 --> 00:10:37.399 align:start position:0% 00:10:37.399 --> 00:10:39.230 align:start position:0% n't have to pay any money for practicing a few 00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:39.240 align:start position:0% n't have to pay any money for practicing a few 00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.790 align:start position:0% n't have to pay any money for practicing a few videos right away. However, 00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0% videos right away. However, 00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.110 align:start position:0% videos right away. However, when you reach 1,000 videos, you have to pay $5. 00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0% when you reach 1,000 videos, you have to pay $5. 00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.069 align:start position:0% when you reach 1,000 videos, you have to pay $5. And 00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:45.079 align:start position:0% And 00:10:45.079 --> 00:10:47.910 align:start position:0% And separately from this, when you run files, you 00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.430 align:start position:0% separately from this, when you run files, you 00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:50.440 align:start position:0% 00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.710 align:start position:0% may incur computer or storage costs. The 00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0% may incur computer or storage costs. The 00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.949 align:start position:0% may incur computer or storage costs. The cost for those is charged below. FIFA 00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0% cost for those is charged below. FIFA 00:10:54.959 --> 00:10:56.550 align:start position:0% cost for those is charged below. FIFA basically provides up to $5 per month for 00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.560 align:start position:0% basically provides up to $5 per month for 00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.310 align:start position:0% basically provides up to $5 per month for free. So, you are 00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320 align:start position:0% free. So, you are 00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.350 align:start position:0% free. So, you are not crawling in bulk, but 00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.360 align:start position:0% not crawling in bulk, but 00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.990 align:start position:0% not crawling in bulk, but collecting only a small amount of data. When is the time? You 00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:03.000 align:start position:0% collecting only a small amount of data. When is the time? You 00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.829 align:start position:0% collecting only a small amount of data. When is the time? You can usually use it for free, so I 00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:06.550 align:start position:0% can usually use it for free, so I 00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:06.560 align:start position:0% 00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.509 align:start position:0% think it would be good to refer to that. So in today's practice, we will 00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0% think it would be good to refer to that. So in today's practice, we will 00:11:08.519 --> 00:11:10.990 align:start position:0% think it would be good to refer to that. So in today's practice, we will mostly use paperless models, but 00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:12.350 align:start position:0% mostly use paperless models, but 00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0% 00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.910 align:start position:0% since we will not be bringing in 1,000 videos, you can 00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0% since we will not be bringing in 1,000 videos, you can 00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.150 align:start position:0% since we will not be bringing in 1,000 videos, you can think of it as not incurring any immediate costs. 00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0% think of it as not incurring any immediate costs. 00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.150 align:start position:0% think of it as not incurring any immediate costs. However, if you want to continue to use it beyond this, you will 00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.190 align:start position:0% However, if you want to continue to use it beyond this, you will 00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:20.200 align:start position:0% 00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.910 align:start position:0% need to check the amount. So 00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0% need to check the amount. So 00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.470 align:start position:0% need to check the amount. So here, we will set up the data that we will crawl. 00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0% here, we will set up the data that we will crawl. 00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.590 align:start position:0% here, we will set up the data that we will crawl. We 00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.550 align:start position:0% We 00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0% 00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.310 align:start position:0% will set up YouTube URLs, Starbucks Korea and Nike Yogurt. 00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0% will set up YouTube URLs, Starbucks Korea and Nike Yogurt. 00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.910 align:start position:0% will set up YouTube URLs, Starbucks Korea and Nike Yogurt. So if you look here, 00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0% So if you look here, 00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.069 align:start position:0% So if you look here, there is an option called Direct URL. 00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0% there is an option called Direct URL. 00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:35.790 align:start position:0% there is an option called Direct URL. In order to save this paper result value, 00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:35.800 align:start position:0% In order to save this paper result value, 00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.069 align:start position:0% In order to save this paper result value, let's set one first. 00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:37.079 align:start position:0% let's set one first. 00:11:37.079 --> 00:11:39.110 align:start position:0% let's set one first. Direct URL is not set as a filter, and the 00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0% Direct URL is not set as a filter, and the 00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.509 align:start position:0% Direct URL is not set as a filter, and the date range is 00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0% date range is 00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:43.710 align:start position:0% date range is significant when setting the channel URL. 00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:43.720 align:start position:0% significant when setting the channel URL. 00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.990 align:start position:0% significant when setting the channel URL. Here, I will set the value to around 180 days. 00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0% Here, I will set the value to around 180 days. 00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.069 align:start position:0% Here, I will set the value to around 180 days. So I will set it to bring in only data from 6 months and to 00:11:48.069 --> 00:11:50.150 align:start position:0% So I will set it to bring in only data from 6 months and to 00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0% 00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.710 align:start position:0% bring in new videos first. 00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.720 align:start position:0% bring in new videos first. 00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.389 align:start position:0% bring in new videos first. Then, save it. After setting it like this, I 00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:55.150 align:start position:0% Then, save it. After setting it like this, I 00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:55.160 align:start position:0% 00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.150 align:start position:0% set it to bring in only two videos at most. 00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:57.160 align:start position:0% set it to bring in only two videos at most. 00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.629 align:start position:0% set it to bring in only two videos at most. Anyway, 00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639 align:start position:0% Anyway, 00:11:58.639 --> 00:12:00.350 align:start position:0% Anyway, in the process of testing, we will not necessarily need to bring in a lot of data. 00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360 align:start position:0% in the process of testing, we will not necessarily need to bring in a lot of data. 00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.269 align:start position:0% in the process of testing, we will not necessarily need to bring in a lot of data. So, one is 00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0% So, one is 00:12:02.279 --> 00:12:04.310 align:start position:0% So, one is a bit. It's a pity, so I set up two videos like this, and 00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0% a bit. It's a pity, so I set up two videos like this, and 00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.150 align:start position:0% a bit. It's a pity, so I set up two videos like this, and then when you press start once, 00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.670 align:start position:0% then when you press start once, 00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:08.680 align:start position:0% 00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.750 align:start position:0% if you look at the log here in the pie, the crawler runs and 00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:10.760 align:start position:0% if you look at the log here in the pie, the crawler runs and 00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.310 align:start position:0% if you look at the log here in the pie, the crawler runs and gets the data. We've 00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:14.949 align:start position:0% gets the data. We've 00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:14.959 align:start position:0% 00:12:14.959 --> 00:12:16.910 align:start position:0% got two data like this, and the roller is already 00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0% got two data like this, and the roller is already 00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.750 align:start position:0% got two data like this, and the roller is already finished. But we 00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:19.760 align:start position:0% finished. But we 00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.590 align:start position:0% finished. But we don't want to receive data from the pie like this. We 00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.750 align:start position:0% don't want to receive data from the pie like this. We 00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0% 00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.710 align:start position:0% want to receive data from this make scenario and process it. In 00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:25.720 align:start position:0% want to receive data from this make scenario and process it. In 00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.350 align:start position:0% want to receive data from this make scenario and process it. In that case, 00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0% that case, 00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.870 align:start position:0% that case, there are two ways to set it. 00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0% there are two ways to set it. 00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.949 align:start position:0% there are two ways to set it. First, as I showed you earlier, you can 00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0% First, as I showed you earlier, you can 00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:33.030 align:start position:0% First, as I showed you earlier, you can run it in the scraper, or 00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0% run it in the scraper, or 00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.870 align:start position:0% run it in the scraper, or there's something called a schedule here. 00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0% there's something called a schedule here. 00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.550 align:start position:0% there's something called a schedule here. Since it's intuitive, you can 00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0% Since it's intuitive, you can 00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.550 align:start position:0% Since it's intuitive, you can create a schedule here by clicking Create New. 00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0% create a schedule here by clicking Create New. 00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.189 align:start position:0% create a schedule here by clicking Create New. So I can create a schedule here and 00:12:40.189 --> 00:12:42.269 align:start position:0% So I can create a schedule here and 00:12:42.269 --> 00:12:42.279 align:start position:0% 00:12:42.279 --> 00:12:44.110 align:start position:0% set it like Weekly. Then, when the 00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:44.120 align:start position:0% set it like Weekly. Then, when the 00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.430 align:start position:0% set it like Weekly. Then, when the actor runs here, it 00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0% actor runs here, it 00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.790 align:start position:0% actor runs here, it detects that it's running and 00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0% detects that it's running and 00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.990 align:start position:0% detects that it's running and gets the data when it runs. 00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.000 align:start position:0% gets the data when it runs. 00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.110 align:start position:0% gets the data when it runs. Or, we 00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.189 align:start position:0% Or, we 00:12:55.189 --> 00:12:55.199 align:start position:0% 00:12:55.199 --> 00:12:56.790 align:start position:0% can make the scraper itself and run it. 00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0% can make the scraper itself and run it. 00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.750 align:start position:0% can make the scraper itself and run it. We're going to mainly use the second method today. 00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:58.760 align:start position:0% We're going to mainly use the second method today. 00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.389 align:start position:0% We're going to mainly use the second method today.

Then, we will run the crawler with the Ron actor and 00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.629 align:start position:0% Then, we will run the crawler with the Ron actor and 00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0% 00:15:56.639 --> 00:15:58.949 align:start position:0% receive the run value from the get dataset ice. If 00:15:58.949 --> 00:15:58.959 align:start position:0% receive the run value from the get dataset ice. If 00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:00.749 align:start position:0% receive the run value from the get dataset ice. If you set up to this point, we 00:16:00.749 --> 00:16:00.759 align:start position:0% you set up to this point, we 00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:02.749 align:start position:0% you set up to this point, we can actually use the crawled data in Make. 00:16:02.749 --> 00:16:02.759 align:start position:0% can actually use the crawled data in Make. 00:16:02.759 --> 00:16:04.430 align:start position:0% can actually use the crawled data in Make. Save it once. 00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:04.440 align:start position:0% Save it once. 00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.550 align:start position:0% Save it once. Then, let's test crawling only the Starbucks YouTube data. Let's 00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0% Then, let's test crawling only the Starbucks YouTube data. Let's 00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.430 align:start position:0% Then, let's test crawling only the Starbucks YouTube data. Let's try it. Then, I'll set 00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:08.440 align:start position:0% try it. Then, I'll set 00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.670 align:start position:0% try it. Then, I'll set the limit to four. I'll set it to four 00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:10.680 align:start position:0% the limit to four. I'll set it to four 00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.629 align:start position:0% the limit to four. I'll set it to four and run it again. Then, if you 00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0% and run it again. Then, if you 00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:15.069 align:start position:0% and run it again. Then, if you look here, this crawler ran well. It 00:16:15.069 --> 00:16:15.079 align:start position:0% look here, this crawler ran well. It 00:16:15.079 --> 00:16:17.389 align:start position:0% look here, this crawler ran well. It ran, but if you 00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0% ran, but if you 00:16:17.399 --> 00:16:19.670 align:start position:0% ran, but if you look at the dataset items module, the output bundle is 0. 00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0% look at the dataset items module, the output bundle is 0. 00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.629 align:start position:0% look at the dataset items module, the output bundle is 0. So, no data was output. 00:16:21.629 --> 00:16:21.639 align:start position:0% So, no data was output. 00:16:21.639 --> 00:16:23.629 align:start position:0% So, no data was output. Why is that? It's 00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:23.639 align:start position:0% Why is that? It's 00:16:23.639 --> 00:16:25.870 align:start position:0% Why is that? It's not that the crawler didn't run. It's that this 00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:25.880 align:start position:0% not that the crawler didn't run. It's that this 00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.189 align:start position:0% not that the crawler didn't run. It's that this ran and this ran at the same time. 00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:28.199 align:start position:0% ran and this ran at the same time. 00:16:28.199 --> 00:16:30.189 align:start position:0% ran and this ran at the same time. So, this crawler has 00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:30.199 align:start position:0% So, this crawler has 00:16:30.199 --> 00:16:32.670 align:start position:0% So, this crawler has n't finished collecting data yet, but it 00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680 align:start position:0% n't finished collecting data yet, but it 00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.150 align:start position:0% n't finished collecting data yet, but it received the item with this dataset ID right away. 00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.160 align:start position:0% received the item with this dataset ID right away. 00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.670 align:start position:0% received the item with this dataset ID right away. So, of course, nothing will be accumulated. So, 00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.790 align:start position:0% So, of course, nothing will be accumulated. So, 00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:38.800 align:start position:0% 00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.910 align:start position:0% go to the Ron actor and there's an 00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0% go to the Ron actor and there's an 00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.350 align:start position:0% go to the Ron actor and there's an option called Run synchronously. 00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0% option called Run synchronously. 00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.710 align:start position:0% option called Run synchronously. You should use this as an example. When the 00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:43.720 align:start position:0% You should use this as an example. When the 00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.910 align:start position:0% You should use this as an example. When the crawler is finished running, it will 00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:45.920 align:start position:0% crawler is finished running, it will 00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.509 align:start position:0% crawler is finished running, it will receive the data. Now, you 00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0% receive the data. Now, you 00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:49.110 align:start position:0% receive the data. Now, you can properly retrieve the data. Let's 00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0% can properly retrieve the data. Let's 00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.389 align:start position:0% can properly retrieve the data. Let's run it. This time, it doesn't 00:16:51.389 --> 00:16:51.399 align:start position:0% run it. This time, it doesn't 00:16:51.399 --> 00:16:53.389 align:start position:0% run it. This time, it doesn't run simultaneously. It runs the crawler with this first. When the 00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0% run simultaneously. It runs the crawler with this first. When the 00:16:53.399 --> 00:16:55.749 align:start position:0% run simultaneously. It runs the crawler with this first. When the crawler is 00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0% crawler is 00:16:55.759 --> 00:16:57.949 align:start position:0% crawler is finished running, it will receive the value. 00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0% finished running, it will receive the value. 00:16:57.959 --> 00:17:00.030 align:start position:0% finished running, it will receive the value. Now, as you can see, the data is 00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:00.040 align:start position:0% Now, as you can see, the data is 00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.710 align:start position:0% Now, as you can see, the data is retrieved properly. 00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:01.720 align:start position:0% retrieved properly. 00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.309 align:start position:0% retrieved properly. Since it asked for two videos, 00:17:03.309 --> 00:17:03.319 align:start position:0% Since it asked for two videos, 00:17:03.319 --> 00:17:05.470 align:start position:0% Since it asked for two videos, two bundles were created and the YouTube 00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:05.480 align:start position:0% two bundles were created and the YouTube 00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.990 align:start position:0% two bundles were created and the YouTube video information was crawled and retrieved in them. You can 00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0% video information was crawled and retrieved in them. You can 00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.829 align:start position:0% video information was crawled and retrieved in them. You can see, but what 00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0% see, but what 00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:11.429 align:start position:0% see, but what we need to consider here is that 00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0% we need to consider here is that 00:17:11.439 --> 00:17:13.270 align:start position:0% we need to consider here is that we set it to receive one crawling keyword at a time, 00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:15.470 align:start position:0% we set it to receive one crawling keyword at a time, 00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:15.480 align:start position:0% 00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.710 align:start position:0% but we tested it with one URL now, but if you 00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:19.789 align:start position:0% but we tested it with one URL now, but if you 00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0% 00:17:19.799 --> 00:17:21.669 align:start position:0% change it back to 20, there are 00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0% change it back to 20, there are 00:17:21.679 --> 00:17:23.669 align:start position:0% change it back to 20, there are two YouTube-related URLs now, 00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:23.679 align:start position:0% two YouTube-related URLs now, 00:17:23.679 --> 00:17:25.909 align:start position:0% two YouTube-related URLs now, but later we 00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0% but later we 00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:27.630 align:start position:0% but later we can crawl five or ten. The problem 00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:27.640 align:start position:0% can crawl five or ten. The problem 00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.350 align:start position:0% can crawl five or ten. The problem with setting it this way is 00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0% with setting it this way is 00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.270 align:start position:0% with setting it this way is that if we have to crawl 10 YouTube URLs, 00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.280 align:start position:0% that if we have to crawl 10 YouTube URLs, 00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.110 align:start position:0% that if we have to crawl 10 YouTube URLs, we turn on the crawler, 00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.590 align:start position:0% we turn on the crawler, 00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0% 00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.950 align:start position:0% collect one URL, turn off the crawler, and when the next URL comes in, we turn on the actor, crawl, turn off the actor, turn on the 00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:37.960 align:start position:0% collect one URL, turn off the crawler, and when the next URL comes in, we turn on the actor, crawl, turn off the actor, turn on the 00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.150 align:start position:0% collect one URL, turn off the crawler, and when the next URL comes in, we turn on the actor, crawl, turn off the actor, turn on the next URL, and turn it on and 00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:41.990 align:start position:0% next URL, and turn it on and 00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0% 00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.270 align:start position:0% off. If there 00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280 align:start position:0% off. If there 00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.390 align:start position:0% off. If there are 10 URLs, we 00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0% are 10 URLs, we 00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.150 align:start position:0% are 10 URLs, we have to run each actor. 00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0% have to run each actor. 00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.990 align:start position:0% have to run each actor. This is naturally inefficient. If 00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0% This is naturally inefficient. If 00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.230 align:start position:0% This is naturally inefficient. If we work on a computer, turn on the computer, 00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0% we work on a computer, turn on the computer, 00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.990 align:start position:0% we work on a computer, turn on the computer, write a document, turn off the computer, turn it on again, write 00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0% write a document, turn off the computer, turn it on again, write 00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.630 align:start position:0% write a document, turn off the computer, turn it on again, write a document, turn it off, and 00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:55.640 align:start position:0% a document, turn it off, and 00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.110 align:start position:0% a document, turn it off, and so on, there 00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0% so on, there 00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.830 align:start position:0% so on, there is a ratio. It would be 00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0% is a ratio. It would be 00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.630 align:start position:0% is a ratio. It would be nice if we could run them all at once. 00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0% nice if we could run them all at once. 00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.190 align:start position:0% nice if we could run them all at once. So, so that we can process multiple things dynamically, 00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0% So, so that we can process multiple things dynamically, 00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.950 align:start position:0% So, so that we can process multiple things dynamically, if two come in, we can 00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0% if two come in, we can 00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.270 align:start position:0% if two come in, we can run two at once, and 00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:06.280 align:start position:0% run two at once, and 00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.830 align:start position:0% run two at once, and if three come in, we can run three at once. It is efficient to 00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0% if three come in, we can run three at once. It is efficient to 00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.310 align:start position:0% if three come in, we can run three at once. It is efficient to set it so that it can proceed. 00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:09.320 align:start position:0% set it so that it can proceed. 00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.510 align:start position:0% set it so that it can proceed. In order to do that, you 00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0% In order to do that, you 00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.870 align:start position:0% In order to do that, you first need to check how the input JSON file is created in the parser when multiple URLs are entered. Please 00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:17.029 align:start position:0% first need to check how the input JSON file is created in the parser when multiple URLs are entered. Please 00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:19.149 align:start position:0% 00:18:19.149 --> 00:18:19.159 align:start position:0% 00:18:19.159 --> 00:18:21.270 align:start position:0% enter the scraper and 00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.280 align:start position:0% enter the scraper and 00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.789 align:start position:0% enter the scraper and select manually and try putting in the direct URL Nike 00:18:23.789 --> 00:18:23.799 align:start position:0% select manually and try putting in the direct URL Nike 00:18:23.799 --> 00:18:25.830 align:start position:0% select manually and try putting in the direct URL Nike URL. Please 00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0% URL. Please 00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.669 align:start position:0% URL. Please put them in together. Then, if you 00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:27.679 align:start position:0% put them in together. Then, if you 00:18:27.679 --> 00:18:30.870 align:start position:0% put them in together. Then, if you look at the JSON file, you can see that it is implemented in the format where the start URL key 00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0% look at the JSON file, you can see that it is implemented in the format where the start URL key 00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.710 align:start position:0% look at the JSON file, you can see that it is implemented in the format where the start URL key value is separated by a comma and the URL medyo is 00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:33.720 align:start position:0% value is separated by a comma and the URL medyo is 00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.430 align:start position:0% value is separated by a comma and the URL medyo is connected by two values. You can see that 00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:38.110 align:start position:0% connected by two values. You can see that 00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:38.120 align:start position:0% 00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.310 align:start position:0% this itself is wrapped in brackets at the end. 00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:41.990 align:start position:0% this itself is wrapped in brackets at the end. 00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0% 00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.070 align:start position:0% So, if we can 00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.080 align:start position:0% So, if we can 00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.029 align:start position:0% So, if we can create it in Make and put it in the input JSON, we 00:18:46.029 --> 00:18:48.510 align:start position:0% create it in Make and put it in the input JSON, we 00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:48.520 align:start position:0% 00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.789 align:start position:0% can scroll multiple URLs at the same time. Then, you can do that. 00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0% can scroll multiple URLs at the same time. Then, you can do that. 00:18:49.799 --> 00:18:51.669 align:start position:0% can scroll multiple URLs at the same time. Then, you can do that. If 00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0% If 00:18:51.679 --> 00:18:53.630 align:start position:0% If there are multiple bundles like this and you 00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:53.640 align:start position:0% there are multiple bundles like this and you 00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.950 align:start position:0% there are multiple bundles like this and you want to combine them in a specific format, you 00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:58.029 align:start position:0% want to combine them in a specific format, you 00:18:58.029 --> 00:18:58.039 align:start position:0% 00:18:58.039 --> 00:18:59.669 align:start position:0% can easily do it by using a text aggregator. So, I will 00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0% can easily do it by using a text aggregator. So, I will 00:18:59.679 --> 00:19:01.549 align:start position:0% can easily do it by using a text aggregator. So, I will show you how to do that. 00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0% show you how to do that. 00:19:01.559 --> 00:19:04.149 align:start position:0% show you how to do that. Before running the crawler in FIFA, you need to 00:19:04.149 --> 00:19:04.159 align:start position:0% Before running the crawler in FIFA, you need to 00:19:04.159 --> 00:19:06.190 align:start position:0% Before running the crawler in FIFA, you need to combine them first and then put the input JSON here. 00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:06.200 align:start position:0% combine them first and then put the input JSON here. 00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.830 align:start position:0% combine them first and then put the input JSON here. So, 00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0% So, 00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.669 align:start position:0% So, unlink this again and create it here. Let me do it. I 00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:12.990 align:start position:0% unlink this again and create it here. Let me do it. I 00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.000 align:start position:0% 00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.029 align:start position:0% know Tools a Text Ligator. Select that. You 00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:16.710 align:start position:0% know Tools a Text Ligator. Select that. You 00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0% 00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.710 align:start position:0% need to merge it by taking it from the crawl target check sheet. 00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0% need to merge it by taking it from the crawl target check sheet. 00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.789 align:start position:0% need to merge it by taking it from the crawl target check sheet. Here, you can enter the format for the merge. 00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0% Here, you can enter the format for the merge. 00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:22.510 align:start position:0% Here, you can enter the format for the merge. Click on Adv Settings. You 00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.669 align:start position:0% Click on Adv Settings. You 00:19:24.669 --> 00:19:24.679 align:start position:0% 00:19:24.679 --> 00:19:26.750 align:start position:0% can enter the format for the merge. It will be entered like this. If you 00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0% can enter the format for the merge. It will be entered like this. If you 00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.149 align:start position:0% can enter the format for the merge. It will be entered like this. If you look here, you need to surround the URL with double commas. The 00:19:29.149 --> 00:19:29.159 align:start position:0% look here, you need to surround the URL with double commas. The 00:19:29.159 --> 00:19:30.830 align:start position:0% look here, you need to surround the URL with double commas. The crawling keyword is 00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840 align:start position:0% crawling keyword is 00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.110 align:start position:0% crawling keyword is entered, followed by a comma and the method get. It is 00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.029 align:start position:0% entered, followed by a comma and the method get. It is 00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0% 00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:36.710 align:start position:0% structured like this. So, you can set it like this. Then, if 00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0% structured like this. So, you can set it like this. Then, if 00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.590 align:start position:0% structured like this. So, you can set it like this. Then, if there are multiple crawling keywords, 00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:38.600 align:start position:0% there are multiple crawling keywords, 00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.070 align:start position:0% there are multiple crawling keywords, each value will be merged into one format. 00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:41.080 align:start position:0% each value will be merged into one format. 00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.710 align:start position:0% each value will be merged into one format. However, if you think about it when merging, the 00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0% However, if you think about it when merging, the 00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.669 align:start position:0% However, if you think about it when merging, the structure is that 00:19:44.669 --> 00:19:44.679 align:start position:0% structure is that 00:19:44.679 --> 00:19:46.750 align:start position:0% structure is that when there are multiple, they are connected with a comma. So, in 00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:46.760 align:start position:0% when there are multiple, they are connected with a comma. So, in 00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.190 align:start position:0% when there are multiple, they are connected with a comma. So, in Advanced Settings, set ES Low 00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:48.200 align:start position:0% Advanced Settings, set ES Low 00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.830 align:start position:0% Advanced Settings, set ES Low Separator to More and 00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:50.840 align:start position:0% Separator to More and 00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.669 align:start position:0% Separator to More and enter a comma as the separator. Then, 00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:52.679 align:start position:0% enter a comma as the separator. Then, 00:19:52.679 --> 00:19:54.430 align:start position:0% enter a comma as the separator. Then, this will be connected with a comma. If you 00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:54.440 align:start position:0% this will be connected with a comma. If you 00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.149 align:start position:0% this will be connected with a comma. If you set it like this, we 00:19:56.149 --> 00:19:56.159 align:start position:0% set it like this, we 00:19:56.159 --> 00:19:57.909 align:start position:0% set it like this, we can merge multiple items. 00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0% can merge multiple items. 00:19:57.919 --> 00:20:00.029 align:start position:0% can merge multiple items. Then, this should be attached like this. 00:20:00.029 --> 00:20:00.039 align:start position:0% Then, this should be attached like this. 00:20:00.039 --> 00:20:02.270 align:start position:0% Then, this should be attached like this. Next, this filter should not be set here. 00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0% Next, this filter should not be set here. 00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.270 align:start position:0% Next, this filter should not be set here. Now, you need to set it in the front. 00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:04.280 align:start position:0% Now, you need to set it in the front. 00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.390 align:start position:0% Now, you need to set it in the front. URL YouTube Crawling Blue 00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:07.400 align:start position:0% URL YouTube Crawling Blue 00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.110 align:start position:0% URL YouTube Crawling Blue URL Platform YouTube Set it like this, 00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:10.120 align:start position:0% URL Platform YouTube Set it like this, 00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.549 align:start position:0% URL Platform YouTube Set it like this, and then go into Input J here and 00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0% and then go into Input J here and 00:20:12.559 --> 00:20:14.270 align:start position:0% and then go into Input J here and now we've combined it into this text, 00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:16.390 align:start position:0% now we've combined it into this text, 00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:18.310 align:start position:0% 00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0% 00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.029 align:start position:0% right? Just put this in. But you don't need the whole thing, just put the text in. Because 00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:20.039 align:start position:0% right? Just put this in. But you don't need the whole thing, just put the text in. Because 00:20:20.039 --> 00:20:22.149 align:start position:0% right? Just put this in. But you don't need the whole thing, just put the text in. Because we've already prepared the combined text, 00:20:22.149 --> 00:20:22.159 align:start position:0% we've already prepared the combined text, 00:20:22.159 --> 00:20:23.830 align:start position:0% we've already prepared the combined text, just put this in like this, and the 00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0% just put this in like this, and the 00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.669 align:start position:0% just put this in like this, and the brackets 00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0% brackets 00:20:25.679 --> 00:20:27.270 align:start position:0% brackets wrap it around like this. 00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0% wrap it around like this. 00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.710 align:start position:0% wrap it around like this. Then, 00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:29.720 align:start position:0% Then, 00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.870 align:start position:0% Then, create this according to the number of aggregator beards, and 00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:31.880 align:start position:0% create this according to the number of aggregator beards, and 00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.950 align:start position:0% create this according to the number of aggregator beards, and connect the format with a comma. 00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:33.960 align:start position:0% connect the format with a comma. 00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.990 align:start position:0% connect the format with a comma. We've set the limit to 20, so we'll 00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0% We've set the limit to 20, so we'll 00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.669 align:start position:0% We've set the limit to 20, so we'll get them all. Now, there 00:20:38.669 --> 00:20:38.679 align:start position:0% get them all. Now, there 00:20:38.679 --> 00:20:40.350 align:start position:0% get them all. Now, there are two URL YouTube links. So 00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:40.360 align:start position:0% are two URL YouTube links. So 00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.310 align:start position:0% are two URL YouTube links. So both Starbucks and Nike will be 00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0% both Starbucks and Nike will be 00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.310 align:start position:0% both Starbucks and Nike will be crawled properly. After that, let's do a 00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0% crawled properly. After that, let's do a 00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.470 align:start position:0% crawled properly. After that, let's do a Run Once again and try it. 00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0% Run Once again and try it. 00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.029 align:start position:0% Run Once again and try it. As you can see, four 00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0% As you can see, four 00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:50.669 align:start position:0% As you can see, four bundles have been created. So we've 00:20:50.669 --> 00:20:50.679 align:start position:0% bundles have been created. So we've 00:20:50.679 --> 00:20:52.590 align:start position:0% bundles have been created. So we've received four pieces of data by doing two each. 00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:52.600 align:start position:0% received four pieces of data by doing two each. 00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.549 align:start position:0% received four pieces of data by doing two each. Now, you can update this in the sheet. The 00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:56.270 align:start position:0% Now, you can update this in the sheet. The 00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0% 00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.070 align:start position:0% easiest way is to select Adder in Google Sheets here, and 00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:00.789 align:start position:0% easiest way is to select Adder in Google Sheets here, and 00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0% 00:21:00.799 --> 00:21:02.390 align:start position:0% then go to Crawling Data and update it. 00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0% then go to Crawling Data and update it. 00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.230 align:start position:0% then go to Crawling Data and update it. Here, select from the update date. You can 00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0% Here, select from the update date. You can 00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.510 align:start position:0% Here, select from the update date. You can just put them in. 00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:06.520 align:start position:0% just put them in. 00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.669 align:start position:0% just put them in. For example, for the classification, we'll 00:21:08.669 --> 00:21:08.679 align:start position:0% For example, for the classification, we'll 00:21:08.679 --> 00:21:10.669 align:start position:0% For example, for the classification, we'll put in platform data like 00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0% put in platform data like 00:21:10.679 --> 00:21:12.110 align:start position:0% put in platform data like YouTube. For the 00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0% YouTube. For the 00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.070 align:start position:0% YouTube. For the update date, go to the date here and 00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0% update date, go to the date here and 00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.350 align:start position:0% update date, go to the date here and put it in as Now. We'll 00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:16.360 align:start position:0% put it in as Now. We'll 00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.310 align:start position:0% put it in as Now. We'll change this to the format we want. 00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320 align:start position:0% change this to the format we want. 00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.350 align:start position:0% change this to the format we want. Put in the format date, 00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:20.360 align:start position:0% Put in the format date, 00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.549 align:start position:0% Put in the format date, put in a semicolon, and do it like this. It'll be 00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0% put in a semicolon, and do it like this. It'll be 00:21:22.559 --> 00:21:25.029 align:start position:0% put in a semicolon, and do it like this. It'll be 2025 0101. 00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0% 2025 0101. 00:21:25.039 --> 00:21:27.430 align:start position:0% 2025 0101. In this way, you can 00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:29.630 align:start position:0% In this way, you can 00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:31.870 align:start position:0% 00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:31.880 align:start position:0% 00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.430 align:start position:0% map the values ​​you want one by one with the data ring data we brought. For example, for the 00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0% map the values ​​you want one by one with the data ring data we brought. For example, for the 00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.070 align:start position:0% map the values ​​you want one by one with the data ring data we brought. For example, for the subscriber follower, there's the number 00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:35.080 align:start position:0% subscriber follower, there's the number 00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.310 align:start position:0% subscriber follower, there's the number of subscribers here. You 00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:37.990 align:start position:0% of subscribers here. You 00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0% 00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.029 align:start position:0% can specify all the values. If you say you've specified them and 00:21:40.029 --> 00:21:40.039 align:start position:0% can specify all the values. If you say you've specified them and 00:21:40.039 --> 00:21:41.789 align:start position:0% can specify all the values. If you say you've specified them and run it again, it'll update the sheet. 00:21:41.789 --> 00:21:41.799 align:start position:0% run it again, it'll update the sheet. 00:21:41.799 --> 00:21:43.909 align:start position:0% run it again, it'll update the sheet. But 00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0% But 00:21:43.919 --> 00:21:46.070 align:start position:0% But in order to filter the existing data, 00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0% in order to filter the existing data, 00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.430 align:start position:0% in order to filter the existing data, we brought in the rolling data ID 00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:48.440 align:start position:0% we brought in the rolling data ID 00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.470 align:start position:0% we brought in the rolling data ID values. It would be good to 00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.480 align:start position:0% values. It would be good to 00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.630 align:start position:0% values. It would be good to compare them right after bringing in the filter value. 00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0% compare them right after bringing in the filter value. 00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.470 align:start position:0% compare them right after bringing in the filter value. So 00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:55.480 align:start position:0% So 00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.310 align:start position:0% So you can set the filter here. You can do a cell-up 00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:57.320 align:start position:0% you can set the filter here. You can do a cell-up 00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.070 align:start position:0% you can set the filter here. You can do a cell-up filter to check for duplicate content. 00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0% filter to check for duplicate content. 00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.070 align:start position:0% filter to check for duplicate content. There's an array value. The content IDs are in this array value. 00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:04.190 align:start position:0% There's an array value. The content IDs are in this array value. 00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:04.200 align:start position:0% 00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.909 align:start position:0% But if you just click this, the 00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0% But if you just click this, the 00:22:05.919 --> 00:22:08.310 align:start position:0% But if you just click this, the problem is that each content 00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320 align:start position:0% problem is that each content 00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.230 align:start position:0% problem is that each content ID has only one meaning. 00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0% ID has only one meaning. 00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.350 align:start position:0% ID has only one meaning. So if you want to select all of them, 00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0% So if you want to select all of them, 00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.269 align:start position:0% So if you want to select all of them, select the upper level array above and 00:22:14.269 --> 00:22:14.279 align:start position:0% select the upper level array above and 00:22:14.279 --> 00:22:17.149 align:start position:0% select the upper level array above and use the format called map. 00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0% use the format called map. 00:22:17.159 --> 00:22:19.470 align:start position:0% use the format called map. In this, 00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:19.480 align:start position:0% In this, 00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.909 align:start position:0% In this, if you put the mouse cursor on the content ID, a value of 4 will appear. If you 00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:24.390 align:start position:0% if you put the mouse cursor on the content ID, a value of 4 will appear. If you 00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400 align:start position:0% 00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.630 align:start position:0% put 4 as the row value as the ID, it will receive all the values 00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0% put 4 as the row value as the ID, it will receive all the values 00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.070 align:start position:0% put 4 as the row value as the ID, it will receive all the values in the column with the content ID row value of 4 in this array. 00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:30.909 align:start position:0% in the column with the content ID row value of 4 in this array. 00:22:30.909 --> 00:22:30.919 align:start position:0% 00:22:30.919 --> 00:22:32.909 align:start position:0% So if you set it like this, all of the 00:22:32.909 --> 00:22:32.919 align:start position:0% So if you set it like this, all of the 00:22:32.919 --> 00:22:34.470 align:start position:0% So if you set it like this, all of the content ID values ​​that we have will be 00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0% content ID values ​​that we have will be 00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.230 align:start position:0% content ID values ​​that we have will be loaded. 00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0% loaded. 00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.870 align:start position:0% loaded. Then, you need to compare it with the 00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:37.880 align:start position:0% Then, you need to compare it with the 00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.269 align:start position:0% Then, you need to compare it with the array operators below, 00:22:39.269 --> 00:22:39.279 align:start position:0% array operators below, 00:22:39.279 --> 00:22:40.510 align:start position:0% array operators below, so does not contain. 00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:40.520 align:start position:0% so does not contain. 00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.029 align:start position:0% so does not contain. So it doesn't contain. It 00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:42.039 align:start position:0% So it doesn't contain. It 00:22:42.039 --> 00:22:44.029 align:start position:0% So it doesn't contain. It says what doesn't contain. There is an ID value. If the 00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:44.039 align:start position:0% says what doesn't contain. There is an ID value. If the 00:22:44.039 --> 00:22:46.029 align:start position:0% says what doesn't contain. There is an ID value. If the ID value is not entered, it will 00:22:46.029 --> 00:22:46.039 align:start position:0% ID value is not entered, it will 00:22:46.039 --> 00:22:48.190 align:start position:0% ID value is not entered, it will come over and update the sheet. I'll 00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:48.200 align:start position:0% come over and update the sheet. I'll 00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.789 align:start position:0% come over and update the sheet. I'll change the name. 00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0% change the name. 00:22:50.799 --> 00:22:52.870 align:start position:0% change the name. Here's another tip. Right now, let's say 00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0% Here's another tip. Right now, let's say 00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.789 align:start position:0% Here's another tip. Right now, let's say we're called Ether Row. 00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:55.799 align:start position:0% we're called Ether Row. 00:22:55.799 --> 00:22:58.029 align:start position:0% we're called Ether Row. Right now, there are four. 00:22:58.029 --> 00:22:58.039 align:start position:0% Right now, there are four. 00:22:58.039 --> 00:22:59.870 align:start position:0% Right now, there are four. If four of them pass all the filters, they will be 00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0% If four of them pass all the filters, they will be 00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.070 align:start position:0% If four of them pass all the filters, they will be stacked one by one. 00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.080 align:start position:0% stacked one by one. 00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.750 align:start position:0% stacked one by one. But if you update like this, the 00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0% But if you update like this, the 00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.950 align:start position:0% But if you update like this, the bad thing is that if you don't have four videos, for example, you 00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:05.960 align:start position:0% bad thing is that if you don't have four videos, for example, you 00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.430 align:start position:0% bad thing is that if you don't have four videos, for example, you brought in 100, 00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0% brought in 100, 00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.190 align:start position:0% brought in 100, then it will 00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0% then it will 00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.750 align:start position:0% then it will access the sheet one by one and update it. So, 00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0% access the sheet one by one and update it. So, 00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.710 align:start position:0% access the sheet one by one and update it. So, in the upper right corner, The 00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:13.720 align:start position:0% in the upper right corner, The 00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.789 align:start position:0% in the upper right corner, The number that pops up is 100. 00:23:15.789 --> 00:23:15.799 align:start position:0% number that pops up is 100. 00:23:15.799 --> 00:23:17.590 align:start position:0% number that pops up is 100. But now, in the case of Make, if you 00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0% But now, in the case of Make, if you 00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.710 align:start position:0% But now, in the case of Make, if you use the free version, you can only 00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:19.720 align:start position:0% use the free version, you can only 00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.149 align:start position:0% use the free version, you can only use up to 1,000 operations for free. 00:23:21.149 --> 00:23:21.159 align:start position:0% use up to 1,000 operations for free. 00:23:21.159 --> 00:23:23.149 align:start position:0% use up to 1,000 operations for free. Even if you use the paid version, 00:23:23.149 --> 00:23:23.159 align:start position:0% Even if you use the paid version, 00:23:23.159 --> 00:23:24.909 align:start position:0% Even if you use the paid version, the cost increases as the number of operations increases. 00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:24.919 align:start position:0% the cost increases as the number of operations increases. 00:23:24.919 --> 00:23:26.750 align:start position:0% the cost increases as the number of operations increases. So 00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0% So 00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.070 align:start position:0% So when you bring in a lot of data, it would be better to 00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.080 align:start position:0% when you bring in a lot of data, it would be better to 00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.029 align:start position:0% when you bring in a lot of data, it would be better to combine them all at once and 00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0% combine them all at once and 00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:33.269 align:start position:0% combine them all at once and do a bulk update instead of adding rows like this. 00:23:33.269 --> 00:23:33.279 align:start position:0% do a bulk update instead of adding rows like this. 00:23:33.279 --> 00:23:35.750 align:start position:0% do a bulk update instead of adding rows like this. Then, even if you access the sheet API only once and 00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0% Then, even if you access the sheet API only once and 00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.630 align:start position:0% Then, even if you access the sheet API only once and update 100 pieces of data, only 00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:37.640 align:start position:0% update 100 pieces of data, only 00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.149 align:start position:0% update 100 pieces of data, only one operation is required. 00:23:39.149 --> 00:23:39.159 align:start position:0% one operation is required. 00:23:39.159 --> 00:23:40.750 align:start position:0% one operation is required. So it is better to do a bulk update like this. If you do 00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:40.760 align:start position:0% So it is better to do a bulk update like this. If you do 00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.950 align:start position:0% So it is better to do a bulk update like this. If you do that, 00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0% that, 00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.110 align:start position:0% that, don't update the sheet right away. 00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:46.630 align:start position:0% don't update the sheet right away. 00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:46.640 align:start position:0% 00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.269 align:start position:0% Use the array aggregate you know to first merge the bundles received from here. 00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:51.549 align:start position:0% Use the array aggregate you know to first merge the bundles received from here. 00:23:51.549 --> 00:23:51.559 align:start position:0% 00:23:51.559 --> 00:23:54.310 align:start position:0% In the sheet module, instead of Ether Row, there is something called Rose in the bulk. 00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:56.669 align:start position:0% In the sheet module, instead of Ether Row, there is something called Rose in the bulk. 00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:56.679 align:start position:0% 00:23:56.679 --> 00:23:58.710 align:start position:0% You can do a bulk update with this. 00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:58.720 align:start position:0% You can do a bulk update with this. 00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.950 align:start position:0% You can do a bulk update with this. Go to the ID finder and 00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0% Go to the ID finder and 00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.510 align:start position:0% Go to the ID finder and enter the sheet name in the keyword. 00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0% enter the sheet name in the keyword. 00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.149 align:start position:0% enter the sheet name in the keyword. Then, it will automatically find the sheet. 00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0% Then, it will automatically find the sheet. 00:24:04.159 --> 00:24:07.310 align:start position:0% Then, it will automatically find the sheet. After finding it, if you turn off the sheet name map, you 00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320 align:start position:0% After finding it, if you turn off the sheet name map, you 00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.870 align:start position:0% After finding it, if you turn off the sheet name map, you can select it like this. We 00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0% can select it like this. We 00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.990 align:start position:0% can select it like this. We want to put it in the crawling data sheet. 00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:11.000 align:start position:0% want to put it in the crawling data sheet. 00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.870 align:start position:0% want to put it in the crawling data sheet. Enter A2 Z and here, 00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0% Enter A2 Z and here, 00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.269 align:start position:0% Enter A2 Z and here, Rose's bulk. Here, you 00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0% Rose's bulk. Here, you 00:24:15.279 --> 00:24:17.190 align:start position:0% Rose's bulk. Here, you select the array to update. The 00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0% select the array to update. The 00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.710 align:start position:0% select the array to update. The array aggregate right in front is 00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0% array aggregate right in front is 00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.710 align:start position:0% array aggregate right in front is going to be imported as a value. 00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0% going to be imported as a value. 00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.190 align:start position:0% going to be imported as a value. So, you can select the array and 00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0% So, you can select the array and 00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.830 align:start position:0% So, you can select the array and click OK. 00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0% click OK. 00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.190 align:start position:0% click OK. Save it. Then, when you 00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0% Save it. Then, when you 00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.549 align:start position:0% Save it. Then, when you come to the array aggregate, the source is 00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:27.559 align:start position:0% come to the array aggregate, the source is 00:24:27.559 --> 00:24:29.389 align:start position:0% come to the array aggregate, the source is Get Data. Here, you will 00:24:29.389 --> 00:24:29.399 align:start position:0% Get Data. Here, you will 00:24:29.399 --> 00:24:31.190 align:start position:0% Get Data. Here, you will combine the crawling data values ​​imported, 00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0% combine the crawling data values ​​imported, 00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.909 align:start position:0% combine the crawling data values ​​imported, so select this. This 00:24:32.909 --> 00:24:32.919 align:start position:0% so select this. This 00:24:32.919 --> 00:24:35.029 align:start position:0% so select this. This is the target structure type. You can select Google Sheet Loss. 00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:36.710 align:start position:0% is the target structure type. You can select Google Sheet Loss. 00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0% 00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.950 align:start position:0% To do this, the important thing is that you 00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960 align:start position:0% To do this, the important thing is that you 00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.350 align:start position:0% To do this, the important thing is that you cannot select it first. You must 00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:40.360 align:start position:0% cannot select it first. You must 00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.630 align:start position:0% cannot select it first. You must first connect the Bulk Ed Lowes Sheet module. After 00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0% first connect the Bulk Ed Lowes Sheet module. After 00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.830 align:start position:0% first connect the Bulk Ed Lowes Sheet module. After connecting it, 00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:44.840 align:start position:0% connecting it, 00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.230 align:start position:0% connecting it, specify the array value of Loss here. Then, you must 00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:47.240 align:start position:0% specify the array value of Loss here. Then, you must 00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.549 align:start position:0% specify the array value of Loss here. Then, you must go to the array aggregate again and 00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0% go to the array aggregate again and 00:24:49.559 --> 00:24:51.269 align:start position:0% go to the array aggregate again and select the structure here. 00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:51.279 align:start position:0% select the structure here. 00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:52.750 align:start position:0% select the structure here. Otherwise, this will 00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:52.760 align:start position:0% Otherwise, this will 00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.389 align:start position:0% Otherwise, this will not appear. So, I think it would be good to be careful about that. 00:24:54.389 --> 00:24:54.399 align:start position:0% not appear. So, I think it would be good to be careful about that. 00:24:54.399 --> 00:24:56.350 align:start position:0% not appear. So, I think it would be good to be careful about that. After connecting it like this, 00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:56.360 align:start position:0% After connecting it like this, 00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.070 align:start position:0% After connecting it like this, there are values ​​here. If you 00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0% there are values ​​here. If you 00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.430 align:start position:0% there are values ​​here. If you add this like this, the column 00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0% add this like this, the column 00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.830 align:start position:0% add this like this, the column values ​​will appear like this. These columns 00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:01.840 align:start position:0% values ​​will appear like this. These columns 00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.630 align:start position:0% values ​​will appear like this. These columns are SNS sheets. Each column means each column. You 00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:05.870 align:start position:0% are SNS sheets. Each column means each column. You 00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:08.029 align:start position:0% 00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0% 00:25:08.039 --> 00:25:09.950 align:start position:0% can specify which value you want to map to each column here. If you specify it, Bulk 00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0% can specify which value you want to map to each column here. If you specify it, Bulk 00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.830 align:start position:0% can specify which value you want to map to each column here. If you specify it, Bulk update contents are 00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:11.840 align:start position:0% update contents are 00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.870 align:start position:0% update contents are combined based on the column values ​​and combined contents are 00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:13.880 align:start position:0% combined based on the column values ​​and combined contents are 00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.310 align:start position:0% combined based on the column values ​​and combined contents are updated in one sheet. 00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:15.320 align:start position:0% updated in one sheet. 00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.350 align:start position:0% updated in one sheet. When doing this, it is important to 00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:17.360 align:start position:0% When doing this, it is important to 00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.430 align:start position:0% When doing this, it is important to set the filter here first. It would be good to 00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0% set the filter here first. It would be good to 00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.950 align:start position:0% set the filter here first. It would be good to check for duplicate content. 00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:21.960 align:start position:0% check for duplicate content. 00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.190 align:start position:0% check for duplicate content. Then, 00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:24.200 align:start position:0% Then, 00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.350 align:start position:0% Then, only the non-duplicated ones are filtered from the crawled data and 00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:26.360 align:start position:0% only the non-duplicated ones are filtered from the crawled data and 00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.070 align:start position:0% only the non-duplicated ones are filtered from the crawled data and combined. Now, we 00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:29.750 align:start position:0% combined. Now, we 00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0% 00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.389 align:start position:0% need to set the column values ​​here. 00:25:31.389 --> 00:25:31.399 align:start position:0% need to set the column values ​​here. 00:25:31.399 --> 00:25:33.630 align:start position:0% need to set the column values ​​here. Let's fill it out while looking at the sheet. 00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:33.640 align:start position:0% Let's fill it out while looking at the sheet. 00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.750 align:start position:0% Let's fill it out while looking at the sheet. Now, the first is the update 00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0% Now, the first is the update 00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.310 align:start position:0% Now, the first is the update date reservation. It will be the value that comes out like before. 00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:39.320 align:start position:0% date reservation. It will be the value that comes out like before. 00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.789 align:start position:0% date reservation. It will be the value that comes out like before. Let's format it like this.

The image 00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0% Next, the video URL. The image 00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.590 align:start position:0% Next, the video URL. The image URL. You can leave the thumbnail URL and image 00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0% URL. You can leave the thumbnail URL and image 00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.430 align:start position:0% URL. You can leave the thumbnail URL and image description blank because there is nothing to put in. 00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:21.549 align:start position:0% description blank because there is nothing to put in. 00:26:21.549 --> 00:26:21.559 align:start position:0% 00:26:21.559 --> 00:26:23.269 align:start position:0% I have specified all 14 column values ​​like this. 00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0% I have specified all 14 column values ​​like this. 00:26:23.279 --> 00:26:25.190 align:start position:0% I have specified all 14 column values ​​like this. Then, I will filter it like this and 00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0% Then, I will filter it like this and 00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.310 align:start position:0% Then, I will filter it like this and bring only non-duplicated ones, merge the arrays, and 00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:28.870 align:start position:0% bring only non-duplicated ones, merge the arrays, and 00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0% 00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.269 align:start position:0% update the merged ones in bulk at once. 00:26:30.269 --> 00:26:30.279 align:start position:0% update the merged ones in bulk at once. 00:26:30.279 --> 00:26:32.269 align:start position:0% update the merged ones in bulk at once. When updating this, there is one more thing to keep in mind. 00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.279 align:start position:0% When updating this, there is one more thing to keep in mind. 00:26:32.279 --> 00:26:34.310 align:start position:0% When updating this, there is one more thing to keep in mind. If the 00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0% If the 00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.830 align:start position:0% If the merged array values ​​are empty in this sheet, 00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0% merged array values ​​are empty in this sheet, 00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.510 align:start position:0% merged array values ​​are empty in this sheet, this update 00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:38.520 align:start position:0% this update 00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.350 align:start position:0% this update will throw an error. But it is not an error. 00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:40.360 align:start position:0% will throw an error. But it is not an error. 00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.190 align:start position:0% will throw an error. But it is not an error. Because if there are no values, of course, it is 00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:42.200 align:start position:0% Because if there are no values, of course, it is 00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.710 align:start position:0% Because if there are no values, of course, it is right not to update. If there 00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:43.720 align:start position:0% right not to update. If there 00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.909 align:start position:0% right not to update. If there are only duplicate values, so 00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0% are only duplicate values, so 00:26:45.919 --> 00:26:47.789 align:start position:0% are only duplicate values, so add one more filter. Let's say it is a data presence 00:26:47.789 --> 00:26:47.799 align:start position:0% add one more filter. Let's say it is a data presence 00:26:47.799 --> 00:26:50.510 align:start position:0% add one more filter. Let's say it is a data presence check. This array value. 00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0% check. This array value. 00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.430 align:start position:0% check. This array value. Filter only if the value exists, and 00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0% Filter only if the value exists, and 00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.230 align:start position:0% Filter only if the value exists, and now we will proceed with the bulk update. Let's 00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:55.240 align:start position:0% now we will proceed with the bulk update. Let's 00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.669 align:start position:0% now we will proceed with the bulk update. Let's set the filter like this. Let's go back and 00:26:56.669 --> 00:26:56.679 align:start position:0% set the filter like this. Let's go back and 00:26:56.679 --> 00:26:58.669 align:start position:0% set the filter like this. Let's go back and look at it again. 00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0% look at it again. 00:26:58.679 --> 00:27:01.269 align:start position:0% look at it again. Now, on the left, 00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:01.279 align:start position:0% Now, on the left, 00:27:01.279 --> 00:27:03.470 align:start position:0% Now, on the left, there is an update until January 5th, and a new action was 00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0% there is an update until January 5th, and a new action was 00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.389 align:start position:0% there is an update until January 5th, and a new action was added. You 00:27:05.389 --> 00:27:05.399 align:start position:0% added. You 00:27:05.399 --> 00:27:07.070 align:start position:0% added. You can see that two were added. 00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0% can see that two were added. 00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.669 align:start position:0% can see that two were added. And because there were duplicate values, two 00:27:08.669 --> 00:27:08.679 align:start position:0% And because there were duplicate values, two 00:27:08.679 --> 00:27:10.549 align:start position:0% And because there were duplicate values, two were excluded. Only the remaining two 00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0% were excluded. Only the remaining two 00:27:10.559 --> 00:27:12.070 align:start position:0% were excluded. Only the remaining two were updated. Even though two were updated, a 00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0% were updated. Even though two were updated, a 00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.630 align:start position:0% were updated. Even though two were updated, a bulk update was performed, 00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:13.640 align:start position:0% bulk update was performed, 00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.269 align:start position:0% bulk update was performed, so as you can see here, one 00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0% so as you can see here, one 00:27:15.279 --> 00:27:17.110 align:start position:0% so as you can see here, one operation is consumed and a bulk update is performed at once. You 00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0% operation is consumed and a bulk update is performed at once. You 00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.710 align:start position:0% operation is consumed and a bulk update is performed at once. You can see it. 00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0% can see it. 00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.630 align:start position:0% can see it. Okay, if you've followed along so far, you've 00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:23.029 align:start position:0% Okay, if you've followed along so far, you've 00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0% 00:27:23.039 --> 00:27:25.310 align:start position:0% probably gotten used to the basic structure. So, I think it would be good to get more familiar with it by configuring 00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0% probably gotten used to the basic structure. So, I think it would be good to get more familiar with it by configuring 00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.830 align:start position:0% probably gotten used to the basic structure. So, I think it would be good to get more familiar with it by configuring various platforms in a similar way. Okay, 00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:29.590 align:start position:0% various platforms in a similar way. Okay, 00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:31.389 align:start position:0% 00:27:31.389 --> 00:27:31.399 align:start position:0% 00:27:31.399 --> 00:27:33.669 align:start position:0% similarly, we're going to crawl based on URL. 00:27:33.669 --> 00:27:36.110 align:start position:0% similarly, we're going to crawl based on URL. 00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:36.120 align:start position:0% 00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.230 align:start position:0% Let's set up Instagram, TikTok, and so on. 00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0% Let's set up Instagram, TikTok, and so on. 00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.830 align:start position:0% Let's set up Instagram, TikTok, and so on. Add one more router. The 00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0% Add one more router. The 00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.830 align:start position:0% Add one more router. The filter is URL. This time, we're going to 00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0% filter is URL. This time, we're going to 00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.789 align:start position:0% filter is URL. This time, we're going to crawl Instagram. It's a blue URL. The 00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0% crawl Instagram. It's a blue URL. The 00:27:43.799 --> 00:27:45.750 align:start position:0% crawl Instagram. It's a blue URL. The platform is Instagram. And now, 00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0% platform is Instagram. And now, 00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.710 align:start position:0% platform is Instagram. And now, when we do the second task, if we 00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:47.720 align:start position:0% when we do the second task, if we 00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.669 align:start position:0% when we do the second task, if we turn it back, it won't be 00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0% turn it back, it won't be 00:27:49.679 --> 00:27:51.509 align:start position:0% turn it back, it won't be good. So, if you right-click, there 00:27:51.509 --> 00:27:51.519 align:start position:0% good. So, if you right-click, there 00:27:51.519 --> 00:27:53.669 align:start position:0% good. So, if you right-click, there 's a disable route. If you 00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:53.679 align:start position:0% 's a disable route.

If you look at this x scraper, the 00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0% If you look at this x scraper, the 00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.630 align:start position:0% If you look at this x scraper, the date comes out, but this date value 00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:33.640 align:start position:0% date comes out, but this date value 00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.750 align:start position:0% date comes out, but this date value comes out a little bit special. Since it's going to be expressed up to 1, 00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0% comes out a little bit special. Since it's going to be expressed up to 1, 00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.230 align:start position:0% comes out a little bit special. Since it's going to be expressed up to 1, the day of the week is not necessary, but this 00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:37.240 align:start position:0% the day of the week is not necessary, but this 00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.750 align:start position:0% the day of the week is not necessary, but this value or an unnecessary plus 00 00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.760 align:start position:0% value or an unnecessary plus 00 00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.190 align:start position:0% value or an unnecessary plus 00 appears here. So upload. I want to enter a date, but I 00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:43.790 align:start position:0% appears here. So upload. I want to enter a date, but I 00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0% 00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:46.109 align:start position:0% want to process this and format it. In 00:35:46.109 --> 00:35:46.119 align:start position:0% want to process this and format it. In 00:35:46.119 --> 00:35:48.349 align:start position:0% want to process this and format it. In that case, there's no choice but to bring in the 00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0% that case, there's no choice but to bring in the 00:35:48.359 --> 00:35:49.910 align:start position:0% that case, there's no choice but to bring in the data, check for duplicate content, and then 00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:51.630 align:start position:0% data, check for duplicate content, and then 00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:51.640 align:start position:0% 00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.349 align:start position:0% process the data. So, 00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0% process the data. So, 00:35:53.359 --> 00:35:55.150 align:start position:0% process the data. So, set three mtip variables. 00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:55.160 align:start position:0% set three mtip variables. 00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:58.190 align:start position:0% set three mtip variables. Here, we'll filter for duplicate content, and 00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:59.309 align:start position:0% Here, we'll filter for duplicate content, and 00:35:59.309 --> 00:36:02.670 align:start position:0% 00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:02.680 align:start position:0% 00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:04.910 align:start position:0% filter by ID. After filtering, 00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:07.470 align:start position:0% filter by ID. After filtering, 00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:07.480 align:start position:0% 00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:09.309 align:start position:0% we'll add only the information we need from the created date value. All we 00:36:09.309 --> 00:36:09.319 align:start position:0% we'll add only the information we need from the created date value. All we 00:36:09.319 --> 00:36:11.750 align:start position:0% we'll add only the information we need from the created date value. All we need 00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:14.910 align:start position:0% need 00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:14.920 align:start position:0% 00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:17.630 align:start position:0% is the month, day, and time. Now, we 00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0% is the month, day, and time. Now, we 00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:19.950 align:start position:0% is the month, day, and time. Now, we can format it as we want. 00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:19.960 align:start position:0% can format it as we want. 00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:22.870 align:start position:0% can format it as we want. So, first, we split the 00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:22.880 align:start position:0% So, first, we split the 00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.790 align:start position:0% So, first, we split the created date by space, and 00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0% created date by space, and 00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.990 align:start position:0% created date by space, and then the 00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:27.000 align:start position:0% then the 00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.069 align:start position:0% then the second is the month after the day of the week. 00:36:29.069 --> 00:36:29.079 align:start position:0% second is the month after the day of the week. 00:36:29.079 --> 00:36:30.829 align:start position:0% second is the month after the day of the week. So, we'll bring in the month value. Then, we'll 00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0% So, we'll bring in the month value. Then, we'll 00:36:30.839 --> 00:36:33.069 align:start position:0% So, we'll bring in the month value. Then, we'll bring in the second value as a coefficient, and then we 00:36:33.069 --> 00:36:34.829 align:start position:0% bring in the second value as a coefficient, and then we 00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:36.990 align:start position:0% 00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:37.000 align:start position:0% 00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.790 align:start position:0% 'll use something called a switch to change it to a numeric value, such as January men 1 or February 2. So, 00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:38.800 align:start position:0% 'll use something called a switch to change it to a numeric value, such as January men 1 or February 2. So, 00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.510 align:start position:0% 'll use something called a switch to change it to a numeric value, such as January men 1 or February 2. So, if we have the December value, we can 00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:40.520 align:start position:0% if we have the December value, we can 00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.510 align:start position:0% if we have the December value, we can use the switch to change the number to 12. We 00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:42.520 align:start position:0% use the switch to change the number to 12. We 00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:43.950 align:start position:0% use the switch to change the number to 12. We did this. 00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:43.960 align:start position:0% did this. 00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.470 align:start position:0% did this. Likewise, since the third value was 1, 00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0% Likewise, since the third value was 1, 00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.710 align:start position:0% Likewise, since the third value was 1, you can see that the created date The 00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0% you can see that the created date The 00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.030 align:start position:0% you can see that the created date The third value divided by space is 0, 00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0% third value divided by space is 0, 00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.270 align:start position:0% third value divided by space is 0, so I took that value, and the time is 00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0% so I took that value, and the time is 00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.750 align:start position:0% so I took that value, and the time is next, so I took the fourth, and 00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0% next, so I took the fourth, and 00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.589 align:start position:0% next, so I took the fourth, and then it's past the 00 type, so it 00:36:58.589 --> 00:36:58.599 align:start position:0% then it's past the 00 type, so it 00:36:58.599 --> 00:37:00.270 align:start position:0% then it's past the 00 type, so it 's the sixth value. 00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:00.280 align:start position:0% 's the sixth value. 00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:04.109 align:start position:0% 's the sixth value. So, I divided the month, day, time, and year values 00:37:04.109 --> 00:37:04.119 align:start position:0% So, I divided the month, day, time, and year values 00:37:04.119 --> 00:37:06.270 align:start position:0% So, I divided the month, day, time, and year values like this. After dividing them, I 00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:10.069 align:start position:0% like this. After dividing them, I 00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0% 00:37:10.079 --> 00:37:12.270 align:start position:0% 'll use the array regulator to insert the values.

Since the input URL is 00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0% input URL is 00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.109 align:start position:0% input URL is not given separately, I'll put it in so that it can be leaked as a user name. I'll 00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:22.349 align:start position:0% not given separately, I'll put it in so that it can be leaked as a user name. I'll 00:37:22.349 --> 00:37:24.829 align:start position:0% 00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:24.839 align:start position:0% 00:37:24.839 --> 00:37:27.510 align:start position:0% put in the follow count and the upload date here. 00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0% put in the follow count and the upload date here. 00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.309 align:start position:0% put in the follow count and the upload date here. Normally, you should put it in like this in ISO format. 00:37:29.309 --> 00:37:29.319 align:start position:0% Normally, you should put it in like this in ISO format. 00:37:29.319 --> 00:37:30.950 align:start position:0% Normally, you should put it in like this in ISO format. So, 00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0% So, 00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.150 align:start position:0% So, we'll create the ISO format ourselves by dividing it. 00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:33.160 align:start position:0% we'll create the ISO format ourselves by dividing it. 00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.990 align:start position:0% we'll create the ISO format ourselves by dividing it. Then, month, 00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:35.000 align:start position:0% Then, month, 00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.710 align:start position:0% Then, month, day, t, time, Z. 00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:41.150 align:start position:0% day, t, time, Z. 00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0% 00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:44.550 align:start position:0% If you do this, we'll 00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:46.550 align:start position:0% If you do this, we'll 00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0% 00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.790 align:start position:0% properly format the ISO value directly using the variable values ​​that we decomposed and saved. 00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:51.510 align:start position:0% properly format the ISO value directly using the variable values ​​that we decomposed and saved. 00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:51.520 align:start position:0% 00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.309 align:start position:0% We formatted it again as year, month, and 1.

And I'll 00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.190 align:start position:0% I'll do it with a long padding humidifier. And I'll only get two videos. This time, I'll 00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200 align:start position:0% only get two videos. This time, I'll 00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.750 align:start position:0% only get two videos. This time, I'll get it based on the filter. 00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:01.760 align:start position:0% get it based on the filter. 00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.390 align:start position:0% get it based on the filter. If you get it based on date, YouTube has a 00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:03.400 align:start position:0% If you get it based on date, YouTube has a 00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.109 align:start position:0% If you get it based on date, YouTube has a lot of small channels. 00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0% lot of small channels. 00:39:05.119 --> 00:39:07.270 align:start position:0% lot of small channels. So, I'll do it based on relevance and 00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0% So, I'll do it based on relevance and 00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.630 align:start position:0% So, I'll do it based on relevance and set it to this month instead. After doing 00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:09.640 align:start position:0% set it to this month instead. After doing 00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.670 align:start position:0% set it to this month instead. After doing this, you can 00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0% this, you can 00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.470 align:start position:0% this, you can check it by coming into the Jason file again. The 00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:13.480 align:start position:0% check it by coming into the Jason file again. The 00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.790 align:start position:0% check it by coming into the Jason file again. The interesting thing here is that when you do it by search term, 00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:15.800 align:start position:0% interesting thing here is that when you do it by search term, 00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.309 align:start position:0% interesting thing here is that when you do it by search term, Unlike before, there is no such thing as Meget. 00:39:18.309 --> 00:39:20.309 align:start position:0% Unlike before, there is no such thing as Meget. 00:39:20.309 --> 00:39:20.319 align:start position:0% 00:39:20.319 --> 00:39:22.270 align:start position:0% You can see that it is just connected with a comma as a keyword value. You can make it by 00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:22.280 align:start position:0% You can see that it is just connected with a comma as a keyword value. You can make it by 00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:24.589 align:start position:0% You can see that it is just connected with a comma as a keyword value. You can make it by extracting everything as it is with Jason Porter. 00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:25.829 align:start position:0% extracting everything as it is with Jason Porter. 00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0% 00:39:25.839 --> 00:39:29.390 align:start position:0% For example, put in YouTube Scraper 00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0% For example, put in YouTube Scraper 00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.510 align:start position:0% For example, put in YouTube Scraper Input Jason. Just 00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0% Input Jason. Just 00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:33.950 align:start position:0% Input Jason. Just connect this with a comma and enter the value. 00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0% connect this with a comma and enter the value. 00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.670 align:start position:0% connect this with a comma and enter the value. Tools. I will give you a tip. 00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:36.680 align:start position:0% Tools. I will give you a tip. 00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.670 align:start position:0% Tools. I will give you a tip. Here, I have been making new ones like this, but you 00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:38.680 align:start position:0% Here, I have been making new ones like this, but you 00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.109 align:start position:0% Here, I have been making new ones like this, but you 00:39:40.109 --> 00:39:42.910 align:start position:0% 00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:42.920 align:start position:0% 00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.430 align:start position:0% can clone this and copy it like this. 00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:44.440 align:start position:0% can clone this and copy it like this. 00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:50.950 align:start position:0% can clone this and copy it like this. This time, 00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0% 00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:54.390 align:start position:0% enter the keyword text value for the keyword YouTube classification. Then, the settings that 00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:54.400 align:start position:0% enter the keyword text value for the keyword YouTube classification. Then, the settings that 00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:57.349 align:start position:0% enter the keyword text value for the keyword YouTube classification. Then, the settings that we have already made will improve. You 00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:59.150 align:start position:0% we have already made will improve. You 00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0% 00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.230 align:start position:0% can set it up a little faster. This time, set it up like this. In the 00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:01.240 align:start position:0% can set it up a little faster. This time, set it up like this. In the 00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:04.630 align:start position:0% can set it up a little faster. This time, set it up like this. In the 00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0% 00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:08.190 align:start position:0% same way, get the value based on the dataset ID. For the 00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:08.200 align:start position:0% same way, get the value based on the dataset ID. For the 00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.990 align:start position:0% same way, get the value based on the dataset ID. For the limit, set it to five. 00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:12.030 align:start position:0% limit, set it to five. 00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:12.040 align:start position:0% 00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:15.710 align:start position:0% Next, here as well, I 00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:22.630 align:start position:0% Next, here as well, I 00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0% 00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.630 align:start position:0% will set the large ad da in advance. Set it and 00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0% will set the large ad da in advance. Set it and 00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:27.309 align:start position:0% will set the large ad da in advance. Set it and disconnect it and try it. Only 00:40:27.309 --> 00:40:27.319 align:start position:0% disconnect it and try it. Only 00:40:27.319 --> 00:40:29.829 align:start position:0% disconnect it and try it. Only two are passing and 00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0% two are passing and 00:40:29.839 --> 00:40:32.030 align:start position:0% two are passing and proceeding. I 00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.040 align:start position:0% proceeding. I 00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.510 align:start position:0% proceeding. I brought in four bundles like this. You 00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0% brought in four bundles like this. You 00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.069 align:start position:0% brought in four bundles like this. You can connect this. In the same way, 00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:40.990 align:start position:0% can connect this. In the same way, 00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:41.000 align:start position:0% 00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.790 align:start position:0% you should check the intermediate content here. I only 00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0% you should check the intermediate content here. I only 00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:46.030 align:start position:0% you should check the intermediate content here. I only did what was missing in the ID value mapping and 00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:46.040 align:start position:0% did what was missing in the ID value mapping and 00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:49.829 align:start position:0% did what was missing in the ID value mapping and set it up. I set it up and set it up as a custom setting. 00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0% set it up. I set it up and set it up as a custom setting. 00:40:49.839 --> 00:40:52.670 align:start position:0% set it up. I set it up and set it up as a custom setting. Next, check the presence of data here and 00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:52.680 align:start position:0% Next, check the presence of data here and 00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:55.270 align:start position:0% Next, check the presence of data here and only pass if there is a value. 00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0% only pass if there is a value. 00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.390 align:start position:0% only pass if there is a value. Here, you just need to map the array values. Input, 00:40:57.390 --> 00:41:01.270 align:start position:0% Here, you just need to map the array values. Input, 00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:04.910 align:start position:0% 00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0% 00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:09.030 align:start position:0% number of readers, date, ID, 00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.040 align:start position:0% number of readers, date, ID, 00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:13.589 align:start position:0% number of readers, date, ID, title, 00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0% 00:41:13.599 --> 00:41:16.829 align:start position:0% count, thumbnail, URL, etc. I put it like this. Okay, 00:41:16.829 --> 00:41:16.839 align:start position:0% count, thumbnail, URL, etc. I put it like this. Okay, 00:41:16.839 --> 00:41:18.589 align:start position:0% count, thumbnail, URL, etc. I put it like this. Okay, now the settings are 00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:18.599 align:start position:0% now the settings are 00:41:18.599 --> 00:41:20.670 align:start position:0% now the settings are complete and I'll move on. 00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:20.680 align:start position:0% complete and I'll move on. 00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:23.109 align:start position:0% complete and I'll move on. Next, I'll 00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:23.119 align:start position:0% Next, I'll 00:41:23.119 --> 00:41:26.109 align:start position:0% Next, I'll try Instagram cooling based on search criteria. 00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:26.119 align:start position:0% try Instagram cooling based on search criteria. 00:41:26.119 --> 00:41:28.510 align:start position:0% try Instagram cooling based on search criteria. If you look at Instagram, 00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:28.520 align:start position:0% If you look at Instagram, 00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:31.550 align:start position:0% If you look at Instagram, there's a 00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0% there's a 00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.750 align:start position:0% there's a search based on queries here. But it searches by hashtags and I'll try to 00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:33.760 align:start position:0% search based on queries here. But it searches by hashtags and I'll try to 00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.670 align:start position:0% search based on queries here. But it searches by hashtags and I'll try to bring in up to two. But if you put 00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0% bring in up to two. But if you put 00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:38.190 align:start position:0% bring in up to two. But if you put padding here, you ca 00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:38.200 align:start position:0% padding here, you ca 00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.990 align:start position:0% padding here, you ca n't select multiple keywords. So you can 00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.000 align:start position:0% n't select multiple keywords. So you can 00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.309 align:start position:0% n't select multiple keywords. So you can only crawl one. 00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0% only crawl one. 00:41:42.319 --> 00:41:44.349 align:start position:0% only crawl one. Then, it comes out in JSON format like 00:41:44.349 --> 00:41:44.359 align:start position:0% Then, it comes out in JSON format like 00:41:44.359 --> 00:41:46.550 align:start position:0% Then, it comes out in JSON format like this, 00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0% this, 00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.309 align:start position:0% this, but you can't search multiple here. Then, it's 00:41:49.309 --> 00:41:51.309 align:start position:0% but you can't search multiple here. Then, it's 00:41:51.309 --> 00:41:51.319 align:start position:0% 00:41:51.319 --> 00:41:53.630 align:start position:0% meaningless for us to merge them. Anyway, 00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0% meaningless for us to merge them. Anyway, 00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.349 align:start position:0% meaningless for us to merge them. Anyway, since the actor can't receive it, 00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0% since the actor can't receive it, 00:41:55.359 --> 00:41:57.790 align:start position:0% since the actor can't receive it, let's just add the actor right away. If 00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:57.800 align:start position:0% let's just add the actor right away. If 00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.150 align:start position:0% let's just add the actor right away. If the actor can't receive multiple queries like this, you 00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:01.160 align:start position:0% the actor can't receive multiple queries like this, you 00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.430 align:start position:0% the actor can't receive multiple queries like this, you have to consider it. So you ca 00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:05.790 align:start position:0% have to consider it. So you ca 00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:05.800 align:start position:0% 00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.190 align:start position:0% n't always use the option. You have to change it like this depending on the actor's option. 00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:10.109 align:start position:0% n't always use the option. You have to change it like this depending on the actor's option. 00:42:10.109 --> 00:42:10.119 align:start position:0% 00:42:10.119 --> 00:42:12.230 align:start position:0% So, the 00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0% So, the 00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.990 align:start position:0% So, the downside to this is that you can't process it all at once. 00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0% downside to this is that you can't process it all at once. 00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.630 align:start position:0% downside to this is that you can't process it all at once. If you 00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:17.750 align:start position:0% If you 00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0% 00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.750 align:start position:0% do multiple searches based on Instagram keywords, you will turn on the actor every time and do 00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0% do multiple searches based on Instagram keywords, you will turn on the actor every time and do 00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.790 align:start position:0% do multiple searches based on Instagram keywords, you will turn on the actor every time and do one, and then the next one, and so 00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:21.800 align:start position:0% one, and then the next one, and so 00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:37.109 align:start position:0% one, and then the next one, and so on. I will 00:42:37.109 --> 00:42:37.119 align:start position:0% 00:42:37.119 --> 00:42:39.750 align:start position:0% set it up again and map it. 00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0% set it up again and map it. 00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.549 align:start position:0% set it up again and map it. Oh, and then 00:42:41.549 --> 00:42:41.559 align:start position:0% Oh, and then 00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:47.990 align:start position:0% Oh, and then I didn't filter here. I will add a filter. I will 00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0% 00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.190 align:start position:0% add a filter and 00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:50.200 align:start position:0% add a filter and 00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.069 align:start position:0% add a filter and run it. Then I will 00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0% run it. Then I will 00:42:52.079 --> 00:42:54.790 align:start position:0% run it. Then I will run it twice to get the values. You can connect them in the same way. In 00:42:54.790 --> 00:43:00.109 align:start position:0% run it twice to get the values. You can connect them in the same way. In 00:43:00.109 --> 00:43:00.119 align:start position:0% 00:43:00.119 --> 00:43:02.630 align:start position:0% this case, 00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0% this case, 00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.349 align:start position:0% this case, when you search by hashtag, the top post, 00:43:04.349 --> 00:43:04.359 align:start position:0% when you search by hashtag, the top post, 00:43:04.359 --> 00:43:06.230 align:start position:0% when you search by hashtag, the top post, such as the rate post, comes up. 00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0% such as the rate post, comes up. 00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.630 align:start position:0% such as the rate post, comes up. We will use the short code based on the ID of the top post. We 00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:10.750 align:start position:0% We will use the short code based on the ID of the top post. We 00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:15.549 align:start position:0% 00:43:15.549 --> 00:43:15.559 align:start position:0% 00:43:15.559 --> 00:43:18.349 align:start position:0% will filter based on this. Then, when you map this, you just need to 00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:18.359 align:start position:0% will filter based on this. Then, when you map this, you just need to 00:43:18.359 --> 00:43:21.750 align:start position:0% will filter based on this. Then, when you map this, you just need to ping it well. 00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:21.760 align:start position:0% ping it well. 00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:25.109 align:start position:0% ping it well. Here, we will get the crawling as the keyword value. The 00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0% Here, we will get the crawling as the keyword value. The 00:43:25.119 --> 00:43:27.309 align:start position:0% Here, we will get the crawling as the keyword value. The sheet value 00:43:27.309 --> 00:43:27.319 align:start position:0% sheet value 00:43:27.319 --> 00:43:28.910 align:start position:0% sheet value is as it is 00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0% is as it is 00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:30.790 align:start position:0% is as it is because we did not merge it. We can use the sheet value as it is in front, so we will 00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:32.549 align:start position:0% because we did not merge it. We can use the sheet value as it is in front, so we will 00:43:32.549 --> 00:43:32.559 align:start position:0% 00:43:32.559 --> 00:43:34.710 align:start position:0% map it with this. All values 00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0% map it with this. All values 00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.710 align:start position:0% map it with this. All values here will be based on the top post. 00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:39.630 align:start position:0% here will be based on the top post. 00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:39.640 align:start position:0% 00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:42.150 align:start position:0% Since we 00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0% Since we 00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.870 align:start position:0% Since we decided to use the short code in the top post, you can 00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0% decided to use the short code in the top post, you can 00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.990 align:start position:0% decided to use the short code in the top post, you can enter the show code. 00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:47.000 align:start position:0% enter the show code. 00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.190 align:start position:0% enter the show code. Comment count, like count, 00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0% Comment count, like count, 00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:55.190 align:start position:0% Comment count, like count, video ration, and then the hashtag value, 00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0% video ration, and then the hashtag value, 00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.790 align:start position:0% video ration, and then the hashtag value, URL, display url, and 00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:57.800 align:start position:0% URL, display url, and 00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.870 align:start position:0% URL, display url, and here too. I'll just put in the tag value like this. You 00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:02.670 align:start position:0% here too. I'll just put in the tag value like this. You 00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:02.680 align:start position:0% 00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:04.829 align:start position:0% don't have to do the mapping exactly the way I do it. You can 00:44:04.829 --> 00:44:04.839 align:start position:0% don't have to do the mapping exactly the way I do it. You can 00:44:04.839 --> 00:44:07.750 align:start position:0% don't have to do the mapping exactly the way I do it. You can map the values ​​you want and use them. I 00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:10.589 align:start position:0% map the values ​​you want and use them. I 00:44:10.589 --> 00:44:10.599 align:start position:0% 00:44:10.599 --> 00:44:14.270 align:start position:0% 've done this with Instagram. Next, I 00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.280 align:start position:0% 've done this with Instagram. Next, I 00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.750 align:start position:0% 've done this with Instagram. Next, I 'll bring in TikTok and use it. I'll 00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:16.760 align:start position:0% 'll bring in TikTok and use it. I'll 00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:18.950 align:start position:0% 'll bring in TikTok and use it. I'll show you TikTok, but the search term is also 00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0% show you TikTok, but the search term is also 00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.870 align:start position:0% show you TikTok, but the search term is also structured in a form that connects with commas. 00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:20.880 align:start position:0% structured in a form that connects with commas. 00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.030 align:start position:0% structured in a form that connects with commas. So I'll make it in advance and go 00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0% So I'll make it in advance and go 00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.750 align:start position:0% So I'll make it in advance and go in. Here, we 00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:24.760 align:start position:0% in. Here, we 00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.750 align:start position:0% in. Here, we received it as a profile, and if you 00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0% received it as a profile, and if you 00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:31.349 align:start position:0% received it as a profile, and if you go into the profile, you can search by plural based on Lee. 00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0% go into the profile, you can search by plural based on Lee. 00:44:31.359 --> 00:44:33.589 align:start position:0% go into the profile, you can search by plural based on Lee. So I'll put in a long padding humidifier. I'll put it in and 00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:36.270 align:start position:0% So I'll put in a long padding humidifier. I'll put it in and 00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:36.280 align:start position:0% 00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:39.870 align:start position:0% receive two based on the top and two based on the video. 00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:39.880 align:start position:0% receive two based on the top and two based on the video. 00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:43.510 align:start position:0% receive two based on the top and two based on the video. Then, these will come out. I'll 00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520 align:start position:0% Then, these will come out. I'll 00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:47.230 align:start position:0% Then, these will come out. I'll break this down and use the file TikTok. I'll 00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:47.240 align:start position:0% break this down and use the file TikTok. I'll 00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:49.430 align:start position:0% break this down and use the file TikTok. I'll 00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:52.030 align:start position:0% 00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:52.040 align:start position:0% 00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:55.150 align:start position:0% copy it again and change it to text. 00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:55.160 align:start position:0% copy it again and change it to text. 00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.270 align:start position:0% copy it again and change it to text. 00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:57.280 align:start position:0% 00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:59.510 align:start position:0% Then, you can connect it in the same way. You can 00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0% Then, you can connect it in the same way. You can 00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:16.309 align:start position:0% Then, you can connect it in the same way. You can 00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0% 00:45:16.319 --> 00:45:22.270 align:start position:0% create a filter here as well. Yes, run it like 00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:22.280 align:start position:0% 00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.630 align:start position:0% this and apply this 00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:24.640 align:start position:0% this and apply this 00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:27.349 align:start position:0% this and apply this filter to filter out duplicate 00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0% filter to filter out duplicate 00:45:27.359 --> 00:45:29.630 align:start position:0% filter to filter out duplicate content. You 00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:29.640 align:start position:0% content. You 00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:31.790 align:start position:0% content. You can filter by ID value. Then, 00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0% can filter by ID value. Then, 00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:34.430 align:start position:0% can filter by ID value. Then, in the case of x, 00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.440 align:start position:0% in the case of x, 00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:36.349 align:start position:0% in the case of x, what we used to use 00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:36.359 align:start position:0% what we used to use 00:45:36.359 --> 00:45:38.270 align:start position:0% what we used to use can only be searched based on URL. So you 00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:38.280 align:start position:0% can only be searched based on URL. So you 00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.190 align:start position:0% can only be searched based on URL. So you can look for other things. Most 00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:42.510 align:start position:0% can look for other things. Most 00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:42.520 align:start position:0% 00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:44.990 align:start position:0% In the case of V2 version, if you don't use the paid version, you 00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.000 align:start position:0% In the case of V2 version, if you don't use the paid version, you 00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.910 align:start position:0% In the case of V2 version, if you don't use the paid version, you can't use it with API calls. The reason why you ca 00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:49.950 align:start position:0% can't use it with API calls. The reason why you ca 00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:49.960 align:start position:0% 00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.710 align:start position:0% n't use it with API calls is because we ran it 00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0% n't use it with API calls is because we ran it 00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:53.750 align:start position:0% n't use it with API calls is because we ran it directly in Make earlier, 00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:55.910 align:start position:0% directly in Make earlier, 00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0% 00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.549 align:start position:0% right? Running it directly means using the API. But that's not possible right now. 00:45:57.549 --> 00:46:01.430 align:start position:0% right? Running it directly means using the API. But that's not possible right now. 00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:04.309 align:start position:0% 00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0% 00:46:04.319 --> 00:46:06.270 align:start position:0% Instead, you can run it directly here. So, in this way, it's 00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:09.190 align:start position:0% Instead, you can run it directly here. So, in this way, it's 00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0% 00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.910 align:start position:0% difficult to proceed in the case of X. Here, we 00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:13.470 align:start position:0% difficult to proceed in the case of X. Here, we 00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:13.480 align:start position:0% 00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.670 align:start position:0% said there are two ways. You can detect that the actor has returned with watch action R, and 00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:18.470 align:start position:0% said there are two ways. You can detect that the actor has returned with watch action R, and 00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0% 00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.790 align:start position:0% then receive the dataset ID and 00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:23.230 align:start position:0% then receive the dataset ID and 00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:25.710 align:start position:0% 00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:25.720 align:start position:0% 00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.670 align:start position:0% proceed by receiving data and updating it. So, 00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:30.109 align:start position:0% proceed by receiving data and updating it. So, 00:46:30.109 --> 00:46:30.119 align:start position:0% 00:46:30.119 --> 00:46:32.190 align:start position:0% unless you're going to use a huge amount of data all the time, you don't need to use the paid version of Pa. 00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:32.200 align:start position:0% unless you're going to use a huge amount of data all the time, you don't need to use the paid version of Pa. 00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.309 align:start position:0% unless you're going to use a huge amount of data all the time, you don't need to use the paid version of Pa. But now, if you 00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0% But now, if you 00:46:34.319 --> 00:46:36.870 align:start position:0% But now, if you really want to crawl the X data based on keywords, you can 00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:39.069 align:start position:0% really want to crawl the X data based on keywords, you can 00:46:39.069 --> 00:46:40.990 align:start position:0% 00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:41.000 align:start position:0% 00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.990 align:start position:0% create a separate scenario by checking it with actor 1 in this way and 00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:43.000 align:start position:0% create a separate scenario by checking it with actor 1 in this way and 00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.990 align:start position:0% create a separate scenario by checking it with actor 1 in this way and test collecting data. 00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:46.510 align:start position:0% test collecting data. 00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:46.520 align:start position:0% 00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.790 align:start position:0% So I explained the X n separate 00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:48.800 align:start position:0% So I explained the X n separate 00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.950 align:start position:0% So I explained the X n separate method now, and the rest are collected by 00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:50.960 align:start position:0% method now, and the rest are collected by 00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.190 align:start position:0% method now, and the rest are collected by splitting it in one router and 00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:53.200 align:start position:0% splitting it in one router and 00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.670 align:start position:0% splitting it in one router and filtering it like this. I 00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0% filtering it like this. I 00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.710 align:start position:0% filtering it like this. I created a workflow that can be done. Then, 00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:57.720 align:start position:0% created a workflow that can be done. Then, 00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:59.750 align:start position:0% created a workflow that can be done. Then, when you actually run it, you can enable all the routes. You can enable them 00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0% when you actually run it, you can enable all the routes. You can enable them 00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.790 align:start position:0% when you actually run it, you can enable all the routes. You can enable them like this and 00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:01.800 align:start position:0% like this and 00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:04.069 align:start position:0% like this and use them. Here, you 00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0% use them. Here, you 00:47:04.079 --> 00:47:06.790 align:start position:0% use them. Here, you can set up a cycle. For example, you can 00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0% can set up a cycle. For example, you can 00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:09.190 align:start position:0% can set up a cycle. For example, you can run it every Monday. 00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0% run it every Monday. 00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.309 align:start position:0% run it every Monday. Then, 00:47:11.309 --> 00:47:13.470 align:start position:0% Then, 00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:13.480 align:start position:0% 00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:15.390 align:start position:0% based on the keywords in our crawling target check, it will be divided by platform and 00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:15.400 align:start position:0% based on the keywords in our crawling target check, it will be divided by platform and 00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:18.349 align:start position:0% based on the keywords in our crawling target check, it will be divided by platform and crawled sequentially. 00:47:18.349 --> 00:47:18.359 align:start position:0% crawled sequentially. 00:47:18.359 --> 00:47:20.670 align:start position:0% crawled sequentially. We have 00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:20.680 align:start position:0% We have 00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:22.829 align:start position:0% We have completed the first scenario. 00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839 align:start position:0% completed the first scenario. 00:47:22.839 --> 00:47:24.549 align:start position:0% completed the first scenario. Now, if you collect data like this, you 00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:26.870 align:start position:0% Now, if you collect data like this, you 00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0% 00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.390 align:start position:0% may want to analyze the data based on it using the best fit. 00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0% may want to analyze the data based on it using the best fit. 00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:30.270 align:start position:0% may want to analyze the data based on it using the best fit. So, 00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:30.280 align:start position:0% So, 00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.069 align:start position:0% So, let's try that again. This time, let's 00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0% let's try that again. This time, let's 00:47:32.079 --> 00:47:34.910 align:start position:0% let's try that again. This time, let's create a new scenario and 00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:34.920 align:start position:0% create a new scenario and 00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:37.230 align:start position:0% create a new scenario and bring only the data that applies to me as a search row. If you look at the keywords 00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:37.240 align:start position:0% bring only the data that applies to me as a search row. If you look at the keywords 00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:40.390 align:start position:0% bring only the data that applies to me as a search row. If you look at the keywords in the SNS crawling data, you can see that I want to 00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:42.829 align:start position:0% in the SNS crawling data, you can see that I want to 00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:42.839 align:start position:0% 00:47:42.839 --> 00:47:44.829 align:start position:0% filter and use only the ones that contain Starbucks. Let's say I want to use 00:47:44.829 --> 00:47:46.309 align:start position:0% filter and use only the ones that contain Starbucks. Let's say I want to use 00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0% 00:47:46.319 --> 00:47:48.790 align:start position:0% Starbucks and 00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0% Starbucks and 00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:51.109 align:start position:0% Starbucks and bring them sequentially based on the row number. 00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0% bring them sequentially based on the row number. 00:47:51.119 --> 00:47:54.030 align:start position:0% bring them sequentially based on the row number. Let's run it once. Then, 00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:54.040 align:start position:0% Let's run it once. Then, 00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:56.510 align:start position:0% Let's run it once. Then, 12 pieces of data were brought in. We brought in 12 pieces of data. 00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:58.390 align:start position:0% 12 pieces of data were brought in. We brought in 12 pieces of data. 00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0% 00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.549 align:start position:0% We will put Chaji PT in this. 00:48:00.549 --> 00:48:00.559 align:start position:0% We will put Chaji PT in this. 00:48:00.559 --> 00:48:02.589 align:start position:0% We will put Chaji PT in this.

So we'll connect them all with commas. 00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:42.440 align:start position:0% had 12 right now. So we'll connect them all with commas. 00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.470 align:start position:0% had 12 right now. So we'll connect them all with commas. But you have to make one more. We'll 00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:46.990 align:start position:0% But you have to make one more. We'll 00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:47.000 align:start position:0% 00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.630 align:start position:0% use set barriers. We'll use the Jason formatter.

We'll wrap the text value in square brackets. 00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0% wrap the text value in square brackets. 00:48:52.079 --> 00:48:53.670 align:start position:0% wrap the text value in square brackets. That way, it'll 00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0% That way, it'll 00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:55.510 align:start position:0% That way, it'll be merged in a Jason format. 00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0% be merged in a Jason format. 00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:57.990 align:start position:0% be merged in a Jason format. So, you can put the merged value in the Chaji PT. We'll 00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:00.549 align:start position:0% So, you can put the merged value in the Chaji PT. We'll 00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0% 00:49:00.559 --> 00:49:02.230 align:start position:0% run it with the latest Chaji PT 4. 00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:02.240 align:start position:0% run it with the latest Chaji PT 4. 00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.630 align:start position:0% run it with the latest Chaji PT 4. System You can input both the user prompt and the system prompt. The 00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.640 align:start position:0% System You can input both the user prompt and the system prompt. The 00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.109 align:start position:0% System You can input both the user prompt and the system prompt. The system 00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:06.119 align:start position:0% system 00:49:06.119 --> 00:49:08.150 align:start position:0% system prompt 00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0% prompt 00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.710 align:start position:0% prompt gives directions on how to work, and the user 00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:09.720 align:start position:0% gives directions on how to work, and the user 00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:12.270 align:start position:0% gives directions on how to work, and the user prompt is the prompt that gives the actual command. 00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:12.280 align:start position:0% prompt is the prompt that gives the actual command. 00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:14.750 align:start position:0% prompt is the prompt that gives the actual command. So I will include this example 00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:14.760 align:start position:0% So I will include this example 00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.670 align:start position:0% So I will include this example on the sheet so that you can refer to it. 00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:16.680 align:start position:0% on the sheet so that you can refer to it. 00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:18.349 align:start position:0% on the sheet so that you can refer to it. However, this is not necessarily the 00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0% However, this is not necessarily the 00:49:18.359 --> 00:49:20.549 align:start position:0% However, this is not necessarily the correct answer, but I 00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0% correct answer, but I 00:49:20.559 --> 00:49:21.950 align:start position:0% correct answer, but I think it would be good to use it as a reference. The most 00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:21.960 align:start position:0% think it would be good to use it as a reference. The most 00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.910 align:start position:0% think it would be good to use it as a reference. The most important thing here is that when Choi Chi 00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0% important thing here is that when Choi Chi 00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.829 align:start position:0% important thing here is that when Choi Chi PT asks to create in Jason format, 00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0% PT asks to create in Jason format, 00:49:25.839 --> 00:49:28.270 align:start position:0% PT asks to create in Jason format, this value is 00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:28.280 align:start position:0% this value is 00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:30.430 align:start position:0% this value is often output. However, I will specify that this should not be output in the output. I 00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:32.030 align:start position:0% often output. However, I will specify that this should not be output in the output. I 00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:34.109 align:start position:0% 00:49:34.109 --> 00:49:34.119 align:start position:0% 00:49:34.119 --> 00:49:36.390 align:start position:0% asked for the user prompt to be written in Korean, and then I will 00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0% asked for the user prompt to be written in Korean, and then I will 00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.470 align:start position:0% asked for the user prompt to be written in Korean, and then I will add one more user prompt. The most 00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:38.480 align:start position:0% add one more user prompt. The most 00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.710 align:start position:0% add one more user prompt. The most important thing is that we need to input the actual value that we processed. We 00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:43.109 align:start position:0% important thing is that we need to input the actual value that we processed. We 00:49:43.109 --> 00:49:43.119 align:start position:0% 00:49:43.119 --> 00:49:45.150 align:start position:0% will input the processed value in the Jason formatter. And 00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:45.160 align:start position:0% will input the processed value in the Jason formatter. And 00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:47.430 align:start position:0% will input the processed value in the Jason formatter. And just in case, I will increase the torque a little. 00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0% just in case, I will increase the torque a little. 00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:50.230 align:start position:0% just in case, I will increase the torque a little. This is how we will proceed with the analysis. After the 00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.240 align:start position:0% This is how we will proceed with the analysis. After the 00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.109 align:start position:0% This is how we will proceed with the analysis. After the analysis is conducted, since we 00:49:52.109 --> 00:49:52.119 align:start position:0% analysis is conducted, since we 00:49:52.119 --> 00:49:53.990 align:start position:0% analysis is conducted, since we asked to receive it in Jason format, it 00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:55.549 align:start position:0% asked to receive it in Jason format, it 00:49:55.549 --> 00:49:55.559 align:start position:0% 00:49:55.559 --> 00:49:58.349 align:start position:0% will come out in Jason format. Then, you can pass it to Jason and 00:49:58.349 --> 00:50:00.710 align:start position:0% will come out in Jason format. Then, you can pass it to Jason and 00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0% 00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:02.349 align:start position:0% get the ret value.

I learned about crawling methods, 00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0% learned about crawling methods, 00:51:22.079 --> 00:51:23.910 align:start position:0% learned about crawling methods, and I 00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920 align:start position:0% and I 00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:26.349 align:start position:0% and I requested data analysis using AI based on the crawled data and 00:51:26.349 --> 00:51:26.359 align:start position:0% requested data analysis using AI based on the crawled data and 00:51:26.359 --> 00:51:28.190 align:start position:0% requested data analysis using AI based on the crawled data and updated the value in the sheet. 00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:30.069 align:start position:0% updated the value in the sheet. 00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0% 00:51:30.079 --> 00:51:32.470 align:start position:0% In the case of SNS crawling, if you crawl 00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0% In the case of SNS crawling, if you crawl 00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.390 align:start position:0% In the case of SNS crawling, if you crawl data from various platforms with code, it 00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:36.270 align:start position:0% data from various platforms with code, it 00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:36.280 align:start position:0% 00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:38.589 align:start position:0% takes a long time to work and maintenance can be difficult. However, if you 00:51:38.589 --> 00:51:39.950 align:start position:0% takes a long time to work and maintenance can be difficult. However, if you 00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0% 00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:42.069 align:start position:0% use the maker file like this, it is a bit complicated, 00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0% use the maker file like this, it is a bit complicated, 00:51:42.079 --> 00:51:44.270 align:start position:0% use the maker file like this, it is a bit complicated, but once you set it up, you can 00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0% but once you set it up, you can 00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.589 align:start position:0% but once you set it up, you can easily collect data stably. 00:51:46.589 --> 00:51:46.599 align:start position:0% easily collect data stably. 00:51:46.599 --> 00:51:48.349 align:start position:0% easily collect data stably. Of course, you should keep in mind that if you crawl 00:51:48.349 --> 00:51:48.359 align:start position:0% Of course, you should keep in mind that if you crawl 00:51:48.359 --> 00:51:50.069 align:start position:0% Of course, you should keep in mind that if you crawl a large amount of SNS data 00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:50.079 align:start position:0% a large amount of SNS data 00:51:50.079 --> 00:51:52.270 align:start position:0% a large amount of SNS data using files, it 00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:52.280 align:start position:0% using files, it 00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:54.349 align:start position:0% using files, it will cost money. If you use it 00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0% will cost money. If you use it 00:51:54.359 --> 00:51:56.990 align:start position:0% will cost money. If you use it not just out of curiosity but in a way that is good for creation, you 00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:59.349 align:start position:0% not just out of curiosity but in a way that is good for creation, you 00:51:59.349 --> 00:52:01.910 align:start position:0% 00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:04.309 align:start position:0% 00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0% 00:52:04.319 --> 00:52:06.230 align:start position:0% may feel that the cost is not that big if you consider the resources to automate and maintain it directly with code. 00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0% may feel that the cost is not that big if you consider the resources to automate and maintain it directly with code. 00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.630 align:start position:0% may feel that the cost is not that big if you consider the resources to automate and maintain it directly with code. Therefore, if you 00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:07.640 align:start position:0% Therefore, if you 00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:09.990 align:start position:0% Therefore, if you consider the cost aspect and determine that you will get a certain level of ROI, I 00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:12.270 align:start position:0% consider the cost aspect and determine that you will get a certain level of ROI, I 00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:13.910 align:start position:0% 00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0% 00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:16.030 align:start position:0% think it is an option that you can use when crawling in large quantities.
