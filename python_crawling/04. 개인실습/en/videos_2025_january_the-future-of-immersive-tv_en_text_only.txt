<v ->All right.</v>
Welcome, everyone.
We are here at The Future of Immersive TV.
Thanks for joining us.
I'm your moderator today, Rick Kowalski,
Senior Director of Business Intelligence
at Consumer Technology Association, CTA,
host of the show, and is the power behind CES.
So thanks for joining us and diving into all the great ideas
and innovation here this week.
Glad to have you here.
So today I have a few panelists here.
We're gonna talk about some of the emerging TV trends,
some of the technologies
that are coming up in the next several years,
and really, you know, pushing the envelope
and figuring out what's gonna make the TV experience
more immersive, more engaging.
So it's really gonna touch on anything that's, you know,
pulling in the consumer in new and exciting ways.
So let me introduce my guest here,
and I'll start with Matt Brantley from 6P Color,
and if you could introduce yourself as I introduce you.
<v ->Sure, yeah. So Matt Brantley.</v>
Thanks, everyone, for coming out.
I'm Chief Technology Officer at 6P Color Incorporated,
and we make color management solutions for kind
of the new age of consumer media,
as well as dipping our toes into industrial
and healthcare aerospace applications as well.
Thanks for having us.
<v ->Great, and Sasha McCune is Vice President</v>
of Media Entertainment and Culture at CMB.
Tell us a little bit about yourself.
<v ->Yeah, thanks so much for having me.</v>
I run the media entertainment
and culture practice at CMB,
a top insights and research consulting company,
and that means I'm studying fandom, viewer experiences,
the adoption of innovations
that are on the show floor here today
in consumer marketplace, and have a lot of fun doing it.
Thanks for having us.
<v ->Great, and to the far right is Dan Mouradian,</v>
SVP of Global Client Solutions at Innovid.
<v ->Yeah, thank you again for having us.</v>
We're really, really happy to be here.
My name is Dan Mouradian, I'm the SVP
of Global Client Solutions at Innovid, which is a company
that enables advertisers to deliver, measure, personalize,
and create interactive experiences for the TV,
which means I represent the dark side, (laughs)
and happy to be here.
<v ->So yeah, we've got the light side and the dark side.</v>
We've got the technology, we've got the ads (Dan laughs)
and marketing, all that, so, yeah.
So I think a good way to start this is just to think about,
you know, how do you define immersive TV now?
You know, we've got a lot
of different immersive experiences out there
in the world, but when you pull it into the home,
and to the consumer, what does that mean to you?
And I guess I can start off with Matt here.
<v ->So the way that I see immersive TV is anything</v>
that allows us to suspend disbelief for where we are,
and what we're doing in that exact moment.
A lot of it's really personalized to the individual
and what they're trying to accomplish with that.
But with the amazing technology advancements,
and man, some of the stuff we've seen on the floor,
it's amazing, just the ability for them
to be somewhere, do something
that is not physically with them there.
That's, I think, to us, immersion,
and there's a lot of things to feed into that.
<v ->Yeah, that's great. Sasha, how about you?</v>
<v ->You know, I always think about the consumer first</v>
in a lot of these moments.
The future of immersive TV being, how do you bring
to their homes, in their everyday lives,
experiences that are high quality and immersive,
and surround them,
and give them that lean back experience
that perhaps they used to get in theaters
that they're looking to bring into their home,
and really engage with content in new ways,
whether that's 360 viewing experiences,
viewing things on four screens at once,
or viewing things across platforms
and engaging with many things at once
or even, you know, surround sound
and kind of bringing things
to life in their living room in new ways.
<v ->Great, great. And Dan?</v>
<v ->Yeah, I mean, as we think about immersive TV</v>
from an advertising perspective,
I think it's really important to bear in mind
what my other two panelists have have mentioned here.
And it's about not disrupting the experience
that somebody has in that immersive state of mind.
So it's about, for the advertising world,
immersive TV, I think, is defined
as personalized creative.
It's interactive creative,
it's creative that you can engage with.
It's one that allows the consumer to continue to explore
and invest in the experiences that they're taking part of.
You know, one of the questions that I like to ask,
and as it relates to this topic is, how do you all watch TV?
And I think as you answer that,
and as you survey a room of folks who answer that question,
you're gonna find that TV has become, you know,
not this sort of laid-back experience.
I'm gonna sit down and I'm gonna watch.
My 94-year-old grandfather watches Fox News
at 7:00 PM every night.
That is TV to him,
but my 23-year-old daughter, TV is in bed on my phone.
And so the definition there is around the content
and the type of content that we get.
And as that becomes more immersive,
you know, it's really critical
that we don't disrupt those experiences
with ads that are not personalized.
People are used to personalized experiences
that allow the user to engage, to interact, you know,
and that's, I think we don't wanna break things
as they're getting better
and better and more immersive.
<v ->Yeah. And you're right.</v>
You know, what we're seeing in consumer behaviors
when we go study people's living rooms
is no one is watching TV the same way.
Everyone's viewing systems, their ecosystems
of how they're using all the different platforms,
all the different devices to get
to the content they wanna watch where they wanna watch it,
when they wanna watch it, have become so complicated
that you have this intricate web of systems and workarounds
and access points that consumers are going through
to get to their content.
And you know, we've equated it
in some recent research we've done
as every single consumer out there in the world
has this unique snowflake
of how they're interacting
with their content,
and creating a media universe in their home.
And a lot of them are going to extreme lengths
to create immersive experiences
that maybe they're seeing products not delivered to them.
You know, one of the most viral gifts I saw trending
on TikTok over the Christmas was projectors for bedrooms
and little gadgets to make viewing
and listening to music
more fun in the home.
<v ->Guilty.</v>
I bought my 10-year-old
daughter a projector.
<v ->I did, I also bought my nephew a projector,</v>
and I bought this really cool little sound visualizer
that has ferro fluid in it.
It was definitely influenced,
and it became the hot gift of the holiday.
All the guys wanted one, why didn't I get one of those?
Now I'm like, alright, now I have to go buy five more.
<v ->I just have one question.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Were you targeted with a really well placed ad</v>
in order to buy that product?
<v ->So speaking of immersive experiences and ads,</v>
TikTok Shop is absolutely changing
the entire landscape right now.
We were joking the other day
that TikTok Shop has become the QVC
of this generation,
and it happened overnight, and it's so interesting
and fascinating, but it's also short form content.
It's portrait, not landscape.
Our TVs and our viewing experiences
aren't designed for that.
So we were joking,
at what point are TVs gonna to shift on their side?
Is there gonna be a button to rotate them
so you can TikTok Shop on your big screen?
You know, we were kind of riffing with that the other day.
<v ->Well, I think the immersion,</v>
what's interesting is we've known for a long time
that the choice in media
has always been a personal experience, but now,
it's becoming consumers expect choice
in how they consume that media.
And it's really transcending technology.
It's going into, it's a personal experience.
Like you were saying, your daughter consuming.
Mine do the same thing.
It drives me nuts.
But you know, they're watching TV on their phone
with a TV in front of them that's off.
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->And I'm like, that was an expensive TV,</v>
why are you watching your phone? "Eh, I can just click it.
I don't have to grab a remote."
But I mean, to everybody, it's unique.
So it's not just the media.
It's how they consume it,
which is a fascinating kind of new landscape.
<v ->And I have this unique purview in my world</v>
where I research both the consumer side,
but I also get to hear the perspective
of traditional media executives.
And let me tell you,
traditional media executives are so concerned about the fact
that their TV shows exist on the television
surrounded in a black box.
And there's all this other activity happening around it.
There's social media while they're watching on the phone.
I've watched people juggle three phones to keep up
with a conversation while watching a sports game.
And the traditional media executives acknowledge
that they have not done a good job bridging the gap
between what's on the television,
the true traditional television,
and what's happening in this other universe with devices.
So there's a lot of cross-platform device interactivity
at play that hasn't really been cracked
as a cohesive, immersive experience.
<v ->Yeah. Let's talk about that a little bit more.</v>
What are the solutions to this?
You know, we talked a little bit about fragmentation
and kind of the fragmentation of experience.
What are some solutions you're seeing to kind
of tie all those devices together into something
that's more cohesive?
<v ->So from a fragmentation perspective,</v>
I'll just give a little bit of background.
So Innovid, the company that I work for, is an ad server.
For those who are unfamiliar with an ad server,
we're basically a counter.
We deliver the creative ad when the publisher
or the platform or the television service calls us
and says, "Hey, this advertiser bought media from us.
We wanna see an ad, or we need to show an ad."
And so whoever has purchased that media
will give us their creative,
and we'll serve that creative.
And we count the whole chain.
We deliver about 1.4 billion ads a day.
We're one of the largest video ad servers on the planet.
We operate in every country.
So we have an enormous scale.
The company's been in business for about 17 years now.
We originally started as an online video ad server,
which means, you know,
you're scrolling on your mobile device,
or this is pre-mobile,
you're scrolling on your desktop computer,
and you get that pre-roll ad that shows up,
and you hit the Skip button.
Thanks. You're welcome.
That was us.
<v ->Thank you, thank you.</v>
<v ->Yes, thank you, but now,</v>
more and more of that is happening on CTV.
So again, 1.4 billion ads we deliver every single day.
58% of those end up on television screens,
what we define as a TV screen in the home.
So it's not a laptop, it's not a mobile device,
it's not a mobile app.
In that group,
what we see from a fragmentation perspective
is all the different screen sizes, the resolutions,
the connection speed
of the consumer while they're streaming.
We get the publisher, the platform, the device.
Are they viewing through a dongle?
Like all of the metadata associated with that ad call
and delivery is stuff that we warehouse
and we look at every single day.
And so what we see from a, you know, when we get a piece
of creative from an advertiser who has, you know,
hired that company, the agency,
and they've bought that media
because of the target that's there,
we receive the asset that's been produced.
And what we do is we encode that asset,
and we encode that asset over 90 times
to satisfy all the different needs
of the fragmentation that exists.
And I know Matt has an even more interesting perspective
on the fragmentation from the production side of things,
and Sasha as well.
<v ->I cannot imagine, Matt, how you manage color perfection</v>
across all these infinite screens.
<v ->It's interesting.</v>
So as you know, you go back not too long ago,
you watched movies in a theater,
you watched TV at your home television,
your computer was for a certain type of media.
The modality of the media were intricately related.
And as we're seeing now with the personalization
of how people consume media, it's the,
"No, I wanna watch the new Disney movie on my phone
at the airport," right?
Or wherever it's convenient for me.
And I do agree with you.
Some of the, let's say, more old-school perspectives
are definitely not happy about that,
'cause it does introduce
new complexities-
<v ->Oh, yeah.</v>
<v ->into, just as you</v>
were talking about, not only on the ad size,
but also just in the general media industry together.
And so, you know, what we focus on is, actually,
how do you provide the same experience
that transcends the technology?
'Cause the modality is intricately tied to the type
of technology that's used to deliver that.
And so our color management systems are directly, you know,
that's why we're creating them is to try to address that.
And you know, we are addressing one issue in the spectrum
of issues that introduces of, you know,
people want the same experience,
but it's a completely different delivery mechanism,
which means that now you have to understand
how do I ensure the same experience?
So you have to start thinking about things,
and this is how we approach it
in terms of what is the experience,
and then how do we leverage the technology to deliver that?
Not let the experience be described
by the technology itself.
<v ->And on the other side of things,</v>
you have big topics changing the landscape,
like generative AI.
You know, just walking
around the show floor here at here at CES,
I already see solutions
that would make consumers' lives better
with integrating all of the crazy things
that are trying to manage in their home.
Sometimes I am in an interview with someone,
and I wish I could just buy them a universal remote
and solve all their problems,
or tell them they really should replace
their $10 20-year-old Roku
that is causing all their buffering issues,
and maybe use their brand new smart TV
instead of bypassing it.
There's all these weird things that people are doing.
But, you know, thinking about the future of the solutions,
newer tech, updating dated technology,
so that people have the latest
and the greatest in their home,
and are inspired to upgrade their technology in their home,
so they can have good immersive experiences.
And another thing we are seeing here on the show floor
is interacting with your television in a completely new way.
It's going to be possible now,
and in the future, as the tech gets adopted,
to have conversations with your TV,
to ask your TV for recommendations,
and to have a dialogue about what you're in the mood
to watch, which is very organic way
of interacting with content.
And it's not gonna be just play X,
and a kind of transactional command.
It's gonna be a back and forth
and a conversation that people are gonna be able to have.
<v ->Yeah, I think,</v>
and you mentioned what's gonna inspire them,
and you know, I can definitely see that.
Are there other things we can do for consumers to kind
of inspire them to engage in that way
or raise awareness of some of the experiences?
'Cause I think, Dan, you might have brought it up
when we talked before about, you know,
consumers just not really being aware of all the stuff
that TVs can do and all the experiences they can have.
<v ->Yeah, so I mean, consumers have certainly chosen</v>
how they wanna watch TV,
and that's one of the things that we've seen
with the shift from linear viewership,
like the average age of a linear viewer is 65 years old.
The average American is 39 years old.
We've seen this shift to I know how to get
what I want when I wanna watch it.
And that's through connected televisions,
or you know, apps that are connected to television,
like apps on phones and desktops.
And with connected television, by connecting the TV
to the internet, you unlock a whole new set
of capabilities that,
at least in the digital advertising space,
we have been doing for decades now,
personalization, you know,
taking a signal that we get on an ad call,
like an IP address,
or that tells us the location,
that can tell us the weather outside,
or if somebody's streaming on a service like Disney.
I don't know if anybody made it
to the Cosmo a couple days ago,
but Disney made an announcement with us in partnership
where we were enabling a contextual targeting product
they call Disney Magic Words.
So an advertiser can buy context and mood,
and then we can deliver an experience
or an ad that relates back to that signal.
Mechanically, we've been able to do this
for a really long time.
It also introduces interactivity,
and, you know, interactive formats do perform better
in an ad space than standard,
you know, sort of delivered ads.
But there is that, you know,
just like the consumer has chosen how they wanna watch TV,
and that's very clearly ad supported,
connected television, hi.
They're also learning,
and every new thing that comes out, whether it's voice,
you know, consumers are still learning how to interact
with TVs through voice remotes,
like that's relatively new,
even though televisions have been able to do that
for the last five, six years.
Look at the QR code, you know, 10 years ago,
you had to have a special app,
and you had to enable permissions to scan it.
And no one did.
No one did it,
Now we've got QR codes that can add things straight
to your target.com shopping cart.
Buying things on TV is another one of those,
like shoppable TV is one of those new technologies
that we're starting to see the market introduce,
and what's gonna, you know, again,
we're still very much in these like consumer adoption curves
of early adopters, early majorities, late majorities,
depending on the tech.
And I just think it's a wide open place.
Forget about the ads,
but like, when you start thinking about how people interact
with their own devices,
advertisers are gonna glom onto that,
and they're gonna figure out how to use that in an ad
so that they can, you know,
capitalize on the way people are engaging.
But you know, that, to me, is the exciting thing,
like having a conversation in my room organically
about what I wanna watch, and then it just starts playing.
That sounds delightful. (laughs)
<v ->You mentioned the adoption curve,</v>
and I think that's something to really pay attention to
of all of these technologies as they evolve and grow.
We need to keep a really close eye on the adoption
when it's tipping over to what we call, at CMB,
a chasm-crossing moment.
And we did a study this a few months ago
on the consumer adoption of generative AI,
and we found that we were very, very close
to overtaking smart speakers in adoption of generative AI.
So we're at 36% adoption
of generative AI features in the gen pop,
and 52% with media and tech workers alone.
So you see how big that jumps
when you just zoom in on people
who work in the industry.
And then we looked at, smart speakers are at 51% penetration
and adoption within the US, so that tells you
we're already fast approaching that milestone.
And then for context,
I think we also measured the adoption of AR and VR,
which has also been in market,
and that was in the 20s.
<v ->29.</v>
<v ->The low percent.</v>
So we're already surpassed wit that one.
And we're seeing that happen,
because there's so much more democratized access
to these features.
There's use cases that go beyond a niche space.
And in the TV space,
you're gonna have people in sports
and gaming really adopt these things at an even higher rate,
and pressure test them
and bring them into their living rooms and homes,
because they're really, really hungry
for customizing their media setups in their space.
<v ->And I take no credit for this,</v>
'cause this was your research,
but I just found
it so fascinating.
You know, Sasha did some research a while ago about,
you know, and one of the questions
in her research thesis was,
would you ever buy something on your phone?
And how many people would've said yes to that a decade ago?
I bought stuff on my phone like this morning,
on my way over here in a cab, like it's everywhere.
<v ->Six months ago, a year ago,</v>
how many of you would've bought something on TikTok Shop?
TikTok Shop.
Now it's growing and going really crazy.
So yeah, it evolves all the time.
So now how many people would buy something on your TV
by scanning a QR code straight from your streaming app?
It's going to be happening.
It's going to kind of inch its way into the zeitgeist.
<v ->So I think a thing that adds to the complexity</v>
that this introduces is, you know, one of the things
that I find fascinating kind of in nature that we are in is,
you know, as advertising is starting
to transcend specific types of media as well,
and non-linear television as well.
And you've got some things that are even, you know,
a little bit of generative going into the ad itself.
<v ->Oh yeah.</v>
<v ->I've seen a few cameos from my favorite TV shows</v>
telling me I
should buy something, but you know, for brand managers-
<v ->You're welcome.</v>
<v ->Yeah, yeah, it was fun.</v>
It was very personal, very immersive.
But you know, I'm fascinated in how,
for you guys as you're delivering that,
how do you maintain brand standards as you're starting
to get content that is going to, you know,
they don't know where it's gonna end up.
They don't know if that's gonna be able
to show the right brand colors.
<v ->Yeah, I think this is a problem regardless of brand</v>
is the state of fragmentation is a little unhinged,
and it's also not getting better,
and it's just going to get more fragmented.
And that leaves everyone in this room
and everyone at CES, the people that work on products,
and technology, and the intersection of these experiences,
it means we're constantly designing
for infinite potential option.
Allocate, maybe.
<v ->Absolutely, absolutely.</v>
<v ->And it drives all of us nuts</v>
all the time, I'm sure.
And unfortunately I don't see a path
where that changes to you.
<v ->No.</v>
<v ->I know.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>
The interesting thing about the fragmentation
is when you look at the sort of companies
that are driving some of this, like, you know,
legally there's not a whole lot of merger
and acquisition that's gonna happen on that chart.
So, you know, the fragmentation is very, very well
and truly clearly here to stay.
We look at our delivery data,
it's like over a dozen different companies,
and they're the Amazons of the world.
They're the, you know, Facebooks, YouTubes, Google,
like Samsung, Roku, Hulu, those are the top platforms
that we're delivering into.
And you're just not gonna, you won't see the, you know,
the acquisition space begin to collapse that.
When you look at like the last two revolutions
that we've had from a consumer perspective,
whether that's the mobile revolution
or the personal computer revolution
before that, the winners in those spaces were the owners
of the operating systems.
And that's the, you know, with the PC,
it was very clearly Windows.
And then with mobile it was Apple, and Google,
and now in the TV space, the operating system manufacturers,
I mean, we were joking backstage about it,
but like, that's why the fragmentation isn't going anywhere
because the OS makers know that that's the key
to the whole puzzle.
And again, you just won't see it from an M&amp;A perspective.
<v ->And also, the other problem is that consumers almost ask</v>
for the fragmentation,
because they want infinite choice.
And that infinite choice just adds the complexity.
We joked, I had a participant in a study recently,
and he had advocated for fragmentation.
He couldn't imagine one app serving his needs,
and he was kind of like leaning into it.
But at the same time he had so many blind spots
about what fragmentation was doing to him as a consumer
that he actually was paying for Paramount twice,
because he subscribed to it through Amazon,
and then bought another standalone subscription
to access it through his app, and he had no idea.
And being a researcher, you just have to be like,
"I am not gonna tell him."
You can't intervene. This is his world.
<v ->I think that, you know,</v>
just talking about fragmentation there,
but you know, it doesn't help
that the consumer technology industry
keeps adding more screens on everything.
You've got it on your fridge now,
and you know, I've seen wearable, essentially-
<v Sasha>Glasses?</v>
<v ->Wearable displays.</v>
So now you know,
are all your screens just gonna live on your face,
you know, (laughs)
and what do you do in that environment?
So, you know, it's certainly changing.
Are there any other, you know,
screen technologies you're seeing on the show floor
that you think are especially immersive,
or that will will change things in years ahead?
<v ->I mean, we've been talking a lot about the home,</v>
but walking the CES floor, what's really cool
is you see how screens can be transformed
to be floors and walls,
and create spaces and be the boundaries of a space.
That's a really cool thing to think about.
And I also look to the sphere here,
and I wonder how far are we from a future
where consumers can recreate an experience like the sphere
in their own space, and have that be a part
of their own entertainment experience,
or be an experience they seek out locally.
It's gonna really start to change the standards
for what quality is.
And there might be more of a surround visual experience
that people are looking for
to mirror the surround sound era.
<v ->Well, if you think about what does that enable, right?</v>
I mean, in a perfect world,
you could take any surface anywhere,
and you could make that surface
into anything you wanted it to be.
You know, I mean, we still have a lot
of perspectives going back to the days of, oh yeah,
a screen is a big discreet thing,
and it lives in its own little spot,
and then you bring the people to the screen.
But you know, in a perfect world,
especially for advertisers,
like if you could push an ad in front of me anywhere,
right?
<v ->I will.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->You will.</v>
<v ->Is it gonna have a skip button</v>
when it's projected on my ceiling?
<v ->Right? Yeah.</v>
<v ->Exactly.</v>
<v ->So we're even seeing with some</v>
of like the immersive like art galleries
and things like that, 'cause now that screens no longer have
to look like a screen.
Right, I mean, there's some stuff on the show form,
especially with like displays,
that are meant to look like printed artwork.
You know, the more canvas that we can give
to the advertiser, we can give to the creative that's trying
to create an immersive experience
or we can just make it look, I saw some amazing things,
one physically moving tiles,
and then one booth over, there's an emulation
of a physically moving tile, that similar effect.
So I think what it is,
it's really about just increasing the visual canvas
to relay experience, relay data to that user.
I mean, imagine a world where you're late for a flight,
and then you're running down the hallway
and then you're like this way, now turn this way,
and it's just popping up in front of you.
But that is now. That's available now.
So I think that's why we're seeing it
is because it's a tool that we can use
to accomplish an infinite number of jobs.
<v ->And we don't even need the screen now,</v>
because we have holographic images.
So I was trying to meet up with a friend yesterday,
walking through, navigating the halls,
and he said, "I'm by the holograph."
And I was like, "We're at CES."
It's really not that helpful anymore. But they're real now.
They're very vivid,
and it's really cool to think about 10 years ago,
not really thinking that would be accessible.
<v ->Yeah, so I was gonna bring up, you know,</v>
looking five, 10 years out now,
and thinking about, you know, where things are headed,
and we talk about, you know, some of the, you know,
trying to tackle some of these fragmentation issues.
But, you know, thinking five, 10 years out,
what does immersive TV look like?
<v ->So again, I don't think it's any surprise,</v>
the largest television event in the year is the Super Bowl.
We all talk about the Super Bowl.
It had 127 million viewers this year,
if memory serves me correctly,
of the top 100 television broadcasts this year,
The Super Bowl rights expire in 2029.
Do you think?
You're the NFL, do you think you start negotiating
with traditional media companies,
or do you go to people like Facebook, and Amazon,
and Disney, and folks like that to figure out
what those experiences look like?
Amazon two years ago took a loss leader,
and created Thursday Night Football.
They created a brand new football viewing event
and had to educate the market on,
you can watch football on Amazon on Thursday night.
And they did so at the entirety of their homepage
for weeks on end, but now-
<v ->Still doing it.</v>
<v ->Yeah, still, but now,</v>
that is a regular viewing event
for consumers who enjoy football.
So I think there's some really exciting things
around live sports delivery and immersive TV.
I mean, how cool would it be, like AR,
to your point, like 29% adoption rate
in the United States right now in terms of households
that have AR devices in them.
How cool would it be to like plop an Oculus camera
on the 50-yard line of the Super Bowl,
and then stick, I've never put one on my face before.
I would put it on
to watch the Super Bowl from the 50-yard line,
'cause that's a experience that I will never have in life.
But if the cameras are good enough,
and the color is good enough,
and the screens are good enough,
and I can suspend disbelief for long enough,
now I'm sitting, you know, court side at the Knicks,
or I'm sitting, you know, a 50-yard line at the Super Bowl,
and why do I have to be static?
Why can't I just get on the field with them?
Like, those are other things that like become new
and like multi-screen viewing,
and there's just, I think it's so bright
when you start thinking
about what immersive TV can look like.
And I think we'll see that inflection point as some
of these big media bastions start thinking the same way we
are all talking today.
<v ->And I also think we heard a lot</v>
about personalization in your future,
which I'm now gonna jump on and build on.
We already see fans, sports fans wanting
to customize their sports experiences.
They will curate four games on a screen, mute all of them,
and pull in their own commentary from radio
to make their experience their own.
And we can imagine a world
where they're doing that within new ecosystems
that they're creating their ideal fan experience,
so they can access all
of the content they want at once,
instead of having to choose A or B.
<v ->I think the, and I call it the tapas approach</v>
to media consumption.
<v ->Tapas.</v>
<v ->We also talk about is as an all-you-can-eat buffet.</v>
<v ->There you go.</v>
I think it's been an interesting thing seeing with,
you know, like the six second of stimuli that's become,
you know, for Gen Alpha,
almost the only way that they can consume anything anymore.
But it's becoming very much a rapid fire.
I'm looking for a specific type of stimuli.
I can't describe it,
so I'm just gonna scroll till I find it.
But I think the big thing, you know,
if we wanna look out 2030, I think
that the generative experience is gonna be a key in there.
And I will say, you know, I've been in the Sora betas
and stuff like that, and it's great.
It's amazing technology.
It's not there yet, but it is in our future
that it's gonna be, I wanna watch a episode of "Seinfeld,"
and this is the script I wanna watch it in.
And it's possible.
<v ->And you know, that's an interesting point</v>
when you start talking about generative AI
is there's, you know,
we all talk about it from a creative lens,
creative perspective, generative AI is really, really good
at democratization and inclusion.
You know, no affiliation here,
but there's a platform called HeyGen.ai.
You can record a video
of yourself in your own natural language,
and it will translate it to any language,
and it will re-dub your lips
to make it look like you're a natural speaker.
It's wild. It does it in seconds.
Imagine like, to your point, I wanna watch "Seinfeld,"
but I am a native Russian speaker.
Fine, now I can watch "Seinfeld" all in Russian
and it doesn't look weird, and it doesn't feel weird.
And it allows me to like connect
with that content just a little bit more,
'cause it's not the traditional like dubbing
that you're used to seeing, or live subtitles.
Kids just watch subtitles.
Maybe it's TikTok,
and they're used to seeing captions go along
with the content they're reading.
But when you are with someone from Gen A or Gen Z
or even now Gen B, I guess we're in as of officially 2025.
<v ->Betas, oh, yes, are the next gen.</v>
<v ->Any kid who's been born in the last eight days</v>
is now officially Gen B.
But you know, they're watching screens with captions on,
which originally was something that we did
from like an ADA compliance perspective,
like we gotta have it so that people
who have difficulty hearing
or able to still have the content,
but now they're just doing it as a part
of like reading through.
I'm being captioned right now
as we speak live.
<v ->Oh my gosh.</v>
And you know,
it's really just because we become too distracted.
And we lose track. And that's really interesting.
And to your point, we're also gonna probably see
some convergence of the creator economy
and short form content with traditional media,
because these worlds are so separate right now,
but they're all talking about the same content.
They're all involved in the same social conversation,
and people wanna flip back and forth from these short
and long form engagements
from these landscape and portrait moments.
And we need experiences that kind of bring those together
and create a universe where people can engage
with their fandom across both of those.
<v ->Yeah, it's ever expanding, isn't it?</v>
Yeah, any other technologies you're seeing
at the show you think
are gonna push the envelope with immersion?
<v ->Lasers in the home.</v>
<v ->Lasers?</v>
<v ->That's huge.</v>
<v ->Okay.</v>
<v ->What that unlocks for the consumer,</v>
which I will say there are,
and close to me, close to heart for me, you know,
content's not there for it,
but the technologies that we are bringing into the home
that were not previously available to the home
is there is a whole new palette of artistic expression
that's becoming available today.
And that, to me, is something that I'm just really excited
to see how that develops as people.
You know, we have the benefit now
of we have display technologies
that can show things that we can't, we don't know how
to create for now.
That is a new experience for this industry as I see it,
of it's always been the display technology
has been the rate limiter, and now, it's no longer that.
So I'm curious to see over the next, you know, I think one
to five years, how people learn to leverage that.
<v ->Yeah, that's amazing.</v>
Well, I think any other comments
on where this is headed?
<v ->Yeah, in terms of the show floor</v>
and things that I'm seeing that are exciting,
I love all of the health tech that's out there.
I mean just, you know, I know I joke
and I kid about being in the advertising space
and all of those things, but at the end of the day,
I'm a dad too, and I have children,
and I have a wife who has an illness,
and like, these are some of the things where I love to see
how consumer technology is, you know, democratizing
and normalizing and helping people live better lives.
And from a television
and an immersive television perspective, like this is where,
you know, we get to talk about the cool, wonderful things
that people are creating and doing every single day,
and how those are gonna, you know, impact engagement
and performance, and all of that.
But like at the end of the day, like those are the things
that I really enjoy looking at when I'm at shows like this
for the human reasons.
And I think that's some of what we've all been kind
of talking about is like how we engage, how we interact,
what's on the frontier, what's on the horizon.
Yes, we will have experiences,
and TV is certainly going to get more immersive
over the next few years as a result of some
of the things that we're talking about today.
<v ->And Dan will figure out how</v>
to serve us ads on all those other places too.
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
<v ->Right?</v>
<v ->Yes, exactly.</v>
I think to your point too,
just thinking about, in CTAs research,
that average Gen Z'er
has something like 13 consumer technology products.
<v Dan>Only? (laughs)</v>
<v ->Right?</v>
<v Dan>That's shocking.</v>
<v ->I wanna know what the, I wanna count them.</v>
<v ->What's the panel size?</v>
<v ->Researchers. Okay.</v>
So but consider all these, you know,
products that they're engaging with every day.
It's all part of their full experience.
And I think there's still that tie in,
because, you know, we talked about fragmentation
and all the different devices,
and trying to make that cohesive,
and TV does become a part of that, you know,
as an entertainment medium.
<v ->I do have a question.</v>
Is there ever a point where TV's become too big?
<v ->Not so far.</v>
<v ->'Cause this year's show floor proved-</v>
<v ->It was big.</v>
<v ->That 163 inch micro-LED.</v>
<v ->But isn't that what AR is?</v>
<v ->It's the one</v>
that looks like a pool.
<v ->It's just as big.</v>
<v ->And when you put those glasses on,</v>
and it's simulating a, you know,
300-inch screen or something.
<v ->It's incredible when you have to ask the question,</v>
do I have a door tall enough for this to fit through?
<v ->That's amazing.</v>
<v ->That's when you buy</v>
the projector, right?
<v ->Yeah. (laughs)</v>
<v ->Well, I wanna thank my guests here.</v>
It was a great conversation,
and I hope you all got something out of it.
And please dive into the rest of CES.
Get out there, explore, be curious,
and yeah, make it a great CES.
<v ->Thank you all.</v>
<v Sasha And Matt>Thank you.</v>
