- If you could take our seats,
we'll get going with the
third session for the day.
Again, for those of you that
are new, thank you for coming.
This is the third segment
of the Quantum Means
Business track at CES.
And this segment,
we're gonna talk about
devices and sensing.
The first segment, if you remember,
for those of you that we are in the room,
we talked about computers and computing.
The second segment was how
industry is gonna get engaged
as we build the ecosystem,
and this is going to be the bookend of it,
talk about a completely
different part of quantum,
which is the sensing side of it.
And with that, it gives
me great, great pleasure
to introduce a dear friend
and somebody who sits
on my sitting committee,
Celia Merzbacher who is the
Executive Director of QEDC,
which is the Quantum Economic
Development Consortium,
which is a group of quantum
and related companies
that are working together
to move the needle forward on industry.
Celia?
That was front and back.
- Thank you. Thank you
George, it's great to be here.
And nice to see all of you
and all of the interest in quantum at CES.
When George told me that this
session was being planned,
I said, "George, we
gotta do a good job here.
We don't wanna fall on our face at CES."
But obviously the word is out,
it's the International Year of Quantum.
And I'm really pleased to
be kicking off this part
of the program talking
about quantum sensing,
which as many of you may know,
and I think was sort of alluded to,
is some of the nearest term
use cases and applications.
In fact, there are quantum-based sensors
that are being made and sold today.
So I run the Quantum Economic
Development Consortium.
This is a consortium that
was created by Congress
here in the US who directed the government
to establish a consortium of stakeholders.
But we're really industry-driven
and our purpose is to enable
and grow the quantum ecosystem.
And notice the word
computing is not in our name,
it's not in our mission.
We are helping to advance
quantum technologies
for all use cases.
And our membership spans everything
from very fundamental component suppliers
up to the big system integrators
that you've heard of,
startup pure play companies
that are building everything
from quantum computers
and sensors and other technologies.
So check us out.
I'm not gonna talk about
QEDC anymore though today.
So let's see. Ah, yeah.
What I thought I would cover today
in my 10 minutes are
the following questions.
What is a quantum sensor?
I'm assuming that there
are some in the audience,
and I can't see very well
because of the lights,
who don't know a lot about quantum
and what a quantum sensor is.
What is it good for? What can it measure?
When will it be so good that
it beats what we have today?
There are a lot of sensors out there.
You can walk around the show floor here
and see tons of sensors.
So obviously a quantum-based sensor's
gotta be better than the
incumbent technology.
What is the current state of the art?
So how close are we
to when quantum sensors
will beat classical?
And where will consumers
start seeing quantum sensors
impacting their lives?
Which again, because we're at CES,
I thought, let's think about that.
Okay, let me just start,
I'll back up if I can figure out how.
Well never mind. What is a quantum sensor?
A quantum sensor, just like any sensor,
is some system that can,
through interaction with its environment,
have some kind of a change
that you can measure.
It's as simple as that.
And of course there are
many different kinds
of temperature sensors for instance,
you could say a stick of
butter is a temperature sensor,
gets too hot, it melts.
So there are a lot of
quantum systems out there,
and a sort of feature which
is problematic frankly
in the quantum computing space,
but it's help in the sensing space,
is that quantum states are very fragile
and very sensitive to the environment.
And that's why of course some
of the quantum computing systems have
to be kept at very low temperatures
because even just thermal
noise causes errors.
And so for this is the
definition of a good sensor.
And so there are, as I said,
many different kinds of quantum systems.
They need to be stable,
they need to be
initializable and measurable.
There are some criteria
for taking a quantum system
and making it into a sensor.
But there are many
different kinds of devices
that are at the heart of quantum sensors.
In terms of what can a sensor measure,
so if you asked a physicist
or somebody who sort of
is a quantum technologist
what a sensor can measure, they
might give a list like this,
it can measure chemicals,
is there a presence of some
particular chemical agent,
magnetic field,
they're very good at detecting
changes in magnetic field
or electromagnetic fields.
They can detect gravity
change very sensitively.
You can have a sensor
that can detect the change in gravity
just by moving it up one centimeter,
the sort of change in the attraction
with the earth can be
detected so precisely.
Temperature is something
that can be measured by quantum sensors,
location and velocity and time.
And those are all critical to positioning
and navigation type of applications.
So that brings me to sort of what someone
who is really in the
development of a sensor
for some purpose might say,
what can a quantum sensor measure?
Well, there are companies
that are making quantum
sensor-based technologies
for measuring methane leaks
in oil wells or gas wells.
They could also be used
for measuring breath,
doing breath analysis for instance.
So lots of different applications
might take advantage of
quantum measurements.
Magnetic field detection,
and we were gonna hear a
little bit more about that
from one of the speakers later,
could be used to measure brain signals
and make images of the brain.
Gravity can be used to
detect underground anomalies,
that might be a submarine
undersea or a tunnel underground.
And and you can see the
list here and position
and navigation are two areas
where quantum sensing is
potentially gonna be very useful
in being able to do
navigation without GPS,
and the government and military
are particularly interested in that.
So when will a quantum
sensor beat classical?
Well, it depends, as is often the answer.
It depends on what the requirements are.
Here's a picture of the
most precise atomic clock,
it's at NIST and it takes
up pretty much a room.
But a lot of times,
you don't really wanna put
something that big on a platform.
It's not very practical.
So the defense department ran a program
to create a chip scale atomic clock
and it was a successful program.
And this is a technology,
this is a product you can buy today,
so the largest market for
these chip scale atomic clocks
outside of government is
in oil and gas exploration,
which I don't think they anticipated
when they did the program.
So a lot of things depend on size, weight,
and power requirements,
but also of course cost.
And if you wanna put it on every car
or in every home, it's
gotta be more affordable.
And even these chip scale atomic clocks
are still relatively expensive.
There are, in some industries,
regulations that you're
gonna have to clear
for biomedical applications for instance.
Standards could be very important.
It's a little early still in some cases,
but there are organizations starting
to think about standards.
And then ultimately adoption,
and there sort of is a
chicken and egg problem.
For some of these technologies,
the market isn't as big as it could be,
and so suppliers don't always
wanna make the investments
to support the industry.
This is just a really quick example
and I'll go through it
quickly on brain imaging.
Right now, the state of the art involves
sitting in a big cryo cooled MRI machine
in a magnetically shielded room.
All that's very expensive.
There are about 200 in the whole world.
There are companies who
are building brain scanning
technology into these
wearable helmets that children
or people who are being studied
while they're doing something
and not just sitting still in a machine.
So this is opening up, this
is really enabling technology.
The company I work for, SRI International,
Stanford Research Institute,
partnered with Twinleaf, a
startup in Princeton University
to do a version of this that is standoff.
So you don't even have to wear a helmet.
This panel that's next
to the head can measure the brain imaging,
and that's, you can see,
still very researchy,
but is showing a lot of promise.
And this is just a
illustration of a gravimeter,
it's available now.
You can buy this and take
it out into the environment
and make measurements of gravity.
On the right hand side is sort of a map
of what you might detect.
And you have to of course
be able to map the signals
onto what it is you're looking at.
So there's work to be done.
So where will consumers,
I'm just wrapping up here.
I see I have about 40 seconds left.
Where will consumers first
see quantum technology
and quantum sensors impacting daily life?
Well, okay, I'm gonna take a sort of
tongue in cheek answer to this.
I think I've given you an idea
of some of the applications and use cases.
I don't think we know, frankly,
where quantum is going
to impact our daily life.
And when we come back to CES
in a year or five years and more,
it's gonna be very exciting to see
where quantum is being used.
But it's being used for marketing,
and if you go out and
look on the internet,
and I don't endorse any of these products,
but Quantum is being used to
obviously say this is something
that's new and has some interesting
characteristics perhaps.
On the bottom left is like
ant killer and paint thinner.
Top right, we have Quantum
vodka or something,
and then there are sort of
these health-related products.
So it will be very exciting to see
where quantum technology goes into things,
and I think there's a lot
of positive association.
I think that there's a lot of enthusiasm.
I don't see any roadblocks to progress.
And so I'm excited to be here
at CES for the first time,
and I hope to be back again soon,
and I'm around for the rest of the day.
So if any of you are
interested in learning more
about QEDC or about quantum sensors,
I'd be happy to talk to you.
So with that, I will
turn it over to George
who's gonna introduce the
moderator for the panel.
Thank you very much.
- Thank you, Celia.
It gives me great pleasure to introduce,
to reintroduce Philippe
to come back up here
to do a panel discussion
about sensing in the market
with two companies in the
quantum sensing space.
And the one thing I will
mention about Philippe
as he makes his way up
here is from what I know,
he's the first person
who's actually exited
or sold a quantum sensing
company in the world.
So Philippe, thank you
again. Please go for it.
- [Philippe] Wow, thank you very much.
- [George] Can you hear me or no?
Oh yeah.
Okay, now it actually works.
- Still no? Oh yeah.
Thank you for the introduction,
and very nice introduction
about quantum sensing.
I'm very happy that you
used like an example
of the product I've been
developing over the past decade,
that's the gravimeter which
was sitting on the top
of the volcano.
So we have the pleasure to have two CEOs
of quantum sensing companies.
And there are more companies
and many more business cases
that have been developed
over the past years
with quantum sensors.
We will spend the next 20 minutes
to discuss a little bit these applications
and maybe raise a few points
or address a few questions
that you raised in your introduction.
But maybe first, if you can
describe in a few words,
what is your company,
what is the quantum
sensor you're so proud of?
- Yeah, so thank you first of all
for this opportunity to
come and talk to you.
So our company is focused
on solving problems
in building electronic systems,
particularly as the
scaling of advanced silicon
is happening from nanometer
to angstrom level,
and more importantly also now
these advanced 3D packages.
And so really building the systems,
it's a large industry you're aware of
heading to trillion dollars,
and there are some very
complex unsolved problems
which offer a discontinuity in terms
of opportunity using quantum sensing.
So that's what we are focused on.
- Thank you, and Noel?
- Thank you, good morning, everyone.
So yeah, it's a pleasure to be here today.
Our company, Neuranics.
we are a relatively new company.
We're based in Scotland,
so we are looking at detecting
very small magnetic activity
of muscles in the body.
So we're very much using quantum sensing
to detect very low picotesla signals
from the muscles and activity in the body.
And what we're looking to do with that is
to develop real world solutions
that will go into human machine interface
where we'll able to detect full movement
of the hands and the fingers
and the hands and produce wrist bands
that will have human machine interface.
So we're looking at
real world applications
on how quantum technologies
can address everyday applications.
- Wow, thank you for this presentation.
So as a physicist, I'm
always thrilled to hear
what a quantum sensor can do,
but that's usually not the
best way to sell it actually.
And so we're here at the
Consumer Electronics Show.
So maybe my question is the product,
the quantum sensor you
have been developing,
very often we speak
about quantum advantage
for quantum computing, but
also for quantum sensing.
So what is the quantum
advantage of your product?
Why should we actually
choose your product,
or why did you choose actually
to develop this specific technology
or to use this specific technology
for this specific application?
- So I think it's a good question.
So really our focus at a
macro level is not necessarily
I would say quantum,
it's really what problem
we are trying to solve.
So our team is a group of physicists
who have been working on the
fundamental quantum solve state
spin sensors.
My background is all semiconductor,
so I think it was a good marriage.
I approached from what
problem we're trying to solve,
and really can we be the order
of magnitude differentiated
being a startup,
and it has to be a couple
of orders of magnitude.
And the problem we are
focused on is particularly
as you're building this,
the more than Moore's law in
terms of advanced packages,
it's very common today
if you look at most of the
companies like Nvidia and all,
their entire product line is a combination
of putting a bunch of silicon
inside this advanced packages
where you are both in
a 2.5D 3D configuration
building these complex systems.
The HBM memory stacks
started from four high
where you're putting these
DRAMs on top of each other,
it's almost like you're
folding the silicon
and going in the third dimension.
While that's a great solution
to continue the semiconductor revolution,
it has some fundamental
challenges to be able
to see magnetic fields between
these layers, so to speak,
the buried current flow.
Today, there is no sensing modality,
literally it does not exist,
which can look at that and
be used in the manufacturing
because as you all know,
this industry, 2024,
So that's what we focused on.
And the quantum sensing
in terms of being able
to use solid state spin sensors
and detect buried 3D
vector magnetic fields
is a very unique value proposition,
which there is no other
technology which can do today.
And that's the two we are trying to marry,
pick a killer problem and pick a solution.
And in both, that combination,
we are orders of magnitude
better than anything else.
So that's what we are focused on.
- Thank you.
- So yeah, our core
technology is based on TMR,
Tunneling Magnetic Resistance,
which is a quantum
effect where you're able
to detect very small picotesla
levels of magnetic activity.
And our company has spun out
from the University of Glasgow
and the University of
Edinburgh, a joint spin-out.
And we're really looking at
bringing quantum technology
into a semiconductor platform
so that it's addressable,
it's sellable, it's cheap,
it's accessible for everyday applications.
So we're bringing that to the
world of biomedical sensing.
If we look at the solutions
that are available currently
for looking deep inside
the muscles in the body,
you're looking at very expensive equipment
such as squid sensors
or OPM sensors that are tens of thousands
of dollars per resident.
We're trying to bring
this into a few dollar
semiconductor piece
that can be applied then
to consumer electronics
parts in the future.
So we're looking at addressing
how do we look at the activity of muscles
in a consumer electronics product
that gives you new
features and new benefits
and something that could be
tangible for people to use.
So we have a lot of PhD researchers
into quantum effects and how
to build quantum sensors.
I'm interested in how
to commercialize this,
how to bring this to the
real world applications,
looking at what solutions we
can deliver to the market.
And we feel that there
is a lot of emphasis
on new human machine interfaces
using electrical signals from the body.
But that causes a lot of problems
in that you need tight skin contact,
you need really tight
contact onto the skin
to receive those electrical signals.
Whereas if you had a magnetic signal,
you're able to stay
further away from the body,
you're able to monitor those signals,
you're able to get better
spatial resolution.
So quantum gives us a lot
of benefits in the market
that we're trying to address.
- Thank you.
So maybe before diving to another topic,
I would like to elaborate
a little bit on this
and also on this aspect that
Celia mentioned in her introduction
that there is an important step
or an important difficulty
for sensing in general,
which is the SWaP,
size, weight, and power,
and also the price.
And very often I also experienced that
that it's not yet a big market.
So sometimes you need
to do things on your own
because you don't have so
much of a like scalability.
So could you maybe give
us some of the difficulty
you had to overcome in
order to get to a product,
and then we'll maybe address
how this product can go to the market.
But I think it's important
to get the product first.
- And I think that way,
Noel and I kind of represent
a little bit two different spectrums.
So it's very interesting
probably to get that.
So in our case, really,
in terms of the solid state spin sensors
where there's a NV diamond,
which is CVD grown,
actually it's available today
and in a relatively very mature state,
and there are companies
like Element 6 and all
which can grow these diamond CVD insert
at layer in terms of these NV sensors
and they operate both
in extreme environments
and room temp.
And a sensor can cost,
let's say a couple of thousand dollars.
But the application we chose,
really that thousand dollar sensor,
which can be produced reliably
and can operate in extreme environments
is the value proposition.
So because our system we are building
will be in hundreds of
thousands of dollars
or potentially even higher.
So it was more, I think
for us, the quantum sensor
we are using, the fundamental NV sensor,
the manufacturing of that
and a reliable supply chain.
And now there are a number of companies
which are doing that across the globe
in terms of building this fundamental NV.
Today, a lot of users are in
the industrial application,
building some really advanced devices.
So for us, really the barrier of entry
is not necessarily the sensor itself,
it's really sensor is
a piece of the puzzle,
but putting the entire system
solution in terms of sensing,
in terms of imaging,
and then the most important
is to meet the performance
and throughput requirements of the problem
we are trying to solve.
So I think in our case, almost,
and I think both quantum
is a good and a bad thing,
a lot of times when you
talk to the VC investors
and all that, as soon
as you lose the quantum,
you see a little bit of a resistance
because they think the investment is,
let's say five plus years out.
But in our case, I think
we are more limited
by building the entire system stack.
The fundamental sensor, the
fundamental NV technology
is solid today.
So we are focused on the
higher layers of the problem,
the sensing, the imaging,
improving our imaging from ODMR
to let's say going more like Ramsay
and RABI imaging techniques and all.
So bringing all the levels of physics
and then being able to offer
the complete system solution.
So in our case, the
limiter is not the sensor,
the limiter is connecting a problem
and being able to solve and offer
a full system stack solution.
- So we're addressing it
with three technology blocks,
the sensor is obviously a
very important first step
along the way.
We need to get a sensor
that's able to detect
sub-picotesla levels of
sensitivity from the muscles,
that allows to give us the
resolution that we need
and the signal quality
that we need in order
to determine position of
fingers for example in the hand.
We then need to apply custom (indistinct)
to amplify those signals
to make them usable.
We then need to apply machine
learning to those signals
then to interpret those signals as well.
So we've got three
distinct technical blocks
that we need to address as a company,
but we see that we need to do all of that
to provide a solution.
And that the solution then could be closer
to the market requirements.
If we were just to provide
the sensor on its own,
it'll sit on the shelf
and nobody will use it.
But if we can provide a solution,
then people will then be interested
in experimenting with hat solution,
we'd provide a dev kit,
people can play with that,
and it brings the
solution closer to market
and allows people to address that
and to experiment with
the technology quickly.
- Thank you.
So I would like now to
exactly go towards the market
and towards the consumers, of course,
except maybe for the
butter that you mentioned,
those sensors that are not
directly acquired by consumers,
they're part of like more complex systems.
But overall I think we
also addressed it before,
we feel that there is still a lot of work
to be done in order
to penetrate the market
with a quantum sensor.
And I would like to have your
feedback, your experience.
And so how hard was it? What was needed?
Basically what is making
a customer pivot to use
and to engage into a
quantum sensor acquisition?
- Yeah, so again, what we are seeing is
the industry, like
semiconductor, batteries,
I think there was a lot of
discussion around batteries,
are looking for much
more higher sensitivity
and resolution than what can be today
with classical sensors.
So there is a fundamental need.
A good example is much like
semiconductor manufacturing,
battery manufacturing, batteries like,
I almost feel like what
semiconductor was in the '80s.
The hockey stick of the
batteries is ahead of us,
and fundamentally there'll
be all different kind
of chemistries and batteries everywhere.
And today if you look at
battery manufacturing,
they throw away 15, 20% of their yield
because putting these complex
battery cells together
and being able to manufacture this battery
is just very complex.
I gave an example of advanced packages.
There's a security application now
with all these global needs to be able
to securely track some of these things.
So there is a fundamental need
of these sensing capabilities
which are not available today.
And so that's how we are
looking instead of looking,
I have a, so to speak,
a widget or a hammer,
what problem can I try to solve,
we are coming from the other side,
really what is the biggest
problem to go solve?
Can quantum offer an order
of magnitude capability
compared to classical
sensors and marry the two?
To me, I think that is
the way to go versus,
hey, I have this great quantum sensor,
and then trying to convince
the industry or the investors
or the end consumers in terms
of really that it brings value to you.
And that's why we started
from industrial applications,
and then gradually work
because that market is a little bit more,
actually it is cost-insensitive
from a sensor point of view,
provided the entire system
solution meets the bill.
And then I think gradually scale
into high volume
applications, because for us,
the machines we will potentially build
will be basically in terms
of high dollar values,
the sensor is really very reliable.
And to us, I think that's a great way.
And we see consumer applications
like the fundamental modality
where we are offering value
is sensing magnetic fields,
which is a very fundamental modality.
And whether we're applying to muscles
or for security applications
or for manufacturing applications, to us,
the magnetic field,
especially vector magnetic fields buried,
offers immense potential.
- So the the core
technology that we're using,
TMR, Tunnel Magnetic Resistance,
is a quantum effect that
has been known and around
for 20 odd years.
Seagate has been using in hard disk drives
for a long time.
We are using different
properties within that TMR
so that we're using it effectively
as a variable resistor
depending on the magnetic
field that we're seeing.
So we don't go out every
day promoting the fact
that we are a quantum sensing company.
We go out every day promoting the fact
that we are a bio sensing company,
that we are detecting
signals from the body
that cannot be detected any other way.
The sensor that we are trying to produce
is probably a thousand
times more sensitive
than anything else that's on the market.
Today, there's loads of TMR sensors used
within automotive or in industrialization,
but they're in the nanotesla type range.
We're trying to get to single
digit picotesla type range.
So the fact that it is a quantum sensor
is a positive and sometimes a negative.
Our VCs are nervous when
we use the word quantum,
but they are positive when they see
that we are solving real world problems
and that we can address
these things quicker,
we can solve them quicker
by using the effects
of quantum within our solution.
So yeah, we need to address the speed
of which people can
monetize their investment
in quantum technologies.
- Yeah, so maybe to elaborate a bit more,
so in a certain way, yeah,
you really address the consumer market.
So you really offer a solution.
So is the label let's say quantum inside
or I don't know how is,
a label that is giving
confidence to a customer
that it is actually reaching a level
that nothing else can do?
Or do you still need to explain it,
or do we need to explain it more?
- So I think we see different reactions.
So the people with the money
don't like the word quantum.
The people who understand the technology
love the word quantum.
So I think we try to use the word quantum
depending on the audience.
So it's just the reality, right?
End of the day,
a good solution will always find a home,
but the trick is really focus on the home
and then finding the good
solution to get there.
So I think that's the
mindset we are taking
because if we start
with quantum first word,
we are always trying to defend,
and I'm just being honest,
and I think that's one of the things,
we are looking at it, it's a plus,
but provided you frame it
correctly from the audience.
- So I think it's really important
that collectively we
all educate the market
that quantum is there, it's a good thing,
it's real, it's active.
And I think sessions like this
where we're bringing quantum
to CES for the first time
and people are able to talk about it,
they're able to experience it,
they're able to go on to various stands
around the show and
actually see it in action,
I think is a real positive thing.
And I think collectively,
we have a lot more to do as an industry,
as a group to bring quantum
out of 20 years from now
to reality that is here,
is present, it's been used.
People are getting real world benefits
from it as of today.
And obviously we're in the
sensing side of things,
the computing side maybe
is a few years off,
but there is real benefits
from quantum technology as of today.
- Thank you.
So if I understand you well,
we have like a large assembly today,
so they are very courageous
people who were not afraid
to come to a quantum show.
So thank you very much
for this, and maybe,
and we still have left a few minutes,
well you raised the
point, I mean that yes,
we have to educate the market,
we have to educate the people.
We may have also to do
some kind of evangelization
or de-evangelization about quantum
that people think it is
something that it is not.
So what is for you the biggest challenge
that you as a company,
but also let's say as a global industry
in quantum are facing over this year,
the year of quantum or over the next year,
what is for you the most important thing
we need to focus as
government organization,
but also we need to focus as organization
of industry, consortia, and et cetera?
- So I think we being a startup obviously,
really while we have
great ideas are really,
so to speak, survival is
dependent on the money.
So we have to balance the two.
So I think the challenge
as Noel and I were talking
as a startup we face is while
we see a great opportunity
having investors' appetite,
because investors typically think in terms
about three year return,
three to five year.
And so the challenge I
think we face is educating
the investment community
and being able to differentiate
where they see return on
investment in a near term.
So I think that's a near
term challenge we see
because once we get past that
and we get to what value we bring,
we absolutely see a positive response.
But really to get that conversation
to believe that this is here
and this is now is really what I see.
We collectively have to
work, and as a common person,
when people use the word quantum,
they think leap of faith, right?
Quantum jump.
And you use that in the
day-to-day language.
But at the same time, I
think different technologies
between sensing or networking
or computing are evolving
at different speeds
and solving different problems.
I think sensing is real,
and I think we need to focus on the value
we are bringing and focus on that
and connect those dots
for the broad industry
and even adopters of this technology.
And what Noel is doing and what
we are trying to do and all,
I think we are trying to
push in that direction
and in general, like
QEDC and other forums,
even Quantum World Congress and even CES
to give us these opportunities
I think are the exact
kind of things we have to do
to really broaden the horizon.
And for I think companies like us,
we have to go past talking to delivering.
So I think it's a combination
of really we as an industry
have to start delivering killer products
where there's a need,
and then also in parallel
promoting the values.
But in my mind, without a doubt,
order of magnitude sensing
capabilities, we need it.
Whether it's geological,
whether it's security,
whether it's manufacturing,
whether it is human
medical needs and all that,
the market is there.
I think we have to just very focused,
maniacally move forward in that direction.
- [Noel] So yeah, just to add to that,
I agree very much on the VC point.
Our biggest challenge this year
is high scale manufacturing,
so scaling up manufacturing
of quantum sensors.
So we're using a stack which has got
and so that is based
on a silicon substrate,
but scaling that up into
high volume manufacturing
is challenging.
And so we need to have
ways of going to market
so we can build high volumes of products
at a very cheap price in order
so we can supply them into the
consumer electronics market,
which is very price conscious.
So they're looking to
buy chips for one to $2.
- Thank you very much.
So I'm looking forward
to see our market flooded
with quantum sensors.
Thank you very much.
I think your input was very
valuable, and also good luck.
I mean it's always that we
should say for a startup,
I mean it's always a race.
And I think I leave the floor
to the last word, and thank you.
- Thank you.
