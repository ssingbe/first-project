- Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Beyond the Bottom Line:
Driving Quality and Value in Healthcare."
My name is Jesse Ehrenfeld.
I'm a physician, I'm an informaticist,
anesthesiologist at practice
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
and I am the immediate past president
of the American Medical Association.
Round of applause, please.
It's mostly for my mother who's
gonna watch the recording.
Okay.
So we have a phenomenal group
of folks, experts here today
to have a great conversation
about how do we drive value,
and I'm gonna let them
introduce themselves.
We've got Jared Augenstein
who's the managing
director of Manatt Health,
Carolyn Jasik, former med
school classmate of mine,
Chief Medical Officer of Omada Health,
and Dr. Barbara Levy,
who is the chair of the
AMA CPT Editorial Panel.
Could you all just a few minutes
about who you are and what you do?
- Sure.
Thanks, Jesse. It's great to be here.
My name is Jared Augenstein.
I'm with Manatt Health.
We're a consulting policy and law firm,
and we work with technology
companies, physicians,
health systems, and others
on making technology work in healthcare.
- Hi, good afternoon.
I'm Carolyn Jasik.
I'm Chief Medical Officer at Omada Health.
We are a in-between care visit provider
of behavioral interventions
for chronic disease,
and I am a pediatrician by training
and very proud to be on the stage
with my former med school classmate.
Very fun.
- And hi, everyone, I'm Barbara Levy.
I am an obstetrician/gynecologist.
I've done women's health
for 40 years or more.
I'm vice chair of the CPT Editorial Panel
and we'll talk a little
bit about what CPT is,
but I've been involved
in policy for 25 years
and really interested in
the evolution of medicine
and how we deliver
quality at a lower cost.
- Well, thanks, guys.
There's been a lot of
progress on the journey
to delivering value-based care
and obviously an explosion
in the digital health space
over the last decade.
You know, where are we today
and why is it important
for us to be having this
conversation at CES?
- So I thought we would
morph into value-based care
about 15, 20 years ago
because it made so much sense.
And of course, here we
are 15 or 20 years later.
It's really challenging to change a system
that is so embedded,
and where we need to be
is a place where we've
defined value to whom and how.
And those are things that we
are trying to do at the panel
and trying to help with,
but it really takes a
village, if you will.
It takes everyone getting
on board to make a decision
that this is how we are now
going to pay for healthcare.
And I think that's a
challenge that we all face.
There's no question that technology
is essential to getting us to that place.
And why it didn't work 15 or 20 years ago
was because we didn't have
the tools to get there.
- Yeah, I will add, I agree
with all of that and say,
because of the conference that we're at
and the day that it is,
this is just really an inflection point,
I believe, for healthcare.
We now have the monitoring
tools, the home data collection,
the consumer awareness,
especially coming out of COVID,
of the importance of in-home care.
And one of the things that's
held value-based care back
for a while is even if we
know what the value is,
how do we measure it?
And are we measuring it in the same way
and are we using the same language?
And that's the beauty of technology
because we can have streamlined data,
streamlined data collection methods,
and we can have data
collection in the home,
which has been lacking.
And so, this is just
really an exciting time
to have that data available
and those devices available,
assuming their clinical grade
to support value-based care
in a way that we haven't
been able to to date.
- [Jesse] That's perfect, Jared?
- Yeah, I was just gonna say,
I mean, I think from, you
know, a technology perspective,
it's sort of like it's, you
know, it was the best of times,
it was the worst of times.
You know, I have yet to meet a technology
more just generally disliked by physicians
than the electronic health record.
And I've also yet to meet a technology
more universally loved
than an ambient scribe.
And so, you know, from a
technology development perspective,
you walk around the show floor here
and you see some of the
advancements being made.
It's really incredible.
We have amazing technology
today that, to Dr. Levy's point,
we didn't have 15 years ago, you know,
in order to deliver the
types of care models
that we wanna deliver.
But from a how you
integrate that technology
into workflow perspective, you know,
for most technologies, it's
sort of been a disaster.
- And obviously how we integrate
what's coming off of
consumer grade devices
into the ecosystem that
influences care decisions
and can influence that value equation
is a part of what we
wanna talk about today.
So by the way, number one
dissatisfier for almost a decade
for physicians, the
electronic health record
that has now been supplanted
by prior authorization,
it's number two.
So, Jared, the AMA and Manatt Health
recently published some research
about the role that
CPT code set is playing
in accelerating the adoption
of value-based care.
Can you tell us a little
bit about that research,
the findings and the
implications for the space?
- Yeah.
So, AMA was curious
about how CPT is utilized
in value-based care,
how does it support
value-based care delivery?
What are the ways in which
it might be improved?
And so we spoke with a
couple dozen experts,
including many of the folks in this room,
to try and get to the
bottom of the question.
And interestingly, what we heard is CPT
supports value-based care
along three dimensions.
First is that it supports
population health
and quality improvement by
helping to identify patients
who are eligible for clinical
interventions and also
by supporting payer quality
improvement initiatives.
Second thing is that it
supports cost management
by supporting cost benchmarking,
by supporting risk adjustment,
by enabling identification
of high-cost patient events
and high-cost patient cohorts,
and also by supporting
provider network management.
And third, it supports
the actual contracting
between providers and payers
around in a value-based way
by supporting patient attribution
into different value-based care models,
by supporting the
enablement of care bundles
that can be used to
support value-based care.
And finally, by actually
enabling the contracting process,
you know, the contracting itself
between payers and providers.
And I think if you add all that up,
what you realize is that, you know,
CPT is really the interoperability layer
for value-based care.
It didn't strike me that way
when I initially thought
about the question,
but that's really, you know,
what we learned from this research.
There were things that, you
know, we heard in the research,
areas of opportunity for improvement
in terms of thinking about
the way the CPT code set
needs to evolve,
given new models of care delivery,
new types of bundled payments,
new types of providers who
are coming into practice
and how that gets accounted for.
But it's hard to think
about making progress
against our value-based care objectives
without CPT as sort of the
underlying interoperability layer
for achieving that advancement.
- Okay, so you just said
that CPT has done a whole bunch of things,
but there are folks in this room
who probably really
don't know what CPT is,
and there's nobody on this stage.
There's probably, in
fact, nobody in the world
who understands CPT better than Dr. Levy.
So, can you just give a
thumbnail sketch of what CPT is
and how it's doing the things
that Jared just described?
Because it sounds like
a great guideline to me,
but it turns out it's a code set.
- It's a language.
So it's the way that we
describe what we do in medicine.
And CPT Panel is a group of physicians
and practicing clinicians
who do those procedures.
So the concept is, yes, it's a code set,
but to create a code,
we need to use a common language,
and we all need to agree
when we talk about the
interoperability, that when I say
somebody has a high-level
emergency kind of situation,
that we're all speaking the same language,
and what things are included or excluded
in a particular event are
things that we describe
in the code set.
So think of it as the unifying language,
of a way to communicate
what's happening with a patient
or a family or an encounter.
- So let me stay with you and
then I'll come to Carolyn.
So, we've got a lot of tech
companies in this room.
What are misconceptions
that a company might have
about the code set, the language
as they're doing development
and trying to enter into a space
where they can bring these
digital tools forward
to support value-based care?
- Yeah, so I think one
of the misconceptions
is that we're some group of people
that are esoteric and
academic and, you know,
don't live in the real world.
We're practicing doctors
and we do practice in the real world
and we're aware and
excited by new technology.
That said, there are certain
rules that we have to follow,
just like the grammar in a language,
that a procedure or for a new code,
it has to describe something that's unique
that hasn't been described before,
that isn't a fragmentation
of something that's already been there
and that it has to have
the data to support it.
So at the panel, this group of physicians
who are really volunteers doing this
in support of the public,
we are saying, "Show me the data.
Show me that this
intervention, whatever it is,
actually does what it
says it's going to do,
and impacts patient
care in the right way."
And so, it takes time to accumulate data,
and you do have to have
published literature
to get a Category I code.
All of those things
though are very important
in many ways to protect the public.
And they're not intended to be barriers,
they're intended to be benchmarks really
for how we include the
rules in the code set.
- Over cocktails,
someday I'm gonna ask you
what your favorite code is,
but could you give an
example of like a new code
that, you know, they might
see as a new technology or-
- Sure.
So, you know, we were
really light on our feet
during the COVID crisis.
We created new codes, it
felt like every two weeks,
but for the testing, so
COVID tests needed codes
to describe them for each
individual immunization
and the administration of the immunization
because all of that was happening
in a public health arena,
but we had to keep track of it
and we had to keep track
of which immunization
was being given to whom,
whether it was the first one,
the second one, the third one.
So we created codes for that.
But also over the past 10 years,
we've created episodes of care codes
that are really designed
around value-based care,
so chronic care management.
Over a 30-day period,
how much time is your
clinical staff spending
coordinating the care
for a complex patient?
Or principal care management
for an individual,
let's say a cancer patient who
really needs care navigation?
How do we pay?
How do we account for the
services that are being provided?
So we've created codes that
capture some of the newer things
that are happening in value-based care.
- All right, so Dr. Jasik,
Carolyn, my colleague,
Omada, your company,
virtual first company
doing evidence-based work
to advance chronic disease management
by providing supplemental
support for patients.
Can you describe a little
bit about how Omada works
and how you're using digital tools
to support value-based care?
- Sure.
Well, I know what my favorite CPT code is,
and that would be Omada CPT code
that we were the first
digital health company
to, I believe, apply for and receive
a digital health delivered CPT
code with the AMA committee.
And I think the story behind that
really is a lot about value-based care.
So when I first started at Omada,
what we noticed about
the CPT coding system
that's really special,
and I think you started to allude to that,
is it is essentially a
badge of certification
that the care that is
covered by that CPT code
is evidence-based and is effective.
And so, we quickly realized
that were there a CPT code
that we could bill under,
it would essentially tell our customers
that we were a medical provider
of care that was worthwhile,
that was worthy of payment.
What a lot of people in my
company thought and didn't know
and I knew at the time is a CPT code
does not come with payment.
You have to talk to the payer about that.
But the way that we used our CPT code
and what was unique
about it, it's not ours,
it's part of the catalog,
is we asked the question of
what would a CPT code look like
if it was adjudicated based on outcomes,
not based on time and not
based on medical complexity.
And this was really unique at the time
because we were in the
field of weight loss.
And so we were asking the question,
because we are virtual care
and we don't have episodic
visits that we could cover,
could we have a code
that instead reflected
the value that we were delivering
for the people sponsoring our care?
So if the point of the
behavioral counseling
and lifestyle medicine was to lose weight,
why wouldn't the CPT code be linked
to the amount of weight
loss that was lost?
And that was the code
that we worked on using the DPP Program.
And it's pretty much what
we've been billing under since,
and it's what a lot of the
groups in our industry use
and what was very special
about that process
is we drop the code once a month
based on a little bit of
the service that we provide,
but then we have a modifier on top
for the amount of weight loss
that our member has lost.
And our customers really like that
because we use our remote device
to support the data so they
can feel good about that
and they know that
they're paying for value,
not just services without the value.
- Okay, so Jared, we've
talked about wanting to move
from a fee-for-service environment
to a value-based care environment,
and it's like a road filled
with potholes and barriers
and left turns that go nowhere.
Can you give a quick overview
from your perspectives?
I know Manatt Health
does a lot in this space.
Why is it so difficult
to make this transition
from fee-for-service to value-based care?
- Yeah.
Well, so just some basic facts.
So if you look at the
percentage of healthcare
that's paid for on a
fee-for-service chassis,
it's still 90% of care today.
- [Jesse] 90%.
- 90%.
So 10% is paid on sort of
a population health payment-based model.
90% is paid for on a
fee-for-service chassis.
That includes, you know,
pay-for-performance
and other sorts of sort
of low-risk population,
a value-based payment.
That's the macro national number.
There's a lot of variability by payer.
So in Medicare Advantage,
25% of payments are population based.
In Medicaid, 6% of payments
are population based.
And in the commercial market,
only 4% of payments are population based.
So that's sort of the
macro payer level view.
Now imagine you're a physician
and you're trying to deliver
a virtual diabetes model
or you're trying to deliver OB care,
and you're trying to deliver care
in a way that is value-based,
and you're trying to get
paid for delivering that care
because you need to get paid
in order to deliver services.
You're dealing with the
traditional Medicare way
of paying for services.
You're dealing with the
way that Aetna has set up
their value-based payment model.
You're dealing with the way
that your local Blues plan
has set up their
value-based payment model.
You're dealing with your
state Medicaid agency
and probably five different
Medicaid managed care plans
depending on the state you're in.
And so, you know, it's
easy to go a little nuts
trying to figure out how to, you know,
which models you're in,
which quality measures
you're being subjected to reporting on,
and how you deliver care
in a way that's consistent
for all patients, but
also allows you to hit
your value-based payment benchmarks.
And I think that that fragmentation
and the lack of alignment across payers
in terms of how these
programs are constructed
is sort of, you know, a real inhibitor
that's getting in the
way of making progress.
- So, alright, those are
some of the barriers.
What are the some of the things
that are accelerating the
movement in the places
that value-based care is being adopted?
Obviously there are digital tools,
there are new models that are
showing benefit and promise
in real outcomes for patients
that Omada has obviously
been a pioneer in.
And then there's obviously
the whole conversation
about, well what do things
like our infrastructure layers
like CPT do when we move
from a fee-for-service
to a value-based care environment?
Anybody wanna start?
- So, there is a little
known healthcare innovator.
I think it's the biggest
innovator in healthcare
that we don't talk about,
and that is the benefits
leader at an employer.
And those benefits leaders,
I would say you were saying
what's the biggest driver
to value-based care?
I would say it's the fatigue
of the U.S. employer.
The fatigue of the US employer
for spending all this money on healthcare
and not getting value out of it.
We've saddled the U.S. employer
with our healthcare spend
for the most part, other
than our government spend,
which is the taxpayers.
And they're tired.
They're tired of spending all this money
and not getting value.
And so, what I have found
is the most innovative
and open minds in healthcare
to look at alternative
reimbursement models,
alternative care models,
payment models are the benefits buyers
that are adjudicating the benefits
on behalf of the employer.
And they are also the,
especially if they're a large employer,
the primary constituent
for the U.S. health insurance
company industry and PBMs.
So they're a very loud voice,
a very influential voice
and very creative and open
to new ideas and new models
due to this fatigue of
having to spend more.
And I think this year in particular
with the GLP medication coming on
and being faced with this
just gut wrenching decision
of here's a great medication
that is pretty much
unaffordable at a large scale,
how do we afford it
and how do we make it work
and get the value out of it?
So lots of interesting
ideas around innovation,
open-mindedness about the type
of care that can be provided,
how it can be billed
for, what kind of value.
Yeah.
- [Jesse] Barbara.
- Yeah, I think there's a
challenge with the structure
that we have right now.
So we have big health systems,
we have consolidation,
and they still make most of their money
in a fee-for-service world.
And so doing more creates more revenue.
And until we fix that, I
think we're challenged.
So the employer can drive some of that,
but unless they're a major
employer in a geography,
they're not going to help
me and my private practice
be able to have the systems in place
that I need to have to do
really good value-based care.
So I think for telemedicine,
for virtual care,
for the kinds of things
that Omada is doing,
that's fabulous.
For some of the things that I need to do
in a women's health space,
it doesn't work, right?
It still drives surgery,
it still drives...
And our population expects
more prescriptions,
more tests and more intervention
rather than sitting back and
looking at the whole picture
and changing lifestyle
and all of those things.
So I think there has to be a sea change
in the way we look at health
and preserving health as
opposed to sick medicine.
And I think that's a
challenge for all of us,
but it's happening, and
that's really exciting.
Omada is a great example
of how it's happening.
- I think it's also, you know, helpful
to sort of give credit
where credit is due.
You know, thanks to the
work of Dr. Levy and others,
the CPT Editorial Panel has been creating
codes that have allowed
providers to start practicing
delivering care in a
population health model.
And so, if you go back to 2013,
chronic care management
and transitional care management
codes were introduced.
and remote physiologic monitoring.
And if you look at the
utilization of all of those codes,
they're increasing significantly
over the past few years.
And what that's done is enabled,
you know, there's companies like Omada
which, you know, have our
virtual first types of models.
They've always been sort of
delivering care in that way.
But what these sets of
CPT codes have enabled
sort of, you know, any
provider to do, if you will,
is to begin to provide
care management services,
is to begin to provide
care navigation services,
to begin to remotely monitor patients.
Those are sort of like the
foundations of delivering care
in a population health-based model.
So physicians, health
systems, provider groups
are getting much more comfortable
delivering care in that model
because there's a way for them to be paid
for delivering that service.
I'm hopeful that because there's been
such significant uptake of those code sets
and because providers are
becoming more comfortable
providing care in that
way, it'll sort of grease
the wheels a little bit of
shifting the payment model
to a value-based payment model.
- Yeah, and you emphasized
an important point
that Dr. Levy made, which is,
sometimes value-based care
is actually about doing less.
And that's a point that
I think we often lose
in the conversation, but when
you are getting reimbursed
for doing less for the patient,
doing the chronic disease management
and all of the wraparound services,
obviously the patients can really win.
So, you know, as we talk about, you know,
where healthcare is going,
obviously we want to continue
to try to reduce costs,
provide more value.
There's been a lot of evolution,
and certainly we've learned
a lot, and digital tools
have been an important
component of the journey.
What else needs to be modernized
on the infrastructure
layer, on the tool side,
on the payment side around
how we align incentives?
And Barbara is just champing
at the bit. (laughs)
- Yeah, so I've really been
thinking about this a lot.
And one of the issues is that
we have to stop being reactive
to our patients coming
to us with a complaint
and be proactive in terms of following.
So if patient comes to me
and she's got heavy bleeding, let's say,
and we have an interaction and
we decide on a plan of care.
In a classic fee-for-service model,
I would write a prescription
or we would come up with a plan
and she would go out and I
would wait until she complained
if it wasn't working.
Well, in a value-based care model,
you wanna use tech and AI and other tools
to be able to say after her
next period, "Did it work?
Were you able to pick up your prescription
or was there a barrier there?"
So becoming proactive and using tools
to enable us to be much more
interactive with patients,
but also to know whether what
we've done is working or not,
I think is a huge benefit
for tech to help us do
and help us become proactive
instead of reactive.
- I think I have my wishlist,
which probably most innovators
in digital health have.
The first, I would say,
continue the good work with the CPT codes.
I think that we all
appreciate that and need it.
I think the second thing that we need
is reform around licensure.
If we wanna do value-based care,
we need to follow our patients.
All of us have traveled here, right?
Someone in this room has
had a medical concern
while you've been at this conference.
Can you see your home
provider in Las Vegas
if you're from the U.S.?
You cannot because that person
is not licensed in Nevada,
and so they can't do a
telehealth visit with you.
So improving our licensure and
board certification process
to make it easier for
multi-state licensure
or even national licensure, I
think would be a big, big win.
And then the third thing,
which I would say to
many of you who are here
who are innovators in devices is pursuing,
it's easier to develop a device
and go the wellness route.
It's easier, you'll get your
device out in the market,
you'll get traction, you'll
get consumer dollars coming in.
Please take the time and work
to go through the FDA process
and produce a clinical grade device
because that's how we're
going to have value-based care
because the payer, the
government that benefits buyer,
they're not gonna
reimburse for your device
unless it has gone
through a vetting process
to prove that it's delivering
outcomes that can be trusted,
especially if they're
gonna link payment to it.
So having access to your innovation
on the clinical grade side,
we are dreaming over lunch
of the future of blood pressure monitoring
possibly not being cuffs.
We do need that innovation,
but I think our regulatory process
kind of scares people a little bit.
So that's my wishlist.
- I do wanna give a quick shout out.
You know, CTA has been very
involved in advancing standards
for a lot of the consumer-facing
digital health products.
And that's a space that
we'll continue to need to do
a lot of work on to make
sure that the things
actually do work for all
patients and all consumers.
Jared?
- Yeah, I mean, you know, I'll just share
from my most recent healthcare experience.
So I tore my meniscus two years ago.
Carolyn asked in the prep if
it was doing something exciting
like skiing.
Unfortunately, it was like picking up
my two-year-old at the time.
But I needed surgery and then I needed PT.
And I asked my surgeon if
I could do my PT virtually.
And they said, "Well, you sort of can,
but we don't think it's
as good as in-person PT,"
which evidence shows it's
just as good as in-person PT.
So I went and did in-person PT.
And then three months later,
I got a letter from Aetna saying,
"We notice you have a health,"
that's when the claim hit for the surgery.
"We noticed you have a healthcare issue
that you need PT for.
Would you like to enroll
in our partner's virtual PT program?"
And I'm like, "Well, it
would've been really nice
if I had had this letter,
you know, three months ago."
And, you know, my ideal
model being a working parent
would've been to have some
in-person PT in the beginning
when they could've done
the physical manipulation of my knee
and then to sort of transition
to virtual PT over time,
with AI to make sure I was
doing the exercises properly,
with text messaging
to make sure that I'm
actually doing the exercises,
checking in if there's
anything that I need.
So the care model for me
is not like complicated to envision,
but putting it all together in a way
where that's offered to
me at the time of service,
we're totally not there yet.
And then I think the other
thing is we're gonna need
the CPT code set to continue to evolve
to keep up with those
types of care models,
which I know Dr. Levy and
others are working on,
you know, but I think
that's sort of the next step
of making sure there's a
way of describing that care
and getting paid for care
in a way that is, you know,
what the way that I wanna receive it,
you know, in a
patient-centric kind of way.
- So, Dr. Jasik, you know,
there's been a lot of concern
about consolidation in healthcare,
but we still have a lot of fragmentation
in terms of where patients are receiving
various components of the
things that they need.
You know, what Jared just described,
you know, you can imagine how
if he didn't have a usual source of care
and had these services,
that it could be spread
across lots of places.
And how on earth do you create a system
that gives him the
nudge or the opportunity
to be enrolled
in a truly digitally-enabled
value-based care paradigm?
You know, how is Omada
thinking about that?
And what could that future look like,
given that, you know,
he may be more likely
to respond to a nudge
from a trusted clinician
rather than his third-party payer?
- Well, there are a couple things
preventing you from getting that nudge.
So the first is, I'll say it's wonder
we haven't said this word
this long into this session.
Interoperability of
data is not at the point
where it needs to be, such that
you could receive that nudge
from your payer, would
be the most likely place.
And that really needs
to be in place for us
to be able to get to a point
where those nudges will happen.
But I think the other
thing that's going to
make us not have fragmentation
is just honestly a commitment.
So the problem right now
is the way that VC funding is
for most of the digital health companies
is there's a strong push
to come out with one thing
in a niche area, show
traction and generate revenue.
So what you end up having
is 20 different companies
all doing 20 different types of care
and you have almost
like a virtual pill mill
where someone's going
here to get their GLP
and here to get their hair loss medication
and here to get their birth control.
And now they've got
three different providers
and oh no, they're in
the emergency room now
with a medical complaint and
there's no interoperability,
no one knows what medications they're on,
and it's up to the patient
to be able to manage
and be aware of all that care.
And that's, at least in the U.S.,
what our capitalistic
funding, you know, structure
is pushing us toward.
So it's gonna take us as
a collective community
to say no and to commit.
And this is part of what
Omada has tried to do
by partnering with the AMA,
is embracing the complexity
of asking could we do this
and not fragment the care?
And it takes a lot of
creativity and diligence.
We are a huge supporter
of the medical home,
and whenever we think about
our care, we think about, okay,
what would a care handoff look like?
If we have a member who, for example,
has a concerning diabetes number,
how can we reach that provider?
In an ideal world, we
would have interoperability
and I could exchange that data.
It's not the world we live in.
So in my world, we send
an eFax to that provider
and let them know, you know,
or we call them actually
and let them know, you
know, the sugar is high,
but we've made that commitment
because that's the right thing to do
to not have fragmented care.
And so, that's what I
think is needed, yeah.
- And I will say in the hat that I wear
as a chief medical officer
for a virtual women's health company,
we are using the principal
care management code
to do care coordination care navigation
and be that medical home.
So it takes effort, to your point exactly,
to reduce that fragmentation,
to be sure that someone is
gathering all of the information
from all of the specialists and the care,
putting it into a single place
and then designing a chart,
frankly, that has the problem
list that's up to date
that keeps the med list up to date.
That costs money to do.
It costs human beings right
now to do a lot of it.
But we are getting traction
in a value-based care world
to say to payers and to employers,
this is a really valuable service,
that that fragmentation
if I know that an employer
has those services available,
Jared, if your employer
had had the virtual services
available or your payer,
then a medical home that
was coordinating your care,
not so much the surgeon who
was part of a health system
that was trying to drive
services to their own system,
but your employer, your payer or someone
who was gathering all of that information.
I think that interoperability
is absolutely critical
and it's really bringing value to patients
because they don't end
up stuck in the middle.
They don't end up explaining
to the psychiatrist
what the OB/GYN said about
their menopause care.
- So, you know, if
interoperability is like,
you know, a full on marathon,
I don't even know what
mile marker we're at,
but we're early in the race
and there are things at the policy level,
and I don't know if any of our
federal colleagues are here
that have tried to move
that needle forward
and have been important and helpful,
but what is CPT doing and what's its role
in supporting interoperability?
'Cause it's not just about
using HL7 as a framework
to shift data bits around.
Obviously there's an implication
on the coding infrastructure.
- No, it's really about creating codes
that describe that work, that
work of care coordination,
care navigation, of bringing
all of that together.
And we do have a work group
that's working on
value-based care right now
that's trying to say where
are the gaps in the CPT code?
Where can we fill those
gaps so that practices
can create a medical
home kind of environment?
You know, CMS tried that, what was it?
it sort of kind of worked
and generally didn't
in terms of reducing
cost and improving value,
but given the tools that
we have now, it can work.
And so we are working to create the codes
that will allow practices and
allow health systems as well
to be able to capture
the work that's being
done and get paid for it.
- Alright, so let me
ask one final question,
then I'll give everybody
a minute to wrap up.
So, you know, there's a lot
of stuff here at this meeting,
exciting new technology
and the number one question
that physicians want to know
when they are looking at a new
technology is, does it work?
And that's a hard question,
and it's a hard question for consumers
and consumer-facing technology.
So how should we be thinking
about the generation of evidence,
the level of evidence?
You know, Dr. Jasik, you made a comment
about going through the
FDA clearance process
for consumer-facing products,
but it's a complicated space
and it's not always clear
what level of evidence we should require
for an algorithm or a tool.
How should we advise companies
that are trying to enter the marketplace,
whether it's on the
professional-facing side
or on the consumer-facing side
to be thinking about
this important question?
- Thank you for this question.
At Omada, we have an internal phrase
called we start with science
and we insist on outcomes.
And the outcomes that we talk
about is we're very committed
to publishing the peer-reviewed
journal mechanism.
And I would say that healthcare,
at least in the United States,
I know this is an international audience,
but really across the world,
we have amazing structures
to adjudicate evidence.
We have the CPT Coding Committee
to review our evidence to give us codes.
We have the FDA to review evidence
to reassure us that our
devices are are safe and good.
We have professional bodies like the AMA
and professional societies
that review evidence
to write clinical practice guidelines.
We have the U.S. Preventive
Services Task Force.
I was reading one of
their guidelines today,
reviewing preventive healthcare evidence
and making recommendations there.
So I would say digital health
should not reinvent the wheel.
We don't need another place or environment
to review the evidence, but
we do need to participate
and get to know and embrace
those structures that do exist
and do the proper studies,
submit them to the proper organizations,
publish your work, hire a
scientist or part of a scientist
to help you evaluate your technology,
partner with the AMA,
if they're interested,
on whatever your technology is
because they will help you,
and start with science
and make sure you're building
something that is worthwhile.
And so get to know the
healthcare community.
We're messy.
The evidence review is slow sometimes.
The regulatory process is slow,
but it does work and it
protects our consumer.
And I think it's up to all
of us to participate in that.
I think tech people
often are kind of like,
"Oh, I'm here to disrupt.
I'm not gonna participate in
that institutional structure."
I think that holds a lot of companies back
and a lot of technology back.
You should need to get to know the system
and work within it.
- [Jesse] Jared's nodding.
- Yeah, no, I really agree.
I mean, I think it's been
a real problem though.
I mean, I think if you
look back at the history
of digital health back to the early 2000s,
you know, for every a hundred companies
that got seed stage funding,
you know, maybe one or two or three
has generated a
high-quality clinical study
in a high-quality peer-reviewed journal.
And it's just, you know, it
was never really acceptable
and it's shaking out in the market
in terms of who's doing
well and who's not.
And I think any company
that's raising money now
or getting off the ground,
that's just gonna be the expectation,
is that you do a really
high-quality study,
publish in a peer-reviewed journal
and you have evidence of clinical impact
and you have evidence
that it can save money
and that it's worth buying.
And so I think that's
gonna be the standard
and I'll add that I think one of the ways
in which you can generate that evidence
is through using real world evidence,
which almost always relies on CPT codes.
And so, there is an infrastructure
through which you can measure
whether your service or product
is delivering the clinical
outcome that you want.
- I have to say again about the CPT code,
this is how we found
Omada's cost, the footprint
of finding our CPT code
billing and our provider code.
That's how I've done
all of my claim studies,
is we have that digital footprint.
- All right, I think,
Barbara, it's the final word
'cause we're running out of time.
- Okay.
- The clock is about to go
flashing and expire.
- No, I would just, you know,
echo what everyone else has said,
that the data is really
important, the science,
the studies are very important.
You have to be addressing a
problem that's really a problem
and you have to think about who benefits.
So is this benefiting a
payer by reducing cost
or an employer by reducing cost?
Is this benefiting a patient,
but a payer isn't gonna pay for it?
So there are a lot of questions
in designing your studies
to be able to answer those questions.
- Amazing.
Alright, Jared, Carolyn, Barbara,
everybody stand up in the
audience please for me.
Come on, come on. There you go.
Standing ovation, look
at that, in Vegas, guys.
Really appreciate you being here
and thank you all for
coming to our session.
That's a wrap.
