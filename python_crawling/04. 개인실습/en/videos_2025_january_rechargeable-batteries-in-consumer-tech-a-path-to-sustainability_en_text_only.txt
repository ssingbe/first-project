<v ->Okay, let's go ahead and get started.</v>
It's nine o'clock.
Good morning, everybody.
I know this is early.
For many of us, this is the first session of the day.
Welcome to this panel session.
We're gonna have, I think, a good conversation.
We have an excellent panel here.
My name's Walter Alcorn.
I am CTA's vice president of environmental affairs
and industry sustainability.
We're gonna be talking today about batteries,
embedded batteries in particular,
both current situations,
some of the issues that we're seeing,
and talking about some near-term solutions,
and then some longer term solutions.
So what I'd like to do is introduce the panelists,
actually have them introduce themselves.
If there's time, just so everybody's ready,
at the end, we will take an audience question or two,
so be thinking about that.
But let's just dive right into it.
So our first panelist, Judy Jeevarajan.
Judy, please introduce yourself and welcome.
<v ->Thank you, Walter.</v>
I am Judy Jeevarajan.
I lead the Electrochemical Safety Research Institute
at UL Research Institutes as the VP and executive director.
My experience with batteries goes back about 30 years,
almost at the beginning of lithium ion,
but I've also worked with many different chemistries
or batteries with a big focus on safety.
And in the past two years, we've also been looking
at new materials and novel energy forms in our institute.
<v ->Great, Giovanni Fili, please introduce yourself.</v>
Thank you for being here.
<v ->Thank you for inviting me.</v>
It's a pleasure.
CES is always fantastic experience.
So I'm Giovanni.
I'm the CEO and founder of a Swedish company called Exeger.
We have developed a new solar cell,
which work under indoor and outdoor conditions.
I'll tell you more about that later.
And we work very closely with the battery companies.
As we see, there's a need in the future
for a lot of good, safe, stable batteries,
especially together with our flexible source,
which I will talk about later.
<v ->Great, I love it you have a prop.</v>
That's makes the panel.
Andrea Murphy from Panasonic, please.
<v ->Yeah, thank you, Walter, and good morning everyone.</v>
As Walter said, my name is Andrea Murphy,
and I am the Director
of Environmental Affairs for Panasonic.
My team covers a wide range of topics
with environmental compliance and sustainability.
So for environmental compliance,
we deal with things like end of life of our products,
which we'll talk about here,
removing hazardous chemicals from our products.
So that fits into battery sustainability,
'cause we want the batteries to have
less hazardous chemicals and be easier to recycle.
Topics such as packaging.
And then on the sustainability front,
in addition to anything that's regulated,
we work on a variety of programs and projects
to increase the sustainability
of our products that we make in our factories.
And I cover that.
My team covers that for all of North America.
So that includes the federal and state regulations
and the provincial regulations in Canada.
For those of you who don't know,
Panasonic is over 100-year-old company.
We are an electronics manufacturer.
We have a rich history of making batteries.
We manufacture all kinds of batteries,
from primary batteries, rechargeable batteries,
small batteries that would fit in your watch
to the large solar batteries, the charging batteries.
So when you have a solar power system
attached to your house, you can collect the solar
and use it after the sun goes down.
And then we're also an electronics manufacturer.
We manufacture a large range of products
from the entertainment industry
that have batteries like your earbuds,
your headphones to personal care products.
So when you think about everything
that you use in your house, or even you have on you here,
it probably has a battery in it.
<v Walter>Awesome, and great keynote yesterday.</v>
<v ->Thank you, yeah, so proud.</v>
If you haven't seen it,
we are the sustainability superheroes,
so please take a look and watch it.
<v ->Wonderful.</v>
Leo, take it away.
<v ->Thanks, Walter.</v>
I'm Leo Raudys.
I'm the CEO of Call2Recycle.
We're a 30-year-old nonprofit that is the largest collector
of batteries for recycling in the United States.
We were actually founded
because of a great idea that Panasonic had back in the day
to actually create an organization like us.
We've been around for quite some time.
Panasonic continues to sit on our board.
We collect batteries at about 11,000
public-facing collection sites,
places like municipalities, Home Depot,
Lowe's, Staples, Best Buy, et cetera.
And about 20,000 other smaller sites
across the United States.
The way I explain us to my mother
is if you're recycling a battery
somewhere in the United States, it's probably us.
So we're intensely interested in this topic
because it's very, very important for us
to be able to move all these batteries safely
to a recycler or a repurposer.
And innovation's pretty key to that.
So thanks, Walter.
<v ->All right, wonderful.</v>
Well, let's do this.
Let's set the stage.
What are the issues with rechargeable batteries,
particularly rechargeable battery fires,
which I know there's been some discussion.
So Judy, you wanna start?
<v ->Sure, so I mean, I've been working</v>
with lithium ion since its inception,
and we are really concerned about its safety.
It's because it's very unpredictable, the safety,
and it going into a thermal runaway,
what we call a thermal runaway,
which is a really high temperature,
or accompanied by smoke and fire can be unpredictable.
And that's because if you don't use it correctly,
manufacture it correctly, charge it correctly,
as well as if you don't recycle it correctly
or dispose of it correctly,
you are going to have a fire in the end.
And what's associated with it is high temperatures.
The fire can propagate very quickly.
We can have toxic gases that come out of it.
Particulate emissions are actually toxic.
And so it is really concerning
that if people are not doing things correctly,
that you can have an unexpected fire
and a lot of high temperatures.
<v Walter>Yeah, the term thermal event</v>
is such a interesting word
that gets used in the public space.
Anyone wanna add anything to that, Leo?
<v ->Yeah, I mean, it's a huge issue,</v>
and I don't think people really appreciate
just how big of an issue it's become.
So if you think about us,
we collect last year about nine million pounds of batteries.
Previous year was eight million pounds.
So recycling has gone quite a bit.
But we still only capture a fraction
of what actually moves through the system.
So anytime a battery ends up in a waste facility,
it's at risk of actually being damaged and catching fire.
There are a lot of fires of waste facilities
and recycling facilities.
You talk to the folks that run these facilities,
they have a fire about a day.
They're not sure if they're all batteries,
but in terms of major fires, according to Fire Rover,
which is an organization that does fire safety work,
they've seen over 453, I think, major fires
at waste and recycling facilities last year.
So it's a very, very big issue.
Our concern is that anytime
you have the risk of fire going up,
it puts the entire recycling ecosystem at risk.
And when that happens,
it's less likely people are going to recycle.
It's less likely we're gonna be able
to get these materials back into commerce.
These are very critical materials.
So anything we can do to get those fires down
is vitally important, especially because recycling
is just becoming a bigger, bigger thing.
<v ->Okay, thank you.</v>
So let's talk a little bit about near-term solutions.
What can be done to reduce fires
or maybe the severity of the fires?
What are some of the things that,
Judy, go ahead and start again.
<v ->So one of the things that I would recommend</v>
is making sure that consumers,
and there are different factors for different sectors.
So when you look at consumers, it's always better
to buy batteries that are certified,
certified by a good certifying organization,
follow standards.
So it should be done.
And then also buy the relevant chargers.
Don't buy universal chargers.
Use the batteries with the relevant chargers.
And also, don't try to replace your batteries on your own.
You'll notice that several top tier
device manufacturers today
make it difficult for you to replace batteries.
So just send it back to them
and have them replace it for you
if you want it done that way.
When we go to manufacturer's side,
we should always look for certified cells
that go into certified batteries
and then so the battery manufacturer should go
and look for good manufacturers of cells
that are actually certified.
And again, the whole cycle of making sure
everything is certified to the end product
should be completed.
And then lastly, also with respect to what Eric,
Leo was talking about, sorry,
we have to make sure that you recycle
your batteries in the right manner,
and there are call to recycle as an excellent site
where you can look for sites or locations in your area
where you can take back batteries and recycle them safely.
So it's always good to follow what needs to be followed
so you can reduce the risk that is associated
with different battery chemistries.
<v ->Great, Andrea?</v>
<v ->Yeah, I really appreciate</v>
that you brought up the consumer,
'cause a couple of days ago, Walter,
you mentioned to me how popular the sustainability track
has become here at CES,
and I thought that this conversation is the perfect start
to the solutions we're gonna come up with.
And you might think like sustainability, why are we at CES?
But you mentioned consumers, right?
What the consumer practice is
and what's gonna be easy for a consumer to do,
so what a better place than the consumer electronic show.
But everything we do right,
it's gonna have to be focused on, can the consumer do it?
Can we get that knowledge and education out,
which is something Call2Recycle.
It does really well.
And then with that, I think we need to work on
the environmental justice and level the playing fields.
I also really appreciate that you mentioned certifications,
'cause I'm sure if you go out there
and look at the batteries for purchase,
you're gonna see a big price difference.
And are you gonna spend 4.99 on a battery
or are you gonna spend 9.99?
Or if it's a bigger battery, much more.
And you have to think about those certifications
and what the manufacturers go through
to get them certified.
So if we can get that education out there
and it starts in a panel like this,
'cause we need to have the manufacturers,
we need to have industry involved, the consumers.
We also need to have government,
'cause there should be more mandates.
We're actually pro having a federal mandate on this
because that's the only way to level out the playing field
and also have the recyclers involved
and make sure that we're seeing this
from a multi-stakeholder point of view.
<v ->Leo, could you address maybe collection or something else?</v>
That's such an important piece to this.
<v ->Yeah, yeah, thanks for asking.</v>
I would say by and large,
that we were able to move batteries safely
to their end destination recyclers fairly safely.
The thing that keeps me up at night
is how defective batteries are handled in the United States.
And this is an area where we can do a lot better,
both on the policy side from the government,
but also manufacturers stepping up
and doing things responsibly.
Panasonic's a great example of how you do it right.
There are a lot of companies that don't do it right.
And what I mean by that is,
if you've got a defective battery that's in the market,
there's always gonna be a chance that a battery
is manufactured improperly.
Just happens, right?
The right way to do it is a manufacturer
should take responsibility for the battery
and get the packaging to the customer and say,
"Hey, get it back to us.
We'll take it out of the system.
Let's manage it safely."
Unfortunately, that doesn't happen a lot.
A lot of times, you just basically
have manufacturers kicking the can down the road and saying,
"Dispose it to your local facility."
They're not equipped to deal with this.
It's a big and growing issue just because
more and more batteries are going into commerce.
To give you some numbers, last year,
the CPSC issued about two dozen recalls.
Three and a half million units
of batteries were recalled last year.
Only a small percentage of those
were handled right way, quite frankly.
In the last two months of the year,
they issued recalls covering almost a million units.
So if you think about it,
you're a person in your home, you've got a power bank,
you get the message, "Hey, I need to get rid of this.
I should need to get out of my house."
It's a risk, absolutely.
But the last thing you wanna do is have 100 households
take all those batteries, take them to the facility,
you magnify the risk,
you put workers at risk, things like that.
So I think we can do a lot better
in terms of messaging from the government saying,
"Hey, this is the appropriate way to do it."
But also, manufacturers need to do the right thing.
Again, Panasonic's a fantastic example.
A lot of other companies
do it the right way.
<v ->I didn't pay him</v>
by the way. (laughs)
<v ->Oh, yeah, no.</v>
And because this is what we do every day all day long,
and it's an issue for us.
So I think it's an area we can do better.
So we're hopeful that it will get better.
I raised this issue last year on this stage
and not as much progress has been made as I'd like,
but I think we'll get there.
<v ->Well, so this is CES,</v>
and really, CES is about the future
and about technology and innovation.
So Giovanni, this one's for you.
What are some of the solutions?
What's the future look like in terms of batteries?
What do you think?
Where should we go?
<v ->Well, I think the future in terms of batteries</v>
is diminishing in some ways.
And with that, I mean that,
I mean, what we do,
okay, every year, the consumer electronic business
uses around 10 billion disposable batteries, give or take.
And these are not recycled in the proper way.
Fortunately enough, a lot of them end up in landfill
et cetera, polluting land and water and so on.
That's bad.
I love batteries.
We need batteries 'cause they enable the smartness,
the functionality, freedom, all the stuff.
But we need to find a good balance
between disposable batteries, preferably not so many,
and rechargeable batteries that we can use more.
But how are you gonna power these rechargeable batteries?
That's what we do.
So we have developed this flexible film.
This is a silicon-free solar cell.
We've developed this over the last 15 years in Sweden
in two factories, completely run on renewable energy,
zero emissions to air and water,
zero emissions at all actually from the factories.
This is the lowest LCA in the world, solar cell.
It's the highest power fishes in the world for indoor.
So this works indoor and outdoor.
So what we do with this
is that we integrate it into products.
This is a product we have developed together with 3M,
one of the best companies in the U.S.
We love them very much.
We have a global exclusivity deal with them.
They can only work with us.
Here is our solar cell.
This one previously was run on disposable batteries.
So every second week, you would need to buy
two new batteries and put inside to have it to work.
This is a smart hearing protector
that protects your ears and allows you to communicate
in different situations such as airports, mines,
construction sites, oiling platforms, et cetera.
Very critical moments where you need to know
you can communicate for yourself to safety.
Also, this is used in military purposes, et cetera.
Now, so over three years, you would buy 150 batteries.
Now, this has a really small one rechargeable battery
that we power by utilizing the light
that surrounds you when you use it.
That means we have eliminated 149
batteries from the ecosystem.
And this is the future where you will see
more and more of these products become self-powered,
self-powered, energy independent,
energy autonomy, call it what you want.
The freedom to utilize the products
in the way that we're supposed to.
You don't have to think, "Oh, I can't really put on
noise cancellation now 'cause it'll drain the battery."
No.
Utilize all the great innovations
that you companies come with all the time.
Utilize the product as it was supposed to,
without having the fear or battery anxiety
or range anxiety, all this stuff.
<v Walter>So let me just ask,</v>
so it doesn't have to be sunny to work, right?
<v ->No.</v>
<v ->Okay.</v>
So-
<v ->Indoor, light,</v>
shade, just light.
This is a light cell.
It's not a solar cell, to be honest.
<v Walter>And I know you're from Sweden, and so sometimes,</v>
not a lot of sunlight during winter solstice time, but-
<v ->That's correct.</v>
<v ->It's still fine.</v>
<v ->It's still fine.</v>
And people are using this in Sweden all the time.
It's on the market since May last year.
And they use it as seven, eight hours per day.
They never need to charge them.
Even in Sweden, November where we had this three hours
of sunshine in one month.
<v Walter>It's a wonderful country, by the way.</v>
I was just vacationing, so knockout, Sweden.
<v ->And with the factory,</v>
we're building our second factory called Stockholm II.
When that's fully ramped, we'll be able to replace
one billion disposable batteries per year
from that single factory.
We do remote controls, the no battery inside,
we do electronic shelf labels
to power the connected stores and retail.
We have the largest customer in the world
signed up a big, yeah.
So this is the future.
We will need good batteries,
safe, environmentally-friendly batteries that are reliable
and predictable and stable, and we will charge them.
That's the future.
<v ->Yeah.</v>
Yeah, excellent.
Well, we're gonna come back I think to you, Judy.
What do you think?
<v ->Yeah, I just wanted</v>
to add about batteries.
<v ->What the future?</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->There are different</v>
chemistries that are being worked.
As you mentioned, environmentally friendly sodium ion,
magnesium ion, those battery chemistries
that we're working on.
But there are some sodium ion cells in the market today,
but they're almost like lithium ion.
They have the same fire
because they're using similar electrolytes.
But we are looking at newer starting materials
and both the sodium ion and magnesium ion.
So we might get to more environmentally friendly, cheaper,
where you really don't have to,
sodium is in plenty in the world.
So I think those are areas that we can provide
to make more sustainable and energy-efficient batteries.
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->I totally agree.</v>
Can I say-
<v ->Sure, please.</v>
<v ->I completely agree.</v>
And what we do, we work very closely to battery companies
because there are new very, very cool things
coming in the pipeline.
And you have many,
you have a four year,
yeah, you have year-long programs, right?
So what we can do, we can take our one millimeter thin
plastic film and we can glue it together
with a one millimeter thin flexible battery
that does not suffer from, if you can cut that,
you can strike a hammer on it, nothing happens.
And when we glue those together, we have a self-recharging,
completely safe, flexible battery
that does not explode or turn into fire or anything.
Alone, that battery is not good enough.
This is a little bit on the expensive side
and the energy (indistinct) is not that good.
But when you combine it with, for example, our technology,
why should that not be the backside of your laptop, right?
This is what's gonna happen.
You're gonna see the devices,
the surfaces turn into something else.
Like we used to have papers, we read papers,
now we have digital papers,
we have functional papers that do many things.
And this is gonna happen as well in the battery
and the energy harvesting area.
<v Walter>Fantastic, Andrea?</v>
<v ->Yeah, I would say just adding on to that,</v>
we have to change the way we think about batteries, right?
Just as you're saying, what chemistries they're made of,
what we attach them to.
And of course, match that with what the consumer wants.
No consumer wants to be tied to an outlet.
You go into a room or you get into the airport, right?
And you're fighting for that charger.
So we really have to rethink as an industry
how we're gonna put batteries into our products,
how we're gonna make them safe,
how we're gonna make them durable as you say.
And not only prevent fires but prevent from water damage.
Right now, you want all your electronics
to be able to be used out in the rain.
You used to have to hide it, and now you're like,
"Oh, my iPhone is waterproof.
This is great."
But you think about what that does to the battery
and how you have to secure the battery for that
and then that how it makes that harder to remove the battery
and then how to recycle that battery.
So that's really a complex issue.
<v ->Fantastic.</v>
Well, we're gonna open it up for questions
here in just a couple minutes,
but Giovanni, I wanted to go back to you,
and many times with our innovations
and the consumer technology industry,
we have to think about what the new impacts are gonna be.
What's the material profile look like
for your technology that you're putting out?
What's it made out of?
<v ->Well, so we have over 300 granted patents.</v>
Over 21 families.
It's 15 years of research.
I'm not gonna give you all of that.
<v ->That's okay.</v>
<v ->But I can say the main component is titanium dioxide,</v>
which is the white pigment in wall paint,
in toothpaste, in sunscreen.
So it's a very environmentally friendly composition,
no rare earth metal, no toxic materials, nothing,
REACH, RoHS, and Prop 65, all of that.
And we do that on purpose.
We can do solar cells with much higher efficiency,
but that would mean that we would need to mix in
toxic stuff or things that are not compliant
with how we see this,
'cause this is something that we wear.
I wear this on me, right?
I carry this, my kids,
we have a lot of consumer products as well.
My kids, they wear the headphones,
they wear the stuff, they carry it.
It has to be completely safe.
<v ->Yeah, fantastic.</v>
Well, very good, thank you very much.
So if folks have questions,
we actually have two microphones.
Anybody have a question at this point?
Alright, come on up and ask a question.
I think both of these microphones should be working.
And if anybody else has a question,
feel free to go ahead and stand up by one of the mics.
Go ahead.
<v Matt>My name is Matt,</v>
and I work in innovative product design,
but I actually had a question
around the waterproofedness of batteries.
Of course there's battery regulations
that are coming out in the U.S. and in Europe
around the need to have them be removable
so that they can be readily recycled.
Currently, I believe there's an exemption
for things that are highly integrated or waterproofed.
Is there an interest and passion
from the industry to look at solutions
to innovate around that,
to make things that can be both waterproofed and removable?
<v ->Yeah, Andrea?</v>
<v ->Yeah, so I could take that.</v>
That's really an excellent question,
and it's something that our design engineers
have been focused on for quite a long time.
And actually, just before,
I was sharing with the panel a story.
So we launched a couple years ago
a product called the MultiShape,
and it's five different personal care devices in one
and it's made to replace your razor, your toothbrush,
your nose hair trimmer,
and I'll get to the point but it's all in one.
And the sales team actually came to me and said,
if we have consumers disposing
of five different products to buy this,
that's gonna create a lot of waste.
So we started calling our recycling partners
and saying how are we going to,
what are we gonna do?
And we created a program
where if you buy the MultiShape,
you can return and we'll recycle for you for free
for the consumer your old product.
So we went to the electronics manufacturer
and we bought a big box of personal care products,
different brands, many Panasonic.
And we saw, and if you've never been
to recycling manufacturer electronics,
it's a huge warehouse and it's all automated
because that's how you're gonna do this at scale
is you're gonna have automation.
And we followed these as it went through the whole warehouse
and they went to sorting and it went to an area
and the ones with lithium ion batteries,
because they catch on fire,
went to a special section in the back
where they had all the fire control, right?
So it took us time to go through there,
and it was a manual process to get rid of the battery,
because it was an electric razor you can use in the shower.
And it took one person about 12 minutes
to get that battery out.
And we are talking about different ways
he had to go get like a special screwdriver
and he had to like safely separate the battery area from it.
And that was hard to do
because like the battery wasn't at the end,
where you think easily removable, it's gonna be at the end,
but it was in the middle
and it was encased in so much plastic.
And they said, "This is gonna cost you a lot of money."
And we said, we said, "Okay, well, we need to do it
but we need to find a way to make it better."
So I put together a proposal.
I'm thinking this is an easy solution, right?
And I put together a proposal,
this is the standard screw that needs to be used.
I got all the specs, and it needs to be
closer to the end of the unit
so it could be chopped off first and then manually removed.
And I bring it back to the design team in Japan.
They review it and they come back to me
and say that that's impossible.
I can't make you that waterproof product
with the specifications you're giving me.
So they are working on it.
I would say with each model, we get a little better,
but we haven't really perfected that solution
where it's gonna be a pop out battery
that can have all the functionality
and the safety that we need.
<v ->If I could add to that, I mean, this is a critically</v>
important issue for the recycling system,
because as Andrea pointed out,
it's a lot of time, time is money.
So we've done some time studies on what it takes
to actually get a battery ready for processing
if it's in a product versus loose.
And as Andrea pointed out,
when you're dealing with loose batteries,
it's increasingly robotic.
It's like it's Star Trek level, sort of.
And then you've got these rooms
where it's basically the stone age.
You've got people with hammers, beating things to death.
And it's very expensive.
It's very time consuming.
Costs us about $82 a pound to be able to process
lithium ion batteries that are loose batteries.
If they're in a product, you add $2 to that.
So it's about $4 a pound.
It's very expensive.
And the more expensive it is,
the less incentive it is to do.
So it's definitely an issue.
And they're introduced all sorts of safety issues.
And since you're in design, you know this.
I mean, there's just a a ton of compelling sort of reasons
to do this, that, and the other on the design side.
This is just one of them.
From our perspective, the more that manufacturers
are thinking with the end in mind,
the better off it's going to be.
So actually, when we were talking earlier off stage
about the headset, my first question, Giovanni,
was can you remove the battery without a tool?
'Cause anytime you gotta use a tool, it's a step, right?
We need to be thinking in that direction.
<v ->I just wanted to add that we have a DOE project</v>
where we are looking at safe recycling
or process for safe recycling.
So we are looking at not only batteries but also devices.
Right now, it's consumer level devices up to power tools
where we are trying to see if we can simultaneously remove
the electrolyte while we are shredding.
So that will make the process,
it's not connected to your question,
but just saying that we can make the process
more safer if we try to do something like that.
<v Speaker>Is that for lithium ion batteries?</v>
<v ->Yes, lithium ion batteries.</v>
<v ->Okay, alright, good.</v>
<v ->Thank you very much.</v>
<v Walter>All right, thank you for your question.</v>
If there are no other questions right now,
Giovanni, I wanted to ask,
oh yes, please go on, go on up.
And then if there's time, I'll ask you the follow up.
<v Audience Member>Hi, everyone.</v>
I'll just try to keep this simple.
I worked 11 years in sustainability
for electronic recyclers down in Southern California.
And as we know, a lot of things are getting
more and more expensive for a lot of the people in general.
And yesterday, I was listening to the speaker,
the CEO for Twitter and she was mentioning how
generation Z is the up and coming.
So what I'm just wondering is,
I guess the question that I wanna ask is,
throughout my years of working in Los Angeles and Seattle,
total reclaim, EWA center, and corporate EWA solutions,
and at one point, I was even trying to chase after
some of the accounts here in Las Vegas like the Venetian.
What I'm just wondering is for Panasonic
or for some of you else on the panel,
do you guys know if the manufacturers
are offering like some type of incentive?
Like for example, like for my shoes,
they're from a company in Spain called Camper.
So whenever my shoes are like older shoes,
if I wanna buy a new pair of shoes, they kind of subsidize
and you bring in the old one and then you can get
like a little percentage off of a new one.
So when I'm wondering is,
in southern California, it's so hard
'cause we're so spread out,
and the only effective thing that I've seen
throughout the years,
you can do all these collection events
with all these Ralphs and Albertsons and CVS,
but what I'm wondering is like the most effective
that I've seen in Orange County
is where the city actually has Monday through Friday
where people can drive their cars
and just basically offload throughout the whole day.
So maybe you guys can give some two cents
on like some of the big major retailers
like Ikea or Home Depot,
'cause I know that they do try to collect
some of the e-waste back,
but I thought I'd just ask if you at Panasonic,
like what do you guys do to cover all that?
<v ->Yeah, I'm sure, and I know both Leo and I</v>
can speak to this, but there's what's called
extended producer responsibility, EPR.
And when you think about it,
there are many EPRs for all kinds of products.
Your sneakers is an interesting one.
I think that's a great new use case,
'cause it's probably even more important
how many sneakers does everyone go through
in even a year or their lifetime.
But that's very common.
And there's EPR for many electronics, not all electronics,
but primarily TVs, laptop computers, desktop computers,
printers, batteries as well have their own
extended producer responsibility laws.
So as a producer of something,
and actually those laws are extending now
to packaging too as well for the products.
We are responsible for that product at the end of its life.
So we do partner with many recyclers across the country,
and we have a recycling management company
called MRM Recycling.
So if you go onto their website,
very similar to the Call2Recycle website.
You just plug in your zip code
and you can see where you can bring
your electronics to recycle.
And there are collection report points,
I believe Best Buy, Staples
will have collection and then local municipalities
and those are funded by us, by the manufacturers.
But you're right, we have to increase that.
As much as we try, and specifically for batteries,
we are not collecting as many batteries as we're making.
And there are laws in, do you know how many states?
And then in Canada?
<v Leo>Oh, it's about a half a dozen right now</v>
and it's gonna be double that soon.
<v ->There are many laws,</v>
and we are struggling to get those rates.
So it's more about the education to the consumer,
because it's pretty easy to get a battery.
I bring my batteries some to the office when I'm lazy,
because we have the call to recycle box.
My husband usually takes batteries to Home Depot.
And if you see the call to recycle symbol on the battery,
you know you could bring it to Home Depot
and we fund that program.
But it's getting that, you know,
just getting that mentality, I'd say, for consumers to know,
hey, every time I go shopping,
I don't know where you live,
in New Jersey, we have a plastic bag ban.
So every time we have plastic bags,
we do our at Target, I bring my bags to Target
to recycle through there.
We have to get people to do that with batteries
and people to do that electronics.
You have to just get it into your daily routine
that you're gonna be bringing back with you to recycling.
But there are a lot of programs out there.
And as long as we expand it,
I think we're on the right track.
<v Walter>Yeah, Leo, could you address,</v>
who are your retail partners?
<v ->Oh, well, the major ones are Home Depot, Lowe's,</v>
Staples, Best Buy,
and then True Value, ACE Hardware, et cetera.
And on the incentive side,
Staples is actually a really good example of how last year,
we partnered with them and with the RI
to basically do an all battery collection program,
'cause most of what we do across the United States
is rechargeable batteries.
We do single use batteries depending on the situation.
And they saw a dramatic increase in traffic.
So it's a good sort of value proposition
for their customers also.
It's good for their business.
That was an experience I had back at Best Buy
where I cut my teeth in E-waste
and standing up that e-waste recycling program,
it was really all about the customer value proposition.
But Andrea is right.
EPR is what's driving this.
So today, we service about a million residents
in regulated EPR states for all batteries.
Within about three to four years,
that's gonna be about 65 million people.
And when that happens is the regulations make us
collect in a lot more places,
have a much more muscular outreach and education approach.
It's basically just making it more available and accessible.
People are ready to do it.
They just need access and some education.
On the design side,
since we had a question about design earlier,
I think what's gonna drive that
is the incentive there is gonna be more a little bit
on the back end, which is it's just going
to increasingly be more expensive
to get recall batteries out of the market
if you can't get them out of the product.
We handle the recall for a manufacturer about a year ago,
and it was an upgrade vacuum cleaner.
It's about yay big, like the size of a small child.
Battery was inside, could not get it out.
The manufacturer needed
to get the vacuum cleaner out of the market.
It cost several hundred dollars per vacuum cleaner
to safely legally transport that back to a recycler.
So I'm a manufacturer, I'm thinking,
"Okay, how do I avoid this next time?"
Put a door.
Get the battery out easily so you don't have to do that.
I think those are the kinds of incentives
that will maybe drive a little bit
more change on the design side.
<v ->Okay, any last questions from the audience?</v>
Yeah, come on up.
<v Audience Member>So we are at CES.</v>
I'm wondering if you can say,
if there is one thing you can get from technology side
that can help recycling of lithium ion batteries better,
what is that one thing going to be for you?
How technology can help in improving recycling
of lithium ion batteries?
<v ->Good question.</v>
Mostly, it's collection, but you might have some insights,
one of you on the recycling.
<v ->Yeah, real quick,</v>
just more automation on the processing side, I think.
That's just gotta go faster,
because we see indications at a pilot scale,
that it has a lot of promise, but it's gotta go faster.
<v ->And safety included in that.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Great, before we-</v>
<v ->I think if I just add-</v>
<v ->Oh yeah, please.</v>
<v ->And collaboration</v>
and new ideas, I think we need to combine
partnerships with large companies and small startups, right?
And work together to bring new technologies.
I think Redwood's a great example of that.
They started because they saw a problem,
and they just worked to find
the technologies for a solution.
And if you read about Redwood materials,
they're materials recycling company
and you could bring them,
I bring them ideas all the time.
"I need you to find a way to recycle this," right?
And they're gonna find a way to do it
or they're working towards that, right?
So we just have to work harder and come up with new ideas.
<v ->Yeah, they're great.</v>
They get about half of our weight today,
so we like them a lot.
<v ->Wonderful.</v>
Well, before we wrap up, Giovanni,
I wanna give you the last word.
So we're talking about the future.
You mentioned a couple of products
and actually brought a couple of products
that use your technology.
What other products are being used for your technology,
and where are some maybe future products?
What looks like a good future market area for you as well?
<v ->I think that in the immediate term,</v>
the connected store, retail is gonna be very, very big.
I actually brought,
this is a small electronic shelf label.
This is a price tag, right?
<v ->That's a price tag.</v>
<v ->This is a small screen that you see in the stores,</v>
which will then show the price of a specific product.
It can also, like this one for example says,
"indoor charging with powerfoyle" by the 3M headphone.
But this can display information, right?
It can also gather information.
And this is now deployed all over the U.S.
Walmart announced a couple of weeks ago
a $2 billion deal with our partner,
The Vusion Group.
We have an exclusive with them.
These used to be battery-powered.
Now, they're not battery powered anymore.
These are now powered by the light in stores
and the one battery to power many.
And then we charge that battery.
So this is enabling, unlocking the smartness of retail
to gather more data, get more insights,
and increase efficiency, enhance the shopping experience
for the users and ultimately drive P&amp;L.
So I think this is gonna be very, very, very big.
I'm pretty sure of it.
We see it being rolled out across the whole world now.
You can change all the prices by your computer.
I also think that the smart workplace,
a smart worker will be really big in the future
where you will have, I mean,
you have 300 million construction helmets
are sold every year.
There's no smart within them.
Integrated smartness, batteries and sensors.
You'll be able to know who is where.
Does she already have the right proper training?
It's about compliance.
It's about having a more safe work environment,
health, digital health monitoring.
There's so many things.
<v ->Wow.</v>
<v ->It's gonna come.</v>
But I think the key is that it has to be self-powered
and just seamlessly integrated.
And I think also what I wanted to comment
on the battery things here is that another way
to approach this is of course
to prolong the lifetime of the batteries.
And this can be done in many different ways.
One way is, for example,
that we electronically control the overcharge.
So these ones, they never charge above 80%.
So these are run for months
without spending one charge cycle.
They just go between 20 and 75% up and down,
which greatly extend the lifetime of the products,
which ultimately will lead to fewer batteries
being used over time.
So I think we need innovations,
to your point there in the audience,
and collaboration between big companies with global reach,
smaller startup, scale ups.
That's gonna be the key to the future.
But in the end, the consumers or business to business,
someone needs to want to buy the product.
So the product features,
I mean, technology will drive the change for sure.
<v Walter>Yeah.</v>
<v ->But it's our responsibility to make sure</v>
that that change is environmentally sustainable
and also business-wise sustainable.
We can't come with solutions
that are really great for the world, but it's too expensive
or especially here in the U.S., sorry,
but no one wants to pay for sustainability.
In Europe, it's a little bit better.
Sweden is quite good, actually.
But here, you need to lead with lower cost of ownership.
You need to lead with a higher increased P&amp;L,
increased efficiency, lower OpEx,
lower CapEx, whatever it is.
And by the way, by implementing this,
you're also contributing a little bit to a better world.
<v ->Wow.</v>
Well, thank you for wrapping up
and just as a consumer, I look forward to the day
when I don't have to put my fitness ring
on the charger every few days.
<v ->So there you go.</v>
<v ->So yeah,</v>
so I'm looking forward to that.
Well, listen, thank you all very much.
Let's give a round of applause for the panel today.
