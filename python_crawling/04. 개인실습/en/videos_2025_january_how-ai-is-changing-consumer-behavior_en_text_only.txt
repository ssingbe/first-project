<v ->Well, we are delighted to be here today</v>
to dive into an incredibly interesting topic, which is AI,
which is ever-present at CES this year,
but specifically to dive
into how it's changing consumer behavior,
also consumer behavior,
not just on a device, but in the content that we consume.
So let me start, I'm gonna start by introducing myself.
My name's Kevin Yalowitz.
I lead our software and platform segment at Accenture.
And throughout this panel,
we're gonna dive into some really interesting data
that we commissioned 18,000 consumers
across 11 countries about how they are using AI,
how they're paying for AI, and how they expect it
to better their experience with both devices and content.
And our four panelists here today are equally well-suited
to comment on this from various different points
of view in the industry.
But just to give everyone a sense
of how we're gonna cover this,
we're gonna first dive into adoption of GenAI
and specifically how end users are starting to use GenAI,
their perceptions of whether they think they're using GenAI
or whether they're not.
And then specifically how they expect the experience
of their entertainment to change as a result of GenAI.
And then lastly,
we would be remiss if we didn't touch on trust.
So we're gonna touch on trust.
So Paul, why don't I start with you for introductions
and then we can go down the rest of the panel.
<v ->Certainly.</v>
Hello, I'm Paul Pastor.
I'm the co-founder and chief business officer of Quickplay.
Quickplay is a company
that builds the OTT streaming services
for Madison Square Garden, Yankee Sports Network.
So we're the system behind all of your apps
for delivering content.
<v ->Hi, I am Shalini Govil-Pai.</v>
I head up Google TV
and prior to Google TV, I was at YouTube for many years.
So been in the media space for a long time.
I'm very excited about talking about how AI impacts content
as well as devices.
<v ->Hi everybody, my name is Anjali.</v>
It's great to be here.
I'm the founder and CEO of Diesel Labs.
We're an audience intelligence company
that creates AI-based panels to help all
of our friends in the media
and marketing space get intelligence almost
within seconds in real time.
<v ->Hello everybody.</v>
Thank you for having me here.
My name is Haohong Wang.
I'm the general manager of TCL Research America.
As some of you may know,
TCL is the world largest TV maker,
shipping more than 40 million TVs last year.
In the last two years, we made a quite good progress on AI
and the streaming services.
For the streaming services, in the last two years,
we make a growth about 100 times
and we launched seven AI-based films last year.
Thank you.
<v ->And two of our panelists</v>
have had a great relationship here at CES
with an pretty interesting product announcement
of Google TV, Gemini on TCO.
It's very cool.
<v ->That's right.</v>
<v ->Very cool.</v>
Okay, so let's dive in specifically to adoption.
So as I mentioned, this broad based consumer study
that we did had some particularly interesting findings,
some frankly that really surprised me.
But first and foremost, we found that roughly two thirds
of consumers are comfortable and familiar with GenAI.
It's not all that surprising.
Interestingly though, 32% of those,
or roughly 32%, so roughly half of
that are using GenAI on a weekly basis.
And of that subset are 5x more likely
to actually be paying for a GenAI tool.
And we can't really see the audience,
but I would love to take just a quick poll.
Raise your hand if you are paying for a GenAI tool
of some sort,
personal or professional.
That probably squares with our numbers, about a third.
What's interesting is, as we dove into this further,
is that we found that the exposure
that consumers think they have to GenAI,
it's their perception, is actually really high.
So within search, they think 60%
of the content they see in search is generative AI,
40% in music,
which is actually equally interesting is GenAI.
And even more interestingly,
40% of consumers believe they can detect
what content is generative or what isn't,
which is actually pretty impressive
'cause I don't think I could do that 40% of the time.
But Shalini, I wanna start with you specifically.
Based off of this dynamic between perceptions and behavior
and this somewhat disconnect
of being able to actually identify,
how can we help consumers really engage
with GenAI knowing that they may
or may not be seeing generative content?
<v ->Yeah, I think it's a good question.</v>
I would say, like, AI is not new.
AI has been been around for a while.
<v ->For sure.</v>
<v ->And this wave of AI is what we call generative,</v>
which is, you know, it can actually generate summaries,
it can generate content, it can generate text.
And so that's the difference.
Like, this is the first time that we've actually been able
to get computers to generate things.
And I would say maybe two years ago, when it launched,
you know, with ChatGPT,
there was a lot of hallucinations that were happening.
And so there was this like, "Oh my gosh,
what's gonna happen?
But it's all gonna be crazy
'cause you're not gonna know what's fake and what's real."
But what we're seeing is
that the models are getting much more intelligent,
much more grounded, and a lot of focus on making sure that
what we're providing is actually accurate and true.
And so I think that that's
why we're seeing people getting more comfortable
with this concept of, "Hey, maybe this is something
that can actually provide value."
And I think that in terms of how users actually get it,
for us it's a lot about, you know,
paradigms that people are already very used to.
For example, search.
If you think of Google search, like we have, what,
And just yesterday I wanted to play craps
and so I went into Google search,
I've never played craps before, and I went into search
and I said, "Hey, what is, you know,
tell me about probabilities and craps."
And I got an AI-generated overview,
it's very clearly flagged it's AI generated,
but it gave me the summary of how the probabilities
of the dice work, why seven is the most probable, et cetera.
And then it gave me all the links
that you would expect from regular search.
And you know, it was just so phenomenal.
I actually went and played last night based
on all of this research.
<v ->How did you do?</v>
<v ->Yeah, I was gonna say.</v>
<v ->Well you know, the house always wins, so...</v>
<v ->Yeah, right, right, right.</v>
<v ->But I did play for two hours, so...</v>
But you know, my point being, like, those are the ways
that I think people are gonna get comfortable
with it is like, "Oh, I use it in my regular day-to-day.
And yeah, it's actually very, very helpful."
And I think that's how consumers
are gonna really take it mainstream.
<v ->Yeah, Anjali, how about you?</v>
What's your perspective?
<v ->I completely second the motion</v>
and I think that from my perspective,
I also think there's something really interesting
about almost being thrown into it professionally speaking,
which is making me even more comfortable as a consumer.
So there's something interesting about the fact that,
for example, what we do is we will leverage all
of these wonderful tools, Gemini, ChatGPT, et cetera,
to create essentially, you know,
bespoke but bleeding edge tools
for our clients in the marketing and media space.
That means now instead of waiting a few weeks
to be able to engage with a focus group
of you're a target consumer,
you can do it instantaneously
while you're on the train live, asking questions,
what did my audience think about X or Y
and get back responses right away.
And so that has accelerated my own comfort level
and adoption.
So when I have experiences like the one Shalini was talking
about within Google search for example,
you start to see the parallels
of how this technology can really impact not only
what we're doing professionally, but also personally.
<v ->Yeah, so in a way it's a flywheel,</v>
the adoption drives experience
and experience drives further adoption.
<v Anjali>Yeah, I think that's right.</v>
And it's like, you know,
every time we have better and better experiences
and with the technology getting so much more robust
and so much more accurate, I think that it's sort of a,
like, if you build it,
they will come kind of...
<v ->Yeah.</v>
Yeah.
Haohong, how about for you from a TCO perspective?
<v ->Yes.</v>
As you know that because we have to,
you know, bring the best experience
to our large volume users.
That's a recently, as you know, that we launched
with Google together the Gemini AI into our TVs, right?
We think this is the best experience
that we can provide it with Google to our audiences.
We are also the first, actually many, many years ago,
first to put the Google assistant on our TV.
Actually I would say this is an upgraded version.
At that time when you say Google assistant at that time,
I can easily tell which is AI generated,
which is not AI generated.
But with this latest GenAI technology,
I believe very soon you cannot tell easily,
you know, what is generated,
'cause some of the content that are generated
by AI may be better than a normal consumer, right?
'Cause sometimes something is coming out of box, you know,
you never imagine that so smart this AI can be, right?
So I believe this GenAI brings a lot of curiosity,
you know, for our audiences
because you can imagine today,
every people that can express themselves using some
of the prompts that you can generate,
text, image, video, and so on, right?
So that's a amazing part that we can see.
And we tried that
to put our AI films onto our streaming services,
you know, last year.
I have something to report to you guys.
You know, it's surprisingly,
you know, overwhelmingly successful
because you can see that all the AI films,
the finishing rate,
the playback completion rate is about 50%,
which is unbelievable.
Of course, you can say, "Hey, because it's a shot,
it's five to 10 minutes."
But also the frequency of the viewings
of that is on the top list.
So we can see that.
I can see that a lot of good user engagement
with AI-based storytelling is going on.
I think AI will evolve to get a better experience
for our consumers.
<v ->Interesting.</v>
And Paul, I mean, you're the enabler in many cases.
I mean, how do you view this?
<v ->Yeah, sure.</v>
So grounding my answer a bit in our industry, right?
One is from a creator perspective, right,
and a creator community,
I think this is an incredible tool.
And we used to be the province of movies
and then through "Game of Thrones",
we brought in amazing graphics
into television is now actually in the hands
of literally everyday consumers
and influencers and users to create incredible stories
and incredible content and leverage all of that.
Now what was interesting is also in your stat
that 43% said they could tell the difference.
And I will tell you, over the holidays,
I was playing on my own feed
and I saw something from "America's Got Talent"
and they were watching all these singers
and dancers turn into animals.
And because somebody interposed that
with real live reactions from the show,
it took me a moment to understand
what I was watching, right?
So I don't know if consumers really,
really understand what they see.
But then from a distributor perspective,
I think it's really interesting this partnership
that Google's put together with TCL
because the enablement on discovery
that AI can potentially enable
is gonna be tremendous, right?
Something that's absolutely personalized, well understood,
and comprehended and makes my, you know,
we know a consumer spends 23 minutes a day searching
for a piece of content just trying to figure out
what to watch.
In the acceleration of this partnership, right,
you can reduce that and actually spend more time.
And guess what?
For the media company, they're making more money
'cause they're putting more ads forward.
You're spending more time with their product.
So there's huge advances that are happening
through this user experience in AI.
<v ->Yeah, and that's a great, great example</v>
of how we can educate consumers to adopt
or to see the benefits of GenAI sort
of being baked into the experience.
I mean, I think it'd be interesting, Anjali,
to talk a little bit
from your perspective talking with consumers.
How do we go about educating them in a way
that I think we have to be careful, right?
I mean, consumers are smart
and you know, how do you recognize that
and balance that with some of the unknown?
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
And just before I jump into that, I'll put a quick plugin
'cause one of the hack week projects we did a little
while ago is to create essentially a TV guide
'cause I don't know about you guys,
but your point about 23 minutes
to find content... - Yeah, it's totally true.
<v ->We have this sort of internal thing</v>
where we call it tile fatigue,
but I don't think we named it.
I feel like that's a well known issue.
But one of the side effects of our data is that we know
what everyone is talking about all the time
across the entire spectrum of content.
So we put together a small tool called WatchNxt,
which you guys can go check out.
It's watchnxt.com,
where it literally tells you every single brand new piece
of content coming out every day and how popular it is.
And the thing that always blows my mind is
that every day there's 10
to 30 brand new things coming out.
Doesn't even include new seasons of shows
or returning shows.
It's literally only brand new stuff.
So if you're curious, that's an MVP of a product
that we have been working on
and soon to include some new AI technology.
In terms of getting consumers comfortable,
I think with AI, we were talking
about this a little bit actually
in the green room,
disclosure and sort of transparency are, I think,
really, really critical at this juncture.
I think we are all here, especially in a venue like CES,
we all know what to look out for.
We know the watch outs.
We know what we're looking at when we're within social media
or search or what have you.
But I think it's fair to say
that not every single person out there would have
that same sort of thought process.
And so making sure that we
as an industry are doing a good job of being very clear
where information's coming from, how we're using data,
where data is sourced.
These are things that at least, you know,
from where we come from as a data company,
are critically important tenants to our service.
<v ->Yeah, I think that's spot on.</v>
We're gonna end with that a little bit in our trust section,
but I think it seeds the discussion
and where we're going.
Shalini, how about education from an OS perspective
and a UI perspective,
how do you balance educating consumers about the benefits
of GenAI and the experience?
<v ->Well, first I just wanted</v>
to answer your 23 minutes on what to watch.
You're clearly not using Google TV.
<v ->Yeah, there you go.</v>
Right.
<v ->Have to make a note of that.</v>
<v ->Because...</v>
<v ->We knew that was coming.</v>
<v ->That's the whole value</v>
proposition of Google TV.
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>
<v ->Is to quickly get to what the content you wanna watch,</v>
but would love to explore the data models
that you're building on top of that.
In terms of education,
look, the way I think about it is if something's useful,
it will carry its own weight
and you don't really need to educate.
Like, the UI should always be that simple.
That there's no real,
like, this is a video on how to use something
and these are the five steps you have to do.
It shouldn't be that way.
It should always be like,
just is so intuitive
and it just makes sense 'cause it's valuable.
I talked about the search example,
but the other example I'll give you is NotebookLM,
which I'm hoping all of you have downloaded and used.
It's an amazing tool.
And what it does is you can upload, you know,
like tens of PDFs or any multimodal content links
and then you can ask it questions on that content
and it'll also create a podcast for you.
But I recently did that for my finances.
I'm not a very good financial planner,
but I put up a lot of my finances.
I asked it about should I invest in a casino.
And you know, it had, like, a lot
of great recommendations for me,
you know, and it did it in such a quick manner
that, you know, I didn't have to spend tons
and tons of hours researching.
I could have probably gotten to the same conclusion,
but it actually was very helpful in terms of shortening
that time and getting me to what I wanted to very quickly.
And I think that's the value.
And I think that's how we educate is here's something
so valuable that you cannot actually live without it.
And once you get there,
like, it just takes off from there.
<v ->Yeah, very cool.</v>
It's a perfect segue to experience
because as we think about experience,
I mean, if we look at what consumers tell us, right,
88% of users that are actively using GenAI
believe it can improve the experience for them.
So once you get through the barrier of making
that convincing argument, they get it, right?
What's equally interesting,
and this is something you hit on, Haohong, is the consumers,
83% of them that are active users believe
that generative content can be more creative than humans.
Which again, is a little surprising to me
that out of the gate that we see consumers there.
But I'd actually love to hear from everyone on the panel,
what is the most impactful thing
from an experience perspective you think GenAI will enable
or unlock between now
and when we're here in Las Vegas 12 months from now?
<v ->Oh my gosh.</v>
<v ->I'll start with you, Paul.</v>
<v ->That's quite a vision that we have to create here.</v>
<v ->Make it investible.</v>
<v ->Yes, exactly.</v>
Well, listen, I will say if we're thinking
about 12 months out from here,
and it's gonna get into some of your trust conversation,
I think we're gonna be having a lot
of conversations...
<v ->100%.</v>
<v ->On disclosure and GDPR, like, things.</v>
<v ->Yep, yep.</v>
<v ->But I also think that the one thing</v>
that I anticipate coming out of generative AIs,
people understand the value proposition,
but they don't yet understand how much
of their own data is actually being used
to actually drive the models.
And I think that there will be companies,
there's a company based in Miami called Crosshatch,
which is basically a locker for your content.
And then you can decide as you interact with an agent
which fields you want unlocked
and how much power you want it to drive.
And I think that those are where some of the pieces
of innovation are gonna sit is how do I wanna interact
with AI because I understand its capabilities,
but I don't know how much I want it to understand about me.
So I think those will be some
of the things we'll be discussing in 12 months from now.
<v ->Yeah, very cool.</v>
Lots of barriers to get there, though,
with stitching together that across...
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
<v ->Multiple platforms</v>
that consumers touch daily.
<v ->That stat that you shared,</v>
it actually doesn't surprise me too much.
And this is probably 'cause I spend way too much time
listening to what people say about content online.
It's a hazard of the job.
By the way, my parents are delighted when I get
to tell people I watch TV for work.
I'm sure yours are too.
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
<v ->Right?</v>
<v ->It was my favorite party trick when I ran research is</v>
like, "I know what you watch
and I know what you watch",
'cause you know their demographics.
<v ->But one of the fascinating things</v>
that's happening right now is,
and for those of you who are on TikTok, of course, there,
you know, BookTok has really taken off.
And one of the things consumers are doing
is actually fan casting their favorite books
using generative AI.
So, you know, for example,
there are many books out there
that have already been optioned by Netflix, by Amazon,
by Hulu, et cetera, which we will all be waiting, you know,
two years to see those things come to life.
But fans and consumers have taken it upon themselves
to create scenes from their favorite novels
using generative AI.
And so I think that in terms of,
you know, people saying that AI can be just as creative
or maybe even more creative,
it's really bringing those tools into the hands
of regular people
and enabling us to share our thoughts, feelings, reactions,
responses in a way that's, like, technical
or sight/sound in motion
in a way that hasn't been possible before.
<v ->Yeah, I think that's spot on.</v>
Haohong, maybe we'll go with you
and then come back to Shalini.
<v ->Yeah, I think the key thing is</v>
that AI redefines the creativity area.
I think that's a key thing
that actually make every people could become a creator.
Okay, because now by leverage the capability of the AI,
which is still evolving,
I mean, we feel that the speed is very rapid.
Actually during the last year,
it cannot limit your imagination
that 12 months later how much these are a normal,
you know, user of the TV
or normal user of the mobile devices,
what they can do to utilize the little tool the AI provide
to them.
So I think, you know, this is something that we're seeing
that it makes self-expression innovation actually much,
much more accessible in the next 12 months.
<v ->It democratizes content creation at the end of the day.</v>
Yeah, absolutely.
Yeah, Shalini, what's your take?
<v ->Yeah, I think that those are all good points.</v>
Especially, I resonate very much with you
that this field is evolving so rapidly.
Like, who would've thought 12 months ago
that we would be here with,
you know, using all of these chat agents, using Gemini
and other forms of generative AI in the ways that we are
and who knows what's really gonna happen in 12 months.
But I would say there are two things
that I am very bullish on.
Of course, we are a knowledge company as Google,
and I think that knowledge is gonna be a huge focus.
And I think that generative AI is gonna help us
in tremendous ways over the next 12 months
just understanding the world in many different ways.
As you know, of course, I talked about NotebookLM.
I talked about our search experience.
As you know, we also have through our DeepMinds team,
a lot of research that we're doing
in the human world, right,
in the actual bio engineering side of things
where AlphaFold, which we got Nobel Prize for,
has uncovered a lot in the DNA side.
And I think that that's gonna revolutionize medicine.
And it's all through knowledge, right?
It's just understanding our world that much better
for individuals, but also for all these enterprises
that want to make a difference.
So I think that's number one in my mind.
It's gonna be huge leaps
and bounds changes in the next 12 months.
And then number two,
I agree with you on the creativity front.
I think, you know, we're already seeing the early signs of,
you know, the video generators, image generators.
They're getting so much more powerful
that the consumer sentiment that I can tell
what's the difference between what's generated
and what's human made.
I think that goes away in 12 months.
But I will also say this.
I work at Pixar animation
and so I'm very close to the creator community,
also from YouTube.
And I would say this is a tool for creativity
and it's only gonna make creativity more easily democratized
so that everyone can be creating.
However, I personally, this is my personal opinion,
I don't think that it's quite ready for,
maybe it gets there in five years,
but as of today,
I would say the storytelling is still
in the hands of humans.
I think that we need to be part of it.
We need to be understanding how
to use these tools for creativity.
But the creativity is,
it's new, right?
Like, these models are built on patterns of the past.
And what humans can do is think about the future.
And I think that's really the value proposition
that we've gotta really embrace.
<v ->Yeah, which actually, as all of you have spoken,</v>
it sort of triggers another question for me,
which we didn't really talk about in advance,
but over the past 12 months,
we've seen a distinct shift from AI.
Is AI, GenAI at least, really being more about chatbots
for end users to agentic AI being something that's known,
but also something
that's getting increasingly real, right?
And we see it starting to touch consumers as well.
Like, if we look at what Apple's doing
with Apple Intelligence,
it's actually natively in the operating system
and can actually do things that, you know,
a typical assistant would not have been able
to with limited access.
How do you see agentic AI changing the experience
of entertainment going forward?
Are we there yet to see that?
I mean, I see some angles with, you know,
your TV being able to predict what you want,
but have you thought about that, anyone on the panel?
<v ->I feel like we've been doing a little bit</v>
of that in our content strategy work.
Let me see if I can link it to the agentic component of it,
but you know, content recommendations, content discovery,
I think we can all agree, has been an area
that really did need a lot of legwork,
whether from our friends at Google or otherwise,
some of the stuff we're doing as well.
But, you know, being able to determine
to create the next story.
So it's one thing to predict what you wanna watch next out
of content that's finite and already exists.
It's another thing to predict
what someone's gonna watch,
what someone's gonna wanna watch a year or two years
from now.
I say a year or two years
'cause that's currently how long general cycles are
for content creation.
Although we know
that those cycles are probably gonna shrink.
That would be another prediction that I would make,
which is I do think we're gonna start to see shorter cycles
for some kinds of content.
Maybe not all of them.
So, you know, the way,
and I think Shalini said this earlier too,
that AI has been around for a long time
under the hood of a lot of things.
And I think that's what's gonna continue to happen.
And as the technology continues to improve,
everything we can do with it will get better.
But content recommendations has been something
that I know a lot of incredibly talented companies
have been working on for a long time.
<v ->I'll also say we were here at CES,</v>
Quickplay announced we developed a new product
called Quickplay Shorts.
And one of the very cool things
about the product is actually
in the content generation side.
So it used to,
let's imagine you go to any studio
and they have a 100,000 assets.
Trying to figure out what to create short-form
out of would usually take them an army
of people and years to do.
And now we say we can process
that in a couple of days.
We can literally look at what's happening on Google Trends
or otherwise or something we're seeing in the social space
and very quickly identify moments that match
that across the entire content catalog
and cut, clip, and verticalize that
and be able to syndicate that into any number
of platforms literally in minutes, right?
That's some of the power of AI
and content creation that's absolutely incredible
and it creates a huge amount
of velocity in a space where you need velocity.
But also it really presents a huge opportunity
for many of these media companies
to have these large libraries.
<v ->Yeah, no, I think that's spot on.</v>
We're seeing that specifically in advertising, right?
The ability to create generative ads for the right context
for the right user on the fly is quite powerful,
especially if you think about audio and video.
Yeah.
Haohong, any thoughts?
<v ->Yeah, so as a veteran in this TV business,</v>
okay, for 15 years, every day,
in my mind I was thinking about user experiences, right?
Because that's what people are using our devices.
So I think there are two key component of the experiences.
One is the content.
If you don't have a good content, nobody will watch.
They don't turn TV, right?
In some regions, they watch more mobile devices
than TVs, in some regions.
But in US, we're lucky still a lot, a lot
of people spend a lot of hours on TV, right?
So which make us responsible
to give them a better user experience.
So one is content, the other is user interactivity.
Okay, let's talk about first for the content,
that's the why we're doing this AI-generated content.
We already been able to cover, you know,
six genre of the content.
There are many genres as you know
that AI is still in this nascent stage.
The phase will change,
the background will change all the time
if you carefully look at the AI-generated content.
So we're able to generate the sci-fi, horror, you know,
comedy, romance, documentary, you know,
six genres in total already.
So this is just our step one, okay?
We want to build a foundation for our,
actually the other step, which is a user interactivity.
Because earlier, there's a lot
of content from the big studios out there.
You cannot do anything.
That's their copyright.
You cannot do anything, right?
But now it's AI generated,
and I know we put a lot of efforts in there.
We might have some rights of something that we could do.
So we launched a feature called Ideal,
which is interactive video, which enable you,
the TV viewers to interact with the IP characters
or story characters anytime
that these story characters empowered
by AI basically will talk to you,
answer your questions, tell you the backstories,
and basically bring you curiosity
and explore further, right?
So these are the things that we believe will be the future.
This is something that actually the content itself
become interactive content
and actually this AI will be able
to support these new experiences
to make user have a deeper engagement
and a more immersive experiences in front of TV.
<v ->Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>
I think that that's a great example.
So I wanna spend our last segment on trust.
And we've hit on that throughout our discussion thus far.
But we would be remiss not to dive deep into it.
So consumer skepticism around AI is very much real.
And if we look at our data, 60% of consumers told us
that they have real concerns about misinformation.
Even more interestingly,
if we look at how consumers view disclosure,
so our active users of GenAI,
when you disclose that something is generative,
they're disproportionately more likely to trust it.
And if you flip the script
and you compare that to those that are not users,
they are disproportionately more likely not
to trust it if you disclose that it's generative.
So I think the question that I'd actually
like to hear from everyone on is how do you build trust
with consumers in this sort of transitional era
that we're in?
Paul, do you wanna start?
<v ->Sure.</v>
So first of all, I'm a big fan of disclosure, right?
<v ->Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>
<v ->I think over time,</v>
when people understand the use cases,
and I think to your point earlier, understand the value
that is delivered, they'll come to trust it more.
But I do believe we'll see, you know,
whether or not governments can get their acts together
to do these things.
But over time I think we will also have required disclosures
that look a lot like GDPR.
And I think we'll probably see platforms enroll a method
that's not unlike what was announced yesterday
on Meta, right?
Which is to say we'll let the community tell
and opine as to what is true and what is not true.
So it'll be the responsibility
of the province of that community.
So I personally believe that's the direction
that we're headed, but you know,
as you were articulating earlier, when you see the value,
I think that will longer term yield benefit.
<v ->Yeah, Shalini?</v>
<v ->Yeah, I mean, definitely huge proponent of value.</v>
Like, without value, there's nothing.
Why does anyone go to anything if there's no value to them?
So I think that's always the number one holy grail.
I think in terms of disclosures,
like, I personally believe three things.
One is I think we should always fully disclose
and you know, if you look at all of our products at Google,
we just launched, you know, with TCL Gemini on TV,
we just are showcasing AI-summarized news,
which is news that we take
from what's happening across the world.
And we summarize it for you
in, like, this quick three-minute podcast.
It is very clearly labeled
that the news is summarized by AI.
And you know, all the feedback we've been getting,
which when we are gonna launch I will hear more,
is that this is phenomenal.
Like, I just want a three-minute clip
and then in my own time, I will go and dig deeper.
And so I think that A, we should always be disclosing
and if there's value, people will value it.
Not be scared of it or run away from it.
Two, I think just, you know,
Facebook announced that they're gonna
have AI-generated channels.
So we talk about creativity.
The whole channel is gonna be AI generated.
And again, like, it's full disclosure
and it's up to the consumer at that point.
Like, if the content is gonna be as sticky
as you're saying, it's gonna be five minutes,
again, all power to them.
Like, you know, because it's fully out there
that this is AI generated and then the choice is yours,
like, is it valuable or enough or not.
And then my third point is just, you know, as Google,
we have taken a lot of steps to make sure
that we're also fingerprinting,
not only disclosing within our own products,
but as we see images
and videos that are generated, we are fingerprinting
and trying to mark out that this is generated
so that consumers feel more trust
between what is human and what is not.
And we'll see how this evolves.
But at this time, this is our commitment.
<v ->Is there initial thinking on the best way</v>
to disclose without disrupting the user experience?
'Cause you could imagine a YouTube video
that has a red screen
that says this is generative AI probably not creating
the best user experience.
Like, is that just something we have to see how it evolves?
<v ->Yeah, I think the experience is gonna evolve</v>
as to how you consume it.
Like, whether there's little tag at the bottom
that discloses it, whether it is a red screen, I doubt it.
<v ->I hope not.</v>
<v ->But it could be.</v>
Those are all things that are evolving.
<v ->Yeah, cool.</v>
<v ->Yeah, I kind of go back to the,</v>
you know, when we started talking about generative AI,
it came hand in hand with this concept of hallucinations,
which you brought up earlier.
And so I think that even in how we introduced generative AI
to ourselves, to the world,
there was already skepticism attached to it.
And maybe I'm standing alone on this one,
but I actually think that's a good thing.
I'm glad that when we started talking about generative AI,
that there was education around
where can AI maybe sometimes go wrong
'cause that helps us all understand how to interpret
and analyze what we're actually watching.
The scary thing, another example would be, you know,
I, in total transparency, used to work over at Twitter many,
many moons ago, still when it was Twitter 1.0.
And we've always had an issue
with non-human generated content on the platform.
It's something we've been very thoughtful about
since the inception of that platform.
And so now that content that is being generated
by non-human is just getting more sophisticated,
it's getting a little bit harder to detect,
but its incumbents on us to then to your point,
fingerprint or otherwise create better detection systems
so that we can be honest and transparent with ourselves
and with our communities.
So I guess I'm just giving two stories
of how I personally feel like coming at AI
with some skepticism and trying to be,
you know, trying to educate yourself on how to consume it
and how to use it is a good first step.
Even though we know that it's going
to get better and better and better.
And hopefully that skepticism will fade over time
as the value proposition continues to increase.
<v ->Yeah, I think there's are great points, great points.</v>
Haohong?
<v ->Yeah, agree with all the panelists,</v>
basically, to label these AI-generated content,
make it transparent to the audiences is extremely important.
I want to add there two more points.
One point is that actually we, in our execution,
the human oversight, we put that at the top priority
because you need a robust system that be able to review
and validate its content to make sure there's no bias
or harmful information to go out.
That's why in our AI filmmaking process,
we use human writer, human director, and the human,
you know, filmmakers produces.
That they basically utilize advances
of AI technology, right?
But they will make sure all the output aligned
with the artistic vision.
That's very important.
Someone needs to know,
"Hey, this is what I want.
Okay, this is not what I want.
That's dangerous", right?
The other point is that I wanna emphasize
because, you know, I'm from the technical background
so this is still in the very nascent AI,
you know, I don't think AI is already there yet.
I don't think the AGI is there yet.
I think it's still very nascent.
That's why I would like to say that we need
to strike a balance between these innovations,
AI innovations, and the management of the trust
for this AI-generated content.
<v ->Yeah.</v>
Yeah, no, that's spot on.
Which actually leads us to our last question.
I wanna spend the last few minutes a little bit open-ended
to be totally honest.
And I just wanna hear from our panelists,
and I'll go first just to take the scariness out of it.
What the one or two things are
that you're most excited about from an AI perspective
in the coming year.
And I'll start, I mean,
I think if we look at the market,
I think we've been in what's sort of called,
what I call the middle miles of AI,
where the excitement is sort of given way to this
how do we make this real and drive real business value?
And for me at least, you're starting to see
that on the consumer side with agentic AI in some ways
and on a B2B perspective, in the back office,
this is getting real, right?
In advertising, this is getting real.
And I think 12 months from now, it's gonna be,
the business value will be much more proven out.
So that's what I'm excited about.
Paul?
<v ->Yeah, I mean, there's so many different angles</v>
in which to attack the service, right?
<v ->You can do it however you want.</v>
<v ->Like, I mean, I love the advances</v>
that could be made in medical technology.
That seems fascinating, right?
<v ->Incredible.</v>
<v ->The ability to enhance story</v>
and storytelling, the ability to drive consumer value
in the amount of time we search for content, right?
All these things are absolutely exciting.
Honestly, I think the thing that keeps me up awake
at night a little bit about it at the same time is, like,
how do we also understand our value add
as humans in this process?
And think about that as well.
And these models are,
it's great input in great,
creates great output, right?
So how do you think about your value add
in the ecosystem as the human
in this environment?
<v ->Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>
<v ->Yeah, absolutely, Paul.</v>
There's so many things to be excited about.
I'm from TV and so are you, Haohong,
so of course,
the thing that I'm most excited about is
what we just announced with TCL,
which we're launching along with TCL
and always on TV with a far field microphone.
So right from your living room,
you can ask Gemini any question that you always wanted to.
Imagine sitting with your child
and they're asking you,
"Hey, tell me more about the solar system."
And you don't have a clue.
And you just asked Gemini right in the living room.
And not only do you get a response, you also get videos.
It's all multimodal.
I think it's just gonna change the nature
of how we engage on our TVs with our families.
And that's really what I'm the most excited about.
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->I feel like I agree.</v>
Sorry.
<v ->By the way, it is demoing at the TCL booth.</v>
<v ->Is it?</v>
We'll head there right now.
<v ->Let's take a look.</v>
<v ->It's nice.</v>
<v ->Sorry.</v>
<v ->Please.</v>
I feel like this reminds me of is any,
maybe we're all at this age,
does anyone remember gonna Disney World
and seeing the thing where, like, they were in space
and talking on FaceTime with people on earth?
I don't know if anybody remembers that.
And that exhibit probably went away a really long time ago.
But honestly, I feel like we're in the precipice right now
of AI being almost like it's our imagination,
which is going to help us understand all the different ways
that this technology,
I think, will advance every facet of our lives.
I kind of liken, maybe this is cheesy,
but I liken it a little bit too, you know,
us all having now supercomputers in our pockets,
which we didn't have 25 years ago,
and how that has fundamentally changed every single thing
that we do and every single way that we behave.
So maybe that's not the best answer
'cause it's way, way, way too big.
But that's sort of how I look at the universe.
When I put my TV and media hat on,
the part that gets me really excited is the fact
that we can bring so many more stories to life.
So one of the things we've always done is observed,
you know, how much content is coming out
from how many different places
and, you know, can everybody remember what their,
the favorite thing they watched last year
versus the favorite thing they're gonna watch this year?
And the fact that now every person can be creative
in their own unique ways, means platforms
that are video-centric are gonna bring new stories
to life in a way that is unprecedented,
I think is what we'll see.
<v ->100%</v>
<v ->Yeah, from my perspective, you know,</v>
Very long year, okay?
<v ->For all of us.</v>
<v ->Since last February,</v>
once the OpenAI,
they announced Sora, right?
So opens everybody's eyes, say, "Wow,
every people can be a filmmaker tomorrow."
Of course, it's not true.
But the point is that people has a very high expectation
for this video generation era.
Of course, Google has a good announcement
of Veo 2, which is great.
But my point is that during this 10 month,
so many companies, so many tools, Runway, Kling,
a lot of tools coming out, maybe 20 to 50 different tools
in that area.
Today, we don't know who eventually will be best.
Maybe no best, but all of them work together
to facilitate this capability about AI filmmaking.
That's why I believe that in 12 months,
we should be able to see a long form, you know,
AI generative film,
like 90 minutes maybe theatrical film in 12 months.
I foresee that
and at this moment, the TCL TV+ is the first
to try this AI content on the streaming services.
I believe more
and more streaming services will join us into adoption more
and more AI content in their streaming services.
<v ->That's spot on.</v>
Haohong, Anjali, Shalini, Paul, thank you.
Great discussion.
<v Anjali>Thank you.</v>
<v ->And to our audience...</v>
<v Shalini>Thank you.</v>
<v ->Thanks for being here</v>
and have a great rest of CES.
<v ->Thank you.</v>
