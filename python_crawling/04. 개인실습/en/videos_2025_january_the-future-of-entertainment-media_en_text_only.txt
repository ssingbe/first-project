- Hello, hello, hello.
Welcome back to the AI House.
I would like to encourage everybody,
if you're coming in the
house, come on in the house.
There are plenty of seats in the middle.
I wanna encourage you
to find seats closer,
if that is your thing.
But you know how in the middle of the day,
sometimes the energy
wanes just a little bit.
You all know that?
Well, not in this house.
The energy is high,
we're going to keep the energy high,
and our next panel is sure to be amazing.
And so I have another question for you.
Lately, in this age of AI,
where everybody is all
of a sudden an AI expert.
It grinds my gears
when I see, let's say, supermodels,
who all of a sudden are now AI experts.
Have you all seen something
similar out in the landscape?
I see heads nodding yes.
Well, guess what?
Supermodels should not be AI experts.
But what if your AI expert
looked like a supermodel?
Would that make a difference?
Well, guess what?
We're gonna introduce
the supermodel of AI.
Let me tell you a little bit about her,
because she's moderating our next panel.
Tiarne Hawkins, do you see
this beautiful specimen?
She is the founder of You &amp; AI.
seven years focused on AI,
supporting AI innovation
with global tech leaders
like Amazon, Google, Meta, OpenAI,
and top enterprises all around the globe,
specializing in AI enablement,
and optimizing training data pipelines
for well-known AI applications.
Tiarne is also a passionate advocate
for AI's responsible,
let me say that again,
responsible use,
focusing on AI for good, AI safety,
and its positive societal impact.
It's just you, Tiarne and AI.
Let's go.
- A little hard to live down.
Hi everyone, my name's Tiarne Hawkins,
and I am your host and
moderator of today's epic panel.
We're gonna be discussing
how artificial intelligence
is reshaping entertainment,
but with that, don't
just take my word for it.
I want to introduce our panel,
with Brooke Siegel from Yahoo,
please come up to the stage.
Steven Keller from SiriusXM Media,
H.B. Siegel,
who's been Amazon, Pixar,
Waterfront, Silicon Graphics,
and of course, Eric Pace,
from Cox Communications.
So, let's begin, huh?
We only have 37 minutes
left to go, (laughs)
'cause of that wild introduction.
Thank you, my love.
Would each of you introduce yourselves,
your experience in the AI space,
and just a brief overview of who you are
and what you're doing today?
- I'll kick it off.
Hi, I'm Brooke Siegel.
I am the VP of content at Yahoo News.
In that role, I oversee
the curation of our content
from our vast network of publishers,
our original content team,
which creates editorial
across all platforms
and our commerce team.
Previously I was at
Hearst Magazines media,
helping with the transformation
from print to digital.
And, did you ask my interest in AI?
- Yeah, let's go for it all.
- So I mean, I don't know,
I think I am deeply
interested and obsessed,
but also it is foisted upon me in not...
I've always worked at the
intersection of content
and how it's consumed.
AI is going to be very much
a part of that in the future,
and I want to embrace it.
It's part of the reason
I wanted to join Yahoo
because of the incredible
opportunity to utilize technology
and media that not all
publishers have access to.
- Love it. Steve?
- I'm Steve Keller.
I'm the Sonic Strategy
Director at Studio Resonate.
Studio Resonate is an in-house,
audio first creative agency
under the SiriusXM umbrella.
So I work with brands that advertise
on all of our platforms.
When I tell people my title,
Sonic Strategy Director,
usually two things happen.
The first is, "It's a pretty
cool title," which it is,
but then the next thing I hear is,
"But what the hell do you do?"
And so the easiest way I've come up
with describing my job is to say,
"I'm in the business of
taking sound science,
blending it with sound art,
to help our partners and
clients make sound decisions."
So on the AI front,
I'm definitely interested
in the application,
a little less on the operational side,
and more on how we might incorporate it
into creative workflows.
But given my background and
my training in psychology
and the behavioral sciences,
I'm even more concerned with
the implications of using AI
and the impact on culture,
diversity, community.
And so this is a fascinating time
to be part of such quick
changes in the world.
And I'm learning as I go,
as most of us are, I think.
- [Tiarne] Yeah, like we all are. H.B.
- Hi everybody, thank you for hosting us.
My name is H.B. Siegel.
I started on the very early days at Pixar
when it was first formed,
and I had a chance to work
at some notable companies
and Wavefront,
which developed an animation
system called Maya,
which I was at the beginning of.
And then Industrial Light &amp; Magic
as Chief Technology Officer,
where I got to work on
"Star Wars," "Men in Black,"
"Jurassic Park," "Schindler's List,"
and some less notable films.
Most recently, I was at Amazon,
where I ran a group called
the Department of Ideas,
and we actually developed
crazy new innovative ideas
and shared them,
and hopefully some of them,
you know, became big things
that will be exposed in years to come.
And as far as my current interest in AI,
I'm really fascinated by its
intersection with storytelling
and ideation and creativity
in what roles it can play
as a partner to humans,
and hopefully that's some of the things
we'll talk about.
- Great. Eric?
- Hey, everybody. My name's Eric Pace.
I am working at Cox Communications today,
and I am the head of AI there.
I spent many years in
Big Five, consulting,
prior to joining Cox Communications,
and then made the shift into industry
where I really had the chance
to get to own a lot of the ideas
and things that we were putting together.
And then about 60 days ago,
the company decided that we
were gonna put a lot more focus
in the AI space,
and we created a dedicated organization
to the spectrum of governance
to implementation for AI.
And in the career, you
know, through consulting
and a lot of the work that
we've done at Cox today,
there's nothing more disruptive
than what AI is doing right now,
and I have spent my career
infatuated with the disruptive nature
of whatever we can get our hands on.
And now I feel like I'm
in the greatest playground
of all time.
- Yeah, absolutely.
So all of the audience
needs to participate
in this next.
Yeah, I'm also gonna ask you
some difficult questions.
I asked ChatGPT to form the best question
to ask you all, which AI
experience you would prefer?
Imagine this, it's Sunday afternoon,
you are sitting down to
watch a movie or play a game,
which would you prefer?
An AI generated movie plot
that adapts in real time
based on your preferences?
A personalized character, again,
that has the ability to
bond with you uniquely.
An AI driven soundtrack
that has the ability to change sound
based on your mood or your preferences.
Or lastly, a fully interactive movie
where you can pick the story narrative.
A show of hands, who would prefer
an AI generated movie plot?
Any hands? One person.
Okay, two. All right.
What about personalized characters?
Okay. Wow.
Didn't expect that.
AI soundtrack, personalized music.
Woo! All right.
And what about a fully interactive movie
where the film adjusts along the way?
Oh, two. Double hand.
Okay, girl! I see you.
Okay, so enough about that.
Thanks for participating,
I really appreciate it.
I wanna get into our first question
from each of your point of view,
how do you see AI changing the
shape of media, entertainment
and news for consumption
for consumers today?
- Yeah, I don't mind starting,
given that, you know,
the role that we play
at Cox Communications, I think,
is foundational and spectacular,
primarily because we're the
service provider network
that allows content providers,
creators, et cetera,
to get their services, their creations,
into the hands of our customers.
And so we have spent,
the last couple of years in particular,
once we saw the surge of
internet usage really,
and the consumption rise during COVID,
we spent the last couple of years
really infusing a lot of AI capabilities
into the network that we put in place
so that our customers can
experience all of the things
that media and entertainment
ultimately delivers.
And I think about that in three ways.
There's the core network
that ultimately delivers our services,
that has to have a ton of
intelligence built into it
just relative to the amount
of data that we process,
and how much we have to ensure
that the reliability of that network
is at a level in which you can experience
seamless entertainment.
And then all the way into
the second part of it,
which is in your home.
Because once our network hits your house,
then we don't have full control,
but we have to be responsible
for how the performance of the network
or our internet in the home works as well.
And the data that we can
get off of the devices
just relative to performance
and signal strength
also will benefit greatly
from AI's introduction
with our ability to process
a magnificent amount of data.
And then I'd say lastly,
in terms of the actual customer experience
and looking at customer preferences
and thinking about a
customer lifecycle in which,
from, you know, prospecting
in a learn phase,
all the way through pay and serve.
Our job really is to go
find all of the places
in the customer lifecycle
that we can apply AI
to expedite the customer's experience,
back to the point that they
want to spend their time in,
which is using or interacting
with the actual content.
So there's a whole host
of opportunity out there
relative to where we can put AI.
And again, going back to the
excitement, waking up every day
and having to choose where
we're gonna spend our time,
given its endless at the
moment, is super exciting.
- Yeah, kind of riff on that a little bit,
actually, just a call back
to your initial question.
- Yeah.
- I don't think I want the AIs
to adjust their stories
to me in real time.
I want to see bold,
interesting, unexpected stories
that surprise me.
And that's why I'm such a fan
of the South Korean movie industry
because they just don't care.
They will take that story anywhere.
They'll kill off the characters
and the main character in the first scene,
if that's what they need to do.
And, you know, I would like our industry,
our Hollywood industry, to
accept some of that boldness
and maybe AI can help bring that to us.
Regarding what you just posed to us,
I think back to early days
and watching John Lasseter
interview people at Pixar
to become animators,
and people would submit
portfolios and ideas,
talking, "I know how to use this tool,
I know how to use this tool."
And he would say like,
"You can submit a portfolio
with chalk and line drawings and pen,
and we don't care about
what tools you can use
because we can't teach
you to be an artist,
but we can teach you
how to use the tools."
And so I see people even
today applying for jobs,
filling their portfolio with
a list of names of tools,
and that's really not the way to go.
You have to convince them you actually
have a interior art skill
and have that skill.
So when I think about that, I want...
I think these tools are
gonna be enormously enabling
for people to make a
variety of very beautiful,
very mediocre assets,
and there's gonna be a lot of them.
So we're gonna be swimming
in this sea of candy
of not very nutritious
content for a while.
And maybe the AI will be helpful
in even sorting that out as well.
- Yeah, I like that. Steve?
- Just to-
- Yeah, please.
- Build on that,
I think that's why at Yahoo News,
it's so important that it's AI
and editors working together
to find that balance,
to make sure that the content
is exceptional as it can be,
and I think that partnership,
that is going to enable us
to really personalize the content
in a way that's not just, you know,
you talk about the empty...
I don't know if you
called it empty calories,
I'm gonna call it empty calories,
or like the candy that you could feed
and you do, you wanna give
the people what they want,
but sometimes that is
gonna be empty calories.
And you need to balance that,
that need to know and what to know, right?
Like what you wanna know
might be the empty calories,
but then you have the
editorial perspective
layered on top of that,
that is gonna give you
what's happening in the world
and what's important.
And you really need the balance
and the marriage of those two.
- When I think in my world, in audio,
I mean AI has been a
part of it for a while.
If you think of the
digital streaming services
that use AI as part of playlists,
Pandora was one of the first ones
with the music genome to use that.
But as we get into generative AI
and even more personalization,
I do think that's a
double-edged sword too.
To your point, if the
AI is always feeding us
things that we like,
how do we discover anything really new.
In the news, more and more
we're having AI voices
that are reading the news,
and studies that are now showing
that you're more cognitively engaged
with a human voice with news,
than an AI voice.
- Okay.
- Which means more
disinformation can happen
when you're not as engaged.
But the last place for me
that's more interesting,
is how AI can help us use sound
in ways that really benefit our lives
in health and wellness technologies
that doctors can use to
prescribe a playlist,
as opposed to just prescribing pharma,
and ways that AI can kind of tailor sounds
depending on moods that can
be really beneficial that way.
So I think those are
fascinating developments
that we're just starting to touch.
- You know, sorry, in
this space in particular,
you can't help but think
that in today's world
we treat hallucination
with the models as a four letter word,
but when it comes to entertainment,
hallucination can become
unexpected creativity,
that produces things we never expected,
and it becomes less
than a four letter word
and more of a, you know,
a true creative partner
that you never thought you had.
- A lot of music was
composed with hallucination.
So maybe it's just a
little more LSD in our AI
and, you know, maybe it's a good thing.
- Yeah, I did a report on audio illusions.
It's a very interesting thing,
but I'm actually really
hung up on the idea
that the doctor might prescribe you
every morning or something.
Is that prescribed music? Yeah, so.
- Okay, so not that we wanna
start talking about LSD
and music hallucinations,
though that could be a really
entertaining company idea
around a musical hallucination company.
Choose your own adventure.
Steven, you kind of touched
on this a little bit earlier,
and so I'm gonna skip the
first part of your question.
I'm gonna go straight to,
is there a potential for AI
to create entirely new audio
experiences for listeners?
If so, what does that look like?
- Yeah, I think, you know, as humans,
sometimes we're not aware of the impact
that sound has on our perception.
And so one area of research
that I've been involved a lot
is this idea of cross modal science,
where our senses can be combined
and one sense can hack another,
playing with things like,
can I change your perception of how bitter
or sweet a piece of chocolate tastes
depending on what we're
putting in your ears.
And so thinking about a connected home
where AI may be able to adjust to volume,
to mood, things where it could be designed
to know who's at home, what's
appropriate content to hear,
there's all kinds of fascinating ways,
I think that in terms of
our consumption habits,
AI can feed into it.
Again, that's a two-edged sword,
'cause I could also
argue on the other side
that maybe that personalization
and that kind of playing with our biases
to move us in a particular direction
could be used for for evil, so.
- Can AI be used to change my lettuce
to taste like chocolate? (laughs)
- No.
- Please? Ah, okay.
Damn it.
Brooke, Yahoo News is known
for delivering timely,
accurate news.
How is AI changing the
way news is curated,
reported and consumed?
- I mean, it's such a big question.
I feel like I could spend
the next 20 minutes on it,
but I will keep it brief.
One of the ways, and it's not
necessarily the most sexy,
that I am really embracing AI,
is using it to free up editors
to work on more impactful,
creative content.
So things like, that we
don't wanna think about,
metadata and tagging, like
things that can be taken over
and off their plate,
so that they can be creating
more engaging content.
So that's very exciting for me.
I think also, you know,
we have such a vast sea of publishers,
we're talking about like
where the line of personalization is.
I think it gives us the opportunity
to surface more diverse
publishers from our ecosystem
so that we're giving
visibility to publishers
that they might not have gotten otherwise.
Another piece that I'm really...
I mean, like I said,
I could keep going on, but
that I'm really excited about
is just, you know, our key takeaways
that are on top of articles
where you could generate
an AI summary of the story.
What makes that distinct on Yahoo
is that the content in that takeaway
only comes from the article itself.
It is a feature
that was rigorously tested,
the same way we rigorously
vet our publishers
so that we could be
assured it has journalism
that we all feel good
about and are proud of.
And what has been surprising,
it's been not surprising,
but exciting, a win-win-win for us,
for the publishers and for the reader.
People that read those summaries
tend to spend more time on the article
and they read deeper and engage more.
So I just, I feel like the
opportunities are endless
and we're excited to
continue to watch it evolve.
- Wow, super exciting. Thank you.
Eric, Cox Communications delivers content
and services to millions of users.
How are you seeing AI change your industry
and what does it mean to your customers?
- Yeah, I mean, I think there's
probably not a lot of...
I think there's a lot
of use of AI even today
that people don't realize is AI, right?
And so, you know, today
in all of our homes,
our customers are using voice remotes
to access the content that they want.
In a lot of ways, our products
and services are the gateway
to the content that, you know,
our customers are looking to
consume, that you guys provide.
And I even think about
where we're going in the future
relative to what we're gonna
have to start looking after,
like Steve was just talking about,
a smart home that has become even smarter
than what you think of it today,
but the importance of
a lot of what you see
around the floor even today at CES,
around, you know, why
models are getting smaller
and why they're, you know, coming up
with things like on-device AI.
Well, in those scenarios, you
want your home to be smart.
You want those models to run
locally on those devices,
because you don't want the
data that it's collecting
and using sent somewhere else.
And so, you know, there's a lot
that I think is coming in the future
relative to how you interact
with our devices today, right?
Today I use my remote
to do a voice search,
but it's very keyword based, right?
In the future, it'll
be very semantic based,
and when you pair that with
some of the personalization
that comes in the future,
you'll be able to ask it for,
you know, horror movies
that are appropriate
for your 16-year-old,
that maybe don't have a lot of, you know,
certain types of scenes
in them, et cetera.
And then if we get to a point
where the content itself
is tailored personally, maybe, you know,
you can tell it to avoid
showing me the things
that I don't wanna see
in those movies also.
But all of that has to be tailored
through the gateway
that we provide, right?
Whether it's the set top box,
whether it's the smart
home panel, et cetera.
- Yeah, I love that.
H.B, you have been in
the storytelling arena
for such a long time.
Talk me through how AI is
transforming storytelling
from your personal opinion.
- Sure, I can talk a little bit
briefly about the historical perspective
of some of my current projects.
One that I really was interested in
when I first had access to some
of these more powerful tools
was content creation
and game creation with AIs.
And I started on this process
of designing my own game with it
in a collaborative session with ChatGPT.
And what became fascinating
to me was, it was, so...
First of all, it was so amnesiac
it would forget about what
we were talking about a lot.
So, but once I feel like I conquered that,
it was so interested in
participating in all aspects
of this game creation process,
even when I tried to like
hammer it down in some area,
like for instance,
I would actually have it design some parts
of the game engine and it
would start to get that right
and then I'd say, well now
let's walk through this scene
that I've created, this world,
and it would start to edit the world
and adjust it as I was trying
to debug the game engine part.
And I kept correcting it
and I realized, you know, maybe
I'm fighting uphill on this.
Maybe the act of...
Maybe I'm thinking about content creation
and engine creation in a too rigid way
and maybe AI foretell way of interacting
with categories of jobs
that don't even exist today.
- Fascinating.
- And maybe I'm just seeing
the beginning of that with
this personal scenario.
- Yeah, that's absolutely fascinating.
Steve, back to you again.
We'd love to understand
how you think AI is gonna
change recommendation engines.
You touched on it a
little bit before, around,
if you're always being
served the same thing
over and over and over again,
will you experience things
outside of what an engine's recommending?
So what is the right balance in that
and how do you foresee that unfolding?
- I mean, I think that the AI potentially
would be smart enough that
if you begin to prompt it
for, you know, I want
to hear something new
that I haven't heard-
- Yeah.
- Before, and in a particular genre.
I think that the
opportunity for it to work
as a discovery engine is there.
The question is whether we as humans
would tap into that as much,
or would we just be lazy,
taking in what it serves us,
because we like things that are familiar.
- Yeah.
- And so, again,
I think there's this delicate balance
between what the AI is capable of,
but in terms of our
humanity and our behavior,
how that's gonna be shaped in the process,
and I think that's the more
interesting question to me
that I don't see, you know,
we don't have enough research yet.
- [Tiarne] Yeah, we don't
have the answer to that.
- I think it is such
an important question,
and that in some sense we do have control
over what the algorithm is servicing.
So Yahoo, last spring bought Artifact,
and what's exciting about the algorithm
is how truly nuanced it is.
I am not an engineer, so I
always picture it like a DJ
for sound folks that like,
there's just knobs you could turn
and you could turn up discovery,
you could turn up what's new.
And I think that is a
tremendous responsibility
of finding that balance
so that you're surfacing not
just what people want to see,
but what they need to see or
should see or might excite
or interest them in ways
that they hadn't yet known.
- Well, and just to riff on that too,
part of the problem as well
is, who is delivering the AI
and what are their agendas?
Because then when we get
into a world where it's like,
okay, we're priming the AI to
give you this kind of content
because we know we're gonna
get this kind of a response
from you, you know?
And again, it's a loop
that we can very easily get into.
- Yeah, there might be
conflicting interest
between those multiple
parties about what we want
that person to hear.
- Yeah.
- I mean, you may even
get into a place where,
you know, given the race
to organize your data
as an important factor
of how you go accomplish
all of this AI stuff.
Like, we're never gonna get to a point
where we organize all of the
world's data so perfectly,
and then what happens is,
we're gonna continue to leverage AI
to sift through the unstructured data
that's out there at the
scale and speed that it can.
And the challenges is,
you don't know what's in
your unstructured data.
And so you've gotta be real careful about,
you know, what it's
ultimately going to serve up.
So that layer of responsibility
becomes super important.
- Well, data's also biased,
so we know that, right?
It's a point of view.
Talking about bias.
That leads me to our next question,
and I would love to take the
opportunity to ask you, Brooke,
how do you ensure that AI
tools that are being used,
maintain journalistic integrity
and avoid some of the biases,
from your personal opinion?
- I mean, first, it is that
balance between AI and editors.
I think you need human involvement,
that you need to find the balance.
You can't just let the AI run the show.
One of the advantages
we have at Yahoo News
is because we have such a vast
array of premium publishers,
in terms of bias, we have
almost every perspective
on every topic that you could think of.
So then it's up to an editor
to curate the various perspectives
so that you're not seeing
it through just one lens.
But I think it's just something
that you have to have rigor around.
And to go back to, you know,
who's in control of that.
Like, you have to make it a priority
for how you're using it.
And it's a responsibility,
especially in news,
and one Yahoo News has
taken incredibly seriously.
- It's gonna be a real challenge.
It's not too bad now,
before the world of AGI,
general intelligence.
It's not as clear about how
you manage intelligences
that are 10 or a hundred
or a thousand times
smarter than you are,
and we'll see how that all plays out.
- Eric, coming for you next,
where do you see some
of the inherent biases
in your world of delivering
content and services?
What are some of the risk and concerns
that keep you up at night?
- Yeah, I think the
risks are just inherent
in the unknown nature
of what all of these things can do.
And ultimately, with the ubiquitous access
that people have to AI inside
our company and outside,
you just never know what's gonna happen,
and so I feel like we...
We thankfully took a step
a year and a half ago or so
in terms of one of our first initiatives
was to put in place some
responsible AI practices,
and I've heard a lot about that today.
The last panel was all about
scaling responsible AI,
which I love.
And you know, core tenets of everything
that we do ensure that the AI that we use
or the AI that we create
ultimately falls under four principles.
It it has to be governed,
it has to be harmless,
it has to be secure and
it has to be monitored.
- Yeah.
- And if you don't do
any of those four things,
plus the whole host of other things,
then you can't do it,
because the risks are too
great relative to, you know,
not the necessary probability
of something happening,
because all it has to happen is once.
- Yeah.
- And that's it.
- Yeah, I love that.
H.B, I wanted to talk a little bit
about maintaining the
right creative balance
between humans and machine.
As a storyteller, how do
you see that playing out?
How do we ensure that if
we do go down the road
of hyper personalized content, story,
how do we keep humans involved in that?
What is your thoughts on that?
- Where we are today
and where we've been for several years,
especially during the days
I was very heavily involved with CGI, was,
the AI will be extraordinary
at relatively repetitive tools
like helping with motion capture,
wire removal, script
support and things that,
you know, in terms of, you know,
you take a series like "Game of Thrones"
with hundreds of characters,
you know, and they forget
that they killed off somebody
in scene, you know, three, episode four,
and then two months later they want him
to say something to somebody else.
Now the AI can prompt you,
"No, we killed that person off."
So that doesn't sound
like a real world case,
but it could very well.
So, I think it's gonna be like having
an extraordinarily talented intern.
- Yeah.
- I saw something,
I saw a story where they
helped one of the people
cleaning in the restaurant,
they asked her if she'd
help like slice up potatoes.
And turned out she was an amazing chef,
that she had moved here
from another country
and she transformed that restaurant.
And what we're gonna find with the AI is,
it's gonna be better and
better at some of these things
that we don't think it's
capable of and it's gonna shine.
Now the question is,
right now where we are
today, these stories,
clearly, you see they don't have
as much emotional intelligence
or depth or human...
AI's haven't experienced, you know,
human pains and wisdom.
So they don't have life experiences
to be able to tell these things.
But the question is,
are we gonna be able to distinguish them
in the years going forward?
And we're not gonna know
them when we see them.
We're gonna know the ones that are poor,
but are we even gonna recognize
the ones that are good?
- Yeah.
- My partner
is a notable plastic surgeon,
and you know, people can see
not good plastic surgery,
but really good plastic
surgery is beautiful.
It's flawless, like,
you can't see anything.
So are we gonna see the same
thing with storytelling,
where the story is gonna
have real depth and beauty
and we just won't know what
role AI played in those?
- The question is, how would
you feel in the audience
if you were interacting with
a fully generated AI story
you didn't know?
Would that make you feel good, bad,
if you had time to really think about...
Does it need to be announced
that you're interacting
with an AI driven...
Show of hands actually,
who is in the camp of AI,
you need to interact with something
and you need to know that it's
AI versus you wouldn't, okay.
And what about AI not making itself known
and you wouldn't mind.
Okay, so the majority still.
It's really good to see,
I always like to get
audience participation,
so just know that, if you're
coming to one of my talks.
- I mean, I do think that right now
AI doesn't have taste, and-
- Neither do a lot of humans.
- Yes, that's true,
but like, that's why when
we're building a team,
I'm looking for someone with
strong editorial judgment.
AI could not tell you who was
best dressed at the Globes,
that was Zendaya, and you...
And so I think that's why
it's the importance of,
you know, in any storytelling,
having that editorial judgment layered on,
I think it will continue to evolve
and we'll need to evolve with it,
but right now, I feel like
we could still sniff it out.
- So let's stay on that for a second,
'cause one of your questions
is around looking ahead
and seeing how AI will
evolve in your industry.
What are some of your
thoughts around that?
- I mean, I would've had one answer
before like walking the floor,
and now like my brain is kind of...
I'm like, we're gonna have robot dogs
that will deliver your newspaper.
I think voice is really,
really interesting.
I think it's interesting
what you said about...
That people don't enjoy
interacting with an AI voice.
I'm chatting with ChatGPT all day.
I think that if that was a
conversation that was out loud,
I mean, not to like,
I feel like everyone's always like,
"And my kid..."
But my Gen Alpha kid, like
anytime he's talking to a phone,
it's always through voice.
I don't know if he could type or spell,
but that's a story for another time.
So I do think that the interface
in which we engage with news,
like you were talking about,
did the "Game of Thrones" character die?
You know, is being able to
ask questions about the news
and get responses
and be able to go deeper
in the way that you would with search,
I think will be, you know,
an interesting evolution.
- Yeah.
- I mean, my child is
growing up in a world
and I watch her interact with things
that aren't voice enabled today,
and she is genuinely surprised
when it doesn't respond
when she asks it a question.
She's like, "Dad, this thing's broken."
I'm like, "No, that just doesn't do that."
- Do you know the
changing point for me was,
I travel a lot for work
and Alexa's in my house,
and when I come home,
I normally get scared
turning on the lights.
Like clearly no one's in my building,
clearly no one's in my apartment,
but there's that one moment
when you open the door
and you're like, "Hello,
is anybody there?"
And for me, Alexa is just,
"Hey Alexa, like I'm home.
Turn the lights on," whatever it may be,
Alexa lights on and-
- You just turned the lights on.
- Anyway, device triggers.
But that was the moment I realized,
because I felt not afraid,
that I had already formed
some sort of attachment
or feeling,
to feeling like there was someone with me,
even though it wasn't a someone,
and that's a device that doesn't have
conversational application
where I can talk back and
forth for long periods of time.
So Steven, what are you
seeing next in the field?
What are you most excited about?
- Well, I think that there's some
real interesting opportunities
for applications.
Like let's say if I'm listening
to a Neil deGrasse Tyson podcast
and he's talking about wormholes
and I want to know more,
I can say, "Hey Neil, tell
me more about wormholes."
And he can have a cloned voice
that will then kind of give
me more information, you know?
I think that's a really
interesting application.
I think, again, this world of healthcare
is fascinating to me.
I think there are some really interesting
developments there.
And also automotive.
I mean, keep your eye on automotive,
'cause I think that's where
the really interesting tech
is being developed.
You have automobiles that they're creating
more and more immersive environments
as we get closer to self-driving.
The vehicle isn't just
about transportation,
it can be about entertainment,
it can be about work,
it can be about relaxation,
and all the different ways
that even now vehicles are using sound.
Knowing from biometric data,
what kind of mood you're
in, tailoring things.
If it senses you are getting
ready to fall asleep,
there can be an audio component for that.
If you're experiencing motion sickness,
I mean we already have this,
we have a soundscape that can
counteract motion sickness.
- Yeah.
- So I think
those kinds of things are
really fascinating to me.
Probably more so than listening
to music in the background,
'cause I'd rather just grab a vinyl album
and put it on the turntable.
- Yeah, that's fascinating.
I'd like an interactive book.
You know, when you read a book
from your favorite author,
there's certain chapters
you wanna spend more time in, you know?
And there's certain chapters
you'd just rather skip. (laughs)
H.B, what about yourself?
Where do you see the future?
- Well, notwithstanding a couple
of decades of making movies
with really terrible endings
related to humanoid
robots in and around us.
If you set that aside for a moment,
that's I think what
I'm most excited about,
seeing these agile,
humanoid robots in the house
that somebody can buy,
will just transform society
in ways that we can't even imagine.
You know, age tech.
Having a robot that can help, you know,
bring you to the bathroom,
you know, do some light cooking,
drive you somewhere in a conventional car.
You don't need a, you know,
a special car to do it.
Go up and down the
stairs, carry, lifting...
It's gonna be just tremendous
for how the world will change
with that being readily
available and priced well.
I'm fascinated by a lot of the same ones
that you guys have mentioned as well.
I think the tedium of
kind of the min maxing
that people like to do,
like just planning efficient
flights and travel,
things that travel agents might
have done for us in the past
that we've now given up
and we don't even know.
And there's a whole generation
that doesn't even know that
that even existed, you know?
We will be able to have again.
- Yeah.
- And it'll work and it'll
follow your patterns.
It'll min max the way
you want it to be done,
for what you're trying to optimize.
- Recipes for dinner, I like AI for that.
- Just cooking the dinner.
- My partner and I have this foodie diet.
So we roll, there's five dice,
it gives you the ingredients.
We can go to AI and say, "Gimme
a three course French meal
that I can cook at home,
and a bottle of wine
with these ingredients."
And it does a really good job.
And the recipes-
- And it will give you
an appropriate soundtrack to your cooking.
- Yes, it will do that as well.
- I had it basically inventing...
I had it inventing cocktails on the fly.
- Yes.
- And I would make
whatever it told me to make,
and it seemed good.
- Your partner walks in
and you're in a bad mood.
They just know it's like,
dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,
as they get closer to
you, you're in trouble.
What about yourself, Steven?
- Yeah, I'll keep it brief
given the clock is ticking here, right?
I think I am enjoying very much the fact
that the world is redefining
the term personalization.
- Yeah.
- And I love the fact
that we have a prime opportunity
to sit in the middle of
how we ultimately market
and communicate to our customers,
how they consume content
in terms of media and entertainment,
and how we deliver those
services to them in the home.
Making that triangle as
seamless as possible,
ultimately has to be done
because it's gonna be an expectation.
But leveraging all of these
things that, you know,
come out every day that you
didn't know existed 12 hours ago
is the most exciting thing that
I think sits in front of us,
and it's what gets me
outta bed every morning
and running to the office.
- Yeah.
Yeah, I think personalization
is quite interesting,
and I know we're pretty much outta time,
because we've put people
in categories, right?
For quite so long, personas.
One more person comes to me
with persona marketing
architecture, I will freak out.
But I think we've got the opportunity
to go so much further past that,
so much deeper into the human experience
and create things that
are destined for that.
- Everything will be a segment of one.
- Yeah, absolutely.
So listen, everybody please
follow these amazing speakers.
Not only are they pioneering the space,
but they are just a wealth of knowledge.
Thank you for joining our session.
Thank you to our MCs who are amazing,
and thank you to Modev
for hosting us today.
We truly appreciate the
opportunity to speak to all.
Enjoy CES.
- Thank you.
- [MC] Let's give them
a round of applause.
