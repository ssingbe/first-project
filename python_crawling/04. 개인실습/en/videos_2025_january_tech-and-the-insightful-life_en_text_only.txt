<v Lori>How's everybody doing?</v>
We're getting ready to just start.
For those of you in the back,
this is like an intimate session, so don't be afraid.
There's actually keys to a Chevy taped
to the bottom of one of these chairs.
So if you guys come on up closer,
we're very attractive people also.
I think if you see us closer,
'cause I know a couple of you
in the back are very nearsighted,
so come closer 'cause we're gonna have
a really fun discussion.
We're gonna show some examples.
So I'd love to see all of you up here.
So my name is Lori H. Schwartz.
I'm gonna be your moderator for this panel.
This is actually the last session
of the Tech to Lead a Better Life, to lead a good life.
And we're very excited to wrap it up
with some insights about really interesting technology
that is going to change how we live
and how it's all coming together.
Have any of you had a chance to walk the Venetian at all?
The Venetian Expo? It's absolutely fascinating this year.
I'm privileged enough through my company, StoryTech,
to provide show floor tours for CES.
And so, I've been on that floor
a lot the last couple of days
and one of the most exciting things is the decision
for CTA to literally move digital health
and wellness to the Venetian
where there was all this lifestyle tech.
And so, now, what we have on
that Venetian floor is not just a series
of products all over the place,
but it's really a whole expo dedicated
to how we're going to live.
And so, on this great panel, we're gonna really dig into it.
So to kick us off, I wanna introduce an old friend of mine,
Sandy Abrams, and she's gonna help us get
into the zone of thinking about all of this.
<v Sandy>That's right, thank you.</v>
Yeah, this is gonna be an amazing conversation
about the importance of measuring
and understanding key biomarkers for our well-being.
And I'm here to share just about two minutes
of breath practice with you
because breath is a really powerful modality for wellness
to help you improve things like stress
and lower your blood pressure,
improve your heart rate variability
to sleep better and improve your cognition.
So I'm gonna share three breath practices
that will help you calm and relax your nervous system.
So let's begin by getting comfortable
in your chairs and closing your eyes.
When was the last time you closed your eyes during the day?
Notice how luxurious this can just feel on its own.
And the first breath practice that we're going to do,
I'll explain it, so you can keep your eyes closed
if you'd like, is called a physiological sigh.
It's the fastest way to calm your nervous system,
and it's two parts on the inhale through your nose.
The first part, you fill up your lungs about three quarters
of the way full, and then the second part,
you just completely fill your lungs
and then the exhale (breathes) through your mouth.
We'll do two of these together. It sounds like this.
And that's something you can do anywhere, anytime.
The second breath practice
is called humming or buzzing breath.
And this activates your vagus nerve,
the V-A-G-U-S nerve which is responsible
for relaxing your nervous system.
And humming or bumblebee breath sounds like this.
Again, you'll be inhaling through your nose (inhales)
and on the entire exhale you make a humming, buzzing sound
for the entire length of your exhale.
Let's just do one of these together.
Slowly inhale (inhales) through your nose and exhale.
Sometimes just one of those really feels like you hit
the jackpot for relaxation.
The third breath tool for calming your nervous system
that we're gonna do today is to make your exhales twice
as long as your inhales.
So let's take an inhale (inhales)
and exhale either through the nose or mouth,
making it feel about twice as long.
Slow, (exhales) exhale.
Let your shoulders come away from your ears.
We'll do two of these, inhaling.
Even smile on the inhale,
it changes your biochemistry (inhales)
and lean into that slow, long exhale. (exhales)
One more of these at your own pace.
Inhale, (inhales) slowly exhale (exhales)
and again, take these practices home with you
because they can be done in small moments throughout the day
to help you relax your nervous system.
Thanks for breathing and enjoy the panel.
<v Ramses>Thank you.</v>
<v Lori>Let's have a calm hand for Sandy.</v>
That was great and I love that all of you did it.
Not that I was not having my eyes closed too.
Okay. (laughs)
All right, so I wanna do just a speed round
to introduce our speakers today who are each coming
with a very unique value prop on this concept.
And then we're gonna dig
in a little bit more to each of them.
So let's start with you, Thomas,
and just go down the line for a little speed intro.
<v ->So I'm Thomas Serval. I'm the CEO of Baracoda,</v>
and we focus on turning your bathroom into a primary point
of care by collecting data from a lot
of useful and usual devices.
<v Pranitha>Hi, everyone, Pranitha Patil.</v>
I am Co-Founder and COO of Function Health.
We are a all-in-one healthcare platform
that looks at comprehensive analysis of all
of your organs in your organ systems,
and I'll get into that in a little bit.
<v ->Hey, everybody. My name is Dr. Ramses Alcaide.</v>
I am the CEO of Neurable,
and we work on brain computer interfaces,
specifically to help track brain-related disease states.
Think of neurodegenerative diseases
or neurodiverse issues, but in everyday wearables
<v Lori>This is so exciting 'cause they're</v>
all collecting data in different ways.
So we're gonna really get into how significant this is.
So, Thomas, I know you wanna show us some slides
and dig in a little deeper.
And while Thomas is making his way up to the computer,
how many of you just, raise your hand,
are leveraging wearables
of some kind right now in your life?
Okay, great.
And then how many of you are leveraging connected solutions
in your home that are reporting back data on how you live?
One of you, okay.
And how many of you are making products
in this space right now?
Okay. And some of you are strategists or just,
or any of you in the medical profession?
Okay, any of you under felony investigation?
Okay, just checking. All right, Thomas, go ahead.
<v Ramses>We're just waiting for the clicker here.</v>
<v Thomas>So Baracoda started 10 years ago</v>
because my daughter was not brushing her teeth correctly,
and I invented a smart brush called, Kolibree,
which is humming bird.
So it resonates with her, last exercise we just done.
And we found a way to track
the way she was brushing her teeth.
So somehow one of the most insightful information,
how do your children do when they brush their teeth?
And we extended this, from this insight,
we extended our vision of if we could know what's happening
in everybody's bathroom
without jeopardizing anybody's privacy is such a great place
to collect the most valuable data about your health.
You spend on average one hour in your bathroom every day.
A mirror or a sensor are seeing you always
under the same angle which is a terrific data set,
and you will not bring many new devices.
Actually, 82% of the people are already bringing
their phone despite the privacy challenges.
So what we have been doing is trying
to wire correctly the bathroom.
So starting with the toothbrushes,
then we invented a smart bath mat,
then a smart screen which we call a smart mirror.
And then we turned it into a platform
which is the best way to collect data,
but also to add other devices to the ecosystem.
And we believe this is going
to be the future whether we want it or not.
And this vision has been proven true
because A, we were lucky to be 10 years in a row,
world winners at CES.
So at least the journalists like us,
but also, because we see adoption across the world
where there is not enough doctors
and practitioners of healthcare,
or you have a growing population of aging people
for which the first reason for them
to move out of their home is actually
that they can no longer use
their bathroom in the proper way.
So with this vision, I'm just trying to,
we try to build the underlying platform
that number one, we are European.
It's critical for us protect your data,
so it's privacy by design, otherwise it would be illegal.
There's a growing number of challenges
'cause in a bathroom, you have, in Asia,
three generation overlapping to each other.
In Europe and US, two generation, but basically,
their needs and interface should be different.
And so, platform by platform,
the first one which has direct impact on your health,
and we keep discovering new insights
is what's happening in your mouth.
I think above 80% of all the disease
are actually caught through your mouth.
So knowing what's going on in your mouth
is actually a great way to diagnose
or prevent a lot of things.
And also, know that with children,
proper health habits are actually increasing
their life expectancy by 10 years.
So it's not minimal.
And another one reason why people
in emerging country are not going
to school is actually oral care diseases.
I'm just trying to get to the slide.
So what a bathroom that is fully connected will mean?
With a smart bath mat, we can collect your weight.
As you probably know, if you combine your weight
and your height, you have your life expectancy
with a 5% accuracy.
Insurers have got it since 1943
or okay, I already mentioned
and the mirror or the smart mirror,
we introduced last year at CES, a mirror called BMind.
25% of Americans wake up in the morning
with a little low moment, you know, little depressed times.
There is not a hundred million dollar of psychiatrists
that can deal with those things.
AI is the only way forward.
And so, by building some smart way
to do triage about how well are you doing?
And so, we invented a way to ask you how you're doing
and by just listening to you,
we get so much more information beyond your language.
We understand what you say, I'm great.
We understand the where you sit, I'm great,
actually your sound, it means you're not great,
and we understand your posture is also a great message.
So beyond the biomarker
and the things that are very hard to catch,
there is a lot of signals that are logging fruit
for us to work on the future of healthcare.
The other thing we have been working on recently
is a smart bath mat, was also two CES award.
So you walk on the bath mat and we track your weight.
Your weight is one of the most interesting information.
But beyond the weight, your balance,
the one reason why you have problem
in your home is you're falling.
And the risk of falling is now based on the data,
something we can predict.
Falling is not an accident.
It's actually a dysfunction of some of your major muscle,
and you have four system in your body
to rebalance you which have become defect,
either by brain damage or by just aging
the you falling.
And then usually, it's a very bad prediction
for your health expectancy.
And the good news about that
is now we know it's somehow a disease.
There is a way to reverse those symptoms
and by doing simple exercise every day.
And that's why this smart mat
has been awarded Best Startup in Korea
which is a most aging population right now.
We can find a way for this to work.
Analyzing your skin, you know,
melanoma, most of the of the mirrors,
most of the cancer are not happening overnight.
They are actually a long decay of some things
that you can actually collect in skin cancer,
not all, but collecting the inner markers,
fluids, and the outside visible marker
is actually a good way
to help diagnose what's going on with your skin.
And last but not least, I think it's important,
the challenge for wearables is actually
when the battery is dead, you no longer wear them.
And which means that all the data collection,
which I call daily healthtech,
or longitudinal healthcare is lost.
And I've bought sixth version of my Apple watch,
and I'm no longer because at some point,
actually it happens two days after CES, battery is dead,
and the data set that I can collect is no longer accurate
because it's interrupted.
So with this, we have been,
with this, what we have been able to do was
to use your body as a battery,
so that was also 2023 CES award.
And this wristband is actually very promising
for all people who need long-term tracks of their vital.
We measure HRV.
We measure activity and temperature,
whether it's for women health or aging people,
or for everybody that wants to take care of their health.
And it's not that complicated.
So on that note, those are all the new devices we
are bringing together and if you want to visit our booth,
what we are showing is actually the underling platform we
call BConnect that enable the creation of all those devices
and new devices allowing those devices to be interoperable,
not only ours, but also all the 65 makers
of devices that collect well-being or healthcare data.
And making those data available for further research,
further discovery, has probably a huge impact
on longevity and well-being.
Thank you very much.
<v ->I wanted to just ask you just really quickly,</v>
have you seen folks that are using your solutions
or whatever data you're collecting,
are they getting more used to this idea
of having all these connected solutions?
You know, is it something
that we're all jumping into quickly?
<v ->Well, each new data source open new opportunities.</v>
Initially, the scale we wanted to do
for just monitoring your weight
and now, we discover we can actually predict falling.
So that's a typical usage.
Another one we have had with a toothbrush was
that we invented the connected toothbrush
because my daughter was not brushing her teeth.
Then we receive emails from parents
of people who have autism.
And brushing your teeth if you have
an autistic child is a nightmare.
Suddenly, you can focus the attention of on the child,
on playing a game and then it becomes easy.
So not only application are invented by even a researcher,
but actually users find new ways to use your tools
beyond what the inventor have thought through.
<v ->Now, that's so interesting.</v>
All right, let's, and I think we're gonna find a lot
of commonalities between these guys
once we dig in a little bit more.
So let's go over to Pranitha.
Tell us about your fabulous company
which I can't wait to use myself.
I love it.
<v ->Can I have the clicker?</v>
Thank you.
And, yeah, so Pranitha Patil, Co-founder, COO.
And I will just take you into kind
of how we're thinking about our platform and what we do.
I think we know especially if we're at CES,
that the applications of AI
with healthcare are finally actually here.
What we are with Function Health is we are
an annual membership for $500 a year.
We start with diagnostic testing.
So blood and urine that you collect
at your local Quest Diagnostics.
Once you complete those tests,
it's about a hundred biomarkers.
We're looking at all organs
and organ systems, your heart, your hormones,
your liver, your thyroid.
We're really getting a full view of what's happening
with your body and then we're presenting
that information back to you
in a digestible, actionable way.
And then over time, how we think about this
as we apply past medical records, self-reported data,
and any other data sets that you can think about,
think imaging, think you're wearable that you're wearing,
stool testing, saliva testing,
we really think of ourselves as a platform.
But today, what we focus on is $500
for those a hundred biomarkers twice a year
to establish a baseline.
And this is just quickly kind of how it works.
Once you set up your account, you schedule your lab tests.
Those results are tracked in this dashboard.
These are the tests that we do.
I won't sit here and list all of them,
but they're meant to be incredibly comprehensive
because if you go to a traditional physician today,
your annual physical,
you're getting about 15 to 20 biomarkers done.
They see you, they say, okay, cool, you look great.
See you in a couple years,
unless you come back with something severe.
And that's what we're trying to fix.
We're trying to say let's be as proactive as possible.
Let's really understand what's happening
in our body because we deserve to have
that information on our health.
The science is there.
There's been only a delay in a hierarchy in getting
that information into people's hands in a proactive way.
So this is the list of a hundred tests that we do.
We also have a host of add-ons.
So you'll see cancer detection, autoimmunity, allergy.
We just released several other add-ons that look at PFAS
and a couple other just new tests that really take,
you know, 18 years to get to market.
We're trying to say let's get you access as soon
as the research and the data and the test is there.
I'll just quickly talk you through kind of the dashboard.
Once you do get your tests, we have,
you'll see here your biological age,
the biomarkers that you've gotten tested,
and we go category by category, so by organ system,
kind of how you're doing and we'll take you into specifics.
So look here, this is H-S-C-R-P. Why does it matter?
A summary, the causes, foods you might eat,
foods you should limit, other things
that you might find beneficial of like what's going on.
And in that chart, you'll see that tracks over time,
which if I ask probably this audience,
I don't know who has their electronic medical records
in a clean, easy-to-access way today.
This is meant to not only be that,
but say, hey here's actually what you should do about it.
We also, obviously, provide clinician notes.
So a clinician actually goes
through your entire medical history as well
as the biomarkers that you got tested to provide you
with a summary of, you know,
what's the most important thing you need
to be focusing on today?
'Cause it can be kind of overwhelming
to get results for a hundred plus biomarkers.
So that is provided here.
And then a clean action plan as your health stack.
I will tell a quick story
of an individual, his name is Jeff.
He was able to find prostate cancer
through the gallery test.
I speak to members every single day,
and it's incredible to really hear
and understand how folks' lives are being changed with this
because they're proactively able
to identify not just cancer,
but hypertension, cardiovascular risk, the list goes on,
on things folks are able to find proactively
and actually make a change in their day to day.
And then, I'll end with our founding team,
and you can join by going
to functionhealth.com if you want.
<v ->Awesome. I'm so going.</v>
Before we jump over to Ramses, I just wanted to ask you,
you have some unique brand partnerships
with what you would call other category,
you know, brands like Equinox,
and I think you also have one with Thrive Global.
Can you just talk a little bit about how
that fills out the story of what you're trying to do?
<v ->Yeah, I mean, if you think, take a step back.</v>
This is an 8-billion-person problem.
This is not just a handful of people that need this.
When we go out and talk to potential partners,
you can think about Function as a platform
and apply your gym and your fitness
on top of your biomarkers.
You can apply Thrive Global. You can apply grocery stores.
You can really think about this as applied as a foundation
which is why when we speak to potential partners,
it's a no-brainer
because this data has been lacking for so long
that folks want the access to what's going on in their body
and then they can make more informed decisions
about how they should live their life
versus going off of a symptom.
<v ->That's awesome.</v>
I just like the idea of all of it coming together.
'Cause how many of you have like a separate app, maybe,
for your scale and a separate app for your diet
and exercise, and all of that.
So it would be wonderful to have it sort
of all talk to each other-
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->which I know is the goal for all of you.</v>
All right, let's jump over to Ramses and then again,
after Ramses goes, we're gonna connect back to everybody.
So Ramses, take it over.
<v ->Hey, before I get started though,</v>
I wanna ask for a volunteer.
Does somebody wanna come up here
and do something with their brain real quick?
Just raise your hand. I need one.
I'm not moving forward until I get a volunteer, so.
<v ->Ramses, I'll do it if nobody will do it, so. (laughs)</v>
<v ->Let's try to get somebody from the audience.</v>
<v ->Come on up. Yay.</v>
<v ->Come on. Let's make this engaging.</v>
Come on. There we go. Thank you.
All right, let's get my slides up real quick.
<v Lori>Are we gonna find out anything weird about you?</v>
<v Ramses>You come up here.</v>
You're gonna sit up here with me.
<v Lori>That's great.</v>
<v Ramses>What's your name?</v>
<v Aven>Aven.</v>
<v Ramses>Aiden?</v>
<v Aven>Aven.</v>
<v Ramses>Aven. Thank you, Aven.</v>
Awesome. Have a seat right here.
We'll get to you in just a second.
So really, what we work on at Neurable
is trying to unlock the mind, right?
A lot of you have wearable devices.
Could you just raise your hand if you have one?
Yeah, pretty much everybody here, right?
That's why we're all biased in this area,
but outside of this group,
three outta 10 people have a wearable device, right?
It's primarily used for things like understanding
the body at scale and longitudinally.
That's a thing that wearable devices really
are changing the world with, right?
Right now, when you go to the doctor,
you just get a snapshot of what your life is
and what your state is,
and some of these wearable companies up here
are changing that.
But that's the big win,
being able to do at scale,
longitudinal analysis about your body.
But the key thing is what about your brain?
The most important organ in your body, right?
Why aren't we tracking that, right?
And there is technology to track that.
They're called brain computer interfaces.
They're basically technology that allows you
to read brain activity
and then use it to control other types of systems
or better understand yourself.
And I'll tell you why these systems aren't everyday devices.
It's because essentially, even though they have
this huge amount of aspects that you can track
and look at, you know, imagine tracking Alzheimer's
before you get it, right?
Imagine tracking your focus even though
the value proposition is enormous for these devices.
They look like this, right?
They're large cap systems with gel electrodes, you know,
essentially prongs that go through your hair.
And while it would be incredible to have this type
of technology and to be able to track these biomarkers,
something that no other type of device can.
We're limited to this type of form factor.
And that's where Neurable comes in.
It was developed in 2011.
It's a signal processing technology
from the University of Michigan
that boost the signal of brain data.
So instead of having to use these large head cap systems
that you see here to your left,
we essentially boost the signal,
and we can bring it down to a pair of headphones.
So here, I have a beautiful pair of headphones.
They're a premium-end headphone
from a company called Master &amp; Dynamic.
We license our AI to this device.
On the inside, you will see these gray bands,
and Aven, you're gonna be controlling
something with your brain.
<v Aven>Okay.</v>
<v Ramses>Yeah. Oh, how cool is that, right?</v>
So go ahead and put these on just like
a normal pair of headphones.
Now, normally, to put on a brain computer interface,
it would take about 20 to 30 minutes.
We'd have to put gel all over you. All this other stuff.
Yeah, just, yep. Awesome.
But essentially, what we're gonna do right now
is we are just having you put it on
like a pair of headphones.
So I'm gonna make sure they're turned on.
Okay.
Wake up my computer 'cause it decided to fall asleep.
And how many of you actually used
brain computer interfaces before?
Anybody? Raise your hand.
You two are biased 'cause you guys came here for me, so.
All right.
And if we could switch to my computer, please.
So for those of you that are interested,
please stand up and move over here real quick,
and we're gonna show you some really cool,
brain-related things.
And if you haven't seen a brain computer interface,
this is gonna be really sick, so.
<v Lori>And Ramses, is there a website also where some</v>
of these can be looked at in case folks don't get
to see everything we wanna see?
<v Ramses>Yes, yes. 'll share that in a second.</v>
Aven, can you come down to this red chair?
And then we'll get everybody over here.
Awesome.
So, Aven, just have a seat right there.
So you guys can see this graph here?
It represents Aven's focus.
Now, Aven, what I want you to do is,
do you see these numbers scrolling
on the screen right there?
I want you to start saying those numbers
in your head as intensely as you can.
Are you chewing gum?
Yeah, could you take that out real quick? (laughs)
No worries. All right.
So go ahead and just start focusing
on these numbers as they pop up.
Say them in your head as intensely as you can.
So you can see that his focus just spiked up, right?
Right there.
And now, that he's distracted
'cause I'm distracting him, you see it drop down.
So go ahead and focus one more time
and then you can see his focus go up.
Now, I'm gonna show you guys something really cool.
Hold this for a second.
I want you to read this article.
So, Aven is about to read an article,
and you're gonna see his focus go up.
<v Aven>This is my favorite headphones at CSE.</v>
<v Ramses>You can read it in your head.</v>
Don't worry about it.
<v Aven>Oh, oh.</v>
<v Ramses>Yeah, yeah, it's okay. Don't worry.</v>
<v Lori>Don't worry everybody, (chuckles) it's okay.</v>
<v Ramses>All right, awesome.</v>
So you see this area right here?
This was him reading?
<v Aven>Yep.</v>
<v Ramses>Oh, and then he saw the picture,</v>
and it dropped his focus, right?
'Cause he got distracted as he scrolled past
this picture right here.
And then when he went back to reading,
it shot back up, right?
So we're tracking his brain activity in real time.
Something that would require a full-scalp EEG
to get this level of capability.
But we're able to do it essentially
with an everyday device, right?
So that's the real key type of technology.
Cool, thank you all so much, Aven.
<v Lori>Let's have a hand.</v>
<v Ramses>A round of applause for Aven, real quick.</v>
<v Lori>Being very creative about the demo there.</v>
Let's just get into some group discussion.
We have eight minutes left and I'd love for you all
to hear from these great entrepreneurs.
So just the question I was asking during our prep,
not to spend too much time on this,
but I'm wondering as we look
at diagnostic therapies and how the FDA
and our health insurance companies are finally paying
for things for consumers, are all of you looking
at the role that insurance companies will have with this
and how doctors are treating this and things like that?
So anyone on the panel wanna answer that?
<v ->So my first customer,</v>
when we started the toothbrush business
was actually Delta Dental from California.
'Cause it's an obvious change of the value, however,
and it's quite disappointing, despite the fact
that insurers show interests,
at this moment, most of the market,
not all, are more focusing on short-term,
simplified interface, better user experience,
less paperwork.
So digitization of the user relationship
is actually lowering the risk because somehow,
the risk right now is properly redistributed.
The insurance business is actually sharing
the risk because if the risk increase,
they will just increase the premium,
and that's not bad for the business.
So the insurance pathway is a long-term path.
But for entrepreneur, we're looking for,
I would say, quicker exit is probably not the best way
in many areas, but it needs to be appreciated state by state
because actually, insurance is actually regulated
quite heavily in a state by state.
<v Pranitha>Yeah. Similarly, we are focused</v>
on consumers directly.
We have a hundred thousand customers today.
I think insurance is, to your point, the long-term play.
But it really, really helps
to have the direct consumer feedback right away.
Like the number of folks that we get feedback from,
so immediately and we can iterate
on our product is outstanding.
So that's our take at the moment.
<v Lori>And Ramses.</v>
<v Ramses>Yeah, I mean we're taking</v>
a similar approach to like what Apple did.
You know, they released a product,
but it wasn't a medical product, right?
It tracked your heart rate and then from there,
they said, "Hey, you might have heart arrhythmia.
Go see a doctor."
And now, they're FDA approved,
and they're going through that.
And now, insurance companies are starting
to leverage the data and so,
we're taking a similar approach.
That way, we can collect a ton of data,
provide value and not be overburdened by FDA
or insurance as a small startup company.
<v ->That's great. I love that.</v>
And do you see a moment in time where, you know,
all of you are training consumers to be advocates
for themselves, so that's gonna push the market forward.
Am I correct? You know, the goal, that's the goal?
<v ->Yeah, I think there is a point</v>
where insurer actually are distributors of product
and don't know actually how to sell hardware.
So eventually, if there is no customer demand,
if there is no desirability, if there is no brand,
there is no value for the customer.
So there is no value for the insurer.
So really, the customer-first approach
is really the only way forward.
There is no big incentive despite
whatever we can sell long-term
for a manager that stays three years in a job
to take a risk to actually buy a lot of hardware
and try to see the value of five
to 10 years down from the road.
<v ->Yeah, wearables really like flip the script.</v>
That's the key part, right?
Like think about when you go to the doctor, right?
You go to the doctor,
and they say everything's fine.
Go back next year, everything's fine.
Go back next year. This happens for five, 10 years.
And then they say, oh, your heart is abnormal, right?
It's not that your heart hasn't been abnormal
for the last 10 years and it just magically happened.
It's probably been happening slowly over the last 10 years.
But when they measured your heart at the hospital,
they didn't detect it right?
And so, wearables are flipping the script
because now, you can measure that change as it's occurring.
You can get it that information years beforehand,
and that enables preventative care.
That enables you to interject earlier.
And so, that consumer-first approach enables
that type of disruption to happen
that using our current healthcare system,
it's not well set up to do.
<v ->Just maybe adding one thing.</v>
I think there is two condition,
when people are consumer and when people are patient.
And there is a big, big difference.
When people are consumer,
it's their desire that will drive the adoption
and insurer are not going to push it
because it's extra cost for them,
and the return on investment is too far away,
in most cases, not all.
Then when the consumer is becoming a patient,
you're entering a brand new world
where once you have proven the clinical value,
which is not really, I mean some of our product are
in that space, some of their product might enter that space.
To enter that space takes two, three, four years
to get the FDA approval
and to have the clinical to support your claims.
But there is a real benefit to the patients
and a clinical benefit then insurers start going in
because somehow if there is a better practice
of care then it will be adopted by the healthcare community
and become almost mandatory.
But that's a complete different game for which startups
who go to CES who have a short innovation cycle
are not really prepared or funded to do.
<v ->I'll also add one thing with physicians, right?</v>
The insurance companies, that's one thing.
The physicians on the other side,
we've spoke to countless number of them
that are finally getting hip to the idea of,
yes, doing this many tests is okay,
even though I was trained in medical school
to think differently and taught to do differently,
the incentive structure is not set up.
There's so many things that are,
honestly, battling preventative healthcare for physicians
as they're burnt out, they have five minutes to see you.
So if we really start to flip the script
and say in your visit,
we're super optimizing that time together
because we know exactly what we need to get out of it.
That is major change in how we do health
and think about healthcare.
<v ->Let me just ask the tricky question</v>
that's a big conversation on the floor right now.
And that's just about data security
and also the other question in the air
for everything right now is sustainability.
So are those two conversations also wrapping
into what you guys are all doing?
Are you looking at, you know, security,
and then also do we make a product
that will move forward in this world?
You know, where we're limited in resources?
<v ->So on security, the biggest weakness</v>
of connected device is inventor don't know cybersecurity,
otherwise, they won't invent
because it's so heavy and complicated.
So that's why we introduce this BConnect platform
to accelerate the best practice of cyber security diffusion
as well as implementing the best practices in data privacy.
Because data privacy, best practice
actually not embedded in the software.
You have to build it yourself,
and you need to build it out of experience.
On the sustainability, it's an economic question.
What we have seen so far is only a few percentage
of the population can afford paying sustainable product
and when people are suffering from purchasing power change,
they will focus on the price versus sustainability,
and that's gonna last,
<v ->I'll start with sustainability first.</v>
If you think about pro-anything,
proactive or preventative,
the idea is to stave off the cost you would have
for treating diabetes, treating heart disease.
That is a major win if you're able to get that
and get that outcome.
And then as far as security, absolutely,
our members own their data.
They choose who they send it to,
and that is of utmost priority with function
because that can impact your insurance.
It can impact a number of things down the line
if we don't keep that top of mind.
<v ->Yeah, ours is pretty simple.</v>
Similar to yours, the consumer owns the data.
If they wanna share it to us, that's wonderful
and by sharing it to us, we give them more value, right?
But if they just wanna use the product
in its simplest form, that's totally fine.
<v ->That's awesome. And just 'cause we're running outta time,</v>
can you guys do another lightning round
of where everybody in the audience can learn more
about your platforms, so they can play?
<v ->Yeah you can go to neurable.com</v>
and actually see what we're building.
Also, come talk to me afterwards.
I'm happy to give you guys demos,
and you guys can mess around with the system yourself.
<v ->Are you on LinkedIn as well</v>
posting about what you're doing?
<v ->I am on LinkedIn.</v>
You won't be able to add me 'cause I have a blocker on,
but I will add you if you show me your QR code.
<v ->Oh, I love that. Privacy issue there. Okay. (laughs)</v>
<v ->I'm on LinkedIn, Pranitha Patil is my name.</v>
And then you can learn more about Function
by going to functionhealth.com.
I'm also happy to chat and answer any questions after this.
<v ->I am on all possible platform.</v>
LinkedIn, WeChat, WhatsApp, Thomas Serval.
You can find me or tserval on the X.
We are on CES show floor at Eureka Park
in the French pavilion.
And our website has plenty of example, baracoda.com,
B-A-R-A-C-O-D-A.com.
<v ->Wait a minute, you're French?</v>
Just kidding (laughs)
All right. Let's have a big hand for our panelists.
Such great entrepreneurs,
really changing the way we're gonna live our lives.
I love it. Thank you guys so much
and please check out all their companies.
They're just doing amazing work. Thanks, everybody.
This ends this track,
but there are more sessions here in the hall,
so please check them out and have a great,
wonderful, and safe rest of your CES.
Thanks, everybody.
<v Ramses>Thanks, you all.</v>
<v Pranitha>Thank you.</v>
