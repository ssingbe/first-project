<v ->I'm David Shrier.</v>
I am your host for this session.
We are joined by an esteemed panel
who I will introduce as we go through the questions,
and we'll be talking about,
What's Next for Smart Cities:
AI for Data, Planning and Beyond.
So my first question goes to Sheri Bachstein,
who leads The Weather Channel,
excuse me, The Weather Company,
a role which has given her the chance
to chase eight tornadoes in a day.
Sheri, you may have insight into something
that I'm rather interested in.
Last year, we saw devastation to regions of the US
that don't normally get impacted by hurricanes,
like the mountains of Eastern Tennessee
and the west end of North Carolina.
Not to mention, extreme heat,
which killed people at a rate 100% higher than 20 years ago,
mostly in urban environments, right?
So we're dealing with these extreme weather events.
How do we better prepare cities and communities
so that they, in turn, can better protect people
and infrastructure?
<v ->Well, David, thank you for including me</v>
on the panel today.
It's great to be here.
And, you know, there is absolutely no doubt
that our climate is changing
and we are seeing more extreme events.
But, not only that, we're seeing weather events
happen outside of their seasonal norms, right?
So that becomes very challenging,
because it's not predictable anymore.
And so you definitely saw that with the devastation
that happened in Asheville,
you would never think a hurricane would impact inland.
And so there's a few things as we look
at how AI can really help as it relates to extreme weather.
One of the areas is around urban design, right?
And really being able to design an infrastructure
that can hold up to events
that we've never seen before, right?
And so the power of AI, you can take a lot of climate data
and be able to come up with those scenarios
that we haven't seen
versus what we kind of do today
is we look back at historical data, right?
And so this gives us the ability to be more predictive,
so then we can redesign those infrastructures,
we can redesign those emergency response systems,
which I think are critically important.
And then, the other thing that I'm very excited about,
because it plays right into what The Weather Company does,
and The Weather Channel is one of our brands,
so that's okay, is that, you know,
traditionally, AI is now giving us the ability
to much further our forecasting capabilities, right?
And so a lot of the weather that you get,
whether you look at your forecast as deterministic, right?
That, for decades, we've delivered a deterministic forecast,
which means one single prediction, right?
With AI now we can really turn
to look at probabilistic forecasting.
And that means that we can take the power of AI
and run thousands of scenarios
to give us a better look at what's the probability
that while this is the best forecast,
there is always going to be the probability
that it could go either side of that forecast.
So this can give communities and governments
the ability to better scenario plan,
again, looking at it to be more predictive,
more preparation.
You know, we can't control Mother Nature, right,
and the forecast will always, you know, be interesting.
But we can better plan for the uncertainty,
and I think that's really where smart cities
can really benefit.
<v ->Great, thank you.</v>
So Barbara Bickham is a CTO and venture capital leader,
and has won two poker championships.
She'll be running a game after the panel just in Hall C.
Barbara, you've worked at the convergence
of different technologies with AI, like blockchain,
in crafting innovative city environments
from Honduras to Ohio.
How are you using technology to improve citizen experiences?
<v ->So we utilize AI (audio drops)</v>
in quantum computing, Internet of Things,
'cause we are gonna be one of the things
in these smart cities, and also Web3 experiences,
in order to not only plan a city,
how do you go about moving around in a city,
but what should a city really look like and be governed?
So we are looking at using DAOs,
distributed autonomous organizations,
in order for citizens to have more say
in the governance of a smart city.
So instead of having a traditional centralized government
where you would go to a DMV,
well, we still would have DMV,
those records would be on a blockchain.
But instead of having certain centralized services,
you could utilize something like Clean &amp; Safe,
where citizens could be involved in their area
and say, "Well, we don't want the graffiti here.
We wanna vote to have that remitted or abated.
We don't wanna have this types of crimes here.
We want to have more policing
and more kind of socialized services over in these areas."
So it's a way for the citizenry
to be more involved in their community
and more connected to each other
versus having this kind of one layer of person
that is in between
where you kind of feel disconnected amongst each other.
<v ->Okay, thank you.</v>
<v ->Mhmm.</v>
<v ->So Prachi Vakharia is strategic advisor</v>
for innovations and infrastructure with ARPA-I,
a US government initiative
to deliver transportation innovation.
So, Prachi, tell us a little bit
about this new ARPA-I initiative
around leveraging emerging data sets
and new techniques in AI
for better understanding infrastructure assets.
<v ->Wonderful, thank you.</v>
Good afternoon, everyone, great to have you here.
ARPA-I, before I get into ARPA-I,
can I see a show of hands,
how many of you have heard of DARPA?
Okay, wow, this is a really impressive crowd.
All right, so you all know DARPA was created,
actually, it was a reaction to the Soviets
at the time launching Sputnik,
and Eisenhower waking up and saying,
you know, "We, as a country,
should never be caught by surprise again,"
and, within four months,
creating this agency that used to be called ARPA,
now it's called DARPA.
But DARPA has given us things like the internet.
I think we can all appreciate that.
Nearly a lot of the foundational technologies here at CES
actually come from DARPA funding.
Drone technologies, for example, internet, like I mentioned,
GPS, global positioning systems,
so on and so forth.
And given how successful this model has been,
about two years ago, the US government,
and especially the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,
created a whole new agency called ARPA-I.
So it's not an initiative, it's actually an agency.
We're in the process of setting it up,
and it ties into infrastructure.
Why infrastructure?
You know, we have so much amazing existing infrastructure
in this country,
and still it certainly can be improved.
What ARPA-I is tasked to do is saying,
"Well, can we use this DARPA model
that's given us so much exciting technology
and apply that to our roads, bridges,
maritime sector, aviation?"
And that includes, I get to look at amazing technologies,
everything from self-healing concrete
to new kinds of sensors that are way more precise
than traditional sensors have been
or classical sensors have been.
To then, of course,
things like electrification and automation,
these trends we've been seeing
for at least the last 10 years in the sector.
Another side note, by the way,
DARPA is also to be credited for creating the AV industry,
the automated vehicle industry.
This is coming from their 2004, '06, and '07
Grand Challenge, which said,
"Hey, can we have a vehicle that's operated
without an operator inside?"
And especially for battlefield environments,
this became quite a necessity.
So they kicked off this whole industry
simply with the power of one challenge.
So really ARPA-I has a great path,
and possibility, and promise ahead.
Now, why are we looking at transportation infrastructure?
A couple of reasons.
You know, I'm always in awe of the defense sector.
Like they know more of what's happening
in the streets of Iraq, for example,
more than we know what's happening in our country.
I used to work at city and state DOTs, and if you ask
a DOT Department of Transportation commissioner,
"Hey, you know, how many bridges do you have in your state,
and what condition are they in?"
and many of them will not be able
to give you a precise answer on that.
We just don't know the condition of many of our assets.
So, last year, we launched a very creative initiative
called Complete Streets AI, with the goal being,
you know, can we use this amazing satellite imagery
that we have access to today?
New, you know, AI models as well,
just new types of computer vision tools,
put that all together
and better make sense of our built infrastructure.
You know, what is the condition of our roads,
our bridges, our highways?
Where do we spend our infrastructure dollars first
and where should we not spend them?
You know, what is in a state of good repair, what isn't?
So really this is why we created the initiative.
I will add one small side note again here is,
I think this is much needed.
If you even think of basic technologies like GPS,
even today, GPS accuracy in defense applications
is at centimeter-level accuracy,
while in the civilian space it's at meter-level accuracy.
So really our mandate is how do we be the best
and use the most cutting-edge technologies
that are out there
or create and inspire them to be built for us?
So this is exactly what we are doing at ARPA-I.
<v ->And I recommend to everyone the book,</v>
"The Entrepreneurial State" by Mariana Mazzucato,
which tells you more detail
on how almost every innovation enjoyed today
was funded by a large-scale government program,
not by Silicon Valley.
So her stage name is Nadia Hansen.
She drives digital transformation at Salesforce.com
and actually lives in Las Vegas.
She is the rare Las Vegas local.
So, Nadia, you used to be the CIO of Las Vegas,
and I'm sure you have some interesting stories
to share both on your past role
and what you're doing with Salesforce.com.
How is AI being used to drive transformation
across cities and countries in Vegas and globally?
<v ->Thank you, well, good afternoon, welcome to my city.</v>
I know nobody says that, I've been here for 25 years.
I've seen the city grow firsthand.
I live in Henderson, which Henderson didn't even exist.
So coming back to your question, David.
You know, some of the things that we're seeing
just globally, I have the privilege of working
with a lot of different state and local agencies,
and it really starts with some foundational basics.
If I want an Amazon experience, I want an Airbnb experience,
I want an Uber experience,
why can't government provide me with that same experience?
So it's very foundational.
I want seamless, I want easy,
intuitive interaction with my government.
How many of you love going to the DMV,
Department of Motor Vehicles, to get a license?
How many of you love to pay your bills,
and then, you know what?
Sometimes you can't pay it online.
Yes, except for one person in back.
Thank you very much for that.
Nobody loves to pay their bills.
But let me tell you, if you make the process,
and if you make the experience easier
for constituents and for citizens,
yes, the interaction will be a lot better.
So a lot of the conversations
are around how can we have an omnichannel approach?
And what I mean by omnichannel is,
look, we're serving five different generations
in government.
We have the Traditionalists, we have Baby Boomers,
we have the Gen Xs, we have pretty soon the Gen Zs,
and all of them want to be served differently.
Some people want to come
into a brick-and-mortar building, great.
Some people never want to see a human, great.
Some people only want to talk
through a mobile device, great.
I think this is the imperative
of us being able to move forward in providing that,
especially with now AI being as part of the realm,
which I'm sure everybody has used ChatGPT in this room.
Pretty much most people.
We're talking about instant gratification.
Okay, and I think we live in this world right now
where every state and local agency
that I speak to is thinking about,
"How do I set up AI governance in my institution?
How do I set up a cyber policy?
How do I have a data governance committee?"
'Cause essentially everything starts with data.
Data is your foundation.
And, in government, I used to work
in government for 15 years,
I have to tell you, we have petabytes of data.
And you don't know how to visualize it,
and you don't know how to make data-driven decisions
because there's so much of it.
So I think it really starts with basics.
What is the outcome that we're trying to achieve?
And then, how can we reverse engineer back to that?
So I'll pass it back to you,
but I wanna talk about agents too
in the next set of questions.
<v ->Sure, well,</v>
so now we're gonna get into some collaborative questions.
So this first one is for Barbara and Nadia.
Data seems pretty central to the AI conversation, right?
And so what are some of the challenges
around working with AI and data in the smart city context?
<v ->I can kick it off?</v>
<v ->Yeah, please.</v>
<v ->So, okay, so a lot of the agencies</v>
that, one, I used to work for,
and, two, a very simple example,
what's the number one thing, when you think of Las Vegas,
what's the number one thing that you think of?
<v ->Casino.</v>
<v ->Casinos.</v>
Gambling, entertainment.
Hockey.
<v ->Water.</v>
<v ->Losing money.</v>
Could be all of those things.
When we were redesigning the website for Clark County,
which is the county here that runs Las Vegas,
we were like, "What do people come here for?
Maybe they come here for a marriage license."
So we decided to design it that way.
But guess what?
We went back and took a look at the data,
and the data actually showed the number one search
on Clark County's website at the time was,
"We're searching for an inmate in jail,"
'cause people just end up missing somehow in Vegas
and they end up in jail,
because there's a lot of things happening.
So coming back to data, this is why when you think,
"Ah, people come here for different reasons,"
yeah, that's an assumption,
but you need evidence to be able to prove it.
So data is imperative in order to do any kind of AI.
So we're talking about AI agents,
that's a digital agent you can have on your side,
your buddy who can actually do everything for you,
and that's kind of augmenting existing workers, right?
And I think that's in the era where we're at,
but you really need to have clean, accurate data
to provide you with the results that you're looking for.
That's the foundation.
<v David>Thank you.</v>
Barbara, Prachi, would you like to build on that?
<v ->I'll build on that a little bit.</v>
Back to the fact of you have massive amounts of data,
petabytes of data, and that it's probably siloed off,
so the data is not in kind of an easy way to access.
So that's an opportunity to start using
kind of decentralized AIs so that they can start
having conversation amongst each other,
the AIs can have the conversations and go,
"Hey, I need this data,
because someone is looking for someone in jail,"
or "someone is looking for a marriage license,"
or "someone is looking
for where is the loop here."
So depending upon what people are thinking
about and looking for,
that siloed area is also a problem,
because data can be hidden in one place
that needs to be surfaced somewhere else.
So that's a very common problem, not only in a city,
but many companies have this common problem
of where is all the data?
Why is the data not transparent?
And why is it so siloed off into certain sections?
So that's where the decentralized AI,
decentralized data concepts can help move a city forward.
<v ->Adding to both these points,</v>
I recently just this afternoon
ran into the economic minister of Estonia.
And I asked him, you know, "What makes Estonia special?"
And the one thing he mentioned is,
"We have lots and lots of digitized data."
And this is really key,
'cause data can be in all different forms and formats.
"We have so much historic data."
Well, it turns out no one's managed to digitize it
and put it in the right format,
you know, structural, unstructured,
but, you know, hopefully, structured data
in a way that actually makes it usable.
Now in the transportation sector,
that gets amplified quite a bit.
We have a federated system of building stuff
here in this country,
that means we have nonstandard curb cuts
or curb ramps, for example.
You know, the sidewalk itself is designed differently,
and it's designed differently in every town,
every city, every state.
We have national centers,
but sometimes states do,
or cities and regions do
what they need to serve their people,
which means they go about building things
the way they've been building for the last 50 years.
And this is a big problem,
because there's no lack of standardization.
Well, how do you then put something
at a national level that makes sense
and create a kind of national database of things?
You know, one small example is you could have,
I could have a national database of bike routes,
for example, in this country, and say like,
"Hey, you know, if I wanna bike from A to B,
can I take a bike route across the way?"
But, you know, how do you define bike routes?
And turns out, there are many different definitions of it,
many different ways they're protected, unprotected.
So lots and lots of variations,
so this is one about data quality itself.
Another anecdote I'll share is when I was working
with the Massachusetts government,
you know, I was in charge of enhancements,
especially to stations,
especially those people coming into transit stations
in the Boston region.
And when I asked for maps of these stations
so I could start, you know, building
on what enhancements we needed to build on top of it,
I got a Dropbox folder,
which was randomly created by a contractor,
with PDF files of the station as-built maps from the 1970s.
This is the best and the most recent data
they had of our infrastructure.
So that tells you there's a lot we need to do
and improve in terms of data quality, data standardization,
and then, of course, your AI tools can come on top of that.
AI itself is really exciting.
You know, along with all these hundreds of models
we've seen applicants use,
even things like visual language models.
Again, that combines and helps you do extraction
from maps or images,
and also combine it with language.
So there's a lot of hope,
and I think AI can fill a lot of gaps in this data spectrum.
So I'm excited.
<v ->And so kind of extending this point,</v>
data's obviously a big part of the intersection
of weather and infrastructure.
So this is for Sheri,
and then, Prachi, you can build on this.
Are there places where public-private partnerships
could help us around getting better AI
and better quality data going into that AI?
<v ->Oh, absolutely.</v>
And, Nadia, I would've thought the most searched term
would've been "What's the weather in Las Vegas?"
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->But maybe not.</v>
But, no, The Weather Company,
for years we've had partnerships
with NOAA, NWS, with the government,
with universities
that we're doing science and projects with,
and then with other companies.
Right now, for example, we are partnering with Nvidia
to build the next generation of AI weather modeling.
And it's a weather model, it'll be the first of its kind,
that will be down to a one kilometer.
It's an AI numeric-based model.
And so, you know, there's a lot of ways to get data
and to partner to get that data.
Our forecasts, we use 100 different models,
some from governments around the world,
some from, you know, private sector,
from sensors, as you were talking about,
from airplane sensors,
from your cell phones, if you give us permission.
All of that goes into input,
because I think the more quality data that we can look at,
the better the answer will be.
And so I think having an ecosystem
where you have partnerships across different sectors
is really fundamental
as we continue down this AI journey collectively.
<v ->Yeah, I'll touch more on just how weather</v>
and infrastructure connect together.
One example is, of course, like, all of us,
you know, a lot of times our routes get disrupted
if there's rain or there's snow,
things take just much longer to get to than before.
During my time at Amazon as well,
I know they've explored using weather companies
and weather services
that even give information at the very block level,
so you know exactly at this block how much traffic there is.
You also wanna understand, "Well, are the tires
on this truck going to be slippery?" for example.
From a kind of public sector side,
a lot of cities and states can also do things
like continuous route planning,
and this is, again, a technology
that could be possible in the future.
'Cause right now, route planning is,
you know, "I wanna go from A to B
and here are the steps to get there."
But what if it's something that's continuous?
And, you know, new kinds of technology can enable that.
So that means, you know,
as you're moving through your route,
you can then figure out,
"Well, there's traffic here
or there's a weather event here
or there's a blockage there,
this road is closed, well, let's reroute it,"
but all happening in real time.
So imagine a digital twin of your city or your region
and that helps you go from A to B.
One technology I'm excited for,
again, weather infrastructure is also perhaps the role
that quantum computing can play in this.
Quantum computers are still very far away,
but we started to see some models
that look interesting and promising.
For example, with tsunamis or hurricanes,
how do you have evacuation done in a way
that's really intelligent and optimized?
Because, again, quantum computers,
you know, they work in sort of bits
which have zeros and ones,
quantum qubits can have multiple different states,
zero-one or zero and one at the same time.
Anyways, it's this exponential and fast compute time
that makes them really great,
which means you could add just way more constraints,
way more variables into your model
and make that better and better and better.
So we certainly see a lot of great technologies
in the future that can help with weather and infrastructure
and how they connect together.
<v Barbara>David, I'd like to add on to this</v>
a little bit.
<v ->Yeah, please.</v>
<v ->So Honduras, we are dealing with, like,</v>
they had a weather event.
And had we been able to see that ahead of time,
now their port is stuck.
Like, they can't ship anything out of their port,
so we're trying to help them move products
out of their port.
So now their economy has stopped,
like, their economy is stuck,
because they can't ship out their crabs
and their other kind of high-end things
that they use for their economy.
So we're going in there and helping solve that immediately.
But if there were weather models that said,
"Hey, this is hurricane season,
these hurricanes are gonna come in here at these times,"
you could potentially reroute those products
into a whole different area
so that they can still have their economy functioning
versus now they're stuck and-
<v ->Supply chain optimization.</v>
<v ->Yeah, we can help-</v>
<v ->Supply chain resiliency.</v>
<v ->Yeah, the resiliency</v>
of the supply chain, 'cause we know,
"Okay, we know to the centimeter,
like, the hurricane's gonna be hitting in these areas,
so now we need to migrate these products this way initially,
and then we can kind of reset it back
when the weather is better,"
and so it's a powerful-
<v ->I mean, I think this lends-</v>
<v ->Powerful use case for that.</v>
<v ->Yeah, please.</v>
<v ->Itself to governments,</v>
businesses all have to have a weather strategy, right,
because of the changes in the climate.
So you no more can just predict it or ignore that,
that would be not responsible to do that.
So I agree, like, if they had a weather strategy and a plan,
you know, because AI is giving us that ability
to better predict, right?
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->Especially down to a storm scale level,</v>
which is really critical.
<v ->Well, they know,</v>
and they know, right?
Because every year this happens.
So it's not like it's a surprise,
but they just weren't prepared.
Maybe it was a little bit worse this year than last year,
or the year before, but it's a constant thing.
And it's absolutely impacting their supply chain now
and their economy has stopped.
So at that, you know, it's unfortunate,
like, we all know about North Carolina,
but like this country, their GDP is going down,
because they can't ship any products out.
<v ->Sure.</v>
<v ->Well, and so,</v>
we're talking about AI, obviously, on this panel.
It's a hot topic.
Everyone is very excited by the new Nvidia announcement
that we heard this week at CES.
So there's lots of talk about artificial intelligence,
but what about human intelligence?
I mean, where does the humanity intersect
with this artificial intelligence?
How do you see AI and human intelligence working together,
and what's the potential
for that collaboration to look like?
So I throw that open to the panel,
whoever wants to jump in on this.
<v ->So I'm working with a company called Reliable,</v>
and they have a mix of AI and human intelligence.
So what they do is they try and take bias out of the data,
because it's not only about how the model is created,
it's also how the model algorithmically starts
looking at the data, and then surfacing data.
So they have the ability to auto-tag
and also for you to tag it yourself
so that the data ends up becoming more robust
and more clear so that the accuracy is better.
And so that product kind of helps surface
all of the different pieces of data
that AI could utilize there.
It's not just, you know, we talked a lot,
okay, I'll leave it there.
<v ->Yeah, sure.</v>
<v ->I'll leave it there.</v>
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>
<v ->Thank you.</v>
<v ->If I can provide a sort of mental model or taxonomy,</v>
or if you wanna call it, for AI and humans,
one way to think about it is,
think of it in four stages.
One is like a human only, right?
So any task that's given,
and depending on the variety of tasks,
but tasks are human only
with very little assistance from AI.
The next level is human-in-the-loop.
And this is where, again, AI does some of the work,
but it's really meant to assist the human being themselves
and, you know, the human, like us,
maybe using ChatGPT once in a while to ask questions,
that's human-in-the-loop.
Well, the next after that is human-on-the-loop,
and this is where AI is doing a lot of the planning,
it's doing a lot of the planning, a lot of the execution,
but key decision making or supervision
happens from the human side.
And then, the last stage is AI only,
which is where the AI system is in full control
of all execution planning, of task operations, et cetera.
<v ->I think to add to Prachi's point,</v>
you know, AI's been around for, what, 10 plus years,
and it really started with automation.
It was very simple.
It's like workflow processing automation,
making sure things get routed to the appropriate region,
department, agency, whatever that might be.
And then, the second wave was more on predictive analysis,
which is what we talked about.
So you could still do predictive analysis.
AI has a lot of different flavors.
It's not just generative AI,
which is now the third wave which we're in right now.
And I do feel with the evolution of LLMs,
we're not quite there yet to be fully automated, Prachi,
like, you know, with the only AI
being the central hub of everything,
just because you brought up bias,
there's a consistency, there's transparency,
there's accountability,
there's all of these things that have to be in place
before you can fully rely and trust a robot
or a machine to be able to do everything.
We're getting really good at reasoning,
we're getting really good at logic, and processing,
and making sure...
Like, I was recently using NotebookLM for fun,
and I was trying to create a podcast.
And I love how it has the ums and the ahs,
so we can take the transcript of this entire session
and put it into an LLM,
and it can generate a podcast between the four of us.
That's where we're at right now with human-like feeling.
So I feel we're kind of there, but not really there,
so you still need to have humans in the loop
to be able to augment, to be able to test,
to verify the accuracy,
especially, since our data is kind of all over the map.
And you had mentioned silos before.
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->Like, especially</v>
in government, if we're trying to be a smart city,
you cannot be smart without having your data integrated
so you can see a cohesive picture.
John Smith is maybe in 19 different systems
in different ways.
John A. Smith, J.A. Smith, John Smith,
but it's the same person.
So it really comes back to personalization of services,
really knowing your customer,
understanding what are they here for,
and let me just provide the services
that they're looking for,
rather than them having to dig it up.
<v ->So back to the tagging,</v>
because we were talking about humans,
and I'm glad you brought that up,
Reliabl helps you do the human pieces
of that tagging.
It's not just all AI doing it, humans are doing it as well.
So that we have a say in how we wanna see
the data and information that we wanna see from AI.
<v ->I mean, I think it's a combination, right?</v>
Man and machine really, that's what we have always done.
We call it actually human-over-the-loop
in what we do in looking at all the weather models,
'cause, you know, it's a paradox, right?
Because AI provides just a vast amount of information,
but, in some cases, you're still needing humans
to actually make the decision
off whatever that information is surfacing.
And so I think, you know, in this stage of AI,
and I agree, we've been using it for a couple decades
actually in our weather forecasting,
it's changing now with generative AI.
But, you know, I think at this point in time,
and where we are in the AI journey,
I think, you know, the match between AI and HI,
we can really learn a lot from each other,
and it's, you know, AI's augmenting human intelligence
to help us make better decisions essentially.
<v ->Great, so we now have time</v>
for questions from the audience.
If you do have a question,
please go up to one of those two microphones
so we can hear you.
If you don't have questions I'll just keep going.
But we did wanna invite you to be part of this conversation
if there is anything you'd like to ask.
If you have a question-
<v ->Go ahead.</v>
<v ->Make sure you go to the mic so we can hear you.</v>
<v Attendee>I just had one clarification.</v>
AI is not there for the last 10 years.
It is there for 40 years, 60 years back, right?
<v ->Right.</v>
<v ->Right.</v>
<v Attendee>It is just in computational space-</v>
<v Nadia>10 plus years, yep, absolutely.</v>
<v Attendee>It's there for a long, long time.</v>
<v ->Mhmm.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>
Yes, AI was invented in World War II by Alan Turing
to crack the code on the German submarines.
So it's been around for a long time.
<v ->Very true, very true.</v>
<v ->Hi, Prachi, this is Siva.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v Attendee>And, I mean, I think this is a question</v>
for any one of the speakers here.
But, I mean, what I'm hearing
is different ways of analyzing where AI is a tool
and where it is the decision maker,
and you guys are vacillating,
because the use case is what's making it vacillating.
So from the person listening, I'm kind of wondering,
"Are you shooting left, right?
Which, what the heck?"
I mean, because I've seen the same thing in transportation.
I work in the automation, not autonomous,
I'm not there yet, but automation.
So my question to you is, while you sound vacillating,
you're not, you're deliberate.
You're trying to say there's a trust factor
and there's a use-case-based thing,
and I've known Prachi for a long time, but,
so one of you, can you help us understand
in the maturation cycle,
what will it take for us to kind of say,
"Hey, this kid's grown up?"
The AI that is, "Maybe once in a while we can let him ride
and I'll sit in the back."
<v ->So is your question, when will we have L4 mobility,</v>
fully autonomous?
<v Attendee>I mean, for that you need a whole 90 minutes,</v>
but, for this question... (laughs)
<v ->No, we don't need that.</v>
<v ->I think the question is more like,</v>
how do you do validation?
What's trustworthy AI?
What is AI insurance looking like?
<v Attendee>Yeah, when is social acceptance likely?</v>
Because it's social engineering, it's not-
<v ->Okay, so when will people trust AI?</v>
<v Attendee>When will governments,</v>
and governments are also people,
so when will systems
and institutions start trusting AI?
<v ->I have a hot take on it.</v>
My take is education is important.
So a lot of re-skilling and upskilling needs to happen,
not just within government, agencies, employees,
but also constituents, citizens, just regular people.
I think there's a lot of mistrusted places
where people are just like, "Hmm, I'm not so sure.
I don't wanna give government more information
than I have to," since we're on the government panel.
So I feel there needs to be a bit
of one transparency aspect to it.
So what are we gonna do with your data?
I think that needs to happen.
<v Attendee>Yeah, especially with your background</v>
being the county.
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Thanks.</v>
<v ->No, absolutely.</v>
So I think that's kind of part of it.
I feel there needs to be an active movement
towards making sure that we are providing,
there's a lot of free tools right now to educate,
but are people actually grabbing them?
Google does it, Salesforce does it.
We have Trailhead, it teaches you soft skills, hard skills,
AI, whatever you need to know.
But I feel like are people actually utilizing
that information to learn, absorb,
and try to get comfortable within,
and then say, "Ah, these are the risks.
Here's how we can mitigate it."
But that transparency level's not quite there yet.
<v ->AI is rather ubiquitous actually.</v>
When you go to McDonald's you use AI.
I call the bank the AI phone weave,
which is the most annoying thing when you call.
It's so annoying.
I mean, AI is rather ubiquitous.
Most people don't recognize that they're using AI
on a daily basis in life.
So when is it gonna be massly adopted or massly accepted?
We're stealthily accepting it,
because it's out there in the real world every day.
If you go to certain things, AI is there.
We don't call it AI, we don't call the,
I call it the AI phone weave for the bank.
But when you call the bank and they have all the prompts,
we don't call that an AI specifically,
but it is a form of AI.
<v Sheri>I think with any change</v>
there's always gonna be a long tail, right,
of people that there's gonna be the early adopters.
But I agree with you, it's a silence accepter,
it's been happening for decades where AI is being used.
You know, it came to the forefront because of ChatGPT.
<v ->That's right.</v>
<v ->That's how consumers</v>
really found out about it.
Which is good, but for all the companies
that have been doing it for decades,
they're like, "What the heck?
We've been using this for a long time."
<v ->Exactly.</v>
<v ->And so I do agree,</v>
but there's always gonna be a long tail to anything.
I mean, look how long it took for us to all get on HD,
to get on to use (audio drops) phones, right?
I think it'll happen much faster than those technologies,
but I still think it's gonna take time to trust, right?
<v Prachi>I disagree a little bit,</v>
just a quick point.
<v ->Sure.</v>
<v ->I think AI, Siva, to your point,</v>
I forget where you're sitting now,
is just it's use-case dependent.
It's gonna take a lot longer for defense applications.
It's gonna take maybe shorter if it's a productivity app
that has no financial or safety consequences,
yeah, then use case is immediate.
<v ->Great, quick question from the audience.</v>
This is the last question before we wrap up.
<v Attendee>So I have, it's more of a curiosity</v>
than a question for Ms. Bickham.
What was the first DAO
you launched, what city?
What was the first city to use a DAO?
Is there one?
<v ->We were looking at using a DAO,</v>
so in 2019, part of the pandemic,
I had four smart cities that I was working on,
some in Africa, some not, some in the Caribbean.
And we were looking at utilizing DAOs
as governance and compliance,
and we were gonna layer AI
on certain of the types of that, those DAOs,
because we knew that autonomy was important,
we knew the data was important,
and we knew that the communities,
it was more important for the communities
to actually have more of a say
than having a centralized way
of having a say in the community.
So if you're in The Bahamas,
this is one of the ones we were doing,
like The Bahamas is not just one island,
it's, like, multiple islands.
So we were looking at doing a DAO,
because communities were not gonna be
in one centralized place.
<v Attendee>Yeah, it seems like it'll be easier to start</v>
in an emerging environment
versus something that's already established.
<v ->Well, it depends.</v>
I mean, most of these I was doing from dirt.
So, like, most of the smart cities
I work on are kind of like from zero, I'll call it,
versus something that was already there.
But when you're creating something from kind of zero,
you wanna reimagine how do you really want governance?
How do you want governments?
How do you want communities to interact?
How do you want people to work with each other?
How do you want people to interact, right?
We're gonna have the extremes.
You're gonna have the ones that wanna do everything,
and then you're gonna wanna have the ones
that opt out of everything and they're paranoid.
We know that, so where is kind of the middle ground.
And so we kind of looked at the middle ground, and said,
"This is how we wanna reimagine a smart city,"
because we're thinking about the future.
Because the quantum computer is coming,
'cause Google had a crack on their chip
or something had happened with them.
We watch that very carefully.
And when that comes,
then how are you now going to govern anything?
<v David>So we're getting close to the end of time,</v>
so we're gonna get into lightning round.
<v ->All right.</v>
<v ->We're gonna go down</v>
the panel on two questions,
and you'll each give an answer.
So the first question is,
what's one AI trend that has surprised you
in the past year?
Nadia, lead us off.
<v ->Ah, I would say-</v>
<v ->Hot takes.</v>
<v ->Hot take, okay, I would say, you know what?</v>
I use AI for everything and so do my kids, number one.
They use it for school.
I have the privilege of teaching
at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas
as a part-time professor.
Every single student is using some level of ChatGPT or AI
to be able to augment essays, and answers, and all that.
So that's not going away.
<v ->Ubiquity, yeah, okay.</v>
<v ->Flat out, so I think that's been a bit of a,</v>
how quickly everybody has absorbed it
and using it in the day to day,
I think it's been a bit of a surprise,
especially since it's been out
for like the last 10 plus years.
<v David>All right, Barbara, hot take.</v>
<v ->Hot take, years ago-</v>
<v ->Surprising trend.</v>
<v ->Hot take, I said, years ago,</v>
there would be no reason to learn how to code.
I said that in 2016.
So earlier, in 2024, I literally,
I'm in the CTO Forum,
and all the CTOs have figured out how to not code
and be more strategic.
So they're utilizing all the GPTs,
they're creating all their own LLMs,
they're creating all their own algorithmic methodologies
in order to advance coding faster
so that these large companies now can,
something that two weeks, can take maybe three days.
<v ->Sheri.</v>
<v ->I think it's interesting</v>
how quickly AI has been adapted into HR systems.
I mean, that is the human connection point, right?
And I think it's fascinating on all aspects
of hiring in HR.
It's really, it's almost pretty much taken over
that type of environment,
and I think that that's really interesting,
'cause that's where you kind of feel
some of the most trusted pieces of your company.
So I think that's interesting.
<v ->Prachi.</v>
<v ->Yeah, what's been interesting is just how large</v>
these models are and how much data they need.
And a challenge maybe to this room and this conference is,
can have AI models for smaller data sets,
and especially an infrastructure is engineering data sets.
And, you know, you don't have too many of the same
to be tagging everything.
So that would be a kind of challenge is,
like, can we work on smaller data sets?
<v ->All right, great, well, I wanna thank our panelists,</v>
Prachi Vakharia, Sheri Bachstein,
Barbara Bickham, and Nadia Hansen.
And thank you all for joining us here
on this discussion about AI and smart cities.
