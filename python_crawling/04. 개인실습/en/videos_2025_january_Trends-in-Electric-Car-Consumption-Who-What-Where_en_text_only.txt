<v ->Thank you for joining us here for our session today.</v>
Today we're gonna be talking about EV trends
and the outlook for 2025.
My name is Martine Paris,
and I am a Features Correspondent for the BBC,
and I also write a column for Forbes on AI.
And joining me here on stage today
is Tina Jeffress of Panasonic,
Dr. Sabrina Rathgeber of Bosch,
and Sujay Sharma of BP Pulse.
And so before we begin, I just would like you guys
to tell us a little bit about yourselves
and the role that you are playing in the EV ecosystem.
Tina, let's begin with you.
<v ->Sure.</v>
Hi, Tina Jeffress.
I lead Energy and Sustainability Policy
for Panasonic North America
and Panasonic Energy North America.
So Panasonic Energy is one of the world's largest producers
of lithium ion battery cells for EV applications.
We make cylindrical cells in Reno, Nevada,
and we're excited to soon open our new plant
in De Soto, Kansas.
So excited to talk about where we sit in the ecosystem
and all of the growth we're seeing domestically here
in the US.
<v ->So, hi, everyone.</v>
My name is Sabrina Rathgeber.
I'm working for Bosch Manufacturing Solutions.
So we are the turnkey provider
for manufacturing equipment from Bosch.
And within that area,
I'm responsible globally for the battery business.
So everything around manufacturing of battery,
but also for sure new technologies
which are evolving in the upcoming next years.
<v ->Hi, everyone.</v>
I'm Sujay Sharma.
I run BP Pulse,
and if you're asking what is BP Pulse,
it is the EV charging brand of the energy major BP.
We operate in 12 different countries worldwide
with over 40,000 charge points.
And we are just getting in the process
of scaling up our EV charging presence
across the United States.
So I run that business.
<v ->Thank you.</v>
All right, so as we all know,
EV adoption has been lagging in the US.
It's behind nations like Norway and China.
Why is this, Tina?
<v ->Yeah, I'd like to first say</v>
that I think we're still seeing
very consistent growth in the industry.
So Panasonic currently makes 66 batteries a second
in Reno, Nevada, about billions of cells a year.
And so we have been really happy
to be a part of mass adoption of EVs in the US.
We were a part of bringing the first affordable EVs
that were still high performance online.
And so I think we're continuing to see that progress,
and I anticipate in the next year
we're going to see so much of the work
that's gone into date, really come to life.
Just earlier this week, we announced our,
a new partnership with Lucid Motors
to provide cells to their new SUV, the Gravity.
And already there we're gonna see 450 miles of range,
and that will also be with the mass adoption,
bringing down costs over time.
So I think many of the concerns that we hear about,
and we'll talk about today,
we're already making great progress on.
<v ->I just wanna ask you,</v>
I mean Panasonic also supplies the batteries to Tesla,
is that correct, and other car makers, is that right?
Here in the US?
<v ->We provide multiple OEMs, yes.</v>
<v ->Okay, thank you.</v>
That's okay.
<v ->Yeah, so Tina, I can totally agree on what you say.</v>
So generally, we from Bosch also still see that until 2030,
we expect EV range from 30 to 40% globally.
So we still see that the market is growing,
even though the growth has slowed down,
to the predicted growth rates we saw a couple of years ago.
So however, coming back to your question,
if I can give some insights on what they did in Norway,
they, from the government, supported really the sales of EV.
So how did they do that?
There is no tax if you purchase a new EV car in Norway.
And in addition to that,
there are other amenities like special lanes
where you can drive with your EV,
free parking in the cities.
And also because they wanted to push that business further,
they build up lots of charging stations on their own
from the governmental side.
So by doing so, they achieved the fantastic results.
So last year, sorry, last year already, 2024,
the overall market share of EV in new cars
was 89% for just pure electric cars.
And for this year,
Norway is already targeting 100% as their own target.
So they will just, they target to only,
yeah, get new cars sold as an EV.
<v ->Yeah, I mean I used to run our China business</v>
in EV charging before this.
And you know, what it comes down to is choice and economics
on the electric vehicle side of things.
Choice wise, we have a growing number of models and cars
coming in at different price points in the US,
but admittedly, you know,
they've mostly been Teslas up until recently,
but that trend is now starting to change.
So as there's more choice,
I think that will lead to more adoption.
The other point that's really important in all of this
is economics, making cars, nice cars
that people want to drive that are economically friendly.
And there's an industry component to this
that the industry can facilitate
by making cars that are more economical, and that's coming.
And there's another part of this,
which colleagues here have spoken about,
which is incentive, subsidies, what have you,
and that encourages adoption as well.
And I would not say that, I mean the US is today at 10%.
I think as of last year, 2024,
10% of new car sales were EVs.
Just way back in 2019, it was 2%.
So we've gone from 2% to 10% in five years.
It's good progression, and it'll continue to grow.
<v ->And I think California penetration is above 25%,</v>
but that's because California has had a lot of incentives,
many of which are now gone.
But incentives do seem to play a role.
Price is a big issue.
We, seems I've been told,
the magic number is to try to get a car under $30,000
for over 300 mile range.
So I think the Chevy Equinox has come out.
Have you, what are your thoughts
on other American made car makers being able to do the same,
offer the same type of affordability?
<v ->Yeah, I think we are getting closer to price parity</v>
on EVs and ICE vehicles across all segments.
It's going to take time, but we're getting there.
Already, if you purchase a vehicle
that is around the same price point, ICE, EV,
research from the Zero Energy Transportation Association
in DC
shows that you can expect anywhere
between eight and 12 grand in lifecycle savings on the EV.
So we do need to really,
there's definitely an education component here
on showing people that it's not just sticker price,
it's also about the reduced maintenance,
not buying fuel, and all of the other efficiencies
that you get from a cost perspective when you own an EV.
And of course on the sticker price point,
incentives like the 30D tax credit,
as well as those credits that support the manufacturers
and the materials providers
are really helping to bring down costs
and make these vehicles more accessible for everyone.
<v ->Yeah, I totally agree.</v>
I mean, if you look on the price point
from an electric vehicle,
the biggest portion is coming from the battery.
And although from the battery point of view,
the material is also still a big portion,
but there's also a lots of cost,
yeah, which is coming from the production.
And in terms of production efficiency,
a lot of things develop the recent years.
I mean many of us have heard
that especially the cell manufacturing are suffering
and having output,
but we also see same things about the module manufacturing.
So especially here within Bosch,
we have great technology to ensure a more stable production
and to increase the output.
And if we have an increased efficiency in the production,
this will then also lower in the price of the total battery.
<v ->Yeah, I think just building on that,</v>
and my colleagues here will know this better.
I mean, battery pack prices are hovering around
that 100, magical $100 per kilowatt hour number.
I mean I think just in the last year,
I was reading they've dropped about 15 or 20%
from the year before.
So pack prices are getting cheaper,
economies of scale are growing,
and we've got I think 40 or $50 billion now
that's going into EV manufacturing
or EV supporting sort of industries in the US
and will be going live in the next couple of years.
So, and a lot more models coming out with that as well.
So I think those economies are coming in.
And I think the other thing is,
as you look at the other markets,
you look at Europe for example,
and you look at the trend of pricing of vehicles in Europe
over the last four or five years,
if you had looked at it four or five years ago,
the average price was about 60,000 euros
or somewhere in that range.
Today, that price is trending downwards
more into the 30 to 40,000 euro range.
We'll see the same sort of thing happen here in the US.
So it's coming,
and it's probably coming in the next couple of years
if it's,
and then everything that Tina spoke about
in terms of the efficiency of operating the vehicle
will just make it that much more beneficial.
<v ->Let's talk about ubiquity of charging stations</v>
or charging options.
Maybe, Sujay, you can take this,
but what can we look forward to in this year
in terms of hot trends in charging,
whether it's in-home or new venues
that we could start to see?
Is there any, are there any initiatives
behind helping existing gas stations adopt
or add charging stations to their space?
<v ->Yeah, so especially on highways for example,</v>
there is NEVI funding,
at least that exists currently,
which is available to put in charging
along highway corridors.
And that's incentivized a lot of companies
to put in charging at those locations where it's needed,
at 50 to 100 miles sort of intervals.
And with that incentive,
there are requirements around uptime,
which is an area that we are quite focused on,
is having a good customer experience.
It comes back to customer experience.
Customer choice, customer experience,
you know, that's sort of the theme.
And having good reliability,
having good uptime, having good conveniences.
So BP operates eight and a half thousand
BP branded or Amoco branded,
Thorntons branded, TravelCenters of America branded,
these are all BP brands,
stores across the United States with us by ourselves,
or with our partners.
And all of these create choice for the consumer.
You know, when they are waiting for the car to charge,
they can go in, have a meal, do whatever they need to.
So those conveniences are important,
and we see that our consumers who are in the EV space
do like that way of charging,
of going to the traditional sort of gas station.
But in addition to that,
consumers are also consuming their charging differently.
So for example, a few months back,
we announced a collaboration with Simon Properties,
and at malls and destination locations as well.
Fast charging, not just slow charging,
not level two charging, but fast charging
is becoming more ubiquitous and penetrating more deeply.
And so these kinds of collaborations
will become more important as well to give consumers choice.
<v ->Is BP happy with the rate of change this past year?</v>
Because with all the NEVI funding
and funding from the Infrastructure Act and so forth,
there has been criticism
that not enough of the charging network has been expanded.
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->What are your thoughts on that?</v>
<v ->I think, so this is a, it's a very good question.</v>
So really, there are a couple of things
that are important for charging, three things.
We call place, power and permitting, right?
And the problem, so place is real estate.
We don't have that problem.
As I just spoke about, the 8,000 plus locations.
Power is a big challenge, right?
Power remains a continuous challenge,
and that's something we continue to work with,
and I think other industry players as well
continue to work with the authorities on that.
And then permitting is another big one.
I mean, I'll give you a data point,
in China to build a site end to end,
from where you identify the real estate,
negotiate the lease, to getting it online,
a high voltage site is 90 days.
Here, it'll take us anywhere between,
you know, 18 months to an eternity,
depending on which jurisdiction you're in.
So I think we have to learn from other geographies,
we have to look at other geographies,
and we've gotta then fine tune our approach to that.
And I think that still exists as an opportunity
for us in the US.
<v ->That's eyeopener.</v>
Okay, I think there's somebody
in charge of the Office of Efficiency coming on board
that might expedite things.
Okay, let's talk top trends for 2025.
Americans have an obsession,
there is a belief that Americans have an obsession
with the need to escape the zombie apocalypse,
to have a car that has enough range
that in the case of an emergency,
and we have a lot of natural disasters,
one going on right now,
where we feel like we need to get in our car and go.
We wanna go far, we have a country that's what, 3,000 miles,
and I'm sure that's the actual range
everybody would feel most comfortable with.
Even though we only use the car about, what, 50 miles a day.
So the question is,
for 2025, do you see Americans adopting plug-in hybrids
at a faster clip than maybe EVs
while we work out the situation of less expensive cars
and better charging options?
Because some of the plug-in hybrids right now are, what,
getting like 600 miles, or better, 750.
What are your thoughts on that?
<v ->Yeah, happy to start on this one.</v>
First off, I think plug-in hybrids are a bridge.
They are a way to get people addicted to driving electric.
Personally, my husband was not willing to buy an EV.
I had been an evangelist for years,
started working for Panasonic.
I was desperate to get an EV for our family.
He was not interested, we got a plug-in hybrid.
Two months in,
he said, I'm in, let's get on the list for a Rivian.
And he was ready.
And our range was only 20 miles.
And with 20 miles of an electric range a day,
he was like, oh, this is easy, this is no problem.
So now we are an EV family.
And so I do think when people
are uncomfortable with the idea of driving electric,
it can be a super powerful tool.
But from a resource perspective,
from a lifecycle emissions perspective,
it does not give us the benefits of a full EV.
So I think it's a great tool,
but I would not want that
to replace the trend toward electrification.
<v ->Yeah, so maybe from a European perspective,</v>
the story is a bit different,
because gas prices are really, really high.
And so if you use an hybrid,
it doesn't even matter if it's a plug-in hybrid
or just a mild hybrid.
The hybrids are really common in Europe
because they just help you
to reduce the fuel consumption that much.
So even if you then have
like the electric drive and the ICE both in your car,
it's still so helpful to drop the consumption down.
So this is an addition topic, at least for Europe,
why hybrids are really a huge interest
for the end customers.
<v ->Yeah, I think the only thing I'd go back to</v>
what I said earlier about economics and choice,
it's, you know, consumer choice.
What we've seen more of is, you know,
in the past decade, it was more about gas and diesel.
There was not that much choice.
And now, and you see this in the advertising
of many of the OEMs, they talk about choice.
You can get a gas power train,
you can get an electric power train, you can, you know?
And so I think where consumers are going with this
is that they want to have the choice,
and then depending on what suits
their lifestyle or their needs, they will pick and choose.
You know, for, I know a lot of folks
who don't maybe have the comfort of, you know,
are not comfortable with EVs,
and so their primary car is a gas car,
but their secondary car is an EV car.
I mean we have, you know, what,
2.5 vehicles on average per household or whatever in the US.
So there's plenty of love to go around I think
for all power trains.
<v ->Yeah.</v>
Okay, another hot topic for 2025, power.
Not just nuclear power, all types of power.
AI is eating the world, and EVs, and AVs along with it,
impacting grids, EVs may even help power grids.
What are your thoughts on power?
<v ->I think as we transition to a fully electrified world,</v>
power is front of mind for everyone.
There is definitely a misnomer
that until we fully transition our energy system,
that it doesn't make sense to drive an EV.
So first things first,
anywhere you drive an EV in the US,
regardless of whether that's a coal-dominant grid
or fully renewable,
you're seeing lower lifecycle emissions over time.
So the environmental benefits are really clear.
What we have to figure out now
is how EVs can be an asset for the grid,
and not further exacerbate the power shortages
we're seeing throughout the country.
Panasonic actually has a business
that's working on this issue,
figuring out how to electrify fleets,
and how to manage the charging on these fleets
that have predictable routes
so that you can do it at a time
when maybe power might be curtailed,
because there's excess solar in California,
and not charge those fleets at a time
when there's a huge demand for power.
One of my pet interests, because I have young children,
is electrified school buses.
And they could be an amazing asset for the grid,
because they can be, they don't have to be charged
and ready to operate when power demand is at their highest.
So at seven o'clock, you don't need to plug in
an electric bus,
it can charge overnight when everyone else is sleeping.
So there are definitely use cases where the grid,
where the vehicles can be an asset for the grid
beyond just the V2X applications
that we all love to talk about.
So I think that EVs are a part of the solution here.
<v ->Is Panasonic working on solutions</v>
for bidirectional powering,
meaning power going back to the grid from the EV.
<v ->It's definitely of interest,</v>
but it's not an area that I've particularly focused on.
<v Martine>Sabrina?</v>
<v ->But so seems that we're perfectly on the same page</v>
all the time, Tina,
because I only can agree again to just what you said.
Like in Europe, we saw last year,
or especially in Germany even,
63% of the energy we were using was renewable.
Even though the weather was not so good,
we had lots of rain,
but still with all the well tanks and wind, we got like 63%.
But again, we also see here challenges
about how we can balance it.
And this is also something Bosch is working on,
because for sure then we need
a different battery management system.
We need to see how we can use the batteries in the car
to balance the grid.
But this is something we have to do.
And again, looking to the success story of Norway,
we really need to have a clear commitment
also from the government,
because in the end, also the infrastructure
needs to be able to cover that.
But if everybody's pulling in the same direction,
we for sure can easily realize that also EVs are just,
yeah, energized with 100% electric energy.
<v ->How far away is the US from transitioning</v>
from coal and other carbon disastrous sources for the grid
to renewables?
How far away are we?
<v ->Yeah, happy to start there.</v>
So we operate our, we're building our facility
in De Soto, Kansas, which has a good amount of wind energy,
and it's really close to the national average of renewables,
so around 30%.
We are, across the country,
continuing to see coal plant retirements.
And even where we're not seeing retirements,
we're seeing those plants run less
because they are not as efficient, they don't make sense.
One of my favorite anecdotes
is that during one of the really disastrous winter storms
last year,
I think everyone thinks that in the extreme scenarios,
you need fossil fuels.
In this particular storm, the solar outperformed,
the wind energy outperformed,
and the coal stacks were frozen.
And so the utility was having to blow dry the coal stacks
in order to run their plants.
So the economics are there.
We may not see price parity every single day,
but the levelized cost of renewable energy is going down,
and now it's just about getting things online.
So it gets back to permitting,
which is I think what we could tie everything to here,
but getting permitting in place, getting more transmission.
We have the technology now
<v ->What about ethanol?</v>
That the crops, you know, being transitioned
to renewable fuel.
I mean, are you guys looking at that at all?
I know that came up during our panel call.
<v ->Yeah, maybe I can say something.</v>
So from a Bosch perspective for sure, we also work on that.
Yeah, that we kind of would be able
to fire this kind of fuel.
But just from a general overall
energy calculation point of view,
it just doesn't make sense,
because the energy output you get
of this kind of energy storage like ethanol,
it's actually not attractive at all.
<v ->Yeah, and then I know we're talking about EVs,</v>
but the hydrogen also is always comes up.
Is that ever gonna happen?
I mean there's no hydrogen stations.
What are your thoughts on hydrogen?
<v ->Okay, so my thoughts on hydrogen,</v>
I mean, again, like in Bosch strategy,
we still believe that hydrogen will be a big thing,
because we don't see that electric trucks
will really bridge the huge distances.
And from our perspective,
the only good solution to follow that up is by hydrogen.
And also maybe we use hydrogen for storage of energy.
I mean we still have to think about
how we can create energy all over the globe,
and how can we store and transport it.
With hydrogen, we have a solution in our hand,
which is already working really well at the moment,
but still we see the market is hesitating.
So we don't know how long it will take
till this topic is really starting to outperform,
but it will happen.
<v ->And we've been talking about hydrogen for, what,</v>
<v ->Yeah, I mean electrolyzer technology is, I don't know,</v>
probably older than that, right?
So it's not new.
I think the question is, you know, use of hydrogen
and industrial use versus transportation,
which is kind of what you're talking about.
And I think the use for industrial use cases
is a little bit easier,
and to make the economics network is a little bit easier.
And we can probably see that come to fruition.
And BP has a number of projects we've announced globally,
one in Europe, one in Australia
that we are pursuing in that space.
But transportation is, to your point,
a little bit of a different animal,
because you've got to, you know,
compress it, decompress it, move it, it's explosive,
it's under pressure, it's difficult.
It's difficult and it's economically challenging.
And there's a lot of very smart folks, in Bosch, I'm sure,
and other companies that have, BP, that are working on it.
But that probably will take a little bit of more time
for the transportation use case, I think.
<v ->Is BP looking at nuclear power for powering?</v>
<v ->We're not currently in the nuclear power business.</v>
That's what I'll say.
<v ->I had to ask.</v>
Okay, autonomy.
Is the future of EVs autonomous?
<v ->I think the short answer is yes, and but.</v>
I think it'll take us a while,
a little bit of time to get there.
I think the US is gonna take the lead in that space,
because from a regulatory perspective,
again, back to maybe permitting in a way,
the US has been a little bit more open-minded about it,
and or has been more advanced rather than open-minded.
Open-minded is perhaps not the right term,
but more advanced in terms of what some of the companies
that are even presenting here are doing.
We've had some that have succeeded, some that are trying,
some that have failed.
I think it'll definitely be a hot topic
over the next five years.
How quickly it scales is a different question.
And does it scale uniformly across the entire US,
and when does it transfer to other geographies like Europe?
Those, there's probably smarter people
that can answer that question.
<v ->What are your thoughts on autonomy driving EV adoption?</v>
<v ->Definite, I mean, we can see autonomy</v>
has a very good use case for transportation,
for goods delivery, for mobility in general.
So it is definitely,
if you can get to the maturity on the technology,
it's going to scale.
It's the question of how and when do you get
to the maturity on the technology?
And I think also from an EV charging perspective,
then the charging solutions that you need maybe today
where there's an individual driving the vehicle,
versus tomorrow where it's autonomous, you don't, you know,
you can bring it back to a base to charge,
which doesn't have to
maybe be in an urban center, et cetera.
So as we look at how we design our networks
for charging for the future,
these are some of the things that we consider
and our thinking about as well as we go into the future.
<v ->Sabrina?</v>
<v ->So actually I hope that autonomy</v>
is not driving the EV business,
because I hope that the EV business
is much faster than autonomy.
At least if I look from a European perspective,
I mean, totally agree.
Regulations is a big thing, especially in Europe,
and what you just said earlier, Sujay,
about customer's choice.
So at the moment, we see that the customers in Europe
are a bit more hesitant about having more autonomy level
or higher autonomy level in the car.
But on the long run, for sure.
It's just a point of efficiency
that if you run many, many cars autonomous,
it's just much more efficient
rather than everyone just driving on its own,
and so can keep the battery in a much better working point.
And in addition, also when it comes to charging,
you can much better balance the demand of energy
you need in the grid.
<v Martine>Any last thoughts?</v>
<v ->I think just in this coming year,</v>
I'm so excited to see the realization
of the domestic EV economy.
Between all of the companies, including Panasonic,
bringing hundreds of thousands of jobs to the US,
the billions in investment that you cited.
I think we're gonna see a lot of change in this next year,
and we're excited to be a part of it.
<v ->So I'm gonna go to a lightning round with the speakers,</v>
and then I'm gonna turn the questions to the audience
'cause I know a lot of you came specifically for this panel.
And so I don't know if there's somebody here with a mic,
or if it's just okay to stand up
and then we'll repeat the questions
so it gets on the recording.
But lightning round, what are your predictions for 2025?
<v ->I think I already gave mine,</v>
but I'm excited to see all these factories come online
and see how that influences adoption over time.
I think that when people are really a part
of making batteries here in the US, making EVs in the US,
it's going to be so much more normalized to buy an EV.
When your neighbor works for an electric OEM,
when your neighbor buys an EV,
it's so much easier to do so yourself.
<v Martine>Interesting.</v>
<v ->Yeah, again, I would say,</v>
especially looking on a battery,
the efficiency is like the key topic.
So this comes for sure out of the production,
making the production more efficient,
but also, I mean we see so many new trends,
new type of cell chemistry,
then we see already at the horizon,
all solid state batteries coming up.
And I'm really curious what will happen
and how the development in this segment is going on
because this can be for sure a boost on EV sales.
<v ->I think for me, I have to say,</v>
making fast charging more reliable and ubiquitous.
I struggle with saying that word, by the way,
if I said it wrong.
Is it's because, you know, the experience has been
quite variable in the US, I would say,
over the past few years.
But the major players like ourselves and others
are really making a concerted effort and investment
into creating that opportunity
and a great experience for the consumer.
And so I'm looking forward
to being a part of that revolution
and enabling that revolution
with our partners and my teammates, so.
<v ->We were supposed to have X paying on the panel.</v>
And so the last question would've been,
is the future of cars or the future of EVs, flight?
But I'm gonna leave that for the audience
to make their own conclusions,
and turn the questions over to the audience.
This gentleman here.
<v Speaker 1>One of the top three questions I get asked,</v>
and I want to hear a professional's answer is battery life.
<v ->Okay, what are the technology advances for battery life?</v>
<v ->Yeah, I think I'd love to hear your perspective</v>
from the tech and R&amp;D side,
but I think what we're seeing
is that battery life is already far exceeding
what we hope to see at this stage in EV adoption.
I'm really excited about recycling of battery materials.
We've been challenged in that space thus far
because there just aren't enough batteries retiring.
So Panasonic makes premium cells that are longer lifed,
and are really staying on the road
longer than anyone anticipated.
So personally that's not one of my huge concerns.
<v ->Yeah, I can again agree,</v>
because what we see from batteries returning from the field,
there's state of health
is much higher than we would've been expected, yeah?
So many of these batteries, as of now already,
are now used in energy storage devices and their SOH,
so state of health is among 80%.
So even after like 10, 12 years being run in an EV,
so still the battery is quite good,
especially if you don't have this high peaks
which of energy consumption.
So this is why you can just easily put them
into energy storage.
And in addition, recycling will be point in EU,
there are regulations already,
which amount of, yeah, recycled mass
you have to insert into your battery cells,
which you newly manufacture
and the value will increase the next years.
<v ->Any thoughts, Sujay?</v>
<v ->No, I have nothing to add to the experts.</v>
<v ->I'd like to ask the audience,</v>
how many of you have bought a used EV?
Not many.
A gentleman over here.
My understanding, and a a couple of people in the audience,
my understanding is that they're seeing the fear
of buying a used EV is that the battery might die,
that's the end of the car, they're so expensive.
But I guess Tesla had released a study saying,
actually the battery is built for the life of the vehicle
and is going beyond 10 years, 20 years,
you know, I mean it's been around.
There is a very high expectation
for battery life these days.
So, and actually I wrote an article for the BBC on used EVs.
If I see you after, I can send you the link.
Okay, another question please.
Yes, this gentleman here in the second row.
If you could stand up maybe.
Yes, we can hear.
<v ->Guys previously have like 100 car companies.</v>
So I was wondering based on your domain knowledge,
who gonna be the big picture or who gonna survive
in this industry?
<v ->Who's gonna survive?</v>
Well, I don't know, that's really.
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard.</v>
<v ->Sujay, can you repeat the question?</v>
<v ->Yeah, the question was sort of</v>
who's gonna survive in the EV race, I guess.
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, like previous,</v>
so many car companies are all gone, you know?
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>
I mean, there are,
so there are both sides of the story, right?
There are success stories,
and there are not so success stories.
I mean if I look, I'll use the, you know,
a China experience for example.
There's a lot of startup companies,
or that used to be considered startup companies
who have been quite successful actually.
They're not, they didn't have a pedigree
of maybe ICE vehicles,
but they've been very successful on the EV side of things.
And even here in the US,
you've had that same sort of example of course with Tesla,
and perhaps you're seeing it with Rivian as well.
So who survives, who doesn't survive,
very sort of hard to say.
I think the reality is that the technology is there,
it's evolving.
The battery pack technology is evolving fast enough,
and so I think there will be enough.
What we can say is there will be enough choices
and enough models and vehicles in the market.
Who those players are, how they run their business
is very hard to comment on.
<v ->We have time for two more questions.</v>
I see a hand there, back there.
Oh three more.
The question was mass adoption of solid state batteries.
<v ->Thanks for looking in my direction, Tina.</v>
I think you're coming from the battery company.
Oh, it's hard to predict.
I mean if you look, and almost the majority of the studies
giving forecast when this kind of technology
will start evolving.
They usually talk about the 2030s.
On the other side, we already know that last year,
CATL announced that they already have
the first all solid state battery ready.
So we need to see,
but at the moment, if I look,
it's not even clear which technology will win the race.
Yeah, there are either the oxide layer,
the sulfide layers or the polymer ones.
So even that decision isn't made yet.
So I personally would still stick with the 2030s
where I would expect that we have a clear decision
what kind of type of all solid state batteries
will win the race
and will come into mass production.
<v ->I'll weigh in as well</v>
since I did throw you under the bus on that one.
I think that there will be
many different battery technologies that succeed.
It will not be solid state, that's the be all end all.
We're going to have different battery technologies
for different use cases.
Of course, we're focused on scaling up as quickly as we can
and making as many cylindrical lithium ion cells as we can.
And we're focused on those continuous improvement tweaks
rather than changing the chemistry over time.
Already we're enabling vehicles
to go 450 miles at a reasonable price point.
So that continuous improvement is a big deal as well.
But that said, we want all battery chemistries to succeed
because there will be different use cases,
particularly on the industrial and heavy duty side.
<v ->There's a hands up in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Biggest question I get all the time is,</v>
what is the effect of the new administration
gonna have on the adoption and public?
<v ->We'll have to ask Donald Trump</v>
the answer to that question.
Is that the answer you give?
I think, look, it's really hard to say, honestly.
That's, I mean, I'll welcome inputs from the others as well.
The way we look at it as BP is, you know, what is,
we look at long-term trends.
We look at trends out to 2050.
We don't look at four year trends.
So the trend out to 2030 and 2050
is EV adoption is gonna continue to grow.
You know, the US market from our perspective
is gonna be somewhere between 25 to 30 million EVs,
we think in 2030.
And it's gonna continue to grow from there.
So all of those EVs need EV charging, right?
Today we are at, I think on average,
for every fast charging stall,
it's one fast charging stall, 200 EVs in the US.
In Europe, in Germany, I think it's about 130.
In China it's sub 50.
And in China, I would tell you
that charging is really freely available.
So there's a lot of, well, at least in certain markets,
it's really freely available.
So where do we, we have a long way to go directionally
in terms of EV growth.
We have a long way to grow in terms of EV charging growth
and reliable EV charging growth.
What happens in the next four years in the longer scheme,
larger scheme of things will probably be a blip either ways.
Whether it goes up substantially or goes down substantially,
or maybe just stays on par.
But we don't kind of make decisions based on that
from our perspective.
I don't know if you guys have anything to add.
<v ->But there were a couple more questions on this side.</v>
I think there's a hands up in the back.
Yes, yes.
<v ->Sorry, was your question on,</v>
will we still need charging if battery efficiency increases?
Is that the gist?
Do you have a view on that?
<v ->Yeah, I think your point,</v>
it's poignant in that it is self-reinforcing.
Obviously as we see continuous improvement
in charging and battery efficiency,
we'll all benefit from those gains.
So I think what I take from your question
is that we need a little bit of all of it,
but no one needs to reach this holy grail
of a thousand miles,
or charging a full battery in five minutes.
The continuous improvement on all fronts
will just vastly improve the experience.
<v ->I need the thousand mile range.</v>
I wanna thank you all.
Oh yes, please.
<v ->I was just gonna say, I think the reality,</v>
I mean even today, if you look at it,
at least the data we look at,
is most of the charging happens at home, right?
70% or what have you.
So, but you still need charging outside of that
when you are moving around.
So I think even if the robustness of batteries
or battery range increases,
there will be a need for a component
of charging outside the home.
Okay, over to you.
I took away your--
<v ->I'm so sorry, we're at time.</v>
I wanna thank this very full audience.
Thank you so much for joining us here
on a late Thursday afternoon at CES.
Please enjoy the show, and come and meet our speakers.
Thank you.
