<v Announcer>Please welcome the president</v>
of the Consumer Technology Association, Kinsey Fabrizio.
<v ->Thank you. Welcome to CES 2025.</v>
We have all watched a dramatic transformation
in the world of media over the past few years.
New technologies are making it easier than ever
to get information and personalized content,
and helping connect people around the world.
As we look to a new future for digital communication,
X Corp is setting the agenda
and reshaping the landscape for content creation,
social platforms, and how technology empowers creators
and communities to thrive.
Under CEO, Linda Yaccarino,
X Corp has become the global newsroom in your pocket
and a community that brings together global conversations
and debates, sometimes, to life.
Just like the company she leads, Linda is a trailblazer
who embodies the spirit of CES
with a career marked by innovation, resilience, and vision.
She's risen through the ranks
of some of the biggest media companies in the US,
including more than a decade,
leading global advertising and partnerships
at NBC Universal.
Linda will be joined on stage by Catherine Herridge,
an Emmy award winning investigative journalist,
and as a senior investigative correspondent
for CBS News from 2019 to 2024, and before that,
chief intelligence correspondent for Fox News Channel.
Herridge has a reputation for insightful questions
and thought provoking conversation.
I hope you are as excited as I am
for this meaningful conversation.
Please join me in welcoming Linda
and Catherine to the stage.
<v ->Thank you.</v>
<v ->Thank you.</v>
<v Kinsey>Thank you very much. Thank you for being here.</v>
Thank you for being here.
<v ->All right, Kinsey, thank you for the kind introduction.</v>
Linda, let's jump right in
and begin with the announcement from Mark Zuckerberg
earlier today that Meta is abandoning
the fact checking program
in favor of a community notes style system.
What's your response?
<v ->How cool is that? (chuckles)</v>
I think it's really exciting
that when you think about community notes
being good for the world,
think about it as this global collective consciousness,
keeping each other accountable,
at global scale, in real time.
And it couldn't be more validating than to see that
Mark and Meta realized that, right?
And when you think about community notes,
Mark and Meta realized that it's the most effective,
fastest fact checking without bias.
Mark and Meta realized there's every language
in almost 200 countries on the platform.
Fastest, most accurate.
And also it inspires great behavior.
Human behavior is inspired because when a post is noted,
it's dramatically shared less.
So that's the power of community notes.
And we say, Mark, Meta, welcome to the party.
<v ->So what do you think is driving this?</v>
Do you think it's a genuine embrace of free speech?
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
I think that people all around the world have spoken.
It's why there's almost a million community noters on X.
And when you think about it, world leaders are on X.
Where are all you, right? Mark and meta are there, right?
Global leaders, business leaders,
sharing their thoughts every day.
Where are you? Gen Z, all on X.
Authenticity matters to Gen Z.
Where are all of you?
The time now, go big on X.
Incredible validation of the power
of what's good for the world, and that's community notes.
<v ->We see all the posts on X</v>
about the big advertisers coming back.
What's the data that supports that?
<v ->Well, there's growth everywhere we look.</v>
Every corner of X, there's growth.
And when you think about the numbers, as you say,
90% of the advertisers are back on X,
and it's really about three things, right?
It's about safety.
We've already talked about community notes, right?
It's about safety, it's about product innovation,
and then it's about
that there's absolutely no surrogate for X, right?
So if you start with the safety part,
already talk about massive, massive success
of community notes, but we also rolled out
a suite of tools that didn't exist prior to acquisition.
So all the tools, marketers in this room care about, right?
So controls and settings that lets you
engage on the platform as you wish.
Brand safety and suitability partnerships,
industry certifications, check the box, we did all the work.
And think about that then leads to product innovation.
Since acquisition, we have rolled out and shipped
over 250 product innovations,
more than in the last 10 years at the company.
And one of those things, one of the best product innovations
that I usually refer to it as,
it may in fact be the holy grail of advertising products
is called Trend Genius,
because it's something that only X can do.
Is that a new innovation?
<v ->New innovation.</v>
<v ->2025?</v>
<v ->Maybe, maybe.</v>
We probably beta tested with it within the last,
I'm gonna say max, four or five months.
<v ->And how does it work?</v>
<v ->It's unbelievable.</v>
So everyone talks about what's trending on X, right?
No surrogate for X, you have to check X,
you gotta know what's going on.
So the product we developed is when a trend kicks up on X
and it hits a certain, let's call it altitude, right?
Or it's really on fire on X,
what's designed with advertisers
that we have agreements with,
their ad campaign gets fired up
and it starts to take advantage of those trends.
I'll put it in something that's easy to visualize.
So for example, during a Taylor Swift concert,
Bradley Cooper is spotted with Travis Kelsey,
and one of the boxes starts singing the Taylor Swift song.
Oh my God, Bradley Cooper is now a Swifty.
So it starts trending on the platform.
So what happened,
because of our previous agreement with LVMH,
and Bradley Cooper is an influencer for LVMH,
that campaign starts kicking and fired
in the real time conversation
that's talking about Bradley Cooper
being a Swifty in real time.
So think about for the marketers in the room,
the holy grail, right ad, right place, right time.
But now you're adding global scale in the conversation.
And the most important thing about it is
because of the uniqueness of the trends, maximum efficiency,
I mean knock every KPI out of the park
with something like Trend Genius,
because then when the trend starts to cool down,
then your campaign pauses and we move on to the next.
Imagine that, and actually, coincidentally,
I would've talked to you about this anyway
because it truly is the holy grail in ad product,
but replicated during the Golden Globes
where you had Zendaya, who's also an influencer with LVMH,
another campaign kicked
'cause the were so hot with her
showing up at the Golden Globes-
<v ->And the engagement.</v>
<v ->That was the big thing,</v>
yes, the big announcement and probably lasted long,
like what is that we see, is there an engagement?
So, so exciting, and that's what's been so effective,
but it really does speak to, when you think about it,
where there's no surrogate for X,
when you wanna know what's going on,
red carpet fashion for the Golden Globes,
it's like, I was talking about this the other night.
It was like the first time that I stopped arguing
with my husband over who has the remote for the TV,
because you had the Golden Globes going on,
and I was like dying when I was reading about,
I mean, come on, Nikki Glaser's like fire monologue.
But my husband is interested in the football game
and wanting to like, he's eyes glued,
saying this is consequential in Jahmyr Gibbs for touchdowns.
So we didn't have to fight over the remote anymore
because it was breaking in real time, in my hand.
So that's what's been so exciting
and that's really what's leading to, you know,
the growth on the platform.
And it brings you to what makes sense
is recent poll showing that Gen Z
is what's really fueling the growth of the platform.
Ad age Harris Poll talking about the number one brand
getting Gen Z's attention is X and why is that?
That's things we're talking about.
It's fashion, it's culture, it's sports, it's music,
it's gaming, in real time when they wanna see it,
which is whenever they wanna see it.
So it's been a really exciting moment,
a really exciting time at X and the platform.
<v ->So in addition to Trend Genius,</v>
what are the other big innovations
people can expect in 2025-
<v ->Okay,</v>
so we talked about that it was about three things, right?
So we talked about the safety,
we talked about the ad products, that there's also,
you know, no surrogate for X, and it leads you to,
really partnerships like only X would do.
If you're transforming the company like we are,
you want a partner with the best brands
and there's no bigger, stronger brand than the NFL.
So we just rolled out this season, the NFL Portal.
So think about, you know, we talk about X
as the global town square,
think about the NFL town square, all conversation,
all rankings, all stats, all video, all in one place.
And the season's not even done yet.
So far this year, 36 billion impressions around the NFL.
Four billion video views.
So when you look at numbers like that,
it really starts to crystallize in your mind
what this was all about in the first place,
and what the idea
of becoming the everything app really means.
<v ->Are you thinking about expanding the portal model?</v>
And I'm thinking specifically about news.
What are we expecting in 2025
in terms of news and journalism?
<v ->Well, I think it's safe to assume you will see,</v>
since we rolled out the NFL Portal soft launch
with the portal to Paris with the Olympics,
and you'll see other big leagues around the world.
So global sports portal,
it's safe to assume that that will expand.
As far as news goes-
<v ->Will there be a news portal?</v>
<v ->Well, I think it's really exciting time.</v>
As you know, this year was a seminal year for X,
particularly as it provided independent journalists,
a clear canvas to really explore their craft.
That's such a challenge for them today.
I mean, look at yourself, come on,
you knew I would check the numbers.
Your followers are up over 35% since October,
and there's a reason for that.
When we look at the sad challenge state of journalism today,
when you think that a journalism,
just under pressure from financials, constant layoffs,
you're reading about it today,
the state of journalism today in legacy media,
we know, the future of news is not legacy media.
Legacy Media News has become almost like a fan service
to make sure that you're speaking to a niche audience
to make your budget, right?
And what we wanna do is make sure
that we provide a great place for that
journalistic curiosity to return, right?
To make sure that there is a place
for journalists to come thrive and earn a great living.
We have a great creator of revenue share program
that we're very generous.
We wanna make sure that we pay off our promise
to incent the livelihoods of the journalists
who contribute to the free and fair press
that the citizens of the world are missing.
It's why what naturally rose up on the platform
where the shift in control, the shift in the narrative
is now in the user's hand,
and it's people like you and the exposes
and giving whistle blowers a safe forum
to talk about the stories
that people are really interested in,
and inspiring change, really inspiring change
by what's allowed by protected free speech
and a two-way conversation of information accessibility,
and not one way, filtered information,
of legacy news that is designed
to make you think a certain way.
It's a new day, a new era.
<v ->So it sounds like a news portal may be possible.</v>
<v ->Well, it's a really good push.</v>
I have to say, she's very good, right?
It's why I'm like pretty excited
to talk about X hiring John Stoll, right?
Former editor and bureau chief of "The Wall Street Journal,"
who's just joining us to help lead together
the news group and partnership team at X to again,
bring everything we're just talking about to life
and just expand it on such a global scale.
<v ->We're sitting down just 13 days before the inauguration</v>
of President Trump as the 47th president
of the United States.
Have you had a conversation with Elon Musk
about how this is going to work
with the Department of Government Efficiency?
<v ->Well, listen, Elon is a visionary</v>
and there is no better person that can set a vision
and a course for others to be inspired and follow.
Maybe that's the question we ask Mark Zuckerberg today,
right?
So he inspires people to follow,
and that's what I do with the team every day at the company,
is to take that vision and to bring it to life
and to execute with perfection.
But as far as DOGE is concerned, I would imagine that
surfacing, identifying government waste and inefficiency
is beneficial to all of us.
And I don't think there's two better people
than Elon and Vivek to do that.
And as Americans, we should all be rooting
for the overwhelming success of DOGE.
I would expect other countries to follow.
And I would also imagine, you know,
you said the inauguration is about two weeks away,
but I would imagine that DOGE
and the success of DOGE will talked about
as probably one of the single biggest unifiers
that will bring this country together,
and it's something we should all be rooting for
and really cheering for its success.
<v ->Do you expect Elon Musk to use X</v>
to advance his objectives for government efficiency?
<v ->Well, I think there's open dialogue on the platform</v>
and there's no more transparent user of X than Elon.
And he shares all his thoughts and feelings
and vision on what he thinks about everything
in his real life and his views on the world.
And actually think about that, that we encourage,
we should encourage all business leaders,
all government leaders to do exactly the same thing
and share more, not less.
Because whether it's Elon,
whether it's you Catherine Herridge or me Lindy Yaccarino,
we should exercise our own individual
freedom of speech rights, but also our life experiences
and what we'd like to share and inspire other people.
I was really taken a couple of weeks ago,
now that I think about it, if you saw,
Elon was posting on the platform
and having a real time conversation
with Sundar about quantum computing, like in real time.
If you haven't seen it, you gotta look it up,
and I'm watching it going, "This is the power of X."
So you have these business leaders, world leaders,
we encourage them to share more, not less.
So I think it's really with growth exploding
all over the platform.
And obviously, you talked about the election,
a validation that free two-way lane street
of accessibility to information, that's what people want.
And that authenticity now more than ever is rewarded.
It's rewarded by the people, Gen Z the most.
They want you to bring your real self
because they talk about the election
as being a podcast and a X election.
That's where that comes from
because that authenticity is new table stakes.
And I think that should inspire a lot of leaders
all around the world to have at it.
<v ->There's tremendous power in an Elon Musk post.</v>
I had checked last night, he has over 211 million followers.
And look at what's happened in the last week
with the grooming gangs scandal in the UK.
As CEO, does it cross any red lines
when you start to see reporting about the UK Prime Minister
considering changing the nature of the relationship
between the UK and the US?
<v ->Well first of all, I don't think about it as red lines.</v>
I think about it in a different way, like I said,
of really a different perspective.
It's more than less.
And what I would really say, as a mom, you are a mom,
if not for X,
where would the conversation be about
to save thousands of girls to bring people to justice
who must be brought to justice?
So I say more than less,
and those grooming trials would've stayed silent
and now we're looking at an inquiry.
So I look at bravery and vision
and the courage to do that.
So I think that, saving those girls,
preventing any other girl in the world
to be exposed to such sick depravity,
as a mother, I ask all of you,
that's what deserves a round of applause.
<v ->It is quite something to see these conversations</v>
playing out in real time online
and seeing responses from European leaders,
alleging that Elon Musk
is engaging in political interference or meddling.
How do you respond to those-
<v ->Did you say like peer leaders?</v>
I'm sorry, I really didn't-
<v ->European, European leader.</v>
<v ->Oh, European, I'm sorry. (laughs)</v>
I really think it's interesting
because I also, I was reading that in real time.
I don't understand how that's interfering in elections.
There's influential people all over the world,
stating their points of view.
Publications either endorse
or state their points of view all the time.
I saw a lot of that popping up,
and it really isn't about that.
It's about that it's a different point of view
and it's not the current, I think,
talking points of yesterday that was acceptable.
And I go back to what I just said, if not for X,
where would those girls and future girls be?
So I say more, not less.
<v ->X is the number one news app in how many countries now?</v>
<v ->Oh my gosh. I think it's nearing a couple of hundred.</v>
It's the number one news app in the world.
<v ->And what do you think explains that?</v>
<v ->I think it's pretty simple, right?</v>
And it's the core foundational value of X,
which is protecting the freedom of speech around the world.
And when the freedom of speech is protected,
democracies are able to be successful and thrive.
And that means the global town square,
which invites all walks of life
to come and share their points of view
is enabled and becomes popular.
What it's also about
is how technology has liberated information.
You and I, we spent most of our careers at Legacy media-
<v ->Correct.</v>
<v ->Right?</v>
And what our jobs became was working within these boundaries
of what legacy media was, the way I talk about it,
like stacking the proverbial sandbags
to try to prevent the future from overtaking us
before it happened while we were there.
Well, when you look at why has X
become such a popular news app, it is because, right,
I said I wanna go there,
I wanna go where the free flow of information is encouraged,
where the users are given the respect
to make their own decisions and see both points of view.
Can you see it now all kind of stitched together,
coming together, community notes,
the protection of free speech, all of this ad innovation.
It was the vision all along.
<v ->Well, it's very hard to argue with the data.</v>
Let's talk about 2024.
What were the watershed events
in terms of engagements and the numbers?
<v ->You know, I think there are a lot of watershed moments</v>
for the platform.
When I think about last year at this time,
we were testifying in front of the US Senate
about X's P zero priority
of protecting children all around the world.
And it gave everyone like a wake up call.
We said, wow, there's real people at that new company,
reshuffling priorities,
and their priority is protecting children.
But then when you kind of fast forward,
let's talk about the last bunch of months,
and you look about the watershed moments
of the results of the election.
All eyes were on X, three biggest days on the platform.
Unfortunately the first assassination attempt
on President Trump, you had election day, right?
And you also had Biden stepping out of the race-
<v ->In that window was a debate.</v>
<v ->Yes, so the debate, it all came together</v>
where there was the highest days of usage
on the platform globally.
And now you look at it and those seminal moments
are still continuing because X has crossed into that,
really no surrogate that could perform.
You're watching the new government unfold, right?
And you're seeing all the nominees announced,
the background all of a sudden coming up,
and you're watching it in real time,
and I thought to myself, when this first started happening
and President-elect Trump
was starting to announce his nominees
and I thought, wow, in real time, no surrogate for X,
but this is really an example of a government
of the people, by the people, for the people.
I felt a part of it.
And I think a lot of people share that view
and that's where they come to X now to enjoy that,
which is no surrogate.
I need to find out what's happening and I need to check X.
<v ->You mentioned this earlier,</v>
it feels like 2024 was an election
where X independent journalism podcasters, like Joe Rogan,
really broke the back of traditional media,
especially with "60 Minutes" in the presidential interviews.
I don't think you would ever have expected four years ago
that candidates would skip "60 Minutes."
<v ->Yeah, I don't think they would've ever skipped</v>
"60 Minutes" and there was no other platform
that would encourage it, whether it was Joe Rogan
and some of the other podcasts,
or X certainly wouldn't have done it.
And it's something we wear that,
kind of that X badge of honor very proudly.
<v ->In closing, in 2025, is there a single idea or concept</v>
or technology that will take X to the next level?
<v ->Oh goodness. What a question.</v>
If there are any Xers in the room or watching,
there's things that haven't been thought up yet,
or maybe there's one person that thought of them already.
So to predict '25, but I would say
what's in front of us now,
I would say two things that'll continue
to just change the way any user
comes to expect what a social media platform is,
and I would talk about X money, right?
Is going to change both payments
and the opportunities creators on the platform forever.
And then you have to talk about Grok, right?
So those two things together,
profound differentiation for our company
and profoundly propelling us,
like at breakneck speed into '25.
<v ->Just in the final 10 seconds,</v>
what do you think the engagement numbers
will look like in 2025?
<v ->A lot higher than they were in 2024.</v>
<v ->All right, Linda Yaccarino, CES.</v>
Thank you for the opportunity today.
<v Linda>Thank you.</v>
Very well.
