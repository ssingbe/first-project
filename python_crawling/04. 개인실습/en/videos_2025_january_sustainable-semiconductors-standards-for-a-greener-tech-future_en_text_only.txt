<v ->Hello, everyone, welcome to our panel</v>
on sustainable semiconductors.
I am Syed Alam.
I'm a partner at McKinsey &amp; Company
with focus on semiconductors.
We should start with some introduction of our panel.
Veronica, we can start with you.
<v ->Absolutely, yeah, hi, everyone, I'm Veronica Lancaster.</v>
I am the vice president of standards
at the Consumer Technology Association.
I'm also the president
of the US National Committee of the IEC
which is a global standards organization.
Standards are near and dear to my heart,
so I'll talk a little bit about standards today
and how those can play a critical role
when it comes to sustainability.
In addition to that,
I'm on the American National Standards
Institute Board of Directors
and the IAC Board of Directors,
so it's a passion for me.
I'm happy to be here, yeah, thank you.
<v Syed>Welcome, thank you, Nancy?</v>
<v ->Hi, I'm Nancy Greco at IBM</v>
and I've been there for 40 years.
So I came in as a chemist
and started developing processes,
and never thought I'd stay,
but 40 years went by
and I've developed every type of semiconductor process.
and automation for the last 15 years,
I went into research to do AI
'cause semiconductor always had a big data problem
and so working on AI that led into large language models.
So I really do feel I've been growing up
with the semiconductor and AI industry
and with the CHIPS Act,
I was so excited that semiconductor is cool again.
So I do a lot of recruiting
for students to come into semiconductor
and just excited to be here today.
<v ->Hi, I'm Sujata Neidig with NXP Semiconductors.</v>
I've also grown up in the semiconductor world over 30 years
and I'm a director of marketing
on our wireless connectivity portfolio.
I also am, standards are near and dear to my heart
too on the wireless connectivity side.
I serve for NXP on the board of directors
for Connectivity Standards Alliance and Thread Group.
And really excited, we've had some pre-discussion.
I think this is gonna be a fascinating panel discussion.
<v Syed>Thank you, Deok-kee?</v>
<v ->Hi, my name is Deok-kee Kim.</v>
I'm honored to be invited
to this CES panel on sustainable semiconductors.
I'm currently a professor
at Sejong University in Seoul, Korea,
and previously I also worked
for IBM Micro Electronics Division
and also Samsung Semiconductors for approximately 10 years,
and my career in semiconductor field
is about 25 years after my PhD.
I also have some government jobs as a program director
at National Research Foundation of Korea
in the division of semiconductors.
Currently I'm also involved
with some of the standardization work.
I'm involved with two committees.
One is IEC-TC 47 semiconductors.
The other one is IEC-TC 124 wearable Devices.
Happy to meet you, thank you.
<v ->Thank you. Deok-kee, this topic is very interesting</v>
because semiconductor plays such a unique role
in the overall technology ecosystem.
Semiconductors are enabling all the greener technologies,
smart and energy-efficient products.
At the same time,
it takes a lot of energy
and water to actually produce the semiconductors also
and in our panel discussion
we'll cover both aspects of these topics.
Maybe we can start with the topic
around how semiconductors are enabling
the greener technology and sustainable products?
Sujata, maybe you can elaborate on that?
<v ->Yeah, sure, first of all, about semiconductors,</v>
I'll say when I started in semiconductors,
nobody in my family
or friends knew what a semiconductor was.
And now after Covid,
it's everybody in CHIPS Act,
everybody knows what it is.
So it is exciting to see that people understand
the technologies that are driving the way they live, work,
engage in the world,
and semiconductors, I was a product engineer at one time
and spent a lot of time in fabs.
It does require a lot of resources.
At NXP and I think all of the semiconductor companies,
there's quite a bit of work investment
in how do we maximize efficiencies?
How do we reduce the energy use?
I know water is a big aspect
and Nancy will speak to this,
but how to reuse water, recycle water.
So those are all areas that companies
like NXP are working on,
but as I said, I'm on the product side
and building chips is one thing,
and how we're building chips to not just be faster,
but lower power, enable more capabilities
so that the end products they go into
can be lower power footprint.
And then the products that we are looking at
and equipping with is the IoT market.
So all these Internet of Things devices
being connected all the time,
I know that that puts a lot of weight
on the servers and stuff,
but we really are driving things
to have intelligence at the edge
and bringing more intelligence to the edge
so that processing of the data
and taking action on that can be done at the edge
and give the immediate result
without having to use the servers.
And then to standards,
that's an area that I've spent a lot of time
over the last 10 years.
These are tough challenges
and if we don't address them together as an industry,
it makes it nearly impossible.
So at NXP, we have invested
a lot more in standards and open standards
and I think we see this shift
from building proprietary ecosystems of devices
to more open standards.
So if you're not familiar on the connectivity side,
Matter is a wireless protocol that enables devices
to all be able to speak the same language to each other
regardless of what brand the company is that makes it.
In our booth, at the NXP booth here,
we have a intelligent energy home demonstration
to really show how being able to monitor the energy usage
of the different devices in the home
and what is going on on the grid,
and being able to leverage that information
and make intelligent automated decisions
without having to put that burden on the user.
And this is in the smart home environment,
but it really scales into buildings.
I remember a couple of years ago,
somebody from Schneider I was talking to made this comment
about I think 85% of the buildings
that exist in 30 years are ones that exist today.
So there's not a lot of new construction
and the only way that we can make buildings
more efficient is through IoT and wireless connectivity
because you can't go
and rewire things in buildings
and tear down walls, right?
So we really look at this from a holistic,
a more system-level approach on how do we build chips
that can enable these technologies?
And then how do product manufacturers
build products that help users,
whether it's in your home
or buildings where you work, be more efficient?
And I think that is an important aspect
because as much work as we do
on the semiconductor manufacturing side,
the demand is going to be there to drive these use cases
and experiences for users.
And the more that we can automate
and bring intelligence without having to put
that burden on the user,
the more impact we can make.
<v ->Thank you, I think you brought to life very good examples</v>
of how semiconductors are enabling greener technologies
and it's driving the demand.
So building on that,
there's a lot of demand for the semiconductor chips
based on the requirements
for greener, smart, energy-efficient products,
plus AI and all the compute needs.
Also some of the geopolitical factors,
all of these things are driving
a lot of fabs getting built around the globe.
Maybe, Nancy, you can talk about how a lot of these fabs
getting built impacts the environment.
<v ->Sure, with the excitement of AI,</v>
every country wants to make sure
they have access to AI chips.
So what we've been seeing over the past couple of years,
heavy investments now going
into not just a few countries like the US,
but many, many countries.
So in the US alone,
we're gonna 3X the semiconductor capacity by next year
or actually it's 2025, by this year, 3X.
Worldwide, the prediction is because other countries
are building their own semiconductor,
that's gonna increase to 10X.
So on one hand, as a semiconductor engineer,
it's like yay, we're cool.
But be honest, as an environmentalist,
I'm very concerned, why?
A typical semiconductor fab the size of TSMC
will use 75 million gallons of water a day.
Today, if you take all the semiconductor collectively,
they're consuming 2%
of the entire electricity available today.
And then of course waste.
Unfortunately semiconductor, and I've developed
processes using fluorinated gases, heavily used PFAs.
They're called the forever chemical.
We can't get rid of it.
There's just no way, in my opinion,
in my lifetime that we're gonna remove it.
So as an environmentalist,
it's great that we're bringing on this capacity.
AI is fascinating, it's gonna help humans
do things they've never done before,
but we're gonna need to use that AI
to understand how to build them
with no impact on the environment.
<v ->And Nancy, AI can also be used in the factories</v>
and processes to help create more efficiencies.
<v ->Absolutely, let me just touch on that for a second.</v>
So one of the challenges you had,
there's regulations coming out
and saying you got to reduce water, or energy, or PFAs.
And rightly so, I'll be honest,
the semiconductor clients are saying,
"I don't know how much I'm using."
All right, I use 75 million gallons of water a day.
How would I reduce that by 10%?
I don't know who's using it.
So we've been developing AI analytics
that can go right down to the tool level.
How do we do that?
It's not that hard actually.
You pull the data
right off a water flow controller through a PLC
or up through the SCADA.
It's not that hard.
Just never thought to do it before.
Now that we're quantifying that data,
we're saying okay, reduce here, reduce there,
and so tool vendors are coming together
and I think the real solution as an environmentalist,
we have to come together.
And what I like about semiconductor,
we actually have the scientific
and engineering horsepower to create sustainable processes.
And I'll be honest,
it's more unique than any other industries.
Think of what it takes to create an AI chip
where the interconnect is 1,000 times smaller than a hair.
That's the brilliance and capability semiconductor has.
We need to turn that on to sustainability.
<v ->Yeah, I think you brought up a very good point</v>
in terms of the PFAs
and the process improvement.
What are the steps the industry is taking
and what are the things that industry
or the semiconductor companies are doing
to help alleviate some of these concerns?
<v ->So let me take the PFAs first.</v>
So there was regulation in the US that said
by January of this year,
you have to report all your PFA use.
Whole bunch of lawyers were hired
and that got extended.
Now but looking at that regulation,
it wasn't doable, right?
How do you know what you're using?
Just the same example with water.
At least you can see that.
But now what we're doing is working to instrument the tools
to understand what they're using
and I know in IBM research and others,
we're starting to say,
"I can't not use the fluorinated gases."
Just can't, it takes 10 years qualified process
if you didn't use it,
but we're looking at the byproduct
and what happens with a lot of the stuff,
it has come up through a scrubber.
Start introducing new chemicals
that break it down in these new scrubbers
and so that again, is we can figure out
how to build the process.
I think we can figure out how to render it,
we call it abatement,
to the point it's inert to the environment.
So PFAs is a high level of focus.
The regulation didn't help,
but now research is coming in
and saying we can do this.
Water conservation and recycling is huge.
A lot of the semiconductors doing that
because you have to.
And then energy, interesting enough, like Sujata said,
a lot of the processes we've developed in semiconductor
actually are core into solar
and other types of renewable energy.
But I would have to say right now,
until you quantify it, they're not listening.
It's like I use 75 million gallons of water a day?
It's like yeah, you do,
and you're in an area
that there's not a lot of water, and guess what?
The humans are noticing the lake is going down.
So I think giving them data, quantify it,
and now unleash your engineering, and AI,
and quantum to figure out how to do this
to be kind to the environment.
<v ->What about in terms of electricity, power consumption,</v>
what can we do about it
in terms of one, renewable energy usage
and second, just to reduce less of it?
<v ->Well, first of all, in a semiconductor factory,</v>
these tools have to stay powered on 24-7.
If you turn them off
and accidentally, drop at it, they're shut off,
they don't function correctly.
All sorts of chaos occurs.
It's like your freezer not having electricity
for two days, it's a mess.
But what we can do is start looking
at semiconductor has huge redundancy of tools.
You don't buy one litho tool.
You'll buy five or you'll buy 10 tools.
If we start looking at the efficiency
that you're using these tools,
do the maintenance, keep them up and running,
do the WHIP analysis,
one approach is can I reduce the number of tools?
The other is again, looking at it,
and I'll just be honest,
reducing energy in semiconductors' gonna be tough
because you can't turn the tool off.
But there's ways we're looking at
and vendors are coming in saying,
"I can consume less power."
But as Sujata said too,
we're creating the chips that can help analyze that
to reduce the data centers,
to reduce the machines.
And we'll get there.
It's kind of like gas consumption on a car.
It's tough in semiconductor to reduce our energy,
but now we're getting the capability to do that,
but it's not gonna be coming in the next one to three years.
<v ->Yeah, you brought up a interesting point.</v>
The chips that we are manufacturing in the fabs
will actually enable to make it
in an energy-efficient way, cool.
I think given that standards can help have
a consistent, unified approach to these challenges,
what do you think, Veronica, with your background,
how standards can help with all of this?
<v ->Yeah, so actually I thought it was a great segue</v>
when you just mentioned all of the different learnings
that the individual companies
and the scientists, the chemists are figuring out
how to use AI tools,
how to get down to the tool level
and figure out where do we make it more efficient?
Where do we get rid of some of these forever chemicals?
How can we do this?
The more we do that
and the more that we share
with each other in standards development,
then that's industry driving change, right, together.
So I think that there's a lot that we can do there.
Definitely energy efficiency standards,
we're already doing work in that.
And what I think is interesting is that there's such a,
I know we said we're not gonna get too political up here,
but at least when we started in the speaker room,
but I think what's interesting
is that when it comes to energy efficiency,
we do find that the government does send a lot of engineers
to the standards development arena
because I think what they can do is learn from the chemist.
They can learn from the engineers and the scientists
and figure out well, what is the best way to do this?
Rather than just coming up with it on their own.
So I like that it's a very inclusive environment for that,
but there's certainly lots of other areas we can get into.
<v ->Veronica, also to your point, having industry involved</v>
'cause governments can make regulations,
but they can't make them deployable.
They can't be deployed easily unless industry is there
providing the inputs on what is reality
on how to actually implement this legislation.
I know there's been the Cyber Resilience Act.
There's been climate change,
lowering the carbon footprint goals in Europe
that are really driving the IoT efforts too in buildings,
that's what I said earlier,
that they cannot meet these standards
that have been set by the governments
without adopting new technologies
and making more intelligent and automated infrastructures.
<v ->Right, right, so what's the end goal for us</v>
is if we're able to get all of our manufacturers together
and create the benchmarks, right, together,
and then the government can then reference
those different standards that we've written.
That's a win because then industries had the opportunity
to set those benchmarks
and the government refers to them
seeing the sound science so.
<v ->What's gonna motivate them to do that, the companies?</v>
We get them together
and say, "Help us create these standards."
<v ->Well, from my point of view,</v>
I think it's everything that you mentioned, right?
It's the challenges that we need to address
in getting rid of the forever chemicals
and addressing how to manage the water, right?
Because there are things
that we need to use in creating chips
and that's not gonna change,
so how might we recycle, reuse?
<v Nancy>Sharing knowledge standard.</v>
<v ->Sharing knowledge, exactly.</v>
<v Nancy>And it's all kind of,</v>
hate to say it so bluntly,
but it's all driven by the bottom line, right?
These companies, not only can they not achieve the goals
that have been set for them,
but they have to have their business model support,
they have to support
their business model and generate profit.
And they're learning that they can't do that on their own
because the market isn't growing, it's too fragmented.
So by joining together
and investing their resources towards standards,
yeah, it makes the market grow faster.
<v ->Yeah, I totally agree.</v>
The more that we can learn from each other, the better.
<v ->What are the areas for benchmarking?</v>
We talk about companies coming together.
What are the areas for benchmarking
and how it can help?
<v ->Yeah, there's definitely a lot of different areas</v>
and there are lots of different industry associations
and consortia that are working on that.
And I know my friend, Deok-kee Kim,
will talk a little bit about what we're doing
in the IEC and TC-47.
But there's definitely things that we can do
to start looking at the environment,
the ethics, certainly social responsibility,
and you can address all of those in standards
and you can get down
into just the different consortia.
Semi's one that you mentioned earlier.
There's the World Semiconductor Council,
collaborative research and innovation
that we can do working together at the educational level
which I know as Deok-kee Kim mentioned, he's a professor.
So you might have some insights into that
and some of the current research that's happening.
<v Syed>And maybe, Deok-kee, you can start with just,</v>
Veronica mentioned IEC TC-437,
so you can talk about what is IEC, what is IEC TC-47,
and maybe we can start there.
<v ->Before I talk about that one,</v>
I wanna talk a little bit about what Nancy
and the others talked about.
I guess, Syed, it's going to be very difficult
to completely remove the fluorinated gases actually.
If I look at the semiconductor history
for the last 50 and 60 years,
semiconductor industry manufacturing has been
developed in collaboration
with the research and development.
Without the research and development
in this semiconductor industry, nothing can happen.
So for this, I guess completely removing the fluorinated gas
may be very difficult,
but I guess the semiconductor industry
has always been together with the research and development.
So there are many research and development,
always are trying to improve the power efficiency
and then also some of the new technologies
like quantum computing and the neuroFIT devices
and also some of the biodegradable materials.
Those things actually can help sustain the semiconductors.
And also if I come back to Syed's question on IEC,
IEC is International Electrotechnical Commission.
This is one of the standards developing organization
and IEC TC-47 is actually semiconductor devices.
This IEC TC-47 is one of the biggest committee within IEC.
It has foursome committees and six working groups.
SC 47A, Subcommittees 47A covering integral circuit
and SC 47D is covering packaging technology.
SC 47E is discreet semiconductor devices
such as sensors or IOs
and 47F is about the MEMS devices.
If I look at the 47,
IEC TC-47 has been focusing
on developing standards of the characterization
and reliability of already developed product
and mostly reliability aspects.
But recently there is some activities
try to do some pre-standardization
on next generation technologies
and also TC-47 has formed a new working group
on wide bandgap technologies
which is power conversion devices a couple of years ago
to reflect the importance
of the power conversion devices recently.
<v ->Okay. and how, I mean, thank you for explaining this.</v>
That was a very important background.
How these standards, specifically TC-47,
how is helping the industry
and what are the effects?
How much industry is involved in setting up these standards?
<v ->Okay, actually TC-47 is actually covering</v>
various aspects of the semiconductors.
So if I look at it,
there is some separation
between the research community and industry.
The countries like EU and US,
actually mostly industry experts
are developing the standards
of the already developed products.
And then the countries like Korea,
we are actually more focused
on the next generation technologies
such as neuroFIT devices
and then some of the manufacturing aspects as well.
But I guess in order
for the semiconductor industry to go forward,
industry and academia or the research community
needs to get together to develop
reasonable standards in various areas
including the next generation emerging
and critical areas as well.
I think which is what the CHIPS
and Science Act in the USA is also trying to support
the next generation technologies as well.
<v ->Yeah, and maybe I can help to explain</v>
a little bit on the IEC side.
So the IEC is one of three
major global standards development organizations, right?
You've got ISO, IEC, in the ITU
and within the IEC,
we've got different technical committees that are addressing
a lot of different areas.
And what's very interesting is that we all come together
and we bring our expertise from industry
into our national committee, right, our national body.
So as the president of,
oops, sorry, I forgot about the microphone, sorry.
As the president of the US National Committee,
what we do is we get all of the expertise,
all of the experts that participate
in the different technical committees,
they bring their votes in
and they vote on the next levels of these projects
or they submit the projects themselves.
So it's a great way for industry to come together,
but also to be represented in a global basis.
So it brings that.
<v ->I would also add that bringing industry in</v>
brings in the perspective
of what are the problems we're trying to solve?
It's not engineering for engineering's sake.
It's what are the priorities
and the problems that we are trying to address?
'Cause there's always trade offs in where we invest, right?
So bringing industry in brings,
'cause they're connected more to the the end user, right?
And so that helps bring that focus.
<v ->Exactly, and then so if you think about</v>
how we're doing that here in the US,
within the IEC, we're taking our knowledge in the US
and then bringing it globally,
and Professor Kim also brings knowledge from Korea
and takes that globally
so then we're able to work together
and hopefully solve global challenges.
<v ->And I think the global perspective is very important</v>
because a lot of large semi companies are global
so they want to have a consistent standard
and a framework that they could deploy
across their fabs around the globe.
Companies would want to have
oh, this standard in this country
and some other standard in another country.
<v Nancy>Exactly, it's not scalable.</v>
<v ->It's not scalable and it's easy to deploy</v>
and stuff like that.
And then I think, Sujata, to your point earlier,
industry participation also helps.
Is it implementable, is it deployable, right?
How practical it is to do something,
so from that perspective it's also important.
One of the things I wanted to ask the panel,
we touched about PFA quite a bit
and I think the role of research,
R&amp;D you talked about, Deok-kee, also.
Are alternate chemistry being researched?
Is is there your path research?
Maybe not in the very near-term,
but is there a research
or a path towards elevating some of the usage of PFAs
and things like that?
<v ->I'll start, absolutely, I know even IBM research,</v>
that is one of our focus areas to look at that,
and using AI and understanding the chemistries.
A real benefit will be when we start using quantum.
So quantum can actually get down
to the molecular behavior of the molecule.
So we can start to understand can we create new processes
where if I have this byproduct,
how can I break it down?
So that is coming.
It's an area of focus,
even though the PFA regulations
got pushed out by a bunch of lawyers
because genuinely people are saying,
"We have to do something."
Now semiconductor of course uses PFAs
and I'm telling you,
for 40 years we've used fluorinated gases.
I don't see a way of getting around it,
but we're gonna look very hard how to render it inert.
But on the other hand,
everybody who does cooking,
guess what's in your frying pan?
PFAs, clothes, it's everywhere.
And what I'm hoping semiconductor can do
and I wanna help do this too,
we have the know-how to go
and figure out how to do this.
Quantify it, use AI, use quantum,
and figure out how to render,
whatever we create, render it inert.
We call it cradle to,
or again, what do I say, grave to grave.
You create it, you grow it,
and then put it back,
and so that's what we're really trying to do.
So I give a lot of folks credit.
It's not based on regulations
which can sway with the politics,
but people wanna do the right thing
and we just got to help them.
<v ->And semi industry has a tradition</v>
or a history of very fact driven, science oriented,
and I mean, the kind of work that we do,
as you were talking about it,
making the chips at three nanometer,
two nanometer is like this
because of all the science-driven kind of a mindset.
We touched about, I think the panel touched about
on regulation a couple of times.
Let me ask a overarching questions.
Do we need some regulation specific to semi manufacturing?
<v ->Well, I could start then.</v>
<v ->Yeah, yeah, go ahead.</v>
<v ->It's almost a yes-no.</v>
You need the regulation,
but it's important to have the standards.
So if you're gonna have a regulation,
make sure it's discoverable and doable.
The PFA one came out,
how could anybody adhere to it?
So I think put the regulation
and bring in the community of scientists
to really influence, all right, here's the problem,
here's how you discover it, measure it,
and here's how you can abate it or remove it.
And that's gonna be really important.
One concern I do have is how do you motivate people?
So if you don't have regulations,
will they have that motivation to do the right thing?
<v Veronica>Exactly what I was thinking.</v>
<v ->Tax credits can only go so far</v>
and it may have to come down to it has to be mandated now.
I was in Malaysia a few months ago
and asking them, "You're gonna have regulations
for a semiconductor, they're gonna boom."
And they're like, "What?"
They're like, "No, we don't have enough water.
We're just gonna have to manage it out of the gate."
So it's a perspective.
I think regulations supported by standards.
I hope humans do want to do the right thing.
You are up against profit
and that's going to be a problem,
and maybe regulations helps open the door and squash profits
and say environment first.
<v ->In a sense, a bar too,</v>
a common bar for everybody to shoot for and work together,
and that's where the standards come in to help.
<v ->I mean, it helps with the bottom line also.</v>
You talked about it,
if you're using less power,
it helps reduce the power expenses also, right?
So there is a,
it's helpful from multiple angles also.
I also wanna touch upon,
I wanna get everyone's opinion on this,
is are we doing enough?
Are we acting with a sense of urgency?
What do you all think?
I think we can go around the panel to talk about it.
<v ->I'll jump in, I think there's always more</v>
that we can be doing, right?
Especially when it comes to standardization.
When you talk about
some of the heavy challenges that we have,
the more that we can get industry together
to talk about how they might be solving different issues,
whether it's chemical usage, or water usage, or power.
We've talked about power a lot as well.
And if we're able to learn from each other
and then hopefully set some of those benchmarks
for other companies to follow,
as we were talking about earlier with regulation,
hopefully at that point,
regulation can then point to that standard
and say, "Follow that standard,"
and we're already getting to a better level.
So we can always look at different areas
and do better in each individual area.
<v ->Okay, Nancy, what do you think?</v>
<v ->I'm gonna say no, we're not doing enough.</v>
Obviously the focus has been on capacity,
get the capacity up and running.
And during that build out,
some companies were very responsible
and they started to build in the environmental conditions,
but was there a whole lot of motivation?
No, you got this money, build this factory,
get it up and running.
And I think that at least in the US
we have that firmly on its way,
we need to focus on the environmental conditions.
So I'm gonna say no.
I understand why we focus on capacity,
but we need a lot of funding to say get rid of PFAs,
water usage, energy usage.
There's more to do.
<v ->Yeah, I think I would say yes and no.</v>
I think I really see that we've accelerated
the efforts in the last five, even just five years.
Even working at NXP,
the amount of awareness there is
around how to build more sustainable semiconductors
and the efforts that are going on in fabs.
And even when I work with customers,
they ask us for information about our products,
and the carbon footprint,
and energy consumption for building the products.
So there's more awareness
and now we have to continue
to drive the semiconductor processes.
But I will also say I think from the end product side,
we're making huge advancements in AI,
like you said, all these technologies
to help us better understand the energy usage
and be able to apply intelligence to reduce that.
<v ->So if I add a little bit.</v>
If I look at the semiconductor manufacturing,
previously for the last 50 and 60 years,
US actually started the semiconductor manufacturing
and then they intentionally I think
moved that to Japan and then Korea
and then finally to China.
And then those are,
Korea, even if I look at the Korea, the initial days,
they didn't really think about the environmental aspects.
And then there was some diseases
from the semiconductor processing as well.
But now USC is actually considering
that semiconductor technology is very, very important
and they're bringing
that semiconductor manufacturing back to US.
And now I think US will be more interested
in the research and development.
US has a very good capability
of the research and capability.
I hope that we will find better solutions in the near future
with all the capabilities.
<v ->Thank you, I think at this time,</v>
we have a few minutes
left for any questions from the audience.
If you have any questions,
please come up to the mic over here
and so that it could be recorded.
Any questions from the audience?
<v Questioner One>I had a, sorry, a question on the,</v>
there has been a lot of reshoring
of semiconductor into the US
and one of my questions was what sustainability
and government environmental obstacles
have been most daunting,
especially with our environmental regulations
in the US versus other countries?
<v ->Nancy, you wanna start?</v>
<v ->Sure, I think in the US,</v>
of course, the water was gonna be a concern.
The PFAS came right up on the top.
But until it was doable, energy is also a big one.
So I think there's some federal regulations,
but then the states have to look at it.
Can they actually support it?
And as we're indicating, water's a big one.
I don't think we can put too many more factories
in the South here, West to be able to do that.
So I think in that case,
we're trying to work with the government.
We have to get this capacity online.
We're rules bent, I don't know,
but I do start looking at the data, kind of questioning it.
EU I work with, they're real tough.
They're not gonna bend, no, boom,
and I'd like to see if we can get there, but collectively.
You have to put something in place that's really doable
and invest in more research.
And I think Syed mentioned,
it doesn't necessarily mean
you're gonna decrease your profit
because a lot of times the way they're calculating profit,
they're not calculating the entire pipeline
of what you've done.
Are you taking into account the waste
and what the impact of the waste is
and if you get sued
or if you're non-compliant?
When you start looking at all that,
doing the right thing will be profitable.
<v ->Deok-kee, any observation from outside?</v>
<v ->Yeah, when I was working for some government jobs,</v>
I actually had a chance to meet
with some of the officials from EU.
Actually the first question they asked me
is can you get rid of the PFA,
especially the Samsung Electronics or (indistinct) actually.
But I guess like Nancy said,
I think currently it's impossible to get rid
of the fluorinated gases completely
and I guess they set the target about 2050.
Currently they don't really look at seriously within Korea,
but they started to look at it.
So I think we have to see whether we can really,
I guess a little bit we may be able to reduce
and then we should reduce
some of the fluorinated gas use in the manufacturing, yeah.
<v Questioner Two>How do the semiconductor companies</v>
plan to achieve carbon-neutral goals?
Do you prefer or prioritize
reducing the carbon emission yourself
or purchasing carbon credits on the market?
<v ->Yeah, yeah, yeah, actually these people may know better,</v>
but I guess in order to prepare this panel,
I also became interested
in the semiconductor sustainability.
And then semiconductor companies I think are doing
various things to use the renewable energies
and also trying to use many,
using the AI, the optimization
of the manufacturing process, et cetera,
to reduce the carbon emission.
And then a little bit,
but currently I guess it's very difficult
to do the net-zero carbon.
<v ->Yeah, I agree with that.</v>
I think NXP, we have sustainability reports
that we started issuing to show
where are the areas that we've invested
and evaluated on the energy consumption
and how we can improve that.
It's gonna take time to get to a net-zero.
I don't know if that's feasible or not,
but just working towards that is definitely something
I think all the semiconductor companies are doing.
<v ->I think there's a broad set of things</v>
going on in this space.
First, usage of renewable sources.
Second is this how can we use less energy?
And then the OEE topic that we talked about.
<v ->And the reuse.</v>
<v ->And the reuse, so there is a broad set of things</v>
that collectively could help us get there.
<v ->Yeah, and I think companies</v>
can also set these benchmarks themselves
and then I know I've preached standards,
but I think the more that we set the benchmarks
on how we might get to a better sustainable world, right?
Especially when we're talking
about the manufacturing of semiconductors, right?
Then what we can do is share that learning with each other
and then hopefully create some standards,
so that's what we hope for.
<v ->I just wanted to add one key here</v>
is typically an organization
or a factory is measuring the total amount of energy used?
Where was it used?
And then they calculate the emissions.
That's too macro level in my opinion.
What tools are using it?
Do you have a tool starting to go rogue
that's just taking too much energy?
And this is why OEE is so important.
Monitor each tool and then aggregate it
'cause otherwise it's so difficult to drill it down.
So in my view, get this dashboard,
build in the ability,
and we're doing that to drill it down.
What tools are using all this energy and why?
And is there any opportunity
to reduce the energy they're using?
<v Syed>With that, I think we are-</v>
<v ->Oh, one more comment.</v>
<v Syed>Go ahead.</v>
<v Nancy>We're out of time.</v>
<v Syed>We are out of time.</v>
Thank you, panel, for a very thought provoking
and at the same time, very actionable kind of discussion.
Thank you.
