<v ->I want to introduce an absolutely fantastic panel to you.</v>
Today, we are talking about
the home,
where we live,
and how it interacts with the world around us
in very different ways than you may suspect,
in terms of not only sustainability,
energy efficiency,
new extensions of the homes.
And the panel is a rockstar group
of executives at the highest level,
who have worked on this problem
and on this opportunity
of the home as a lower carbon footprint world.
So, I'm gonna let them introduce themselves.
I'm gonna do a little framing for you,
to give you a sense of background,
and then we'll dive right in.
So, let's go right through this.
<v ->Yeah. Thank you.</v>
Is this working? Yeah.
Yeah, there we go. Thanks, John.
I'm Nicole.
I am VP of product at Savant Systems
for all of our energy management products.
Nice to be here, today.
<v ->Great to see everyone, here.</v>
I'm Greg Fyke,
president and CEO for Ecobee,
best known for smart thermostats.
<v ->Hey everyone, I'm Katy Bolan</v>
and I lead environmental sustainability
in some of our product areas at Google.
And I'm also an avid interior architect designer,
focused on interior, focused on sustainability.
<v ->Hello, everyone. I'm Bingrui Yang,</v>
I'm the founder and CEO of Pebble.
We are a startup
that's building a all-electric travel trailer.
We just launched it, two days ago, at CES.
It's on display in West Hall.
Great to meet you all.
<v ->Congratulations.</v>
It's a great panel.
Just to, you know, get one thing out there
and I'm gonna do the context.
I have had an Ecobee thermostat for about 10 years.
And I know Bingrui for, you know, the last nine months.
So, just so you know, I know them really well
and I just wanted that out there
because, while I'm fans of everybody's products
on the panel,
I just didn't want you to think
I was biased in any way,
but I'm biased to what every one of these people
is working on.
So, what we're gonna talk about today
has to be put into a greater context.
And in general, the greater context is
that the world is heating up.
So, about two and a half miles from my home,
in Santa Monica now, there are huge fires
that are engulfing very standard residential neighborhoods.
If you live near water, anywhere in the world,
you're seeing effects of weather and extreme events.
And why this is happening is very simple,
is that for the last a hundred plus years,
we've taken dinosaurs and plants out of the ground,
it's called fossil fuels, in many forms.
And the CO2 that's emitted from converting those to energy
and energy fuels economies, as they grow,
has stayed in the atmosphere and does for a thousand years.
So the planet is getting much, much, much warmer,
warmer than most people actually know.
The problem with that is
that it increases what we're seeing right now.
And what happens is, over time, things get worse.
Now, the negative side of the story
has to be framed in a different way,
which is there's an opportunity here.
One, to try and work to fix this problem.
And the beautiful thing about the companies we have today,
at least, within the environment we call the home,
they are focused on reducing carbon
and creating a more efficient home.
Why this is really important is
because in the US,
we emit about 13% of all of those greenhouse gases
from our home.
And that's EPA number.
It's only from the electricity
and heating and cooling from fossil,
more green energy going into that, better.
So, the home is a really big focus of, you know,
opportunity, but also issues to reduce carbon.
The benefit that you have,
when you see this as an opportunity,
is you don't make yourself or your friends
feel like that frog in the water,
where it's getting warmer and warmer
and there's nothing you can do about it.
You actually see this as a huge, huge business opportunity.
And we're gonna get into that a little today.
Just so you know, the globe,
and this is an IEA number, it's an energy agency,
spends $2 trillion on just green energy inputs.
That's not climate tech on top of that.
And general estimates put it at four to five years,
at $5 trillion a year.
The market cap of the five largest companies in the world
is $15 trillion.
So, every three years,
they're all tech companies, you know them,
they're, every three years, we'll spend that on,
obviously, saving ourselves from ourselves.
But you have to think about that as the biggest investment
and business opportunity in the history of humanity.
And that's the part that is exciting,
despite the difficulties.
And these individuals have embraced that.
And so, what I'd like to do,
is I'd like it to turn to Nicole,
because Nicole has a whole-home vision,
as we'll hear from others.
And maybe just take it, in what you're seeing
and what you're doing, in regards to the home as a-
<v ->Yeah, absolutely. Thank you, John.</v>
So, a core part of energy management for the home
comes down to improving energy efficiency.
And so, what that really means is
reducing energy consumption in the home,
while maintaining comfort and convenience.
And then, there's an added benefit, as well,
of saving money on your utility bill.
And so, Savant looks at this in a few different ways,
but starting with a really great
simple approach to start with,
is just giving users a way to know
how much energy they're consuming,
how they're consuming it throughout the day,
what appliances or systems are taking up that power
that they're getting, you know,
you're getting your bill at the end of the month
and you see the number, the dollar amount,
maybe you see the kilowatt hours,
but you don't really know where it's come from.
And so, Savant has an energy-management product
that goes into your electric panel,
your standard panel that you have in your home.
And we can monitor how much power you're consuming,
the total consumption you're consuming,
and also on a circuit-level basis,
as well as being able to control those circuits.
So, this is a really great, easy way.
You can go in to our mobile app,
see, you know, I've consumed my,
my kitchen appliances more this month.
Why was that? Is there a way I could be better there?
<v John>Mm.</v>
<v ->And another, another approach we take is</v>
controlling those items in the home.
So, even just by knowing you've, where you're consuming,
you can be more conscious,
but you can also use software
to improve your day-to-day life
by scheduling your usage, based on when you're,
maybe not at home or you're on vacation
or there's a certain part of your house
that doesn't need to be running at these times of day.
And so we have a smart lighting line, product line,
where we can automate when lights are on or off in the home.
We also, with our energy-management product,
can connect up to anything you have coming out of your panel
to automate, maybe it's your dryer,
maybe it's your electric car charger.
And so, these are all really great ways
that are approachable.
And you don't have to do all of these things.
You can, sort of, pick and choose
what's right for you, in your home.
<v ->So, just one thing I wanted to say about that,</v>
for the audience, is if you think about activity trackers,
before we had activity trackers,
once you get activity trackers,
you know, roughly, how much you're moving or not.
If you have data, you can actually change behavior.
And I just loved what you said, too,
that the behavior is cost saving, as well.
So, it's all beneficial.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
<v ->No, that's great.</v>
<v ->Interject that.</v>
But
there's,
at Ecobee, there's a similar,
not the same way of looking at it,
but the two of you speaking together,
I think, will really drive this point to the next level.
<v ->Yep.</v>
<v ->So Greg,</v>
can you tell us about it?
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
I think, the part I would really,
kind of, follow up on Nicole's point is a key word,
simple and simplicity.
<v ->Yep.</v>
<v ->One of the things,</v>
like the greatest path to simplicity that we'd see is that
with the increased complexity of energy,
we have now, time of use,
billing rates that are getting a lot more complex.
They're increasing in costs,
you're having greater power outages,
and the overall, kind of, the increased demand on the grid,
customers, fundamentally, it's a bit overwhelming for them.
And so, one of the core things that we can all do
is to try and make these solutions
that are geared towards sustainability,
ultimately, simple to use.
And what that leads to is a lot greater use for customers.
It takes all of that complexity away
and leads to, ultimately, greater usage of
these solutions that we can provide
that reduce carbon emissions,
ultimately, make the planet more sustainable,
and it's a really critical component
of the work that we actually do.
<v ->That's fantastic.</v>
'Cause when you think, too, about what
I have seen out in the market,
the complexity in so much of this
is really the friction point.
And the cost savings versus the complexity
are a psychological barrier for so many people.
It's now great to save costs, but it could be very complex.
One of the things that's fascinating
is when you take a point of view of solving
really big wicked problems,
where there was a lot of complexity
and you make it simple,
you reinvent how people think about a category,
a product or the home.
And I have to say, I would love, Bingrui,
for you to talk a little bit about your journey,
because I see a lot of that in what you're doing.
<v ->That's right. Yeah.</v>
So, we're a bit of in the
similar but different category here.
So, a lot of people get to know Pebble in the last two years
as the RV, the travel trailer company.
We've designed and built
and unveiled, two days ago,
an all-electric, smart travel trailer,
it's got a large battery,
it's got solar, over the entire roof.
Everything it runs off the battery.
So, it's sustainable.
A lot of people look at us as an RV company,
but really a lot what people, most of them,
they don't know is Pebble is actually
a sustainable living company.
And we are thinking this in a different way,
that home is not just your house,
your apartment.
Home is anywhere you're staying at.
That can be a camper, can be a travel trailer.
So, what we have developed is this, essentially,
extension of your home that you can park this Pebble Flow,
which is a flagship product, at your home,
on your driveway or backyard.
It's got three times the size of the Tesla Powerwall,
in terms of battery capacity.
You can power your home in a blackout.
It has solar panel to generate renewable energy.
And then you can use this as an ADU.
And we have heat pump systems for air conditioning.
So, it's really the golden standard, when it comes to
electrification and sustainability.
<v ->And the beauty is that, you know,</v>
you start to integrate these ideas.
And you know, one piece of this is,
what is, you know, product? What is service?
And how does it interact with all the other systems?
The energy system, if specifically, electricity,
if you're not aware, doesn't have an ability
to store in the middle of the network.
So, load is balanced by increasing production of power.
Usually, fossil in the United States, it's 80% fossil
for electricity generation.
And if they need more power, they crank up fossil.
But when you have batteries
or other types of storage in the middle,
these new technologies
and greener ways of approaching things become available.
So, the home is the edge of a network,
which is really an exciting place
to think about energy saving, energy storage,
to mitigate what you may have read about,
which is the difficulty in reinvesting
and reinventing our grid.
Now, the home is also a place
where people buy products and services.
And that's a classic,
Americans buy a lot of products and services.
So,
Katy, I'd love to turn it to you,
to talk about, what's the thinking around
when you're offering a very high value
product or service, into the home?
And how does the sustainability angle fit into that for you
and what you're doing at Google TV?
<v ->Yeah, so for Google TV,</v>
and for those of you who don't know, a Google TV is,
you know, you can buy, like, Sony with Google TV
or you can buy a Dongle
to make your existing TV
a Google TV.
And it's a launcher interface
that allows you to access all your streaming networks
and live TV in one place and search through it.
So, we're just the operating system really, right?
So, I work with engineers, directly,
on things like energy efficiencies and whatnot.
But we have manufacturing partners like Sony
and LG and Hisense and whatnot,
who produce these TVs.
And we work with them on things like sustainable packaging
and materials manufacturing and whatnot.
It's all about the user experience, right?
This is consumer electronics that we're dealing with
and every portion of it has to do with
the user experience with the product.
And in my opinion,
if it's not sustainable
then it's a terrible product user experience.
And so, we are looking at the full circularity of,
of the Google TV experience,
among our other products, as well,
that we also support.
But for Google TV, recently we launched, like, energy modes,
which gives users the option
to reduce their power consumption when the TV's in standby.
Most consumers don't know this,
but when your TV appears to be off,
it is actually not off
and it is consuming, potentially,
substantial amounts of power,
in some TVs it's consuming almost as much as if it were on.
And that's not fair,
I don't think most people want that experience
and don't wanna be paying for something
that they're not imminently using, for no reason.
So, we're really focused on giving users the option,
you know, you make the decision,
the options are here for you,
whatever suits your home lifestyle.
<v John>Mm-hmm.</v>
<v ->But if we're introducing features like "Always On,"</v>
we wanna do it responsibly
and provide those options that will, you know,
help you make the more sustainable choices.
Now, at the scale of Google and Google products,
there, you know, we have millions and billions of users,
across the different product areas.
One lever can have massive effects, so,
not an official quote,
but if I reduce the brightness of the TV by 5%,
across all Google TVs,
we may be collectively able to reduce
the equivalent of 5 million cars off the road, per year.
<v ->So, Katy brings a great point</v>
and I loved hearing about that,
which is, when you're thinking about the home
and products and services, that was a great product example,
it's a systems thinking approach.
So, it's not just the home, it's what leads into the home.
So, on the other side of the TV and your smartphone
or data centers and they use a lot of power.
So, you start to see that these companies, as evidence here,
think about it as a complete system,
versus the very transactional model
of just selling products,
that was like the 10 or 15-year-old way.
So, this is really cool that there's, sort of like,
a fingerprint now around the home
and what's going on,
and at both product and at a broader level.
So, turning to,
I think something that, you know,
has been on a lot of people's minds lately,
which is, you know, energy consumption
and the cost of energy has gone up, dramatically.
And we were talking before,
if it can be electrified, it should.
You know, I'm gonna just throw this open
to anybody who wants to pick this up.
But, how, when you're thinking about
managing what you're doing,
are you thinking completely from
supply of energy, all the way down?
Or maybe you're not, and you know,
you mentioned simplicity and the like.
But can you talk a little bit more about, sort of,
the electrification of our world that's going on,
in terms of, the consumer seeing the benefits of it?
And I'm not asking an EV question,
Pebble notwithstanding,
it's not an EV, but I am, sort of,
asking more on the level of
looking at the home data and the like.
<v ->If I could start just to.</v>
<v ->That's fine, sure.</v>
<v ->Yeah, follow on.</v>
<v ->Oh yeah, sure.</v>
<v ->From Katy's question a bit here,</v>
but it's related to that.
<v ->Please.</v>
<v ->And that is, you use packaging as an example and,</v>
we talked about systems.
One of the really, really powerful things that can happen,
actually transformative in a company,
is when you incorporate sustainability thinking,
early on into that process.
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->And so, the simple thing,</v>
even like the choice of packaging
can have a profound impact,
not only on the materials that you use,
the choice of inks that actually kind of reduce,
and make the planet more sustainable,
but it also can save costs, as well.
We, for example, at Ecobee, in some of our products
for both thermostats and our cameras.
We use tapioca in some of our, no jokes.
So tapioca and some of our trays.
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->And it's,</v>
it's both locally sourced,
from the areas where we're getting supply,
it is lower cost, it's a great product
and we still make the experience
that you get out of the box
to be a delightful experience,
<v John>Smart thermostat and dessert, too.</v>
<v ->And it comes back to, so coming back to</v>
that system thinking,
one of the core things that, you know,
I'd love for the audience to take away,
is just this idea of really
shifting sustainability left in your organization.
Because that can lead to, frankly, much better decisions.
And it's really not a compromise.
It's a path to ultimately lead to
better products and solutions,
better experiences for our customers
and less waste, as well.
<v Katy>Can I pick up on that?</v>
<v ->I just wanna. Go ahead, if it's something.</v>
<v ->I just wanna stay on the packaging for a moment.</v>
<v ->Can I take it away from the packaging?</v>
'Cause the initial question, I'll come back to it.
<v ->Okay.</v>
<v ->'Cause I have a thought</v>
on the packaging, that you can pick up on.
So, do you want to talk a little bit
about the electrification,
sort of, home piece?
<v ->Yeah, absolutely. So,</v>
and the original, sort of, question around
energy management and energy efficiency,
and how can I be more energy efficient, as a homeowner,
or as a tenant?
One great way is by electrifying your home.
And again, that can be very overwhelming.
What does that, what are my options? How do I do that?
But people are putting in new electric heat pumps
and you know, they're switching to an electric vehicle
and they're charging at home.
<v ->Dryers with heat pumps.</v>
<v ->Electric dryers.</v>
Savant actually has a partnership with GE appliances.
And so, they have a really incredible product line
of energy-efficient electric appliances
for the kitchen, the dryer.
<v ->Right.</v>
<v ->They have an</v>
electric water heater product that you can,
again, similar to what Katy was saying
with energy modes and being conscious about
the mode that your appliance or your device is running in.
It can be put into a vacation mode,
where you're away and it's consuming less and
cool features, where you can supercharge the water
at certain times of day, when electricity is less expensive,
with time of use coming into play.
And then using that water later,
when electricity prices are higher.
So, these are really great ways that are
different options that people can start
bringing into their homes to electrify,
be more energy efficient, be more energy conscious.
<v ->And we're gonna go to packaging</v>
before I say one thing, which is,
we have designed our use of energy
for the traditional model of fossil,
exactly the opposite of how you would want it
for when we're talking about green energy.
We tell people to save energy by doing things at night
and there's something called a duck curve,
which between 10 and two in the afternoon
is when we have the most energy.
California ran a hundred percent green
off of the entire grid,
for the fifth largest economy in the world,
a hundred days last year.
So, this point about realigning the psychology of consumers,
it was mentioned in time of use by Greg,
which is the
old metrics for use at night, and not.
This is really, really impactful.
So, little things add up to big, as Katy said before.
Katy, you wanna go back to the piece?
<v ->Yeah, I'll give a quick food for thought on packaging.</v>
And then, I've got something on data for you.
How about, how about that, John?
On packaging, you know, as,
your product, as a consumer electronics producer,
is not just the electronics, it includes the packaging.
I mean, how many unboxing videos and things are out there?
It's really the first experience
the user has with your product, is the package.
And so, if you think about what you're giving your customer
to deal with,
you might consider making that
a frustration-free experience.
And part of that is being plastic free
because in so many municipalities,
it's really difficult to recycle things.
So, like, if you think about a TV
with all the styrofoam in the box,
the unboxing experience can be really awful.
<v John>Right.</v>
Only 10% of plastic in the United States is recycled,
which is the supporting, keep going. I'm sorry.
<v ->And then there's even questions around around that.</v>
But, so, in some places where
you're expected to sort your trash at home,
you know, it can take weeks
to finally get rid of that TV trash.
So, think about the experience that
your user would have at home
if they had to keep all of their trash on their property.
Like, what do you think they would want
or what would you want to have on your property
to have to deal with?
Piles of plastic garbages
or, like, cardboard and things that you can
take care of and compost?
<v ->So can.</v>
<v ->That's the visual</v>
I live with, is if I had to keep all the trash
on my property.
<v ->That's a good point because</v>
we used to ship it around the world
and we can't do that anymore.
And before we go to data,
it just brought a thought into my head
and Bingrui, you can
tell the audience about what this was like.
You really reimagined a vision of living,
starting with a white sheet of paper.
And it's extraordinary, 'cause it was only,
roughly, two and a half, three years ago.
<v Bingrui>That's right.</v>
<v ->So, can you tell us, sort of,</v>
what were the pieces you were thinking about,
in terms of, when you have a white sheet of paper?
'Cause they also inform everything that everybody else says
and now, Katy, you can see,
I'm gonna go back to data, in a second. So.
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->So, I would just take a step back.</v>
I think we've,
humans have lived for hundreds of years,
more or less, in the same way.
<v ->Mm-hmm.</v>
<v ->We think of a home</v>
the same way as we thought about home decades ago.
But COVID really gave a systematic shock
to the entire world.
when you think about how you live,
when you think about how you work, right?
So, the part of the inspiration about Pebble is really
looking ahead on how people wanna live and work.
They wanna do it differently than they were
before COVID.
People are working hybrid and remote and all these things
and people want more freedom.
So, fundamentally, Pebble, as a company,
is really about creating this new lifestyle
of lighter and freer and more sustainable living
for people,
and bringing product that does that, right?
So, our first and flagship product, Pebble Flow is,
literally, a home on the road
that you can have a home anywhere you want it to be.
Or even just have this as an extension home
in front of your,
your house.
I, kind of, want to go back to what, John,
you were talking about data, right?
So,
and there's a bit of discussion about habit, right?
When people think about energy at home,
we, kind of, take it for granted.
We turn on a switch, we turn on an AC,
things just gonna work.
But we're in this
pivotal moment, like John talked about,
and because global warming,
that cannot be taken for granted anymore.
Your energy supply is not guaranteed.
We have blackouts.
<v ->Mm-hmm.</v>
<v ->Several years in California,</v>
the fifth largest economy in the world, right?
So, we are really taking, thinking about,
"What is our role, to bridge to that sustainable future
where we have energy and it's done sustainably?"
In providing that assurance and infrastructure,
by giving battery storage,
by giving solar that can run your home,
if the grid is not, cannot be relied on,
can even use this product and go to places,
if really there is a wildfire, you have to go somewhere.
You know?
<v ->And it just brings up an interesting point, too, which is,</v>
you know, many times with technologies
that are breakthrough,
like all of the panelists evidence in what they're doing,
it takes a while for it to come down the cost curve,
you know, economies of scale.
And the brilliant thinking that's going on much faster now
is bringing more products to the market
that, in general, appeal to the high-end home first.
I often say that there's only 133 million,
The median household income, which is pre-tax, is $93,000.
So, there's a lot of work to be done,
but if you don't start with things that are,
what would call, a little bit of an add-on for most,
you can't get it down
and solve the whole problem of the home.
So, it's a very good point that, you know,
we're starting here
and we're gonna change, fundamentally,
how we think of the home.
Greg, you wanna follow on?
<v ->I'd love to talk more about data as well.</v>
<v ->Please, datas.</v>
<v ->So, really two points that I'd love to cover.</v>
There's one, from an internal standpoint,
data from a sustainability perspective
can lead to really incredible outcomes.
One of the examples that I can share here today is
understanding your house and how your house
is heated and cooled
and learning, over time, what that profile looks like
by leveraging data and machine learning.
What that leads to, is this then ability
to then shift your load
and shift your heating and cooling cycles,
such that you can preheat and pre-cool your home,
such that it's, actually, operating like a battery.
Really incredible way.
And I think, from the other panelists here
that have talked about,
there are points in time when energy
is more expensive than others.
And so, this ability to shift and move,
kind of, that heat battery across, over time,
leads to, not only, again, like,
a home that is still comfortable,
but a home that is then heated or cooled using
cleaner and cheaper sources of energy.
On the flip side, that same set of data
is really, incredibly powerful in your customer's hands.
And so, one of the things that we've done,
is basically release this information
and highlighted how your home is being heated and cooled,
what is happening, in full transparency.
And what we're finding is that this allows our customers,
then, to make further optimizations.
It also allows customers to understand even opportunities
to make their homes more efficient.
A great example is we leverage both that data
and really a social graph,
where we understand how maybe one home is performing
within a neighborhood
and that can inform, perhaps,
the need to improve insulation or change out windows,
which then leads to again, a
more efficiently heated or cooled home,
all leveraging data.
<v ->That's great.</v>
Katy, did you wanna go back to data?
<v ->That's exactly</v>
<v ->Oh, okay.</v>
<v ->Teeing up.</v>
<v ->Anything to add?</v>
<v ->Just putting on my other hat for a minute on,</v>
on a sustainable-built environment.
As a homeowner, I don't know how many people have done
a renovation recently. Anyone?
<v ->You got some.</v>
<v ->About how many decisions</v>
did you have to make during that process?
Like, possibly, yeah, like, 10,000.
Like, it's just, it's utter insanity.
Even as a professional in sustainability,
when we were renovating our home
and I wanted to be as sustainable as possible,
it is tough to get the information you need
that is specific to your property.
<v John>That's right.</v>
<v ->And your location and your climate and whatever.</v>
And so, what I'm really hopeful for,
in terms of that data is,
as a consumer, throwing all that data at me
is not gonna do me any good.
But once we implement AI into the equation,
suddenly, I have some very powerful information
and the decisions can be made on a system level
for me, for my neighbors,
for, you know, a region
and taking away all the complexity,
you know, in terms of like,
"Should I get this or should I get that?"
Sort of balance.
Being sustainable is not at home,
when you're renovating, especially,
is not straightforward.
It's, there's a lot of, like, balancing,
"Should I get this kind of countertop?
Should it be marble or should it be,
you know, a composite?
Which one is more sustainable?"
Well it depends. How far you shipping?
Blah, blah, blah.
So, having an AI system to take all that data
and customize solutions for you is gonna be amazing.
<v ->That was a nice build on what Greg was saying.</v>
I want to take it back to a point that
Greg made, which is,
you also have to help consumers understand
what's the most consequential thing they can do.
So, the number one use of energy in the home
is heating and cooling.
So, if you don't get heating and cooling right,
you got a big problem because,
we're gonna try and electrify everything.
We've got a grid that's got issues,
we've got generation that needs to come more green,
we've got generation problems.
So, this notion of data, as we've heard,
and then the decisions that consumers can make,
it's important that consumers understand
what the consequential decisions are as opportunities.
Which is like,
"Oh, if I have a system
and I'm making sustainability decisions around renovation
and, behind the scenes, I'm gonna get."
It's not gonna happen this way.
"But I'm gonna get lower energy costs and credits."
Which actually, California does,
or at least SoCal Edison.
Then it's almost frictionless
to the consumer.
They still have to deal with the startup cost
and all of that.
That's really a mess.
What are the grants you're gonna get or the like?
But it's simplifying the notion of being sustainable
without somehow turning it into a confusing scenario.
Because the planet needs this in the next five years.
It can't wait for all the new homes to be built
to have energy management systems and the like.
By the way, all those homes will be over $250 or $300,000.
We gotta work on what these folks are talking about, today.
I wanna talk about, I would love for you, Nicole,
to talk about, sort of, a Savant vision of,
that's a great name, too,
a Savant vision of, you know,
where this goes for you, as a scaling company.
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>
And at similar points to what
some of the other panelists are bringing up,
but using, because we have a product that goes into the home
and it's gonna monitor your energy consumption,
there's a lot we can do with that to help users improve,
like improve their energy efficiency,
but also improve their day-to-day life.
So, for example, we are working on solutions where we can
detect that appliance or a device is not running efficiently
and it's looking like there's a
issue occurring in the device
and that maybe they need to
go check out why their dryer isn't running effectively and
predict that there might be an issue
before their dryer breaks and things like that.
But also,
just sort of, keeping an eye on the home
and providing recommendations to users.
So for example, you're running your dryer
in the middle of the day, when rates are high,
we recommend that maybe you push this off,
you shift this off to later in the day or
you've plugged in your car
and this isn't an optimal time to charge.
And there's a lot of really cool things where this,
where data can become even more powerful.
We haven't talked too much about solar
and home batteries yet,
but by being able to predict, look at weather patterns
to predict solar production,
we can also help homeowners be efficient,
if they've got rooftop solar,
how they're using their solar energy,
and how they're storing that excess power
if they've got a home battery,
and being prepared, if a grid outage does occur. So
<v John>As has been more the case.</v>
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>
<v ->Natural disaster</v>
and grid overload.
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->I think, it's a really good point.</v>
And Greg, it reminded me when Bingrui was talking about,
you know, having a sidecar to the home
and then the sidecar becomes mobile,
it's like a little home that you bring with,
that you take with you.
You know, it brought a question into my head,
which you might have some thoughts on, which is,
as I mentioned, there are only 84 million
single-family homes in the United States.
The rest are multifamily dwellings.
How do you guys, I mean, you can put a thermostat
in each of those, but in the Ecobee world,
how do we think about multifamily?
'Cause if we don't get that right,
we still have a huge problem.
<v ->In the multi-family market,</v>
I think one of the things we think about
is really making our products more affordable.
<v ->Mm-hmm.</v>
<v ->To ultimately drive also,</v>
more sustainable outcomes, as well.
We're excited, this week we've just announced
a new thermostat that is now, like, $129,
our lowest cost, to date.
<v John>Subsidized by some utilities.</v>
<v ->And the, I was gonna get to that.</v>
<v ->Oh, sorry.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>
I think one of the key things is that,
with utility programs
that are involved in demand response programs,
which we also support,
there are opportunities to get these devices for free.
And so, in terms of making, kind of like,
that smart sustainable choice,
having that simple solution,
in terms of addressing, kind of, a much broader set
of the population,
that's one of the key things that we're investing in.
We're really, really excited about, as well.
<v ->That's great.</v>
And you know, the good news here, too, is
that you're seeing innovators, on stage,
who are really not dependent
on the broader political winds of the United States.
And I only bring that up because people should know
that green energy,
despite us not having it all day,
is the lowest cost form of energy deliverable,
onshore wind, which you can't make enough of,
but solar is the lowest cost of energy.
So, when we're hearing about shifting loads
and balancing this, we're really moving to
the physics of the cheapest form of energy
that's the best for the planet.
And that's a really dynamic moment
because it's happening from the home.
It's not like the grid has all of this technology in it,
to start to balance and do this.
So, I want to come back to this notion
of storage at the edge.
<v Bingrui>Okay.</v>
<v ->And I'm gonna do it in two ways.</v>
I'm gonna ask Bingrui,
because he has storage at the edge
but in a very unique and different way.
And then I'll bring it to however
both you would like to talk about it.
But, Bingrui, you're putting storage at the edge.
<v ->That's absolutely right. Yeah.</v>
And we're doing in the-
<v ->Edge of the electric network, I'm sorry,</v>
<v ->Edge of the, edge of the grid.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Right.</v>
<v ->So 'cause as I talked about earlier, right,</v>
as weather gets more, events gets more severe,
you're gonna have more and more blackouts.
It is really essential
that we have these energy storage device as a grid.
'Cause you can't just count on the grid to upgrade,
the infrastructure upgrade cycle is just so long, right?
So, but what's hard for a consumer is, like,
kind of, to what, Katy and Greg, you all talked about
is upgrading these infrastructure at home
is really difficult.
Consumer doesn't know what to get
and they have to hire someone.
Once they pick what they want to get,
they have to hire someone to put it in.
So, what we really thought about, at Pebble, is,
how do we make it as frictionless as possible?
Turnkey.
So,
which our product is,
is basically you can buy one, get delivered to your home,
and plug it in.
And that there you have it,
you have energy storage,
you have solar generation already, right?
<v ->Yeah, I would add, I think, you know,</v>
there's light at the end of the tunnel here.
And that is, one of the things that I think
is really exciting is that
batteries at the edge, the cost of battery technology
is rapidly decreasing.
And so, what that means is that,
while still, kind of, at the higher end of home,
it's becoming increasingly affordable
to bring that local storage to your house.
And I think that the point that you made earlier, John,
is that, that actually helps to provide a buffer
for some of the challenges that exist within the grid,
that idea of balancing loads.
And having that local storage in houses
that allows you to use that cleaner cheaper energy
to accumulate that energy from perhaps solar
or when the utility grid is at its cheapest
point of rate of use.
And that affords you then, to not only have
kinda that local storage and to actually help the grid,
relative to balancing loads,
that same battery then provides you with resiliency.
And so, if there, you know,
and we talked about increasing outage events,
having that battery in your house
can then sustain a whole home now,
with the size of batteries that can be supplied,
for hours, in some cases days,
depending on the size of the battery and the home.
Really, kind of, just creating a better overall
customer experience that also is sustainable.
<v John>Yeah, and that home innovation is a key piece.</v>
And, go ahead, Nicole.
<v ->Yeah, one thing to just add to what Greg mentioned</v>
is that, we've talked a lot about
shifting your energy use at certain times of day
to save money.
But the other really awesome use case for a home battery is
a number of utilities are adopting
demand response battery programs,
where if you have a battery at home,
you can actually discharge power
that you've stored up, earlier in the day, to the grid,
when they need it most, at peak times of day.
And so, that's great, as a homeowner,
you get a financial incentive to do that.
But this is also really helping utilities
promote grid stability and give them power
when they need it most.
So, another great use case.
<v ->I think, that's a great point</v>
because what we're seeing is, as Bingrui was saying,
and we've been implying that,
the cost of upgrading the network
of the grid
is extraordinarily high
and the technologies are still very old.
It's very hard to reinvent the grid quickly.
We're a very large country with a lot of land mass
and one of the hardest things in the world to do
is move electricity long distances.
There's huge loss.
So, if the home becomes the nexus
of energy production
and demand balancing,
it's at least something that everybody,
even if they're aware or unaware that it's going on,
can help implement,
which is effectively helping the entire country
be more energy efficient.
So, it's a really great point that they brought up.
And we have one minute more,
so I'm just gonna close it off
by giving you a couple of thoughts
that we've heard about today,
which is the notion of home
is a
changing and evolving concept.
Data within the home is helping people to reimagine
and rethink how they
use energy and do other things in their home.
The notion of home is also being extended
to new technologies
and products, like Bingrui's,
so that you can have support at the home,
when you're at home.
Or you can be out and be in a home that moves around
or only have a home that moves around.
And the important thing here is
that all of this is going on
at the scale of real innovators here,
that are real companies, really delivering. Right?
Utilities and others have a harder time.
There's more, you know, money and investment involved.
But you're seeing real potential
and massive opportunities, right here,
which is incredibly encouraging
'cause ultimately, what we've talked about
in the heating of the atmosphere
and all of what we're seeing
impacts the home
as clear as anything,
through insurance costs,
the risk of where the home is located.
So, the home is really a nexus, while we don't know it yet,
as broadly as our panelists have shown us,
of, sort of, the early
opportunity to have a better path
for future generations
to have a planet somewhat like ours today.
And you all are involved
by getting the message out in your companies, and the like,
that thinking about sustainability,
and specifically about reducing carbon in whatever way,
is a path to not only customer success,
it's impact for the planet,
it's doing good for your company,
it's attracting and retaining the best talent
and hopefully having a huge impact.
So, it's empowering, it's a great message
and don't ever forget,
it's, literally, the largest investment opportunity
in the history of humanity.
So, a huge thank you to our absolutely superstar panelists
'cause they were great.
