<v ->Well, thank you so much everyone for joining us here</v>
to talk about my favorite topic,
women's health.
We have a wonderful panel today.
I can't wait to hear from them.
And first, let me introduce myself.
My name is Alice, I'm a partner with Foreground Capital,
which is a venture capital fund
investing in early-stage women's health companies.
We have 22 companies in the portfolio,
and are very excited
to continue investing at the forefront of the space.
So we don't have too much time today,
so I wanna make sure we cover all the the key topics.
And the first I like to start with
is always the personal and the why.
So, I like to hear from each panelist:
What is your why?
What brings you into the women's health world?
So let's start with Sheena,
Sheena who has a background
in government affairs and relations
and started a company in women's health.
Tell us more about that journey
and particularly the why that led you there.
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>
So, it was two things.
It was my lived experience as a woman
and hearing the challenges of other women,
how difficult it is to navigate the healthcare system.
And so with my background, as you said,
in government relations in the healthcare space,
it really gave me a different and unique perspective
of how the healthcare system worked,
where there was siloed,
and even there, there was cross pathways to work together,
but it also gave me a front-row seat into how technology
was going to change the future of healthcare.
So it was all those things combined together.
<v ->Okay, thank you. Christina.</v>
<v ->Hi, Christina Wurster.</v>
I'm with the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine,
and I have spent most of my career
working for professional medical societies.
So working closely with clinicians
first in the cardiology space,
and now in high-risk obstetrics.
And the reason I came into this, it was funny,
I was actually interviewing for the position during COVID,
but I could just feel the passion
of the members and leaders of this organization
even through Zoom,
and I would say that even with the clinicians
that I worked with before,
but there's just such a passion for the work that they do
in caring for patients
and trying to really improve outcomes.
And so ultimately, that's why I landed where I am.
<v ->Wonderful, thank you so much for sharing.</v>
And let's talk a little about each of your organizations.
So let's first understand, maybe just one sentence.
What does your organization do to help us see:
Where does it sit within the ecosystem of women's health?
There are innovators, there are investors,
there are professional societies.
So help us understand what your group does
and perhaps a sense of the scale or impact.
<v ->Yeah, I'll go first.</v>
So we are a health informatics
or data and analytics company focused on women's health.
So, our mission is to build
the first and largest women's health data index
that cuts across demographics and health status.
So, our vision is really to make sure
that we can have women's health data
be as powerful and actionable as oncology data is.
And to date, we also have a telehealth platform.
So, we've been able to reach over 8,000 women
and then also be able to provide 2,000 of them with care.
And obviously, we're able to get them to opt in
to our research studies
so that we are able to collect and manage their data
for data analytics.
<v ->Exciting, can you share a little bit</v>
about what type of data you're collecting,
and if it helps to bring it to life,
maybe one example of what you're integrating
also with the telehealth?
<v ->Yeah, so what we do is we're really about early diagnosis,</v>
and one of the things that we found out
in the early stages of our company
is that a lot of the diseases
and conditions that impact women only, solely,
or disproportionately have one thing in common,
and that's dermatological conditions.
So, our telehealth platform focuses on that first.
So we're able to diagnose the skin condition
and the underlying health condition,
and then forward them on to a specialist
that they need to see to manage that care.
<v Alice>Great, thank you.</v>
<v ->And so I work for professional medical society.</v>
There are many professional medical societies
across healthcare.
Ours specifically focused on high-risk pregnancy.
So, it's a membership organization
for clinicians and other healthcare providers
that focus on high-risk obstetrics.
They do a general residency in OB-GYN
and then a three-year fellowship in maternal fetal medicine.
There are about 3,000 board-certified MFMs within the US,
and over 90% of those are members of our organization.
But we've been growing, it's a very collaborative,
we kind of like to think of MFM
as the internal medicine of obstetrics
because they work across therapeutic areas
with partners in cardiology, endocrinology,
mental health, for example.
And we focus predominantly on promoting research,
providing continuing medical education
and also advocacy for both patient access
and things like that.
And we work very closely
with a lot of different stakeholder groups,
whether in government, industry,
or other nonprofit organizations.
<v ->Thank you, so that's great to hear.</v>
And now we know what your vantage point is,
Sheena, really speaking from the perspective
having worked with patients
and integrating different types of data
and Christina, with your members.
So next, I'd love to move into the core topics,
which is really around the gaps in women's health
at the intersection of technology and women's health.
And then we'll talk about solutions.
So actually, let me go to Christina first.
What types of gaps are you hearing about from your members,
these MFMs that are providing care daily
to patients in obstetrics?
<v ->Yeah, I mean there's a lot,</v>
so many people are aware,
but I often try to think
from our organization's perspective,
our goal is to help improve
the day-to-day of our members and support them.
Some of the biggest challenges are in patient access,
increasing costs, and increasing complications.
So more and more women and pregnant women are becoming...
considered high risk no longer just based on age.
but because of so many comorbid conditions,
there's a lot of high-risk pregnancies now
and complications.
And so one of the biggest challenges
is not just access with increase of maternal care deserts,
for example,
but also workforce
and encouraging more people to come into the field.
So, a lot of our members are burnt out,
and so that's a big challenge.
<v ->Got it.</v>
And on the prop call, you mentioned an article
that highlights the maternal healthcare deserts.
Can you share more about that?
<v ->Yeah, in fact one of our partners, the March of Dimes,</v>
many of you probably familiar,
just released their report card.
They do it every year, and it's an alarming statistic.
They kind of give a grade, I think it was a D,
D+ or something among developed countries,
which is obviously going in the wrong direction.
But 50% of counties within the US
do not have obstetric care services.
And 35% of counties...
I'm not countries, I'm sorry, counties,
35% of counties are considered maternal healthcare deserts.
And this data was from 2022.
And we're actually seeing anecdotally across our members
that more and more labor and delivery units are closing.
And that's multifactorial,
but it's leading to limited resources.
For example, our president is the chair of OB-GYN at UCSD
and she's working on an editorial.
You would not think San Diego
would be a maternity care desert,
but it's becoming one.
UCSD has doubled,
they've gone up 100% in the number of deliveries
in the last four years
because more than close to a dozen labor and delivery units
in their county or surrounding counties have closed.
<v ->Oh, you're right, that is surprising.</v>
Wouldn't have thought that, for sure.
So it sounds like challenges
that you're hearing about are mostly around access to care,
of complications and risks with the population,
and then also workforce.
And that's specific to the OB perspective.
Let's hear from Sheena.
It sounds like you're working on a broader set
of women's health issues, starting with skin,
to all the underlying conditions.
So, what gap are you solving in your company
and what other gaps remain that you see?
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>
So we're sitting in this space
of knowing that women's health is drastically underfunded,
and so there exists health data gaps,
as well as healthcare gaps.
So what we're trying to do is to close that,
to bridge that, right?
So, for example, only 4% of federal funding
goes to understanding women's health across the board.
Also, recently, about a year and a half ago,
McKinsey released a report on how to close these data gaps
because not only do we have a dearth of data,
the data that we do have
is not actually what I would say good-quality data.
It's not responsible in terms of how it's collected,
but there's also biases
that exist in the data regarding women.
So, that's where we sit.
So we know it's a huge problem,
so we're trying to work with individuals like societies,
other FinTech companies to help close all those gaps.
<v ->Absolutely, data is certainly a big problem.</v>
And thank you for mentioning the McKinsey article.
I'm very proud of my former team in my prior life.
I do wanna drill down a little bit
'cause data can mean different things.
So there's data around disease burden,
data around investment, or just health data.
So can you give a little bit more color
to what types of data you're looking at in your company,
what data you're referring to?
<v ->Yeah, so we deal a lot with health data.</v>
So our initial health areas are menopause,
cardiovascular disease, and brain health,
particularly Alzheimer's, how they're all interconnected.
So it's the health data, we collect that.
And then not only do we provide women
with insights about their own health,
we provide them insights of how we use that collectively
to help solve a health burden
for other women like themselves.
<v ->That's great.</v>
So, women are both getting care themselves
and contributing to research.
That's wonderful.
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
<v ->Great, so we have a number of gaps to solve:</v>
data, access, workforce, complications.
And this is a tech conference with innovators,
of both startup innovators,
as well as large tech companies
and the innovators within those.
So let's talk about solutions and innovation.
I'll start with Christina first.
What type of innovations are your members engaging with?
Do you find them open to it,
and what are solutions that either they or you think
could really solve some of the issues you're talking about?
<v ->Yeah, thank you.</v>
I think the tide is changing a bit in a good way.
In the past, a lot of kind of negative perceptions
were often existed between clinicians
partnering with industry as conflicts of interests,
and we do have to deal with that.
We've got clinicians writing clinical practice guidelines,
and so their relationships are looked at,
but there is a lot more receptivity
in the women's health fields, I believe,
to recognize that that partnership is critically important
and is the only way that we're going to advance solutions
in getting those working on technologies
and innovations connected
with the clinicians who are on the ground firsthand
and understanding the challenges
and where the solutions are needed.
And I'd also like to comment on the research piece.
I'm very optimistic also there
because I'm seeing some mild improvements.
It's not happening fast enough, of course,
but we don't have a centralized institute within NIH
for women's health, right?
It's decentralized, so that presents challenges.
But I think if we can focus
on promoting the clinician scientists
that are doing the work
and try to break down the barriers that they have,
it's unfortunately, they're kind of a dying breed,
but hopefully we can continue to support them
so that clinician scientists continue to thrive
and work with the innovators in the technology space
to do more research and bring more solutions to the table.
<v ->That's great.</v>
I'd love to actually dive in a little bit more
on these partnerships you mentioned
between clinicians and I guess...
And two levels.
One is what type of groups you see them partnering with.
Are they startups, are they large companies?
And do you have any examples of solutions
that do address some of the challenges
that you mentioned earlier
around access workforce, et cetera?
<v ->Yeah, I mean I think one of the solutions</v>
that's totally low tech but is mentorship.
And there's a lot of programs emerging
outside of the traditional academic or career pathways
in which people are getting paired up with mentors,
clinician mentors with the innovators.
One quick example.
I know of an undergraduate group
at Johns Hopkins University.
They're biomedical engineers,
and they're working on a fetal port delivery system,
and they're taking catheters in the cardiology space
and adopting them for port access for fetal surgery.
And how would you ever think
that a group of undergraduates would come up with that?
But it's because of the mentorship,
and they were exposed and able to observe
some fetal surgeons
and maternal fetal medicine specialists at Johns Hopkins.
So where we can multiply that
and get people connected, I think, will help.
There's the MedTech Innovator,
which I've been a part of in judging,
and programs like that
that are helping connect that expertise
and mentorship with young investigators and innovators.
<v ->Absolutely, and speaking as someone downstream</v>
from the academic innovations,
it's really great to see those partnerships
and the innovations arise.
So our portfolio is actually about 1/3 in maternal health.
So we see a lot of-
<v Christina>Thank you.</v>
<v ->Different innovations here,</v>
such as remote monitoring for pregnancy,
new ways of detecting fetal distress during delivery,
and partnerships with clinicians to test those
are really important,
as well as the researchers.
So great to hear-
<v ->That's amazing. Thank you.</v>
<v ->Your members are participating.</v>
And Sheena, let's turn to you.
What do you see as potential tech solutions,
both within your company and elsewhere
that address the data gaps that you are discussing?
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>
But to piggyback off of the previous comments,
I would really like to see more partnerships,
I'll use that word loosely,
but having chief medical officers of your startup.
I think that's paramount, right, from the very beginning,
not after the first release, right?
But we see a lot of technology improving access care data
in one little hub through telemedicine platforms,
through wearables.
I think that's a really great opportunity,
and I would envision more of the health and wellness
and fitness trackers like the Pelotons,
and Whoops, and things like that.
We're gonna see more of them focusing on women's health
and then partnering
with other FinTech companies and societies
to make sure that we're...
privacy concerns are met,
but also we're able to push further with innovation
to solve a lot of the health challenges that we have.
<v ->That's fascinating.</v>
Have you incorporated
any of these wellness type of solutions into your work?
<v ->No, but I would like to,</v>
so if there's anyone in the audience who wants a partner,
but we do a lot of advocacy and education
on our platform and as a company as a whole.
<v ->I think what's also really interesting</v>
is the blurring the lines between what is clinical
versus what is wellness.
If you have a diagnostic
that tests your hormones daily at home, for example,
plug for one of our companies, LA Health, which is here,
is that considered clinical, is that considered wellness?
I do think that there's a blurring the lines
and when we think about health data,
that's all part of your data,
even if it's collected by yourself at home.
<v Sheena>Exactly.</v>
<v ->Yep. Great.</v>
<v ->Yeah, I heard the session prior to this, and it just...</v>
It rang so true.
I think the technology and innovation is there
in so many places.
We talk about some of these healthcare deserts
and that are now being challenged
even by things like climate.
I was supposed to be here on Monday
and had my flight rebooked twice from D.C.
because of storms and, right?
So the access is getting harder and harder,
but things like remote wearables, and technology,
and sensor technology,
where you can be monitoring a patient
and just identify a trigger to then...
And hopefully cut down on the travel
and need for monitoring type thing.
So, it was just exciting to kind of see...
I thought the session before was well-timed with this one.
<v >Definitely.</v>
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
Wonderful, but there's a lot more
we can uncover there as well.
We'll love to turn to some other pastures.
So we are in a new year.
A new year, new beginnings.
What is one thing you would either like to see this year
or you do predict for women's health in 2025?
<v ->Okay, I'll jump in and go.</v>
So, I would say there's two.
I think we're gonna see more women driving the change
in women's healthcare.
I think we're also gonna see a lot more
what they call like citizen science projects,
where companies are actually going out
and asking women to participate,
taking a different term
than a typical clinical trial recruitment.
I think that's gonna be one.
And two, what I would like to see,
and I know we will see,
is that a lot of the technology
will start to incorporate the needs
and differences of women, right?
The hormonal changes, you talked about.
Fit, whether it is a cardiovascular vest,
how is that actually gonna fit with women?
We have our own different body structure there, right?
So I think that's really...
We're gonna see a lot of innovation
that I'm looking forward to.
<v ->That's great.</v>
Yeah, I mean, to be candid, coming from Washington D.C.,
there's some nervousness with the change in administration
on what that will mean
for some of our established health agencies.
So we're a little bit of a wait-and-see,
but I am, again,
hopeful that through partnership and continued dialogue,
a lot of the momentum that has been happening
in the last several years will continue.
And I also agree a little bit of a hope,
but I think that we can do more
to reduce the stigma of participating in research
and get more resources
to women's health research initiatives
and support some of these startup companies
and advance these solutions.
<v ->Absolutely, in terms of women's health,</v>
and US policy is such an interesting time
where we had never seen an administration
like the Biden Administration
pay so much attention to the space.
It's probably the first time we've ever heard a president
say the word menopause out loud.
And there are some areas within women's health
that are unfortunately politicized,
but no one can argue that maternal fetal medicine
isn't critical and important,
and that preventing pregnancies,
treating skin problems
that are also underlying other health problems are critical,
and really, it's not just about women's health,
but the overall health of women
beyond the reproductive issues as well.
For sure.
All right, let's turn to a couple of fun lightning topics.
<v Christina>Okay.</v>
<v ->Can you share</v>
with the audience your favorite shocking fact
within women's health?
<v ->Well, I shared one earlier,</v>
but I had just again read that March of Dimes report.
So it was frightening to hear
or see the increasing number of maternity care deserts,
mainly because for a lot of women,
their OB-GYN is their primary care.
So I'm just a little bit concerned
that even though that report
was focused on our current maternity healthcare deserts,
it's gonna be extrapolated at impact
across all of women's health at all ages.
So, it's a little alarming and it's growing.
It sounds like even though that was data
that's two years old,
anecdotally, what we're hearing
is that it could be significantly higher
when next year's report comes out.
<v ->Do you have any ideas on what we might do?</v>
What technology to mitigate that?
<v ->Well, I think, again, it's multifactorial, right?</v>
I think it's hard to pinpoint just one thing,
but in support for...
The rising cost may not be something that's so easy
to tackle right away.
But again, I think trying to support the workforce,
encouraging people to go into medicine,
finding them the right mentors,
people that look like them come from similar backgrounds.
I think the workforce
is something that we could potentially work on
and help support.
Things like certified midwives programs,
trying to get more providers access to training
and knowledge that they can,
because they're being forced to see patients
across multiple things that may not have been the area
of their specialty originally.
<v ->So I'm gonna cheat a little bit</v>
to refer back to one that I just shared
is that a lot of the technology or even the old technology
wasn't actually made for women's bodies.
So-
<v ->Can you give us an example?</v>
Let's dive deep.
<v ->So I don't wanna call anyone out in particular,</v>
but the number one killer of women
is cardiovascular disease.
So when we go in to have all these tests
and we're putting things on our bodies,
they're actually not fit for our bodies.
Whether our bodies are too small,
for some women, they may have more chest area.
So all the data that's being gathered like in the office
may be inaccurate.
So, like, that's shocking to me.
<v ->Absolutely, and on that note,</v>
when I was in medical school,
all drawings that I saw in the anatomy textbooks
were male bodies,
except for reproductive organs.
And that never occurred to me
that medicine has that male bias until decades later.
And also women's heart attacks
are called atypical heart attacks,
which implies that because it's a different etiology,
different type of heart attack,
implies that what women experience is atypical.
So then when doctors are seeing a patient with symptoms,
they're not thinking of that type
because it's not the mainstream heart attack,
which is a whole other story.
I absolutely agree there.
All right, let's do a couple more.
We have, again, a room full of folks in tech,
some innovators, different-sized companies.
What is one takeaway
or one thing you'd like folks in the audience to do
based on what we just heard?
We have lots of problems to solve:
access, workforce, health.
Any takeaways?
<v ->Yeah, I mean, I think just to encourage the partnership,</v>
a lot of people in the room
may be from working with startups, or VCs,
or whatever it might be,
and encourage the dialogue and communication.
I think there's a lot that we can be doing together
that we don't necessarily even realize
until the conversations are started.
So, just encourage everybody
to seek out partnership and dialogue
with the clinician community
so that we can together kind of help advance
what you're trying to accomplish.
<v ->Yeah, so for women's health,</v>
I would encourage people to bring experts on your team
who focus on women's health.
Next, don't just make women's health an initiative.
Create so it's a real standalone program.
And then not be afraid to educate
and communicate with your patients and consumers
who are using your products and services.
<v ->Thank you.</v>
All right, let's do a fun one.
Can you give a recommendation for a podcast,
TV show, movie, or book, your favorite medium?
<v ->So mine right now is the "Landman,"</v>
I don't know if anybody watches that.
It's on Amazon Paramount+.
So it's about the individuals
who work the oil fields down in South Texas.
So they don't focus on like the policy business,
they're focused on the people who actually work on the oil
and then also how they have to deal with the cartel.
So, I recommend everyone watch it.
It's awesome.
And it stars Billy Bob Thornton, so you gotta watch it.
<v ->And real quick,</v>
mine is kind of one that's been around for a while,
but Guy Raz, "How I Built This."
He interviews CEOs, and talks about their journeys,
and how they built companies and stuff.
And he's just a creative
and very kind of energizing podcast, so...
<v ->Wonderful, well, thank you to our panelists</v>
for this great discussion,
and come find us after if you wanna discuss more.
<v ->Thank you.</v>
<v ->Thank you, thank you.</v>
