- Okay, the mics are on.
Good morning.
9:00 AM Vegas.
You guys are really
impressive, I gotta tell you.
So we get the honor to kick off
the robotics discussion here at CES,
here at 9:00 AM in the West Hall,
about retail robotics, robots at retail.
My name's Oliver Mitchell
and I'm your moderator.
And I'm gonna tell you a
little bit about myself,
a little bit about how I see the landscape
of retail robotics.
And then I'm gonna let
each of our panelists
introduce themselves and share with you
their videos of their products
that you might have never seen.
This is really, you know,
news-breaking stuff here.
So there I am again.
All right.
So does everyone know who that robot
is there serving the drinks?
That's Elon Musk dressed
up as a robot, Optimist.
So as I mentioned
before, my name's Oliver.
I'm a venture capitalist.
And so why should you listen to me?
Because I deploy capital?
No, I've been a founder
and operator of startups.
I've sold them to big multinationals.
And my last one was called
Robot Galaxy at retail.
It was a STEM robotics company.
We had stores, we had wholesale accounts,
we had a multiplayer virtual world,
and we also had entertainment products.
We were transmedia brands.
And near the end of that,
the blogging sphere started,
and my marketing department
created a blog for me.
They know, you know,
that I was always called
the robot guy in New York.
"Hey, there's Oliver, he's the robot guy."
And my marketing department
thought it'd be cute,
knowing that I'm Jewish, to
name the blog Robot Rabbi.
So I got a promotion, I became a rabbi.
But I became a rabbi of robotics,
and I started to write trade
periodicals about robots.
And I got to meet some
really great founders,
some of them on stage like Jeff
and Erik and I started to invest
in automation technologies,
and I had my own investment
vehicle called Atomic Ventures,
where I had eight exits,
two that went public,
and one that got bought by
private equity for 1.4 billion.
And then I ended up joining another fund
called ff Venture Capital,
where I'm at today.
And these are some of our holdings.
I also teach.
And a shameless plug, but
if you scan that QR code,
you can pre-order your book
of "A Startup Field Guide in
the Age of Robots and AI."
Oh, I love it. Look at all those cameras.
Okay.
And I interviewed about
of taking their idea from ideation
all the way to going public.
One of the people that I
interviewed was Mick Mountz.
Now I would say that Mick
Mountz is the progenitor
of robots at retail.
And this all starts in the
first, you know, web 1.0,
the dot-com era when a
company called Webvan
raised a ton of money, $800 million.
They build huge distribution centers,
and they were the first
online grocery company.
Makes sense, right?
We all use Instacart, right?
But they didn't do much market research,
and they didn't really, you
know, get that many orders,
but they had these huge
distribution centers
and Mick Mountz was the
director of logistics for them.
And he saw that there
was a real problem there.
They were basically, as his
partner, Raphael Andrea says,
they were taping $50 to every
package going out the door
because it was costing them so much money.
And Mick saw that, like,
they were using these slides,
and this was the first
time you opened up a carton
and repack it to ship it to a consumer.
And so he would go to
the company, he's like,
"Listen, can I put a a glass jar of Prego
tomato sauce on the slide?"
They're like, "No, you can't do that.
It's gonna break all over the place."
"Well, can I take, on the
chute can I take something soft
and put it there?"
"No, it's gonna get stuck."
And he saw that there
was nothing really there
that was solving the problem
of online fulfillment.
And sure enough, Webvan went bust,
after a huge IPO, $800
million they raised,
and they went bust within three years.
And so around this time
there was a small online book retailer.
You might have heard of them, amazon.com.
They dropped the dot com shortly after.
And you could see in 1997,
you could see that their
original fulfillment center
in Seattle there using what
Jeff Bezos coined door desks.
They went to Home Depot and put some 2x4s
and created a desk.
And that was the original
fulfillment center.
And as they grew with more
orders, more products,
you would have people
walking miles pushing carts.
And it was really inefficient.
And Mick saw this not just with Amazon,
but with Walmart, with Target.
And he created Kiva.
And what Kiva does...
This would be really
great if this would load.
There we go.
Okay, what Kiva does, it brings
this shelving to the picker
and actually reorganizes the warehouse
based upon best sellers.
And he ended up building
this very quickly,
and he serviced the top 10%
of all online e-commerce companies,
including Walmart and others.
Two of them being diapers.com
and right here in Vegas, Zappos.
And who acquired diapers.com and Zappos?
Amazon.
And when Amazon saw what
Kiva was doing for them,
they're like, "Listen, we need Kiva."
And they bought them for $775 million.
That's still one of the
largest acquisitions to date.
And that was in 2012,
in the robotic space.
That payback came within months.
I mean they were shipping
billions of packages
as you could see,
close to a billion dollars
was within five months.
You know, in five years
it was like three months.
And so this really started
what I would say robots at retail,
because today, if I walk you through
how a retail store lays out,
you have the front of the store,
and this is in brick and mortar,
where you have people greeting you.
And there's been...
Some of these robots here have died,
you know, an unfortunate death,
like Pepper there in the left hand corner.
But the concept is true.
And it's more in Asia,
these greeting robots.
And then you have robots doing functions
that humans don't do so
great, like rack jobbing,
and point of sale scanning.
And Jeff's gonna get into that with Tally,
that can get better
analytics, better data.
Because what happens
when you go to Walgreens
and they're out of your
favorite toothpaste?
You just go to your mobile device
and you just order it on Amazon,
it's gonna come tomorrow.
Maybe you got bad breath for a day.
And so, and then, you know, we
have robots cleaning floors,
like Wiz and Brain Corp.
You have robots moving people in airports.
And then going to one of the biggest areas
is online fulfillment that
Erik's gonna talk to you about.
You even have robot
drones scanning UPC codes
going up two stories to see
the fulfillment centers.
You have robots unloading trucks,
and then you have robot delivery.
And you know, besides Plus One,
which is a portfolio company,
you could see Manna, which
is a drone delivery company,
that ff's an investor in.
And you have autonomous trucks
and (indistinct) delivery there.
And so I bring this up is,
where does this all lead?
Well, I'm sure you've
all seen some videos,
and this is Optimus
who I started off with,
and there's a lot of other humanoids.
But there's a lot of
human functions out there,
like folding shirts.
And as we get large language
models, really the big frontier
as I see it, is dexterity,
human-like dexterity.
And that opens up lots of opportunities.
And that if you look at
the humanoid landscape,
it is growing.
And this is only a handful.
We saw Jensen give a
presentation a couple nights ago
and with even more humanoids
than he did at at his
original Nvidia conference.
And we see that every human
function in the workplace,
and even the home,
potentially could be augmated with robots.
And that's a really
trillion dollar business.
And that's their trillion dollar business.
So I'm gonna let Ujjwala,
and then let Jeff and Erik
tell you a little bit
about what they're doing.
- All right.
Well, good morning everyone.
I hope you all are well
caffeinated like I am.
My name is Ujjwala.
I'm the co-founder and chief
strategy officer at Artiligent.
So we are a research and development lab
that helps businesses
conceptualize, design,
and build custom and semicustom robots.
So how do we do this?
We leverage off the shelf platforms.
So that takes care of your
core robotic technology,
like navigation, obstacle avoidance.
And we build a layer of software,
and based on the customer's
use case, we build the body
of the robot using cost effective
methods like 3D printing.
So I have a little video here,
and hopefully this plays.
- [Oliver] You need to just press
the blue button really hard.
- All right.
So a few notable examples
of robots that we've built.
And you probably saw the
Coke Bot robot there.
I'd love to kind of give you a small story
of how that journey came about.
So this is about three years back.
We built a mobile information kiosk
for Bangalore International Airport,
which is the size of JFK.
So sees about 18 million
passengers every year.
And you can imagine the complexity
of questions that come up
with so many passengers.
And we built a conversational AI tool.
This is pre-ChatGPT, so it
was a very successful pilot.
People of course today are very accustomed
to hearing human-like responses from AI,
but back then it was quite innovative.
And the sort of result of
being at an airport space was,
it was also very, like,
highly visible pilot for us.
And we soon started getting observed
by marketers like Ogilvy and WPP
that were interested in having retailers
market their offerings on this robot.
So through those introductions
we started having
more conversations with
WPP, which is of course
the global marketing agency for Coca-Cola.
And they came to us with a very
interesting problem in mind.
So they wanted to increase
the foot traffic in beverage
aisles in supermarkets and grocery stores.
So if you've purchased a Coke
or any other beverage recently,
it's probably an impulse buy.
I think candy kind of falls
in that same category.
So through brainstorming
sessions, we made recommendations
to create a robot that would bring
the beverage to the customer.
That was very well received,
and we launched our first iteration
of the Coke Bot in front of the President
and CFO of Coca-Cola, John Murphy.
He was on a big business trip to India.
And we also saw a 22% uptick in sales
within the first month.
So that led to subsequent
projects with Coke.
We launched Sprite Zero,
Jack Daniels and Coke,
which is their new alcoholic offering.
And we've since built robots for Nestle,
a robot that looks like Kit Kat.
On the other side, so
sort of on the e-commerce
fulfillment side, we've
been working with DHL
to build a robot in
their fulfillment center.
And let's see, what else?
We also partner with OEMs
to help them commercialize
the robots in new markets.
So a lot of exciting things
lined up for us in 2025.
We're very much an early
states startup right now
and very excited, really
looking forward to 2025.
And what a better way to kick
it off than being here at CES.
- [Oliver] Excellent.
- Maybe I'll do introductions
and play a video.
- [Oliver] Yeah, that
sounds like a good idea.
- Cool.
Hey everybody and thanks for having me.
My name's Jeff.
I'm one of the co-founders
and chief design officer
of Simbe Robotics.
And what we've built to date
is a data analytics platform
that we call Store Intelligence,
which is essentially a
single source of truth
for accurate and reliable
data for our retailers
so that they can change the
operations in their space.
Our goal is to really
redefine retail operations
so that they can curb
the loss that happens
in these markets.
And how are we doing this?
For the past 10 years we've built
an autonomous mobile robot named Tally
that I'll show you in a
video post this review.
And we've built this robot to
be unobtrusive and friendly,
to share the space with
people in the store,
including staff and shoppers.
It moves up and down the aisles
and throughout the entire store,
capturing high fidelity
information that we convert
to actionable insights for them
to curb this loss in sales.
When the problem, for most of you,
you probably understand
it, the point of sale knows
what comes in, it knows what comes out,
but the everything in between,
what happens in real time, is a gray area.
If the product's not on the
shelf, people can't buy it.
Wrong price, they may get an empty basket,
they're not gonna do anything with it.
So we're trying to curb that.
In the past it's been 6%.
In the pandemic, it went
up 15% out of stocks rates,
and it is backed down again,
but the problem still exists.
So when we built this platform,
we're applying it to grocery
club format supplier.
One of our newest ones
we'll show in the video,
C-A-L Ranch, and a series of others
that are coming of retail formats.
I'm also happy to announce as of yesterday
that we will be the first
retail technology company
in the world to do
multimodal data capture,
which is essentially taking
computer vision, RFID,
and fixed sensing as an extension of Tally
and working on top of Tally's data
to bring something much
richer, much more holistic
throughout any type of environment
and possibly extending into other aspects
of the supply chain and operations.
We're really looking to
become a turnkey partner here
for our retailers to curb the loss,
and really improve customer
experience overall.
Let's play the video
and you'll get a sense of
what I'm talking about.
Just the blue?
What's that?
- [Oliver] Press the button hard.
One more time.
- [Jeff] Here we go.
- [Ujjwala] And one more time, sorry.
- [Jeff] In the world of
robotics, I still struggle.
- [Madison] Came in the C-A-L Ranch today,
I noticed something a little different.
There was a little robot going around.
- And it has a little eyes on it.
- It's a robot, it's
actually taking inventory.
- Super cute. Found out her name's Tally.
- She traverses the aisle,
she whistles at people.
- Woot-woo.
We're ranch and home stores,
C-A-L Ranch and Coastal.
We have just about everything you need.
Feed, sporting goods, apparel.
We have 55 locations
spread over six states.
We have stores from 20,000 square feet
up to over 100,000 square feet.
- What made us decide
to partner with Simbe
was we saw huge potential
to use technology
to free-up our associates to
meet the customer's needs.
Before Tally, it'd take
us probably a good month
to get the whole store.
Now we can do it within a matter a day.
Tally can go through our hard
line side three times a day,
condense the reporting and
send it to us each morning,
that then we can go work the exceptions.
- [Katie] With Tally, now
I'm able to scan the code
with the app and it'll show me
the exact location where it is.
So that cuts the time in half.
- We're able to be down every aisle
in every location every day.
And that's super powerful
for us to be able
to be in our stores even when we're not
in our stores physically.
- I actually go into work
excited to, like, work with Tally
because we're like a team.
We help each other.
- It is the first time that I've ever seen
a robot in a store before, and I think
it could go, like, everywhere.
- It allows me to know that
there's gonna be things
on the floor when I come in.
- It's pretty neat that
they're investing in the future
and they wanna make my
experience that much better.
- We're just beginning to
understand the abilities
that Tally offers and the
impact that it'll have
on the company going forward.
- And I am gonna pass it to my
esteemed colleague Erik here.
Thank you everybody.
- Good morning, I'm Erik Nieves.
I'm the founder of Plus One.
We're a robotics company in Texas.
We've been around seven years.
And unlike Artiligent and Simbe,
you will never see our robots, right?
If things go well, our robots
will be invisible to you
because we work behind the scenes.
Because whether it's
brick and mortar retail
or it's e-com, the goods need to move
through the distribution channel.
And Plus One builds AI
robots for that purpose.
And just to give you a
sense of how that works,
these are computer vision-enabled,
AI-driven machines,
and they will load the sorting conveyors
and such that bring packages to you.
So if they show up at
your porch this week,
they are probably a user
of Plus One's technology.
Parcel shippers, big e-com, et cetera,
use robots like this driven by AI tools
and computer vision to
load and move the parcels
through the facility,
or take parcels off of pallets
and send them into inventory.
I think we've seen enough of that.
The notion is robots, when we
talk about robots and retail,
we really mean the entire ecosystem
because robots and automation
have a role to play
in each piece of the sort
of shopping experience,
whether it's front of
store, back of store,
all of them suffer from the same issues
on labor availability and such.
- Awesome.
Well let's hear it for our panelists here.
That was amazing.
So, you know, we have about 20 minutes
for a little open discussion
amongst ourselves.
If there's time allows, we'll
pass the mic to you guys.
But, you know, in seeing the videos,
it brought back so many
memories as a retailer.
I remember doing inventory
with Post-it notes
and closing the store
on a Sunday to Monday.
And it was like a 24-48 hour...
You had to stop inventory
both in the warehouse
and in the stores and do full counts.
And it was the biggest pain
in the **** as a retailer.
And you know, I know
that everything starts
at the warehouse, right?
If you get inventory
and your planning's off,
and fulfillment, whether
that's online fulfillment
or it's brick and mortar
to distribution centers,
I mean, I remember being a wholesale,
and if you were labeled
incorrectly, they sent it back.
And guess who paid for
that, the shipping back?
And then, in store design
the gondolas are so important
when you go into a store,
those are the displays,
for calling people.
You know, there's a real
balance in store design
between something feeling precious
and something being approachable.
I think Warby Parker
does that really well,
that you can touch and feel the glasses,
they're not too precious,
but they're really kind of sexy up there
because it's like designed
nicely and everything like that.
You feel it's really high end.
And your robots that
interface with the users.
And so I'm gonna combine, I
know we did a a little review
of the questions, but time is compressed
so I'm gonna combine a
couple of thoughts here,
and I'd really love your thoughts,
is that one of the big stories, you know,
and you were mentioning
about GPT, is AI, right?
And so much that you rely on
and all three of you is computer vision.
And so much of your
investment into training data.
We gotta take a step back.
What Erik showed, it looks
really simple, right?
Suction, end effectors picking
up robots on a conveyor belt.
But if you notice there
were cardboard boxes there,
there was, you know, different
types of envelopes there,
there was that really
annoying Amazon white
that folds in a different way.
And like, robots go awry, right?
And you need a lot of training data
to protect against that.
If you're gonna make
investments in your stores,
in your brand for robots,
well the roboticists here
need to know what they're dealing with.
And I've never been to
a ranch supply store,
being a New Yorker, but
it looks really cool.
So my question is to all of you
guys is how are you planning
for the future in your investments
of taking the next
iterations of your products,
in utilizing large language models,
and combine that with computer
vision and different sensors,
to provide more opportunities
for your customers?
You spoke last, Erik.
I'm gonna start with you because
you're looking right at me,
and we'll just go down
the line, but feel free-
- I'm not averting my gaze.
You know, sure.
In seven years Plus One's
already on our second
sort of iteration of the core technology.
And initially everything is
based on computer vision, right?
That's the difference between
robots in this line of work
and robots in manufacturing.
In manufacturing everything is repeatable.
You do the same thing 800,000 times
so the robots can be blind.
But in any of the work that we care about,
you have to discover
every item, every cycle.
And so computer vision is really
the fundamental technology.
Computer vision itself
has been revolutionized
just in the last five years through AI.
Initially, you know, our computer vision
was what we'll call
classical computer vision.
And since then we've all adopted AI tools
to sort of make the systems more flexible
and more tolerant of change.
And that's ultimately what
we need is flexibility.
Because what I'm confident
in is, whatever you order
this week, when you order it next week,
it's not gonna be the same thing, right?
We're always changing packaging types,
materials, shipping, et cetera.
Even if it's the same SKU,
as far as the operation
is concerned, it is different in some way.
And so you need to be
able to have AI tools
give you the sort of elbow room necessary
to maintain the systems
operational at a cadence.
That said, I am a human exceptionalist.
And what I mean by that is I love AI.
We use AI in every single
robot we've deployed.
And yet I'm a big believer
that AI has limitations
and people are better
than robots at vision.
And so there will absolutely be occasions
when robots get confused and
the AI is simply not enough
to resolve the issue.
But people are really good
at exception handling.
And so frankly, that's the reason
I called the company Plus
One is because you add
a human being to the control loop
and watch just how much more
reliable the systems become.
And so when the classical
computer vision fails,
and the AI layer fails,
and the robot says,
"I got nothing, I don't
know what I'm looking at,"
a person can see exactly what
that robot is experiencing
and go, "Yep, I understand
why you're having a problem.
I would pick up that one."
And that, of course, gets
the robot going again,
but more importantly feeds
the AI model over time,
and then you don't have
that same situation.
So probably gonna be a theme
that AI plus human supervision
of some kind, some human involvement,
it's that collaboration
where the real value lies.
- We see this as well.
You pointed out these unique products
that really mess stuff up.
And we see this on the store shelf
'cause there's such a variety
of different kinds of products.
And we use the algorithms,
our own especially,
to detect some of these things.
But being able to
differentiate between them,
this is a big piece where
if the algorithm's working
really well and then there's
a piece where we're not sure,
or the can's sideways
or something like that,
it lets us know and then
we can make clarifications
or call it out and it'll
help make an action
that isn't, like, bad data.
So there's this whole
piece where the information
has to be accurate, even
if it's not perfect,
you can at least say this is an anomaly.
'Cause what's happening
in these kinds of spaces,
even with ChatGPT, they can only access
what they know off like
internet and things like that.
But in like our space, we're creating it.
It's this unknown and you're
using your own algorithm
to detect the differences
and figure out like,
what can you work with that's a sure thing
and what can you not, but
include that in the data
so that people can make an action
and then transform, piece by piece,
even if it needs a
little bit of human help.
- So as far as we are
concerned with the concierge
or the mobile information kiosk use case,
a large language model
has been a game changer.
So earlier you would need
to create an entire flow,
pre-program responses,
and then train the model.
Today something that would
take us, like, weeks to do
can be done within a
few minutes using LLM.
And all you need to do
is feed the data set
and set some rules or
a playbook around it.
So we tested a sort of pilot
recently at DC Startup Week,
which is a local event in Washington DC
where we set up a ChatGPT
for conferences and events,
and people could simply come
up and ask a query like,
"What session is Oliver moderating?"
and it would give you a response.
So incorporating that
is definitely a plan.
And I'm very excited about
the shared intelligence.
I think now, of course, if you've seen,
Jensen Wong's keynote, this
idea around taking real world
simulations, this
omniverse, and having robots
learn from each other and
from human beings as well.
So in the future, let's say
there's a early stage startup
that's looking to maybe build
a company that packages food,
and Plus One has already
figured out a lot of things,
maybe that could just be a solution
that can be shared across robots.
So again, as an early stage startup
and you know, working
with businesses to develop
proof of concepts, that's
extremely valuable to us
because it really cuts
through the time development.
- Excellent, you know,
when you all were speaking,
remind me of some
interviews I did in my book,
which I'm sure all of you
have bought by now on Amazon,
and one of them was with Rodney Brooks,
and one of his design
principles was human agency.
That robots will go awry,
and that you need a way to,
that if you have a robot in a hospital,
and someone's having a cardiac arrest,
and the robot's blocking a
gurney from getting to an OR,
everyone's gonna hate the robot.
Or if you have a robot in a store
and it goes into a toddler,
everyone's gonna hate the robot, right?
So you need a way for human
beings to have agency.
And these are like, when you
think about robots working
at retail, you think about
a lot of human beings
around robots, and you think
about those edge cases.
But you also think about
there's a lot of macro factors
for deploying robots, right?
Macroeconomic factors.
You mentioned pandemic and
that during the pandemic
it shifted things.
We're now post-pandemic, and
interest rates have been high,
and so when people are
making new investments
into automation, that
definitely affects things.
Building new fulfillment
centers, that affects things.
And when you think about
macro labor trends,
where that you're talking about Plus One,
and you're talking about,
that there's a shortage
of skilled labor out there
where people are investing in robots.
So tell me, like, as, you know,
people that are deploying
robots within this commercial
world around humans, around
these macro labor trends,
what do you see as sort
of the best cocktail
to being successful if we're starting
a company in this space?
Why don't we start with Jeff?
- Sure. Yeah.
Our customers reveal to
us that they're struggling
to hire for these positions.
They're very mundane, and laborious,
and physically intensive.
So they struggle with this gap.
And we found, and they
tell us, that if you can
replicate this mundane process,
kind of like your calculator,
and have that team
do other things like
customer service and filling,
which they need, desperately,
filling the shelf,
that is a model that seems
to have been working for us,
and is growing, I think
more now than ever.
You know, with the loss we
discussed, it's a lot easier
for shoppers with the
information at their fingertips
to say "no" when they're
not getting what they want,
which will maintain and accelerate
this, "I'm not buying it"
when you're getting lost sales.
This is the the whole point
we're trying to curb, right?
It's in the trillions
globally in lost sales.
So there's a huge opportunity here.
For decades retail never
really had the technology
available, I think, to curb this problem.
- So I think the perfect cocktail
is a complex concoction, right?
Like for any business to succeed-
- We're making success cocktails
- You know, you need a product market fit,
you need the right team,
access to capital, cash flow.
Adaptability, I would say,
especially for any robots
that are in the retail space.
I mean, of course retail
has been through so much
over the last five or or six years.
I would say since the
pandemic, a lot of, like,
brick and mortar stores
have shown resilience.
You're also seeing e-commerce stores
sort of open brick and mortar stores.
So a lot of opportunities
for us as a company.
What's interesting is we're also seeing
sort of omni-channel strategies in play.
So buy online, pickup in
store is one example of that.
And there are a lot of robots
that are beneficiaries of it.
I think Cleveron Robotics
is sort of a click
and collect model.
I would say the opportunity
here is to look at fulfillment,
sorry, brick and mortar stores is also
like fulfillment stores in some ways.
So yeah, I mean again, sort of looking
at both the e-commerce and
the the fulfillment side.
- Yeah, we've seen that.
Like even like Instacarts
have approached us before,
and said hey, you know,
like out of a shopping list
of 13 things, one or
two items ain't there,
and that's like their biggest pain point.
- Yeah, you know, you talk about
just sort of the macros
here, I would argue
that no robot ever deployed
in a warehouse context
has resulted in a pink slip.
There's just not enough labor
available, period, right?
And so the first thing you do is you try
to make the labor more efficient.
And that's why you see so many of the AMR
sort of applications
where you're just trying
to make the picker more
productive, reduce their walk time,
give them more picks per hour.
It's all in the sake of
we don't have sufficient labor available.
That said, I do caution my
users, or potential clients,
make sure you're evaluating,
do you have a labor problem
or do you have a labor hassle?
'Cause those are two different things.
A labor hassle is, "I have a lot of churn,
I'm always onboarding people,
I'm always having to train folks.
I hate doing it."
A labor problem is beyond that.
Nobody is showing up at
the door to take the job.
If you have a labor hassle,
you're gonna have a different ROI struggle
than you are with a labor problem.
The finance officer is interested
in solving a labor problem.
He may not fund your project
if you have a labor hassle, right?
- Yeah, well said.
- Erik is always so articulate.
And he's also featured my book,
so another shameless plug.
But so, you know, in my presentation
I ended with humanoids,
and I think it's on everyone's minds.
There's lots of cool videos out there,
and I focused on Optimist
because I didn't want to pick any
one private robot company out there.
But there's a lot out there,
there's a lot of capital being raised.
And that the investor
sort of value proposition
is that everywhere there's
human hands, you know,
that can't be on a conveyor belt,
that can't be serviced by a
co-bot, a humanoid could do.
And I wanna know, you know...
And walking around the show floor,
I don't know if you've
had the opportunity,
I think Agility is just downstairs.
And so what's your thoughts regarding,
with your solutions, you're
talking about augmenting
human labor, is there a Plus
1.5 with humanoid out there?
Is there, you know...
Do you see humanoids going
and serving Coke bottles
to people and so forth like that?
- I'm a big believer in anytime
you have this much capital
flowing to this many smart
people, good things will happen.
Now, are we in a humanoid hype cycle?
- There's never been a trough
and disillusionment after that.
- Right? No.
But you are going to...
The definition of a hype
cycle is the expectations
have outpaced the realities.
And so, you know, are we in
a hype cycle for humanoids?
Of course we are.
There's that much money,
you're not going to be able
to meet all of that demand.
That said, good things are going to come
from the humanoid exercise.
And you know, one of the
things that I'm excited about
is you saw in that video,
those were two robots.
But those two robots were
acting independently.
They could not collaborate and
work on something together.
Maybe a big package showed up
that was too heavy for one,
but what would you do?
You'd use two hands and pick it up.
Robots don't do that today.
But humanoids, and some
of the developments
and the techniques that
come from that effort,
are absolutely going
to have sway in the way
that we perform work in
the warehouse, for sure.
- We get asked, "When is
Tally gonna grow arms?"
And I don't think the answer
is not for a very long time, or wherever.
We don't know, but there's
a place for every type
of hardware platform, and
you really have to design
for that job or that task.
And for us, like, ground
mobile you can do a lot with.
It doesn't necessarily have to
have that level of dexterity.
Depends on what it is.
There are things that can
be considered, you know,
when you automate, can you
change the automation path
that would require less manipulation?
I think those are pieces of a puzzle
that may not happen, like, overnight.
Some of it's transitional.
Maybe humanoids will
start to fill this gap
and then evolve into, instead
of two arms, the one arm.
And then maybe it doesn't have any arms,
and just has like, a
conveyor that comes out of it
or something like that.
So I would even challenge the industry
to think more openly about
how could you best solve
the problem and it doesn't have,
not to fix your mind to
humanoid necessarily.
- Yeah.
I would say it's really exciting.
And you mentioned Agility Robotics.
The CEO, Peggy Johnson, said
the world was built for humans.
So I think there's definitely room
for humanoids to thrive here.
- You know, we're at 0, 0, 0 here,
so I predicted we would only
get through three questions.
But you know, everybody in the room,
you have a chance
afterwards to really speak
to the leading minds here of robotics.
And if you don't get an
opportunity to speak to them,
you can always buy my book.
And so...
But I really wanna thank you
guys for coming out early.
It's Vegas, and early is
really tough in Vegas.
And I wanna thank the
audience, and thank Robin,
our producer here.
So I hope everyone has a good show.
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.
