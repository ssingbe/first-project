<v ->Please welcome the CEO and vice chair</v>
of the Consumer Technology Association
and best selling author, Gary Shapiro.
<v ->Thank you and welcome to CES 2025.</v>
Thank you so much for coming to CES.
It is the coolest, funnest,
and most exciting technology show, or in fact,
any show in the world.
It gathers the innovators, the disruptors,
and the dreamers, the people who reshape our world now
and actually are creating a better future.
These days, it feels like everyone is pivoting.
Certainly, the United States and Canada are in the midst
of a dramatic pivot in government.
But so is the rest of the world.
That's what I hear from the innovators in Eureka Park,
our home for startups,
and from the global technology brands
that are driving our economies and our world forward.
It's what I hear from leaders in technology
and in government every day.
And it's what inspired CTA's new book,
"Pivot or Die: How Leaders Thrive When Everything Changes".
Thank you.
Of course, progress has never come from standing still.
It comes from those who took a chance
and they tried something new.
Think about it.
Humans discovered fire,
and that sparked the birth of civilization.
We didn't just use fire.
We harnessed it: to cook, to warm our homes,
to shape the world.
Along came the wheel,
an innovation that allowed us to travel further and faster.
A lot of other innovations occurred.
Cars, machines that shrunk time and space.
We turned our eyes to the sky.
The airplane wasn't just
a way to get from one place to another.
It showed our ability to break barriers,
to stretch the limits of what's possible.
As humans, we've done
this over and over, pivoting,
innovating to survive and to thrive.
And that's especially true in the rapidly evolving world
of technology, where we have to adapt or become obsolete.
Pivot or die.
As we know, successful companies don't just ride the wave
of change, they create it.
Just look at our CES 2025 keynotes.
Nvidia, amazing last night.
Panasonic, Sirius XM, X, formerly known
as Twitter, Delta, Volvo Group, Accenture, and Waymo.
All companies with the agility to adapt and pivot
in response to changing markets
and a rapidly changing world.
And that's not to mention
the over 1,000 speakers joining us on CES stages
over the next four days.
These leaders succeed not just
because of their amazing products and services,
they succeed because they know that technology is only
as powerful as the people around it.
And today we're actually seeing technology
and humanity intersect.
AI, autonomous vehicles,
and quantum computing aren't just changing industries,
they're solving some of the world's biggest challenges.
AI is revolutionizing automation and decision making.
Autonomous vehicles are reshaping mobility,
making roads safer and systems more efficient,
and it's opening new doors
for the elderly and people with disabilities.
And health technology is supporting patients
and extending quality of life.
While these technologies solve problems,
they can also create a new one,
an increasing demand for energy.
And that's why here at CES 2025,
you'll also see solutions in sustainability, efficiency,
and energy production.
And that will help us navigate this big energy transition
in front of us.
To share more, I am so thrilled to introduce
a true champion of innovation and a star at CTA,
President of the Consumer Technology Association,
Kinsey Fabrizio!
<v ->Thank you. (laughs)</v>
Thank you, Gary. And welcome, everyone.
There is truly no place on earth like CES
as a gathering spot for so many people around the world
who believe in the power and the possibility
of tech innovation.
From solving big global challenges like access to food
and medical care and education
to making our everyday lives just
a little bit greater,
technology is an incredible force for good.
Take healthcare.
Remote patient monitoring has revolutionized how we care
for people, especially in rural and underserved areas.
And AI is powering everything from diagnostics
to drug discovery.
Or take accessibility.
At CES 2025, you'll find smart home technology,
autonomous mobility, and even 3D printed prosthetics.
And I'll tell you a personal story,
my father-in-law has mild hearing loss.
And during the holidays, you know,
he was using his new hearing aid feature on his AirPods.
And he said he was so thankful to CTA for our work
to make over-the-counter hearing aids possible.
Thank you.
And trust me,
between the jolly chowder and the rowdy children,
it's a big Italian family, those AirPods came just in time.
At CES, you'll see over-the-counter hearing aid technology
on the show floor,
along with wearable tech for every need you can imagine.
<v ->I love that story, Kinsey.</v>
You know, we spend a lot of our time talking
about the big picture of technology,
like its power to drive economic growth,
boost our stock portfolios, and change industries.
But that's all important.
But it really is just as important to talk
about how technology changes our individual lives,
the way you just did.
Because at the end of the day, technology matters,
because it helps people like your father-in-law
and millions more around the world.
<v ->It's true.</v>
And it's far from replacing people.
Technology empowers them.
Think about ag tech
that helps farmers make better decisions
about the crops they plant
and augmented reality glasses
that provide real-time language translation.
And how about cybersecurity tools
that are helping us protect ourselves and our data?
From AI to robotics and healthcare and sustainability,
CES 2025 will show what's possible
when the entire tech ecosystem comes together in one place.
You'll see the companies driving forward our autonomous
future, adapting to new environments in real time
and opening doors for people with mobility challenges.
And you're going to see innovations
that are creating new power and supporting
a more sustainable world.
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
You know, Kinsey, each year at CES,
we see that innovation can come from anyone, anywhere.
But for good ideas to become great products,
innovators need pro-innovation policies.
To keep our economies thriving and inflation in check,
we need policies that enable startups,
allow businesses to flourish,
and create the next generation of tech leaders.
Policies that create rules of the road
for tech companies and offer guardrails
to protect safety, privacy, and fairness.
Here in the U.S.,
that means finding a way to break through the gridlock
and pass sensible immigration reforms
to promote highly skilled immigration.
Thank you, Michael.
<v ->He's a good cheerleader.</v>
<v ->And recognizing that tariffs are taxes paid</v>
for by American businesses and the American people
and the world.
In fact, we actually just released some research Sunday
at our Tech Trends presentation,
and it shows that the proposed tariffs
on tech products could tank U.S.
consumer purchasing power by as much as $143 billion
in just the first year.
<v ->And with the growing scrutiny of the tech ecosystem</v>
and a new U.S. administration coming soon, the conversations
that we're having here at CES over the next four days
have never been more important.
And to help drive those conversations,
we're also looking to CTA's Global Innovation Scorecard.
First launched in 2019,
the scorecard is designed to rank countries
on the policies and practices that fuel the fire
of innovation or stand in the way of progress.
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
It's so important that other countries
have the opportunities
to have their citizens take advantage of innovation
and also be the innovators.
For the 2025 Global Innovation Scorecard,
we asked which countries have the political, economic,
and demographic realities that catalyze innovators
to invent the future?
That means not just evaluating the investment
in cutting-edge sectors or red tape for startups,
but recognizing that countries that ensure freedom
of speech, create opportunities for workshop diversity
and respect people's fundamental freedoms.
And by celebrating the best of the best,
our innovation champions, we encourage other countries
to follow their lead.
Let's learn more.
<v Narrator>Since 2019, the Consumer Technology Association</v>
has produced the Global Innovation Scorecard,
leading the world in ranking countries
on their commitment to fostering
an ecosystem driving innovation.
Innovation typically means a new method, idea, or product.
But what makes an innovation champion?
It's when technology and policy come together
to fuel transformation for a country and its people.
This new class of global innovation champions reflect
the art of what's possible and are finding new ways
to solve the world's biggest challenges.
Congratulations to this year's innovation champions.
We can't wait to see what you do next.
<v Announcer>Please welcome our 2025</v>
Global Innovation Scorecard award winners.
Estonia's Minister of Economy and Industry, Erkki Keldo.
Finland's Ambassador to the United States,
Leena-Kaisa Mikkola.
Germany's Minister for Digital and Transport,
Volker Wissing.
The Netherlands Minister of Economic Affairs,
Dirk Beljaarts.
Sweden's Deputy Prime Minister,
Minister for Energy, Business and Industry, Ebba Busch.
Switzerland's Ambassador to the United States, Ralf Heckner.
<v ->Oh, we go for our group picture.</v>
We're gonna do a group photo.
Okay.
<v ->I think we...</v>
<v ->There you go.</v>
<v ->There you go. Very good.</v>
<v ->I think you switch.</v>
You guys.
<v ->There we go.</v>
<v ->Thank you.</v>
<v ->We're nailing it now.</v>
<v ->Okay, thank you all.</v>
<v ->Thank you all. Thank you.</v>
Thank you. You guys can go off stage this way.
All right.
Congratulations again
to our 2025 Global Innovation Champions.
Gary, as you know,
we are wrapping up an exciting year for CTA.
It's our 100th anniversary. Yes.
<v ->Woohoo
<v ->It's a huge milestone and it's an incredible reflection</v>
on how far we've come since we started out
as the Radio Manufacturers Association.
<v ->That's funny. You know, I don't feel 100.</v>
<v ->You don't even look 100.</v>
You don't look a day over 99. (laughs)
But we rehearsed it and he liked it.
But more seriously, this year we've had a chance
to celebrate a century of staying ahead of the curve,
a century of working to advance technology
and the innovation that fuels it.
<v ->Certainly.</v>
I mean, we've grown as an association and along
with the tech industry,
but our industry has certainly never, ever been stronger.
Today, we reflect the energy,
the momentum and the impact of a sector that's shaping
the world now and the future that our children
and our grandchildren will inherit.
And one of the best parts of our career is handing
this over to you.
<v ->It is one of the best parts of our job.</v>
And we love building on all the incredible success
we've had in the past while looking ahead
to the next 100 years.
And with that in mind,
we refreshed the CTA brand last fall
with one shared identity for the first time in our history.
And this isn't just about a new logo,
though we think ours is pretty great.
It's about visually representing the connection
between technology and humanity,
a bond that we've championed for the last century.
And as part of our evolution,
we also launched a refresh to CES.tech this year after
a lot of feedback from many of you.
Thank you so much.
And I hope that you've all found it to be
a very helpful resource in the lead up to CES 2025.
And speaking of helpful resources,
do not forget to download the CES 2025 app.
It is new and improved and more helpful than ever.
And coming soon is a new CTA.tech,
another step to make it easier for the industry
to connect, collaborate, and innovate.
<v ->Great.</v>
I love these changes we're making.
It gives us the look that reflects what we're doing.
But as we look ahead,
I am excited to share two big announcements
that are investments by the Association,
the Consumer Technology Association,
that reflect the future of technology.
And to help us do that,
I'd like to invite two members of CTA's executive board
to join us on stage.
Everyone, please join me in welcoming Austere founder
and CEO and immediate past chair
of CTA's executive board, Deena Ghazarian,
and former executive on IBM, Verizon Business,
and Kratos Defense, and Quantum Crunch founder and CEO
and CTA executive board member, Debbie Taylor Moore.
Get out here.
<v ->Good to see you.</v>
<v ->Good luck.</v>
<v ->Here you go.</v>
<v ->Break a leg.</v>
Wait, Kinzie, come back here. We're doing a photo.
<v ->Are you ready?</v>
<v ->Oh.</v>
<v ->Hi, everybody.</v>
<v ->We have to say hello.</v>
<v ->Oh, we have to take a picture?</v>
<v ->Yeah, we have to take a picture.</v>
Okay, well now-
<v ->All right.</v>
<v ->Hi, everybody.</v>
I am so excited to join Gary and Kinsey
to share some very big news for CTA.
When I founded my company Austere,
I had the advantage of decades of connections
in the consumer technology space.
But it's a tougher road for many entrepreneurs trying
to break into the industry to gain access
to capital, especially for women and black
and brown founders.
Only 2% of venture capital goes to marginalized founders.
That's why I have been such a fierce advocate
for CTA's work through the Innovation for All Fund
spearheaded at CTA by Tiffany Moore.
Since its announcement in CES 2019,
the fund has provided $10 million
to 10 venture capital firms that support women,
people of color, veterans,
and other underrepresented entrepreneurs.
Today, I am thrilled to share that based on our success
and demonstrated impact, CTA will invest
an additional $5 million into this incredible effort.
This investment will help to support and catalyze
the next generation of world changing entrepreneurs.
Thank you to everyone who supported this work,
especially my colleagues
on the Innovation for All Committee, chairwoman Mara Lewis
and committee member Denise Gibson,
who proposed the original idea for the fund.
And most importantly, John Shalam,
who's the chairman of the investment committee,
who made their dream come to life.
For our next announcement,
I'll turn it over to my fellow board member
and friend, Debbie Taylor Moore.
<v ->Thanks, Deena.</v>
And thank you so much for all of your work
over the past year.
It's been outstanding.
<v ->Thank you, Debbie.</v>
<v ->So I've worked in the cybersecurity field for more</v>
than two decades, and one of the biggest sea changes
I've ever seen in our industry is the emergence
and the development of quantum technology.
I'll put it this way for the Taylor Swift fans
who are, there you go, who are familiar with her Eras tour.
She has had an era, I think we would agree.
If the 2020s are the AI era,
then the 2030s will most certainly be the quantum era.
Broader use of quantum technology is going
to completely transform my field, cybersecurity,
as well as enterprises in healthcare, telecom,
in material sciences.
It's gonna change the way
we optimize supply chain management.
And that's why I was thrilled to work
with the incredible CTA staff to broker
a major investment in Quantum World Congress.
Quantum World Congress is a first
of its kind global quantum conference that's located
in Washington, D.C.
that convenes the entire quantum ecosystem.
This investment expands CTA's reach into emerging areas
of critical technology.
So congratulations to CTA
and to the Quantum World Congress team.
And I just want to say it's gonna be a wild year.
Have a happy new year and just a fabulous CES.
<v ->Good job, Debbie.</v>
<v ->Thank you, Deena and Debbie, two of my favorite ladies.</v>
At CES 2025, we have also been working
with the Quantum World Congress over the last year
to produce a new quantum focused conference track,
one of several new CES conference tracks this year.
So let's talk about what else is new at CES 2025.
This year we are thrilled to have South Hall back online
and buzzing for the first time since 2020,
showcasing classic CES products and accessories.
And digital health has a new home at the Venetian,
uniting health, lifestyle, fitness, and smart home,
all those categories together
to reflect our connected living experience.
And the CES keynotes will span the Las Vegas strip.
Nvidia's Jensen Huang delivered
an amazing sold out keynote at Mandalay Bay last night.
And we will see Delta's Ed Bastian
at the Sphere tonight.
And if you're planning to join us at Sphere,
don't forget that you will need a separate ticket
to experience Delta's keynote.
I'm pretty sure there's information
on the screen behind me,
but tickets are limited and can be picked up
on a first serve, first come basis.
And they are located at the Aria,
the Venetian Expo, North, South,
and West Halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center.
They're everywhere.
So make sure you find one and pick them up before
the event tonight.
One other new addition that I am especially excited
for is the new CES Creator Space presented by Sony
and the Central Hall's Grand Lobby.
This space is an exclusive area for our storytellers,
the amazing media and content creators who cover
the show, helping them develop content
and make connections with exhibitors and each other.
This area will also feature three days of exciting
on stage programming sponsored by Sony and Pinterest.
And with so much to see and do,
we are ready to dive in to new tech, new partnerships,
and new ideas.
Ready to dive in to...
To all of these new tech and new partnerships and new ideas.
Where's Gary? Gary, are you coming?
Oh, my gosh.
Gary, I said dive in, like the campaign, not ride in.
<v ->I think I need one</v>
of those new hearing aids your father-in-law got.
<v ->What are you doing?</v>
<v ->Well, what I'm doing is I think I've also learned</v>
that I can't ride circles around you.
<v ->(laughs) Well, you are truly the master of pivots, Gary,</v>
so take it away.
<v ->Thank you.</v>
Everybody, the amazing Kinsey Fabrizio!
You know, in Pivot or Die,
I talk about the need for reinvention and transformation.
But even as we embrace new things,
some technologies and companies thrive long term.
Like the bicycle, invented before any of us were born.
It's been reinvented over the years to become
the e-bike, like the bike I just rode in on from Panasonic.
Or like Panasonic itself,
a company that's reinvented and transformed itself
to stay practical, relevant, and vital.
More than 100 years later, Panasonic
is still transforming, not only as a country
and as a group of employees,
but they're transforming entire industries,
societies, and lifestyles.
That kind of agility is what I hope all
the companies, entrepreneurs,
and innovators can embrace here at CES 2025.
Because CES isn't just an event,
it's where the future is made.
So welcome to CES 2025.
This morning,
it's my honor and pleasure to introduce our opening keynote.
Panasonic is a mainstay of CES,
one of just a handful of companies
that have exhibited every year since the first CES
in 1967 was held in New York City.
And we share some common ground.
Both Panasonic and CTA thrive today because we've pivoted
to be leaders in innovation and embrace
and drive forward trends in technology and society.
Panasonic's ability to evolve
and embrace new things fuels
its extraordinary longevity and relevance.
Panasonic also succeeds
because its leaders know something important.
You have to stick
to your principles and know when not to pivot.
Over a century ago,
Panasonic's founder Kōnosuke Matsushita declared
the company's mission to overcome poverty
and enrich society.
He wasn't just talking about profits.
He was talking about the roles that business leaders
and technology could and must play
in making society better and our lives healthier
and more fulfilling.
That's a legacy that Panasonic's CEO Yuki Kusumi embraces.
It drives his approach to pioneering new markets
in our data driven AI powered future
and Panasonic's leadership in more sustainable technology.
To share their next chapter and a vision
for the technology that propels us forward
and makes us well into the future, please welcome Panasonic.
<v ->Panasonic story began over a decade ago</v>
with this double socket.
This is the spark that ignited decades of innovation
and passion, comfort and connection to every corner
of the globe.
Panasonic grew to take bigger challenges
of the modern world,
leading the transformation to sustainable technologies
and solutions and factories,
supply chains in the air and on the road.
Born in this tiny innovation,
Panasonic continues its core mission to inspire
a healthy society that enriches the lives
of people around the world.
Now, these efforts blossom across new landscapes seeded
by artificial intelligence.
Panasonic has always thrived at the intersection
of yesterday and tomorrow, of human with the technological.
The fabric of connection and intersection
makes Panasonic code system one of the most fertile
in the world of technology and innovation.
Today, you'll meet game changers and startups,
innovating leaders and visionaries like Anthropic, AARP,
Redwood Materials and more.
Panasonic is over 100 years along on a 250 year plan,
and as we engineer and reveal our next phase,
Panasonic is a great company.
As you'll see, you might look at this double socket
and say, simple!
It's a no brainer.
But after a century,
it remains the foundation
of a company whose original mission remains true,
unbroken by time, forging connections
in a universe of disruption.
And that Panasonic commitment continues well
into the future.
CES 2025 begins here and now!
Please welcome CEO of Panasonic Holding Group,
Mr. Yuki Kasumi.
<v ->Hi, Gary.</v>
Good morning.
Thank you all for joining me here today.
I'd like to thank Gary for the kind introduction
and for the entering in style on the Panasonic e-bike.
And of course, my friend, Anthony Mackie,
who seems to have covered 100 years
of Panasonic history in about 90 seconds.
<v ->It's an honor to share the stage with you, Mr. Kasumi.</v>
<v ->You as well, Mr. Mackie.</v>
Or should I say, Captain America?
<v ->Nah, come on, Kasumi-san. You call me Anthony.</v>
<v ->Thank you, Anthony. And please call me Yuki.</v>
<v ->You got it.</v>
As anyone who comes...
As anyone who comes to CES year after year can tell you,
technology moves ahead at an amazing pace.
So it's important that we be intentional in our work.
We all know that our current systems and practices
are not sustainable, not for the planet,
and not for the mental and physical health of its people.
The communities where we all work and live are dealing
with climate change in different ways.
This is certainly true in my hometown of Osaka,
where my family lives.
And where my first grandchild was born,
just three months ago.
Professionally and personally, I want to do everything
I can to make sure that my children and grandchildren,
and yours, and future generations enjoy
a healthy environment.
We must balance our drive to deliver innovation
and create abundance with the need to do so sustainably.
In today's reality, everything is connected.
<v ->This morning, you learned the latest ways</v>
that sustainable technology solutions from Panasonic
are driving the process
in large-scale renewable energy solutions,
EV batteries technology,
and a sustainable home technologies.
You'll also hear some exciting news
about a fundamental shift in Panasonic's business model.
It centers on AI-led software and services,
taking related investments and partnerships
to a whole new level.
As part of this,
you'll hear about new solutions to support the well-being
of families and societies around the world.
The value of Panasonic brings this market
to its highest point, and it's even getting bigger.
<v ->We are fortunate that in every step of the journey,</v>
we have fantastic partners working side
by side with Panasonic.
In fact, a few of them will be joining us on stage today.
<v ->The timing of these announcements couldn't be better.</v>
It's a critical future for Panasonic
and everyone here today.
The World Economy Forum estimates that manufacturing
and production account for one-fifth
of global CO2 emissions.
Now, if Panasonic and its partners committed
to net-zero operations globally,
that would make a huge difference to the planet.
Panasonic's renewable energy journey is well underway,
as you're about to see.
So Yuki, tell us about how this journey is going.
<v ->Yes.</v>
Currently, 44 of our manufacturing sites worldwide
have achieved net-zero status.
Thank you.
We are most excited about our fuel cell factory
in Japan, which is the world's first factory
to be fully powered by a combination of hydrogen,
solar panels, and battery storage units.
This renewable energy solution is called Panasonic HX.
Panasonic HX generates only the amount of power needed
and uses our original energy management system
to balance supply and demand in response to changes
in electricity and weather.
We have also expanded Panasonic HX
to our manufacturing UK operation in Cardiff.
And we will bring the solution
to our Panasonic office building in Munich in spring
of this year.
We are extremely motivated to bring these solutions
to life in our own operations.
But what is more encouraging
is that commercial enterprises and governments around
the world are stepping up and want
to make these changes too.
We are currently working with forward-thinking planners
at the Greater Manchester Combined Authority in the UK
to explore implementing our solution, Panasonic HX,
for net-zero energy at select public and government sites.
It's the world's first agreement of this nature.
Imagine the positive impact
as these solutions become widely adopted.
This is an opportunity to truly make a difference at scale.
Now, let's switch gears
and talk about a different kind of power.
I have asked Anthony to share more about the story.
<v ->Thank you, Yuki. I appreciate it.</v>
This is really exciting news.
In the EV battery market, Panasonic is a quiet giant,
some would say, supplying 15 billion batteries
with superior performance.
Now, that's enough batteries to power more
than 3 million electric vehicles worldwide and counting.
In fact, Panasonic is the largest manufacturer
of EV batteries in North America.
They've been investing in battery technology for decades.
Their latest 2170 battery set a new benchmark
for performance and capacity.
Furthermore, the cutting edge 4680 in line
for production has a capacity
that is five times greater than the 2170 cell.
And Panasonic continues to advance the state of the art
in partnership with leading global automakers Subaru
and Mazda, as well as U.S. EV company Lucid
and other prestigious brands.
The capacity and quality of their batteries
has kept Panasonic at the leading edge
of EV battery technology.
Take a look.
<v ->Whether it's</v>
the wide open highway or a run
to the market, zero emissions driving
has never been more innovative, efficient and exciting.
Panasonic is accelerating the EV revolution.
Our batteries power millions of cars that are easier
on the planet, but built for muscle and speed.
From the Gigafactory in Nevada to our new plant
in Kansas, Panasonic has set a new benchmark
for the industry with our 2170 platform.
Panasonic is now the largest provider of EV batteries
in North America, powering some
of the world's leading auto brands.
And we are ready to begin production
on our next generation 4680 platform,
producing higher capacity, five times that of the 2170,
at a lower cost, mile after mile.
As ever, Panasonic is leading with sustainability
at the core.
Our factories employ a circular economy model with among
the highest levels of recycling solutions in the industry.
The EV battery market is just shifting into high gear,
and Panasonic is driving it forward well into the future.
<v ->Come on.</v>
Yuki, I didn't realize how massive Panasonic
is supporting the adoption of electric vehicles.
Obviously, the battery is a huge part of making that happen.
Now, I'm hearing more and more
about this circular economy model for recycling
and battery production.
<v ->Yes, bringing battery manufacturing into harmony</v>
with our need to protect the environment
is a complicated challenge, but it is absolutely essential.
And we are fortunate to have the best partner
on the planet to help us make it happen.
<v ->Indeed you do.</v>
Please welcome Redwood Materials CEO, J.B. Strauble.
<v ->Hi, J.B.</v>
Thank you very much for joining on stage today.
And what the audience probably knows,
you are a co-founder and longtime CTO of Tesla.
I bet they would love to hear about
what led you to start Redwood Materials.
<v ->Thank you very much, Mr. Kasumi.</v>
I'd be happy to share a little bit
of the Redwood origin story and some of the work
we're doing together with Panasonic.
I'm an engineer at heart,
and my passion for energy and sustainability
is what drives me and what drives most of the things
we're focused on at Redwood.
And while people often associate me
with electric vehicles and cars, for me,
it's always been more about the battery
and energy technology.
And proving that the battery technology is now scalable
and a sustainable energy solution is core to my belief.
Today, this same mission drives us
at Redwood Materials, where we're tackling challenges
within the ecosystem to enable
a fully responsible transition to electrification.
It's a monumental shift for the industry
that will unfold over decades,
but I am convinced it's inevitable.
And Redwood, with Panasonic's partnership,
is here to make this as sustainable as possible
at every step along the way.
My personal journey with Panasonic began
when we were building the first Gigafactory
in Nevada together about a decade ago.
I recognized both a challenge and an opportunity
to reuse the batteries we were producing and repurpose
the resulting production scrap material,
moving toward a circular ecosystem
for those battery materials.
Today, the Panasonic
and Redwood partnership extends well beyond recycling,
and we're taking old batteries and critical materials
and turning them into functional battery components
that Panasonic can use to manufacture new cells
in the United States.
Material from the Panasonic Gigafactory in Nevada arrives
at Redwood multiple times every single day,
just a few miles down the road.
We're recycling that material and recovering greater
than 98% of the critical materials like cobalt, lithium,
nickel, and copper,
and then rebuilding new cathode active materials right here
in the U.S.
that will be returned to Panasonic's value chain
into manufacturing new batteries.
This will be the first time
that this has happened anywhere in the world
with this level of recycled content.
Cathode has never been produced with this type
of closed-loop ecosystem so close to the factory,
and Panasonic will be the first to put it back
into new batteries at this incredible scale.
Panasonic is an amazing leader when it comes
to technology and their commitment to sustainability both
in the U.S. and globally, and Panasonic
has made tremendous commitments towards circular economy
practices both in the Nevada Gigafactory and now
in their new factory in Kansas.
I believe they're a model for the entire industry,
and we need more players to invest in this sustainable
and sensible approach.
I want to thank Panasonic for this opportunity
to share our work together with you at CES,
and my thanks again to you, Mr. Kasumi.
<v ->Thank you so much, J.B.,</v>
and look forward to doing more great work together
in the coming years.
<v ->Likewise.</v>
<v ->We've seen how sustainable technology is advancing</v>
in the world of commercial facilities and EVs.
Now, let's take a look at how Panasonic
is bringing sustainability home.
Sustainable home design brings together two broad areas
of focus for Panasonic: renewable energy technology
and the well-being of society.
A core element in sustainable home design
is efficient HVAC,
and Panasonic is revolutionizing this space.
Air quality isn't only about the outside air.
The inside air has to be improved and is just as important.
<v ->And our engineers have done something</v>
that just makes sense.
We have identified three Panasonic systems
that heat, cool, and power homes.
And we are bringing them together in a unified solution
that is not only more energy efficient and economical,
but healthier and more comfortable as well.
Today, we are announcing Oasys, and here is why it matters.
<v Narrator>When I come home and the house is clean</v>
and I can breathe fresh air, it makes my heart full.
<v Narrator>Being able to be energy efficient</v>
is really important
and meaningful for us as we start a family.
<v Narrator>Our home, to me,</v>
is a place for us to come together.
<v Narrator>It really says, family,</v>
when you have three generations under one roof.
<v ->I love fresh air blowing through our home,</v>
but then during the springtime, I get seasonal allergies.
So that's where air filtration,
air quality is super important to us.
<v ->As I think about the next phase and having kids,</v>
one of the most important things is modeling our values
and our behavior.
<v ->Wouldn't it be amazing to actually be able to see</v>
how we're using energy,
or if there was ways to inform and teach us
to be more energy efficient?
<v ->Sustainability starts with awareness and knowledge.</v>
<v ->It is very important that our home is a healthy place.</v>
My son, Logan, has asthma.
It's important that our kids are able to breathe
the clean air so they don't get sick.
We vacuum often. We change our air filter religiously.
When we open the windows, try to get fresh air,
pollen comes in, then we have sneezing
and coughing happening.
<v ->It would be nice to have a better filtration system</v>
that could really clean the air.
<v ->There's seven of us in the house, eight with my dad.</v>
So managing the temperature in here, it's interesting.
<v ->He's always warm and I'm always cold,</v>
so when I'm working I have my electric blanket on.
<v ->During the summertime when we are running our AC,</v>
our electricity bill is ridiculous, yet
we're still hot, still uncomfortable.
We need a better unit, better circulation.
<v ->The world I hope my kids and their kids will grow up</v>
in is hopefully that each home is more sustainable.
<v ->I want the world to be a healthy place for them</v>
to live in.
I don't want them to have to struggle with the air quality.
<v ->In starting our own family,</v>
we're definitely thinking of what is the world
that these future generations are going to inherit
and how have we contributed to either
that more beautiful future or not beautiful future.
<v ->Oasys offers us a look at the future of home comfort</v>
and indoor air quality with wellness, comfort,
energy efficiency, and resiliency all under one roof.
And in a few short weeks,
we'll actually be opening our first Oasys concept home here
in the U.S.
So stay tuned, that's pretty good.
From factories to homes,
from cars we drive to the air we breathe,
Panasonic is the leading edge
of sustainability effects around the world.
<v ->A few years ago at CES 2022,</v>
Panasonic established a major initiative,
Panasonic Green Impact, that sets some aggressive goals
for carbon reduction.
We are working hard
to realize net zero CO2 emissions across all
of our operations, including
all factories worldwide by 2030.
<v ->Now, however, Panasonic Green Impact aims higher.</v>
Panasonic aims to reduce total emissions by more
than 300 million tons by 2050.
That's equivalent to approximately 1%
of current global CO2 emissions.
So that's 1% being done by Panasonic alone.
Now imagine if 99 other
industry leading companies joined us.
That's 1% times 100. Yeah, yeah, I saw you.
You just did the math. I saw you.
That was fast. (laughs)
The first 100 million tons
of this commitment involves direct emissions
from Panasonic's entire supply chain,
including energy consumed
by Panasonic products already purchased.
The remainder will need to be achieved
through avoided emissions.
Now this term describes emissions that are prevented
by using a sustainable product or technology in place
of a more carbon intensive option.
<v ->By working toward avoided emissions,</v>
we can extend our impact far
beyond the Panasonic supply chain
to our partners, customers, and society at large.
I've invited a colleague and visionary thinker
on this topic to share a few insights
about how our industry can work together globally
with a focus on avoided emissions as an important path
to a carbon neutral society.
Peter Bakker is President and CEO
of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.
He was recently named one of the top 100 climate leaders
in business by Time Magazine and was a recipient
of the Clinton Global Citizen Award.
Please join me in welcoming him.
Hi, Peter-san, thank you very much for being here today.
<v ->Thank you.</v>
Well, thank you, Kusumi-san, for this kind introduction.
Panasonic has committed itself
to contributing to sustainable development
and the advancement of society.
Let me begin by expressing my gratitude to Panasonic
and to all of you here in the audience today.
Panasonic's dedication to sustainability
and innovation inspires global process
and aligns perfectly with WBCSD's mission to accelerate
the transition to a net-zero,
nature-positive and more equitable future.
We all know here that we're running out of time
to prevent the most devastating impacts of climate change.
Without bold action, global temperatures could rise
by 2.4 to 2.7 degrees Celsius this century,
far exceeding the critical threshold
and safe operating space for humanity.
But in this era of rapid innovation
and growing consumer awareness,
sustainability is not just
a moral imperative to curb this warming.
It is now also a competitive one.
Businesses that fail
to embrace sustainable practices risk falling behind
in an evolving marketplace
where consumers, investors, governments and partners
are increasingly demanding transparency and accountability.
That's why over 20 years ago,
WBCSD in partnership
with the World Resources Institute developed
the greenhouse gas protocol,
the global standard for measuring and managing emissions.
Today, the greenhouse gas protocol is used by 97%
of all global companies and is an essential tool
to measure and manage their direct and indirect emissions.
Kusumi-san just spoke about the importance
of avoided emissions, a powerful new metric to measure
the emission reduction potential of low-carbon solutions
and products, of which so many are being launched
this week at CES.
Avoided emissions accounting will make it possible
to compare the potential emission reductions
of innovations in low-carbon solutions,
allowing financial institutions to improve the allocation
of capital on the basis of this impact potential.
Panasonic's leadership in this space is pivotal.
Together, WBCSD and Panasonic are advancing
the standardization of avoided emissions accounting
to ensure they eliminate the risk of greenwashing
and are being recognized by governments,
financial institutions and society at large.
This work is not just about measurement.
It's about innovation
and disclosure, empowering customers,
industries and investors
to accelerate decarbonization and innovation.
Collaboration is the key to success.
We all need to work together
to fully integrate sustainability
into our innovation agenda and actions
so that we can make it
the foundation of economic growth and resilience.
Panasonic's commitment to sustainability and its vision
for an ideal society with affluence both in matter
and in mind can serve as a guiding example for all of us.
The time to act is now, and the world is watching.
Let's ensure that the incredible innovations demonstrated
here this week contribute to a thriving,
sustainable future for generations to come.
Thank you.
<v ->Thank you so much,</v>
Peter-san.
It's a great honor for Panasonic to be a part
of your important work.
<v ->Thank you.</v>
<v ->We couldn't do it without you.</v>
<v ->Thank you.</v>
<v ->Thanks, Anthony.</v>
<v ->Our commitment to sustainability will never end</v>
because we all have a responsibility to our future together.
<v ->This future is already here today.</v>
This is the time of enormous challenge and transformation.
Wait for it. Now is the time to eat some candy or something.
Talk amongst yourselves.
<v ->From here?</v>
<v ->Hey, here we go. Hey. (laughs)</v>
<v ->Our commitment to sustainability will never end</v>
because we all have a responsibility to our future together.
<v ->The future is already here today.</v>
This is the time of enormous challenge
and transformation, but also a time of hope.
<v ->Our customers</v>
are now more varied, more globally diverse,
and yet more connected to each other,
and the world around them.
Today, I want to talk to you about our journey forward.
<v ->Building on Panasonic's history.</v>
Building into a new future. You ready?
Because here we go.
<v ->Over a century ago,</v>
our founder Kōnosuke Matsushita shared a remarkable vision.
A 250-year journey divided
into 10 periods of innovation and progress.
Each 25-year period would build on prior successes
and adapt to society's needs and dreams.
His mission was simple, yet ambitious.
To use technology to make a meaningful difference
in people's lives.
For more than 100 years,
Panasonic has been there:
in your homes, your businesses, your daily moments.
From the first radio sets to sustainable energy,
we've grown alongside you,
driven by our intent to build a better world.
And now our world is changing.
In the fifth period of our vision,
we intend to rise and meet that change.
This is the spirit of Panasonic Go.
We're accelerating into an era where AI
and data platforms will create new ecosystems
that amplify human potential.
We're building a new portfolio of tools to improve
the lives of the consumers, enterprises,
partners and shareholders that make up Panasonic,
all while contributing to a more sustainable world.
Panasonic products and services already make a difference
in the lives of over a billion people every day.
This is how we intend to expand our reach
to the next billion.
This is Panasonic Go.
<v ->Panasonic Go is a growth initiative</v>
that is driving the transformation of our business,
and creating new experiences
for global customers and partners.
We are providing our global enterprise with AI tools
and processes to serve our customers
in fundamentally different ways.
We are not starting from scratch.
We have already invested more than $10 billion
in North America, including Blue Yonder
and Panasonic UL, which you will hear more about today.
Together, these investments are creating
an AI orchestration and service platform
that will create new possibilities
to serve our next billion customers.
<v ->Moving from pressing a button to powering a business,</v>
from a microwave competing on wattage
to an AI-powered sustainable home
that uses almost no watts at all.
From a refrigerator that keeps your food cold
to a food that's just what you want when you want it.
From just touching a screen to powering the touch points
of every business.
And from a brand that you've known to a brand
that you need to know.
<v ->Today...</v>
Today, we're announcing a new commitment as part
of our company-wide transformation initiative for Panasonic.
By 2035, 30% of our business, our revenue,
will be generated through software and AI-enabled solutions.
Thank you.
And this transformation will change
everything you know about Panasonic.
This is Panasonic Go.
<v ->Okay, so let's dig into it.</v>
Hit us with the details, Yuki.
Now we'll start with Panasonic's subsidiary, Blue Yonder.
<v ->They are reinventing the global supply chain using</v>
advanced data analytics and AI.
To tell you more,
I'm delighted to welcome Blue Yonder's
Chief Strategy Officer, Wayne Usie.
Hi Wayne, thank you very much for being here.
<v ->Thank you, Kasumi-san and the entire Panasonic team.</v>
It's exciting to be here at CES.
Modern supply chains are extremely complex.
They're global, they're interconnected,
but they're also burdened with outdated technology
and operational silos.
Companies need to manage operations across
the globe, collaborate on disparate systems internally
and with partners.
And they need to do all of this seamlessly and effectively.
Now, all of us know that AI is changing how we work
and do business today.
Whether you're in retail, manufacturing, technology,
or logistics service providers,
every industry will benefit
from these massive changes brought on by the use of AI
in the supply chain.
This is where we come in.
Blue Yonder empowers businesses
to navigate modern supply chain complexity
with the most advanced and innovative technology.
We're combining predictive and generative AI to unlock
the value in data to build autonomous supply chains.
So how does this translate into tangible benefits?
Here are five key ways that we see AI will impact
the supply chain.
First, multi-enterprise ecosystems.
Blue Yonder's AI-driven solution provides
an end-to-end visibility across
a company's entire supply chain,
including its suppliers and its trading partners.
With predictive insights, supply chain professionals can
understand relevant information.
They can assess scenarios and make informed decisions.
Second, personalization.
We're building autonomous AI agents
for various supply chain roles.
These multimodal conversational assistants will synthesize
data, generate content, solve repetitive tasks,
perform root cause analysis, recommend solutions,
and even execute decisions.
Third, inventory management.
Using our AI, businesses can analyze buying trends,
inflation news, production projections,
and inventory data to far cast better the balance
of demand and supply.
This helps them avoid overproduction of goods
and rejection of waste and carbon emissions right
at the beginning.
Fourth, on-time delivery.
Our AI-powered solutions help organizations facilitate
faster shipments while avoiding unnecessary miles.
And lastly, capital savings.
As a result of all the improved efficiency,
companies see an influx of capital savings,
which means an opportunity
to invest more in innovation and growth.
One of our global customers, Sainsbury,
has implemented Blue Yonder's AI capabilities
to transform operations across more
than 600 supermarkets and 800 convenience stores
to save time, save money, and future-proof the enterprise.
Let's take a look.
<v ->There are probably three good examples</v>
where Sainsbury's are using AI and or machine learning.
The first one being our supply chain transformation program
with Blue Yonder, where we're using those platforms
to enable us to develop a better store order,
but also in our P&amp;L going forward
for a more sustainable supply chain.
We're also using AI in a very different way
in our store environment.
We're using it to detect theft.
We're using it through cameras,
through an AI model that helps us monitor the behavior,
the way that our customers shop with us,
and therefore able to predict
where potential theft might be taking place.
The third place we're using AI is in our forecast
and predictive modeling
of where we think customers
might shop food products with us.
So in our marketing space,
we've been using it to understand customer behavior
to help us think about marketing
with those customers going forward.
<v ->So long before it became a buzzword it is today,</v>
Blue Yonder has been offering AI-driven solutions
for more than two decades,
but it's not about the most advanced technology.
It's also about one of the largest supply chain team
of data scientists in the industry.
And with over 400 patents
and 20 billion predictions per day
on the Blue Yonder platform,
we are delivering future-proof solutions today.
As Kusumi-san said, Panasonic is not new to AI,
but with Panasonic Go,
you can expect to see a lot more AI-driven innovation
as we continue to create smarter, safer,
and more sustainable solutions for the global supply chain.
Thank you.
<v ->Thanks so much, Wayne.</v>
Great job.
One of the most exciting things about Panasonic Go
is the expansion of products and services we will bring
to millions of modern households around the globe.
We have a new catalyst for well-being innovation,
Panasonic Well, and a new service we are introducing today.
Here to tell you more,
please welcome the Executive Officer of Panasonic Group
and Panasonic Well CEO, Yoky Matsuoka.
Hi Yoky, it's great to see you here,
and now it's your turn to share some news.
<v ->Sounds great. Let's do this.</v>
We have some amazing announcements to share with you today.
At Panasonic Well, we're focused
on helping people lead healthier, happier lives.
In addition to my role at Panasonic, I'm also a wife,
a mother of four, and the only child
that's caring for my aging parents in Japan.
And as an expert multitasker,
I'm also a proud caregiver of two dogs,
a chatty cockatiel, and a 200-pound pet pig.
It's a beautifully chaotic household,
probably just like yours.
And this chaos motivates me to create solutions
to help families every day.
I'm sure you can relate in some way
because modern families need help.
In fact, the US Surgeon General recently issued
an advisory on the well-being of parents,
sharing that nearly half of the parents
are reporting feeling overwhelmed with stress,
and roughly 65% of parents are feeling lonely.
When parenting has an advisory label like a pack
of cigarettes, we know we're in a crisis
that demands our attention.
To understand firsthand what modern families
are facing today, we went into homes and lives
of real families.
I want to show you what we found.
<v ->The days feel so long sometimes.</v>
Going to mama's...
<v ->The idea of consistency in life right now</v>
is out the window.
I guess, you know,
as we're kind of coming to a close on this meeting...
<v Narrator>There's very little downtime.</v>
<v ->Have a good day.</v>
<v ->Bye.</v>
<v Narrator>It's just managing.</v>
It's hard to schedule just life.
<v Narrator>How do people do this?</v>
Like, I can't do this. I feel so alone.
<v ->Whenever, you know,</v>
it's a rough day or feeling kind of mentally unwell,
it's so amazing to be able to just be outside in my element.
I got a promotion.
<v ->My life is the highest highs and the lowest lows.</v>
When I achieve something,
it's a win and I immediately feel calm.
But if not, things start to shake a little bit.
But the lowest are low.
<v Narrator>Life has ups and downs.</v>
Everything will work itself out. I believe that.
You want as much time with it as you can have.
<v ->There's a monster.</v>
Good night.
<v ->Good night.</v>
<v ->Man, we're done.</v>
<v Narrator>I don't think we figured it out yet.</v>
We haven't cracked the code.
<v ->Every family's looking for the same thing.</v>
More highs and less lows.
And when I say families,
it could be any of the people you cherish,
from your nuclear families to your neighborhood families
to anything in between.
And these families everywhere are weathering
the same storm of struggles.
This may paint a cloudy picture,
yet it also highlights what we can do
to achieve wellness together.
Science shows that physical activity is good
for your heart and is a natural mood booster.
Sharing meals lowers depression rates,
and that's just a start.
I haven't even touched on the wellness benefits
of sleep, the power of play, self-care,
or reducing screen time.
These activities not only support your personal wellness,
but when you share it with loved ones,
they enhance positive outcomes
and foster deeper connections.
This is why we created Umi,
an AI-powered family wellness coach
that helps families care, coordinate,
and connect with each other.
Meet Umi.
For my family, Umi will be a game changer.
Creating wellness goals that we can achieve
and getting help in a fun,
easy and creative way will empower us
to achieve those positive outcomes.
Our current goals are to stay active and eat together.
But you know what?
This holiday break with four teenagers at home,
things have been a little bit on the tough side.
So let me show you how this can work for us.
Hey, Umi.
<v Umi>Hello, Yoky.</v>
Wow. Your schedule today seems intense.
How are you feeling?
<v ->I'm actually feeling pretty good.</v>
I'm at CES in Las Vegas.
<v Umi>Yeah, I saw that.</v>
Are you able to take a break right now
or a few deep breaths to relax?
<v ->Not exactly right now.</v>
Actually, I was checking in on my family.
Do you have any updates for me?
<v Umi>I'm seeing it's been hard</v>
to coordinate active time together without you in town.
Can I share a few ideas?
<v ->I'm a little bit busy right now.</v>
So can you just schedule something for me
when I get home this weekend?
<v Umi>Of course.</v>
Let's do one of your favorites from AllTrails,
a family walk at Windy Hill,
and then everyone can make tacos together.
<v ->Sure, that sounds perfect.</v>
<v Umi>Great.</v>
I put it on everyone's calendar for this Saturday at 3 p.m.
<v ->I can't wait to do that.</v>
So Umi, do you also have an update from my dad?
<v Umi>Yes.</v>
Your dad has already gone to bed. It's pretty late in Japan.
He had a good day today, and he's eating well.
He told me he liked
the New Year's food delivery you arranged.
<v ->Oh, that's great.</v>
I'm trying to keep him motivated to eat more protein
in addition to his regular meals.
<v Umi>Well, he told me yesterday he loves to eat</v>
while you're chatting with him.
Would you like me to set up a few more mealtime calls
with him later this week?
<v ->That would be smart.</v>
Thank you. Thank you so much, Umi.
<v Umi>Happy to help. Have fun at CES.</v>
<v ->Thank you, Umi.</v>
<v ->Whether you're a working parent caring for a loved one</v>
or realizing halfway through a Zoom call
that you're still wearing costume makeup from set earlier
in the day, wellness often takes a backseat.
This balancing act to fit in wellness in daily life
is extra challenging for families like yours, Yoky.
This is called the sandwich generation, right?
Yoky sandwich. (laughs)
People raising kids while caring for aging parents
who are stuck in a constant balancing act.
And for most families, especially mine and yours,
this is a source
of huge strain on both emotions and resources.
<v ->That's really right, Anthony.</v>
And there are millions of other families
who are dealing with this every single day.
And this is why we designed Umi to be at the heart
of an ecosystem
of partners to meet their wellness needs and goals.
And one of those incredible organizations is AARP.
<v ->Here to tell you more about it,</v>
please welcome the CEO of AARP, Dr. Myechia Mintor-Jordan.
<v ->There you go.</v>
Good morning.
I'm thrilled to be here at CES where AARP plays
a unique role in fostering innovation
that helps make aging easier for everyone.
As a nonprofit organization,
we have an important social mission: to empower people
to choose how they live as they age.
Aging, like technology, is constantly evolving.
In fact, aging is much more dynamic than most people think.
And the realities of aging are unique from person
to person and generation to generation.
That's where you all come in.
Technology is critical in every aspect of our lives.
For people 50 and over, it is central
to driving good health, financial security,
and the happiness that comes from caring communities,
strong social connections, and personal fulfillment.
This, essentially, is what age tech is all about.
It lives at the intersection of longevity and technology.
As you explore these halls,
you will find age tech in almost every corner of CES.
Why? Because aging is fueling economies around the world.
In 2030, a year before
the first millennials start turning 50,
the world's 50-plus population is projected
to contribute $65 trillion to the global GDP.
And that economic contribution is expected
to nearly double by 2050.
What are they buying?
Everything, especially technology,
and not just gadgets and wearables.
They are seeking tech that enhances their lives
as they age, from smart homes and appliances
to innovative health and wellness solutions.
This is why we launched
the AgeTech Collaborative, a growing ecosystem
of tech leaders, visionary startups,
and strategic organizations committed
to making lives easier, healthier,
and more fulfilling for the massive population
of older people and their families around the world.
The AgeTech Collaborative is where we started our work
with Panasonic Well, co-promoting
the Family Wellness Innovative Challenge,
which you'll hear more
about in co-developing game-changing technology
to support family caregivers.
Many of today's family caregivers are millennials,
caring for aging parents or grandparents,
as well as young children.
We've heard these family caregivers describe life
in the sandwich generation,
more like life in a panini press.
Full of daily stress that is having long-term impacts
on their physical, mental, and emotional health.
And make no mistake, this is very real and very personal.
You will likely be a caregiver or need a caregiver
at some point in your life.
Yoky, all of us at AARP thank Panasonic Well
and its partners for the collaboration, the ingenuity,
and the tangible difference this work could
have in the lives of family caregivers today
and in the future.
<v ->Thank you so much, Myechia.</v>
With this relationship, families have access to content
and benefits of AARP to care for each other with Umi.
Umi is also proud to collaborate
with best-in-class partners like Blue Apron, Calm,
Thumbtack, and dozens of other leading companies
who will help care for families connect across all
their wellness needs.
But building an ecosystem requires commitment
to innovation from the ground up.
This is why today we're also announcing the winners
of our global startup competition
called Family Wellness Innovation Challenge.
With over 550 applicants from 7 countries competing
for $1 million in prizes, we saw
groundbreaking technology aimed at family wellness.
Earlier this week, we celebrated five winners,
including our grand prize winner, Hearth Display.
Congratulations to all.
Swing by our Panasonic booth to make sure
to meet these amazing winners.
We're laying the foundation for a global wellness ecosystem.
Panasonic Well Partner Collective.
It is where wellness meets world-changing innovation.
And trust me, you'll wanna be part of it.
<v ->Our partners are not just collaborators.</v>
They are integral to shaping the future of our business.
With the launch of Panasonic Go,
we are teaming up with the best in AI
to deliver cutting-edge solutions rooted in our legacy
of trust and reliability.
And when it came to embedding ethical AI into everything
we do, there was only one clear choice.
That's why I'm thrilled
to announce Panasonic's global partners with Anthropic,
a leading AI safety and research company.
<v ->And here's to tell us more,</v>
please welcome co-founder and president
of Anthropic, Daniela Amodei.
Yeah, let's do this.
<v ->Good morning and thanks, Yoky.</v>
What an exciting vision for Umi.
It's such an honor to be here to talk with you today
about Anthropic's global partnership with Panasonic.
<v ->Umi is Panasonic's first consumer offering powered</v>
by Anthropic's LLM Claude.
And today, you saw a sneak preview
at how our thoughtful integration delivers personalized
experiences in family wellness.
But this partnership goes beyond what you saw today.
Together, as a global LLM partner,
we're advancing AI in a powerful and an ethical way
that reflects our shared values.
So, Daniella, would you like to share the audience
a little bit about what we're working on together?
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
At Anthropic, we build trustworthy AI.
For those of you who aren't familiar,
Anthropic is a company that is focused
on developing safe and trusted artificial intelligence
that millions of people around the world rely on every day.
Today, our commitment to building safe, reliable,
and transparent AI, aligned with human values,
brings us together with Panasonic.
These principles have guided Anthropic from day one,
just as the commitment to human-centered technology
has guided Panasonic for more than 100 years.
Through this partnership, Claude, Anthropic's LLM,
will help transform how Panasonic works and innovates
with humans at the center.
Throughout its century-long history,
Panasonic has consistently evolved
to meet its customers' changing needs.
You've already seen Umi in action.
In the future, and with Claude's help,
we'll help bring that same personalized experience
to more of Panasonic's customers,
making every interaction more human, more helpful,
and available whenever people need it.
