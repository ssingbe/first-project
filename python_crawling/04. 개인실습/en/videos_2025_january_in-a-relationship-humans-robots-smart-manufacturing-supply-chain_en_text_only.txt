<v ->All right. Well, good morning and welcome to CES 2025.</v>
I'm Mike Oitzman.
I'm senior editor for The Robot Report,
co-host and producer of "The Robot Report Podcast."
If you love robotics and love hearing about industry,
hearing from industry folks in the industry,
I encourage you to download an episode for your flight home
and stay up to date with what's going on
in the robotics industry.
I love my job
because I get to talk to interesting people all day
and help amplify the stories that are,
you know, on the cutting edge of robotics and innovation.
And so I'm excited to be here this morning at CES
not only to see all of the innovation on the showfloor,
and there's lots of that,
so I hope you guys are, you know,
excited to see what is going on there.
But more than that, I'm excited to be on stage
with this incredible cast of individuals,
who all have some very industry-leading stories
to talk about.
So let's get going because I know they've got a lot to say.
And so I'm gonna ask each of them
to introduce themselves individually
as we go along here with the first question.
And so you'll get to know who they are.
And, Sally, I'm gonna start with you.
So please introduce yourself
and tell us what emerging technologies and trends
you're seeing that are shaping the future
of robotics and automation at DHL.
<v ->Sure. Thanks, Mike.</v>
My name is Sally Miller. I'm with DHL.
I would ask for a raise of hands
but I can't see any of you, because the lights are bright,
but I'm sure you're a customer
of one of our divisions at some point.
So DHL has five divisions.
We run the postal business for Germany,
we have a forwarding business
where we move freight between continents,
and we are the largest time-definite parcel provider
outside the US.
And then we have a newer division called e-commerce,
which inserts packages less than five pounds
into the postal system of a couple of different countries.
And then we have the supply chain division,
which is the division I'm in,
and we provide warehousing and transportation
and value added services to companies.
We service several market verticals.
And I bring this up in the context of the conversation today
of what, you know, are the emerging trends
and things that are important to our business.
We have over 55,000 hourly associates
across the US and Canada.
And we have a high dependency on hourly labor
to provide service to our customers and our sites,
we have about 500 across the US and Canada.
And so what we're seeing and what we're focused on
are trends that can help our operations be more efficient
and reduce our dependency on hourly labor.
So we look at robotics,
mainly assisted robotics that work with people
to help make the more mundane, non-value added activities
easier, reduce travel time, make the job less stressful.
The second thing is autonomous material
and handling equipment.
So autonomous forklift trucks are of interest to us.
And also AI in several forms.
And I know it's highly overused lately,
but gen AI, we're doing a lot of use cases
and back office activities, including IT development,
data mapping, generating documents,
you know, like most large organizations.
And DHL, I believe, is the 15th largest
private employer in the world.
We generate a lot of legal documents, associate documents,
and documents to suppliers and customers.
And those are all very nice use cases for gen AI.
We're also using AI machine learning
to take data from different systems
that we utilize in our operations
to make our core activities more efficient.
So there's a lot going on.
It's a fun time to be in IT.
I think after years of reporting uptime statistics
and, you know, number of applications deployed,
we're really focused on driving innovation
and changing how things are done in the industry.
So that's a bit about me and my focus.
<v ->Well, thanks for that.</v>
Jay, same question to you.
Please introduce yourself,
tell us what emerging technologies you foresee
shaping the future of robotics and automation at Oshkosh.
<v ->Yeah, good morning. Can you hear me?</v>
Okay.
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Good morning.</v>
As an introduction, my name is Jay Iyengar.
I'm the chief technology
and strategic sourcing officer for Oshkosh Corporation.
As an introduction to Oshkosh,
you know, we are an industrial technology company
who've been around since 1917.
The company was founded
on innovation for mobility since 1917.
What our products, what we work on
is we use the term everyday heroes,
those who move the world forward, right?
We couldn't exist without them, as an example.
Everyday heroes are, you know, people that work daily,
your refuse collection, your firefighters,
people that deliver your mail,
people that actually serve the military,
people that work in construction.
So these are all the people that, everyday heroes.
And all our products and technology
serve those everyday heroes.
As an example, we have, you know, firefighting,
we have, you know, firefighting equipment,
which is fire trucks both for, you know,
residential, commercial use, as well as airports.
We have, you know, equipment around the airport itself,
such as ground support equipment around the airport itself,
people that work on the tarmac.
Chances are if you flew in, you know, to this event
in the last couple of days,
you probably got on the jet bridge,
which was an Oshkosh jet bridge.
That's an example of another one of the everyday heroes
that I talked about, right?
People that collect your refuse.
We do have refuse and recycling collection trucks.
So we are a vehicle manufacturer,
we are a technology provider.
And, again, the common theme that ties it together
is this everyday heroes theme.
And what we do is we apply technology
to address both spoken and unspoken needs of our customers.
By the way, these jobs are very difficult jobs.
These aren't something that,
you know, many times it's tendency to take it for granted.
As an example, your refuse collection,
your garbage collection job
is the seventh most dangerous job in the country
according to Department of Labor,
because they have to climb in and out of the vehicles.
They actually, on average, do 24,000 steps a day.
So these are very, very difficult jobs.
It takes time for somebody to learn
how to actually drive the vehicle,
park it right next to your garbage can
and deploy the arm and using the joystick
and collect it, you know, and dump it back into the trucks,
and that repetitive task frequently.
Those kind of things, there's opportunities that we see
in terms of technology, how the technology can apply
to make those jobs more efficient,
more productive, and safer.
So that's what we focus on,
is we have, you know, automation, autonomous technologies,
we use it at moments of autonomy.
You don't really need a completely driverless vehicle,
but there's a lot we could do
to make those difficult jobs easier, efficient, et cetera.
Another example is your jet bridge.
How many times have you been stuck on an aircraft
because don't you know that your jet bridge didn't deploy
or a person that was supposed to deploy the jet bridge
wasn't available, right?
That's an example of something we are working on,
you know, automating it
so that there is an autonomous jet dock
where the dock identifies an aircraft
and actually, you know, automatically moves,
identifies the aircraft and the door of the aircraft
and automatically it deploys itself.
So get very, very close to the door.
So there a lot of opportunities there in applying AI,
you know, advanced sensing and robotics
to really make those difficult jobs easier.
At the end of the day,
making it very productive for our customers,
providing them both, you know, financial benefits
and overall total cost ownership benefits.
<v ->Yeah, some great examples of everyday automation</v>
that we don't think about.
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
<v ->We're interacting with</v>
or interacting with parts of our lives.
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
<v ->So thanks for sharing that.</v>
Andrew, I'm gonna ask you to go next.
Now, you're the entrepreneur on the panel here
and you're developing a new robotic system.
So tell us a bit about your journey
and how you've come to evaluate
the opportunities for automation in robotics
in the markets that you're serving.
<v ->Sure. First of all, thank you.</v>
I'm very happy to be here.
I love what I do and I'm grateful
to get to share a little bit more about it.
I'm the founder of Lucid Bots,
and we focus on extending human reach
by building robots that do dangerous and demanding jobs.
Currently, we're focused on exterior cleaning.
And we have customers around the world
doing anything from cleaning office windows
to industrial water tanks, all the way to stadium domes.
On average, it's about two times faster
than traditional methods
and you're not suspending human workers from lifts,
ladder, scaffolds.
You're able to relocate them to the ground.
And there are three fundamental beliefs about the future
that really guide how we think about our business.
The first is there's this world of dirty, dangerous jobs
where robots are primed to step in and be helpful.
And the second is these robots, we feel,
really need to be built domestically
as we think about our own economic resilience,
national security, and data privacy.
And the third belief
is everything that moves will be automated.
And that combination of robotics and automation
is what can unlock a world of prosperity.
And to tell a little bit of a story of how we began,
I had a very unusual journey into the robotics world.
I originally went to Davidson College to play baseball,
and I was majoring in the highly relevant fields
of economics and Spanish.
And it was a fall windy day of my junior year
and I saw these window washers cleaning large building
and the platform they were on got caught in the wind,
started slamming against the building.
And you saw the workers up there
just white knuckling the rails, hanging on for dear life.
And I just asked what seemed like an obvious question:
how can we leverage technology to make this job safer,
to make it more efficient?
And I looked around me at all of these buildings
and I realized we're building more buildings,
they're getting larger, more complex
yet we've got less and less people willing to do the work,
which represents just an enormous opportunity
to introduce robotics and automation.
And in terms of how we think about it at Lucid Bots,
again, we're a little bit unique
versus the traditional robotics world.
Firstly, for the last several decades,
we've been building robots
but primarily for the factory settings and warehouses.
And the way we think about this
is static environment robots,
one robot on the same job site every day,
sometimes literally bolted to the floor
where the work comes to it.
In our world, we focus on dynamic robots,
robots that operate on a different job site every day
and they actually go to work.
And the second big difference
is just how we approached our business.
We weren't originally a team of researchers
looking to expand some foundational technology.
What we saw was a real world, everyday expensive problem,
and we wanted to focus on solving that problem
and delivering customer value as quickly as possible
as we now look to continue expanding.
<v ->Yeah, that's a great story and thanks for sharing.</v>
And, again, it speaks to the fact
that anybody in this room could start their own journey
by recognizing a problem that could be automated,
a dull, dangerous, dirty job,
and, you know, helping to make society better.
And I think, again, that is on display on the floor here
from all of these companies that are displaying here,
their own technologies
that are impacting consumers' lives, right?
So the last individual I wanna introduce you to is Rahul.
And he works for an organization.
If you're in the industry, you'll recognize the name.
But, Rahul, tell us a little bit about who you are
and what Siemens is doing.
<v ->Yeah, happy to be here. I'm Rahul Garg.</v>
I lead the global business
for our industrial machinery manufacturers,
companies that make machines, companies that build robots,
companies that make equipment that enable their customers
to manufacture in their factories.
So as part of my job, I have the good fortune
to work with companies who are driving innovation
inside their factories.
And at Siemens, we enable a lot of the automation
inside a factory and we also enable
a lot of the development of the products
that are gonna be built in the factories.
We have a extensive industrial
software business application as well.
So as part of what we are trying to do
is drive this whole notion of a comprehensive digital twin.
Now, most of you may have heard the idea of a digital twin
and you think of it as a product,
and the digital twin of the product.
But when I'm referring to the comprehensive digital twin,
a physics-based digital twin, we try and extend that
throughout the entire lifecycle of the product,
from the time it is designed, engineered
to the time it's manufactured,
and to the time it's serviced and supported as well.
And we think bringing that digital twin,
comprehensive digital twin capability
and combining it closer to the physical world
will allow you to do some very useful things
in optimizing your business processes,
helping you ask very difficult questions
and meet your many challenging demands.
So as part of that whole digital twin
and the comprehensive digital twin,
we enable the digital twin of a factory as well.
And inside the digital twin of a factory,
we think in terms of how to harmonize
and build the entire process
for what you're gonna be building inside a factory.
And inside a factory, you've got equipment,
you've got robots, you've got humans.
So how do you get all of that to work in a seamless manner?
And as part of that whole process through a digital twin,
we can enable you to look
at how the machine would be functioning,
what are the speeds that you would be needing
to work the machine at,
you can look at how the humans would be interacting,
how the robots would be interacting.
So as part of that process, it becomes very critical
that you can evaluate all these capabilities
in a digital way and gives you the freedom
and the flexibility to try out different options,
to try out different scenarios you would want to run,
and make sure that you can design the most flexible,
the most optimal production facility
and get the necessary output
that you would want from your factory.
<v ->Yeah.</v>
And I think the interesting thing about digital twins,
and there's been a lot of news this week about,
you know, simulation in the real world
and in the virtual world,
the idea that you can create an entire factory line,
a process manufacturing
or a typical labor-based manufacturing line
and actually change the parameters parametrically
and see the output,
see how the KPIs change is just incredible.
And it helps close the loop that much faster
on the rights answer.
<v ->It does, it does.</v>
And in fact, and bringing in a lot of AI capabilities
into the digital twin, allowing you to simulate
a lot more variables that you did not have
at your hand before.
<v ->Right.</v>
Well, having made it through 2024,
the big hype for us last year
in the robotics industry was humanoids.
The big question of course was what are they gonna do?
As a journalist, I'm a skeptic,
that's my job, to be a skeptic,
and I'm still questioning exactly when humanoids
are going to become real or if they're gonna become real.
So I wanted to pull you guys,
and we talked about this before we got on stage here
as one of the most hyped stories.
You know, so there's multiple vendors
on the showfloor today.
You're gonna see opportunities to interact with humanoids.
They're getting better every quarter.
From the capabilities,
but the question remains is there work for them to do?
And it's this question of general purpose automation
versus specific purpose automation.
Purpose-built automation,
automation like an industrial robot
that does one welding operation a thousand times a day
versus a general purpose automation
that can do many different tasks and change it up.
So having said that, it seems that labor availability
has been one of the key things
that both the venture capital community sees
as an opportunity here,
why they've invested some large sums of money
in some humanoid companies this last two years.
And so I wanted to ask you guys your thoughts
about the reality in future for humanoids,
whether you believe it's a good thing or a bad thing.
And so I'm asking you to go on a record a bit here.
So, Sally, I'm gonna start with you
'cause I know you are in charge of a program
that actually evaluates new technology
for the use cases.
<v Sally>Yes.</v>
<v ->So tell us a little bit about your experience</v>
with the humanoid world.
<v ->So humanoids are a vision of roboticists</v>
and well-financed friends, I would say.
In supply chain in a warehouse,
you don't need a robot to have legs.
In fact, if they have a stronger base
that has a battery pack, they can operate for more hours.
And I'm a firm believer
in that what you deploy in the warehouse
should look like its intended use.
And I'm taking that quote from Rodney Brooks,
who invented the Roomba, which we all have,
especially if you have a dog.
And there is a human element
in everything that we've talked about
while we've introduced ourselves.
And, you know, I have to wonder,
would you wanna be working next to,
you know, something that looked outta "Star Wars" every day
or a robot with a nice screen, interactive lights
that was designed for the use case it was intended?
My hope, because I'm an optimistic person,
is that there are, you know, products
that come out of the huge investment in humanoids
that can be leveraged for the use cases
in what we do in warehouses, which is receive product,
put it away, pick it, package it, and ship it out.
And I really don't think it will be very well received
in the look and feel in the warehouse.
There's a lot of sensitivities
to robots taking over humans' jobs.
And I think if you design a robot
that looks just like a human,
you're looking for some problem with the labor force
that we're desperately trying to attract, retain, and keep
and make as efficient as possible.
<v ->Yeah. Jay, what's your thoughts?</v>
<v ->Yeah, so I agree with comments made by Sally too.</v>
At the end of the day,
if you think of what a humanoid is, right,
what we all do as humans is we sense,
sensing is a really critical part of it.
We perceive sensing, perception,
self-learning, and making decisions, right?
Very simplistically, those are the key elements
of what a humanoid is.
Human form is, you agree with me,
human form is extremely inefficient from an,
you don't wanna mimic something that's inefficient
to do something that you're trying to solve.
Creating a human form just for the sake of it
doesn't do anything.
In our industry, what we are trying to do is,
as I mentioned earlier, is to solve,
there's a lot of low-hanging fruit inefficiencies
as we are looking at the manufacturing floor
or on our own products,
what we could do for the users of our products as well.
I'll just give you maybe one example,
is we are the leaders in access equipment,
people working at height.
If you walk around the building,
you see the JLG machines.
By the way, they're really, really safe.
The platform stays flat at 185 feet.
So there's a lot of technology that goes into it.
But still there's a human being standing up there
that's cleaning the window, or it's used for a lot of,
like welding is another example.
They go there and move materials and they weld.
Sometimes there's two machines, two machines go together
where, you know, the material is carried on one
and the person's on the other one.
So there's a lot of repetitive human parts.
You can even argue to an extent
it is more of mundane type of tasks that are there.
So we call about end-effector humanoids
where you could still have the saw machines
but the last part of the work that they do can be automated
with having an arm that actually,
you know, goes and welds automatically, right,
and then coordinates with another machine
to bring the equipment, bring the materials out there
so that that work can be more efficiently,
whereas human being can move on
to something higher level tasks.
We don't believe in just we have to replace something,
we can augment what people do today
and take out the mundane work,
take out the, you know, potentially unsafe work,
and talked about dangerous environments, et cetera,
but make that more efficient
so that we can move on to some higher level work.
So that's what we focus on from that sense.
We're seeing a lot advancements
in, you know, we use cameras, LiDARs
and, you know, processors.
And AI chips have come a very, very long way.
We saw some announcements this week, yet from Nvidia,
being able to do, we do digital twins today by the way.
We simulate factories, we simulate test environments,
we do some virtual testing
before we do physical testing on our products,
using a lot of Siemens's applications.
But with AI, you can do a lot more scenario planning
you couldn't normally do with today with this thing.
So I think there's a lot of low-hanging fruit opportunities
we need to go after before you design,
before you really wanna mimic
the inefficient human form in a humanoid.
<v ->Yeah, if you listen to the podcast,</v>
Steve, my co-host, we talk often
about the humanoid robot video of the week
because it seems like every week,
one of the other companies is one-upping each other
with what they're doing.
And I'm supporting my Boston Dynamics Atlas Socks
on stage today as an homage
to, you know, one of the OGs in the industry.
But having said that, Rahul, what are your thoughts about,
you know, humanoids even in the digital twin?
Is it a good opportunity to try to validate that-
<v ->Yeah, you know, first of all,</v>
I do think humanoids are on the cutting edge of technology.
They're very fascinating.
And they bring in some new capabilities
that can be adopted more universally
but on a technology side.
I think from a general purpose perspective,
the usage of humanoids is not there as yet
from a production perspective.
I think we have to still rely on special purpose robots
that are eventually gonna do the function
in a more efficient manner.
The reason you're using robot is to bring in more efficiency
and a humanoid will not get you that efficiency
that you're looking for.
So from a digital twin perspective,
we actually do have the ability already in place
to create a digital twin of a human.
In fact, we have a Jack and a Jill version of the human
to allow you to evaluate different ergonomics,
different safety criteria,
different capabilities that a human could be functioning
in a manufacturing environment.
So you can do that complete evaluation
from a digital perspective.
You can even evaluate a person
based on characteristics of a person,
whether it's, not only a man or woman,
but if they're from the US versus China
and their capacities of handling things.
So all that can be done digitally.
But trying to bring in that humanoid, I think it's not,
the ability is not on the digital side,
it's more on the physical side.
I think the systems are not there, as Jay indicated,
the perception capabilities,
a lot of those things are still missing.
The freedom of movements are not there as yet
to bring in that capability as yet.
<v ->Yeah. And, Andrew, I'll let you get a moment here.</v>
I know you're not using humanoids at all,
but we had some interesting thoughts
in our pre-conversation.
<v ->I'll acknowledge that the human form factor</v>
is highly adaptable,
but three things cause me to be reserved about humanoids.
If you're optimizing for strength, stability, and cost,
a humanoid is not the design you would tend toward.
Another big thing, just from a physics perspective,
rotational motion is much more power-dense
than linear motion, which is humanoids.
And then the last thing
that I think often goes overlooked with robotics
is robots are a little bit like cars
and they need ongoing maintenance and servicing.
And simplicity is what scales in this industry.
And the humanoid introduces so many extra failure points
that would need to be serviced and cared for
over the duration of a customer relationship.
And in robotics, you wanna minimize customer headaches
at every opportunity you get.
<v ->Says the entrepreneur who's rolling out products</v>
to new customers every week.
So yeah, serviceability, maintainability,
and customer service key for any robotics company.
So with the time we have left,
we brought up the topic of AI,
which again is changing so rapidly.
We've already talked briefly about this.
But again, as you walk the CES floor today,
I stopped counting how many companies
are talking about AI as the core part of their products.
And, again, as a skeptic, Jay said that,
you know, where is AI deployed and really what is it, right?
I think that's the question,
is what are those places that AI and innovation
is feasible today to do real work?
So did you wanna expand a bit more on-
<v ->Sure. Oh, okay, okay.</v>
So AI is being used today extensively in our products.
And clearly we apply AI as we're making decisions,
whether it's within the factories
and making decisions on what happens.
You know, is the supplier gonna deliver something on time?
There's things that we use for AI for enterprise decisions,
but right on the products there's AI being used.
If you go to the Oshkosh booth,
you're gonna see some of that in action.
Machine learning, deep learning,
at the edge, on the devices,
having embedded systems on the devices.
One simple example I'll give you
is that I talked about refuse collection earlier, right?
So we have sensors and technology on your arm
on the side of your refuse truck.
As today, what they do is they drive by
and then they look to make sure
that they actually parked the vehicle closer to,
stop the vehicle closer to your,
where you put your, you know, refuse on the curb,
then they use their joystick
and then they line it all up and then they grab it.
That whole task, applying sensors in AI,
it actually identifies and locates the refuse bin.
If there's a kid there or if there's a bicycle there,
it won't deploy.
It identifies and locates that is exactly refuse bin,
deploys the arm and grabs it and puts it back,
empties out the refuse container.
That's a very real world use case
that you see today in production applying AI.
<v ->And helping that driver just get that much more efficiency</v>
out of their task, yeah.
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
We've done the mapping.
Actually if you look at putting,
it's almost, you can say one hour of work a day.
They do thousands of these pickups each day.
Look at the fatigue that they have to face, right?
The second example is, I don't know how many of you
really are good about recycling.
Many times, I have to admit,
I mix recycling and refuse together.
I try hard not to put the recycling in there,
but there are times I mix it up.
I'm getting a lot better now
after learning a lot about this.
But it's the wrong thing to do
because it costs more money to sort it out
when you mixed things together on the,
we call it cross-contamination.
Applying cameras in AI technology,
we actually identify there's been a,
as soon as the garbage goes in there,
identify there's been a cross-contamination,
which actually informs the driver, informs the customer.
You do not wanna throw batteries in your garbage.
Do not do that.
It's got a serious impact in terms of safety.
Those are the kind of things
we can actually provide more warning
and it can be in consumer education piece of it.
So there is practical applications.
And the jet dock is another example.
How does it know it's an aircraft?
How does it know it's a door of the aircraft?
Aircraft's very, very expensive.
You just cannot deploy something and hit it.
So there are practical applications of AI, things like that,
but what we do see is advancements in AI processing
and being able to do a better job of sensor fusion
between the cameras and LADARs and LiDARs.
Training the models much more efficiently,
millions of scenarios, training using videos.
So we see that, we see it taken to the next level,
but AI is here and now
and you'll see it across the board on our products.
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>
Rahul, for the Siemens,
again, you're a hardware company and a software company.
We talked about the digital aspects of the digital world,
but, again, how is AI being infused
across that entire stack?
<v ->Yeah, we are, (clears throat) excuse me,</v>
we are looking at AI, in modern,
what we are calling as industrial AI
where we are trying to make sure
that the AI that's being used is robust and reliable enough
from an industrial application perspective.
And from our point of view,
we are looking at it in three ways.
The first one is leveraging the AI on the shop floor
for the operators, making it easy for them
to perhaps even communicate on issues.
Something very simple.
When an operator has an issue,
we have found that 80% of the issues
do not even get reported
because of the challenges in trying to document
the issue, for example.
So just having a very easy mechanism
to capture that information,
getting it to the right person inside the company,
getting, using large language models
for any language perspective, taking photographs,
getting that in front of-
<v ->Part of process improvement then, yeah.</v>
<v ->Exactly, exactly, right.</v>
And then even using our edge devices.
Jay just mentioned, there's some announcements from Nvidia.
We have partnered with Nvidia now
where we are embedding their GPUs inside our edge devices
so that when an operator finds an issue,
they can get their resolution capabilities right there
without having any issues around security of the data.
So that's one on the operator.
The second piece is enabling the engineers,
the programmers with the AI using copilots.
We see tremendous advantage
in trying to design the product, design the factory,
designing the simulation, programming the robots.
Close to 75% of the cost of a robot
and the during the life of a robot
is actually in programming.
And if we can minimize that using copilot capabilities,
we can help that significantly
by driving more adoption of robots in the factories as well.
So that's the second big application we see
in the mass usage of copilots.
And the third piece is actually
on the production floor itself
and actually using AI for production.
And this is where visual capabilities at least
are becoming more adaptive and useful today.
Simple example I would give you,
for example, trying to look at deformities
on the paint of a car, right?
It's not an easy thing,
but using visual cameras to identify the issues
and figure out where the issue is,
what's the depth of the issue, the size of the issue,
and then processing it to take it to the next level
to actually fix the paint.
And as you're trying to move that whole assembly line,
moving it in the right space and at the right time.
So those are some applications
we are starting to adapt inside our factories.
<v ->Yeah, real practical applications,</v>
maybe the less sexy examples of where AI is being deployed.
And, Andrew, you know, again, you're flying drones,
you've got your ground-based robots for cleaning.
AI, I assume, is a core part
of what it's doing to navigate and complete its tasks.
<v ->It's really fun living at the forefront</v>
of trying to embody AI on a physical robot,
'cause that's where the most opportunity is.
And over the summer, we actually acquired an AI company
and where we've seen the greatest benefits from AI
just in the short run.
One has been with our actual software development.
Things, five years ago, we used a program,
we're up to 20 times faster today
just using AI tools and workflows.
But we get most excited about, though,
is truly getting agentic AI to work on our robots.
And when I say that, that's allowing the robot
the ability to perceive, reason, act, and learn.
And to give an example,
it's like having a coworker right next to you
where you can communicate what needs to be done.
They can take in their surroundings
and use relevant sensors and data to understand,
"Here are the actions I need to do."
And as they're doing those actions,
they continue to take your feedback,
they continue to perceive and reason.
And as they do it, they learn and refine.
And starting that flywheel
where every single time your robot operates,
it's getting more intelligent,
it's improving its autonomy, efficiency, effectiveness,
that's the holy grail within this AI robotic space.
<v ->Yeah.</v>
Well, we're just about out of time,
but I wanna ask Sally to give us a preview.
Sally, you are responsible
for the innovation, evaluation team at DHL.
So you're continually looking
at young entrepreneurial opportunities,
companies like Jay, but for the warehousing space.
So talk to us briefly about the program
for folks that might be interested
in, you know, getting involved in that
and how you evaluate the capabilities
of some of these systems you're deploying.
<v ->Yeah, so we have a innovation funnel where we look at,</v>
you know, I mentioned trends and supply chain,
what will impact our business, make us more efficient.
So it's targeted.
We're not, you know, looking for,
you know, things that are necessarily way far out.
We're more use case-driven.
You know, problems we're trying to solve
and optimize in what we do every day.
And working with a lot of startup companies like yourself
to help roboticists, non-operational supply chain people
develop their products so that we get an ROI.
We're running a business. We have to make money.
You know, you mentioned your Boston Dynamics Socks.
It's a good example of, you know, the leader,
I would say, in robotics.
Worked with them on developing the stretch product
which unloads cartons from a trailer
and will have more specific use cases
to be able to do other case movements within the warehouse.
So working alongside companies
that have the robotics expertise,
we bring the operational expertise.
And we're interested in things
that can scale across our operations.
There are a lot of niche solutions,
but, you know, assisted picking,
we do each picking in a lot of facilities.
So the ability, you know, to scale up
gives us the best benefit.
And we've got over 7,500 bots deployed globally
and are always looking for solutions in our use case,
you know, that fit our use case.
<v ->Great. Well, we are right on time, so.</v>
<v Sally>Yeah, I saw the countdown-</v>
<v ->Yeah, so I wanna thank you guys</v>
for the great conversation.
I think you guys can hang out for a few minutes here.
So if you wanna reach out to any of the folks on stage,
catch them over here on the side.
But, again, thanks for your time today.
Thank you, guys.
And, again, download the episode
of "The Robot Report Podcast" for your flight home.
And thank you for your time today.
<v ->Thank you.</v>
<v Rahul>Thank you.</v>
