<v ->Good morning, everybody,</v>
or I should say good afternoon.
It's already one o'clock.
The time is going by so quickly.
I wanna welcome you all here today.
We're gonna talk about the cyber security talent gap
that we're experiencing globally,
but we have two U.S. or individuals here,
so we'll probably talk a lot also
about the situation in the United States.
First, I'd like to introduce myself.
My name's Jennifer Taylor.
I'm the president and CEO
of the Northern Virginia Technology Council.
We're one of the largest tech councils in the country,
and we've been around for 35 years.
And what we do is we really drive
innovation and economic growth
in the Northern Virginia region,
which sits right across the river
from the capital of the United States, Washington, D.C.,
so we really unite and bring together
our full tech ecosystem in the national capital region,
our nation's capital.
Prior to this role, I actually worked
at the Consumer Technology Association,
where I was VP of Industry Affairs,
and one of my roles was to lead
all of our workforce development programming
and policy work, so that's why I'm here today.
Today's panel topic is titled The Cybersecurity Talent Gap.
And this topic is really relevant and timely today,
considering that cybersecurity talent shortages.
This shortage has never been more pressing.
I'm sure you're all aware of recent cyber attacks,
such as the Salt Typhoon
targeting the U.S. telecom industry,
and the Volt Typhoon,
the Chinese State-sponsored hacker group
that has threatened critical infrastructure,
including power, water,
military facilities, and supply chains.
So all of this underscores escalating risk.
And these are just two of the more well known.
We know companies are dealing with cyber attacks every day.
So what I'd like to do now
is just set the table for our discussion
and share some general statistics with you
about the cyber workforce.
In the U.S., we are currently experiencing
a significant shortage of cyber professionals
with thousands of positions unfilled.
And this gap poses, I find this really interesting,
substantial risks to our organizations,
our industries and governments
because the lack of skilled personnel
is predicted to account for more than half
of significant cybersecurity incidents worldwide,
so we need more people.
To address the talent gap,
there are various initiatives underway, which is great.
We're seeing organizations map skills training
to emerging threats.
We're offering more continuous learning opportunities
for staff or employees.
Their organizations are providing more clear pathways,
career pathways.
We're attracting talent from more diverse populations
and through non-traditional educational pathways,
like apprenticeship, at least in our country.
And we're collaborating more with public agencies
and through national campaigns.
So in today's discussion, we're going to do three things.
We're gonna understand what are the factors
that are driving the demand for cybersecurity talent.
We're going to discuss how the increased demand for cyber
is impacting companies,
specifically how they're filling their talent pipelines.
And then we're gonna showcase
how tech companies are addressing these challenges
through innovative and unconventional ways.
So what I'm gonna do now is introduce
our two subject matter experts.
First, we have Torrell Funderburk.
He's the CISO at Sealed Air.
And he focuses on cyber resilience and innovation
in the face of evolving security threats.
He has a background in software development
and a passion for digital transformation
and emerging technology.
Today, he's dedicated to bridging the gap
between business objectives and cybersecurity strategies.
So we're gonna talk about that.
For those of you who are unaware of Sealed Air,
they're now branded as C.
Do you say C or S-E-E?
<v ->C.</v>
<v ->C, yeah.</v>
And they're a packaging company.
They're known for their innovative solutions
in product protection, food safety, and security.
They're headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina,
and you'll know some of their popular brands,
well-known brands such as Bubble Wrap and Cryovac
for food Packaging.
Now, we also have Vishal Chawla.
Am I saying that correctly?
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->Okay. (laughs)</v>
And he's the founder and CEO of BluOcean.
He brings over 30 years of cybersecurity expertise,
combining his big four experience as a global cyber leader
and a senior partner serving global Fortune 100 clients
in the financial services and healthcare industry.
He's now the founder and CEO of BluOcean Cyber.
They're located in Northern Virginia,
where he's created a product called RiskGPS.
It's a cyber risk governance platform
and it helps companies dominate their competition
by redefining cybersecurity
as a critical strategic business asset.
And he'll tell us more about that as well.
And he's been published in "The Wall Street Journal,"
"The MIT Review" and many other publications.
So thank you both for being here today.
<v ->Thank you for having us.</v>
<v ->Okay, so we will take time for a few questions at the end,</v>
so if you have any, you know,
we look forward to hearing from you.
So we're gonna start with Torrell and then Vishal.
So based on your respective experiences,
at Sealed Air and Deloitte, when you were working with them,
Vishal, what do you believe are the main factors
driving the increased demand for cybersecurity strategies?
what's driving the demand?
<v ->This is like an incredible question,</v>
and I like this question
because I think it's a combination of many factors.
I think one, obvious for large publicly traded companies,
is the new SEC regulations
and trying to aim for regulatory compliance
and shared accountability and ownership
at the leadership level.
But on top of that, I think the general awareness
for the cyber securities is being raised across industry.
So more people are aware of it,
more people kind of understand
that they need their collective strategies towards cyber.
And I think as a side effect of that,
it almost feels as if through that focus,
there's a realization that cyber can also de-risk
and enable the business as well,
because of the unique nature that cyber has to play.
So, if a business has a strategy
that they're driving towards,
how can cyber be leveraged to de-risk that
while maintain kind of operational resilience
for their current operations effectively?
So I think a combination of all those three things
is really what's driving the need and demand
for effective cyber strategies
and also demand for cyber strategy
to be communicated effectively,
which is also a challenge in our industry.
<v Jennifer>Yeah.</v>
What are your thoughts, Vishal?
<v ->No, those are great points, Torrell.</v>
I'll add few aspects to it.
I would pick about four things.
One, I think what we have seen is
the cyber criminals are not anymore...
I joke like two men in a truck,
door wrangler, just try to come in.
They have become organized.
<v Jennifer>Yeah.</v>
<v ->Ransomware as a service, like LockBit.</v>
These companies have HR department,
you get paid, you come in nine to six,
you hack all day-
<v ->Unbelievable.</v>
<v ->You go home.</v>
So they are businesses.
They are not just two people
just trying to see sitting in a basement or a dorm room
trying to break in.
So that shifts like bringing the professionalism,
if you think about it, to attacking,
to hacking companies and holding them hostage.
So that is a big shift we are seeing.
The number two is definitely when you look at
in terms of automation and everything, what's going on.
We are seeing a lot more stuff like cloud and SaaS.
Especially after COVID, we saw this huge shift,
we gotta move.
But cloud and SaaS means
now you gotta go out of your perimeter.
You don't have that control, right?
<v ->Right.</v>
<v ->So, that creates now</v>
a very open-ended environment,
like I call it why you need to come into a house
when your house is actually outside or-
<v Jennifer>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>
<v ->Or the other way I look at it is,</v>
we used to always call it what happens in Vegas,
stays in Vegas.
Not anymore.
It's on a SaaS cloud sitting somewhere,
which we have no clue.
And they don't need to come in,
they just hack in and those things,
so it's changing that whole thing.
<v ->I love these analogies.</v>
Like I like that house is outside of the house.
<v ->It is, everything is out, right?</v>
You can go ahead Salesforce for any of these tech company
outside, you don't need to come into the parameter.
And I think the third biggest thing we are seeing,
which is third biggest thing we are seeing is
the attack pattern has shifted
because earlier, the people wanted to go attack for data.
Every one of our information had some value,
but that value has gone down considerably.
So when Ticketmaster got hacked,
I think they got half a billion record, I think,
and they asked for 400,000.
That's less than-
<v ->Dollars.</v>
<v ->That's less than a penny for each of our record.</v>
That's it.
But what they are shifted is
they are going after business disruption.
How I disrupt business, like change healthcare,
how I go, like, don't want to name the companies,
but companies we are disrupt the business, shut it down,
so I hold them hostage and they gotta pay me now.
And the last part I would say which has changed
the attack pattern is everything we look in CTM is
I'm sure we are enjoying CES, right?
Every technology we see.
As fast the technology is moving,
like we were talking about Abbott,
when I was looking at the device, the hacker is moving too.
And the more technology-enabled company we become,
the more opening is for hackers to go after us.
So I think these four factors-
<v ->It's very well said.</v>
<v ->are creating an ecosystem,</v>
which is creating this talent gap also
because it's not where we were,
it's like, your hockey, where the puck is going,
that's moving too fast, it's going somewhere else
and we are still kind of moving slowly towards it
<v Jennifer>So the skills, the talent pipeline</v>
has to keep up with the pace of technology.
<v Torrell>Yeah, I love the analogy</v>
because I use it internally.
<v Jennifer>I'm seeing the technology,</v>
you know, have the hockey stick.
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->And then the hackers.</v>
But the talent has to-
<v ->Correct.</v>
<v ->Go along with it.</v>
<v ->Skate to the puck.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v Jennifer>Absolutely.</v>
So I'm gonna go to my next question.
So how has increased demand for cyber security impacted C?
Like what are the conversations you're having as the CISO
with your CEO and your leadership team?
<v ->I think kind of what I touched on earlier,</v>
and that's leveraging kind of the capabilities
that we've established at our company
to actually de-risk the business strategy, right?
So we're elevating our integration into the organization.
So it's not just this back office project function.
It is how we align with the business
to de-risk that strategy
and the expectations and outcomes that come with that.
So it is raising the bar
for the expectations of security
in terms of helping driving outcomes,
but also more visibility
in terms of our readiness for operational disruption,
as Vishal mentioned.
<v Jennifer>So are you able to give us a specific example?</v>
I don't know if it's proprietary,
but of de-risking a specific strategy.
So, like what might be-
<v ->I'll give you an example.</v>
So Vishal gave a great example.
So, there's an increase in attack posture,
attack surface with the boom of the devices
and emerging technology.
So you have AI, you have IoT and manufacturing.
There's this I4.0 revolution, right?
<v Jennifer>That's right.</v>
<v ->So a lot of connected devices,</v>
smart manufacturing, digital twins, all this.
<v ->Right, so I'm visualizing C's manufacturing operations</v>
as you're describing that, and this is massive.
<v ->Yeah, yeah, so-</v>
<v ->And I'm sure it's global,</v>
<v ->It's a global footprint.</v>
<v ->Yep, yep.</v>
<v ->So from a security standpoint,</v>
how do we align with the major stakeholders in the business
that are driving this strategy
for more digital operation to de-risk it
in terms of like building secure by design models?
So we have a clearly understood model
to onboard this emerging technology onto our operation
that not only protects
against like existing or emerging risks,
but it also improves
the performance of our current operation as well.
<v Jennifer>Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay.</v>
<v ->So, I think the days of just expecting it</v>
to be secure is gone.
It's like, okay, secure and what?
Secure and more efficient, more cost efficient,
more operational resilient.
So I think the more integration to business outcomes
is kind of what I'm seeing.
<v ->Gotcha. Wow.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->And so, how, how is it impacting-</v>
<v ->Talent side?</v>
<v ->What?</v>
<v Vishal>The talent?</v>
<v Jennifer>Well, so this increased demand</v>
for cybersecurity.
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->How is it impacting?</v>
How are you seeing companies respond from your perspective,
either while you were working,
you know, with the big four or with BluOcean?
<v ->I think-</v>
<v ->How are companies responding to any these four-</v>
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
<v ->trends you just outlined?</v>
<v ->So, when I take those trends</v>
and I think back to Torrell's great point
about the business-centric kind of thinking,
I think what it's creating is I step back
and been I've consultant for so long.
When I look at the problem from outside in,
I see we have a talent issue
at about four different dimensions to it.
I'll start with the first one is,
what Torrell and I were talking a few minutes ago
is just the security leadership.
Is the security leadership trained enough
to understand the mission and the business-
<v ->Okay.</v>
<v ->and very business-centric?</v>
Back to the SEC regulation.
They want you to focus on the business centricity.
Because the criminal looks at your business to attack you.
So there's a huge demand on security leadership,
how to train themselves
to move more toward the business side of the gap.
So that's some of the companies are pushing
their security leaders to be more strategic.
And what I call it, we were great
as a professional cybersecurity leader
used to be a good defender and a technologist.
As I remember a bank in Virginia,
they hired someone and he was phenomenal in technology,
how to transition to cloud, but then they get hacked.
Not his fault, but again, that's how they used to hire.
And now, they have to move to hiring people
who are more strategists and collaborator.
<v ->Okay.</v>
<v ->So you gotta shift</v>
from technologist and defender
to building new additional muscles
of a strategist and collaborator.
So that's number one.
The number two I would pick, Jen, is
it's really the skill side
where companies are investing into
back to, yes, we need certain skills,
but what exactly the skills are gonna be needed
for the future where things are going.
So, we can be great with the skills we have,
but we gotta shift that skill pattern to, oh, you got AI.
Now, you got SaaS application,
which security never had to really deal with application
too much because it was inside the...
But there's no more wall,
there's no more around the company anymore,
so everything is outside, so you gotta change the skillset.
I think the third big thing which we are seeing,
and you will see, like if you guys align with NACD
and the board,
there's a huge pressure on the board of directors
<v Jennifer>Yes.</v>
<v ->to bring some cyber security skills at the leadership.</v>
<v Jennifer>Okay. Even into the board.</v>
<v ->Even into the board.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->And actually, interestingly,</v>
there's a senator out of state of Washington, I think.
He has proposed, actually put something on the table,
which I don't think this is gonna get passed,
but we're holding criminally.
<v Jennifer>Yes, I remember reading that.</v>
<v ->The board and the CISOs</v>
start getting accountable for it.
So there is a huge pressure on the board
that if you're gonna do the governance,
this is a risk you need to manage.
So that's the third skill gap
which companies are trying to address.
And the fourth one I feel is awareness.
As we know, what?
80% or so cyber attacks happens because of human errors?
80?
So how are we gonna become savvy?
It's just like when you purchase a car,
you learn how to manage the car, right?
Now you got all these devices,
like, I don't wanna put anyone like
I go and ask this question sometime.
Like, go and open your Venmo and see
who all is paying to whom.
Can you see that?
And if you can't see that,
that means you have that personal information,
which you don't need to know because it's all there.
So you gotta understand technology.
<v ->Okay, so wait, let's talk about this example.</v>
So when I go into my Venmo, what did you say?
I can see everybody that I paid, right?
<v ->And all your friends who you're paying, anyone.</v>
<v ->Oh, absolutely.</v>
<v ->It's like why I need to know.</v>
<v ->I put my thing on private.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Because I remember seeing</v>
a friend from high school-
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->That said that she paid a tutor for her daughter.</v>
And I went, "Hmm, her daughter must need help with math."
Why do I need to know that eight states away?
That's weird, you know? But yeah,
<v ->If you go back to,</v>
I'm sure everyone has watched "Home Alone," right?
<v ->Yes. Love it.</v>
<v ->People had to go and go to the house</v>
to figure out is someone gonna leave the house,
so I can come and commit the crime.
<v ->Now you don't need to do that.</v>
<v ->Now, you don't need to do anything.</v>
You can check on the phone.
Okay, they just bought their tickets.
Okay, what I need to do next?
<v ->That's right.</v>
<v ->So we need to become,</v>
I think that's where my fourth aspect is becoming
at a human level, we need to become
more aware of the technology.
We need to become aware of how our information can be used.
<v ->Our digital footprint.</v>
<v ->And how to digital footprint</v>
and bring it down.
So that's what I see companies are becoming more,
they're investing a lot more
in security awareness and training.
They are pushing the boards to transition.
They are asking cyber leadership to becoming more strategic,
and then really investing in talent from AI.
So those are the four aspects I will touch on.
<v ->And I would like to add to that too,</v>
about the kind of people you're looking for
to solve these problems.
If we know we have the risk with the,
the human risk, the human element
and the scenario we just played out,
why is that public and not private by default?
And it goes back to the secure by design discussion
and the technology adoption.
Like, are we securing that before we adopt it?
Or do we adopt it and then scramble
to try to figure it out afterwards?
So the talent that you need to do that needs to be aligned
with the outcome of that secure by design thinking
and not defending.
<v ->And it's a great point actually,</v>
just to add one thing to it,
if you look at most of the people,
how many people are like in technology company
or technology, or how many are financial services and stuff?
Not much.
Or retail or manufacturing?
Yeah.
Probably you guys are already seeing a big shift
where a lot more technology decision,
back to Torrell's point,
is getting done at the business level
with CIOs are not even involved
and they're purchasing these SaaS products like this.
I mean, we are working with a company,
they have 1,200 of these.
And then we go into their Slack,
and the Slack is talking to another 500 applications.
It's like, do you know where your data is?
What you're gonna do?
And when you don't know anything,
so that's what is happening,
the technology is coming so fast.
<v Jennifer>Right.</v>
<v ->So we need products to become more secure,</v>
like security by design,
because the business is saying, "I need this tech.
I saw CES Conference, I'm gonna bring it in
and I'm gonna use it tomorrow morning.
And the CIO was like, "No, no, no, I don't know."
I was like, "What do you mean by you don't know?
Just sit back." Right?
Because you wanna move forward and you want to move fast
and there's a competition, the growth.
So I think that's where the security by design
is gonna become more, I think the seesaw,
which is the big, it's not a regulatory body,
but Center for Information Security.
And they have been pushing for this SBOM,
Software Bill of Material,
which is you should be able to just like you buy...
Actually, my boys also look at the water where it came from,
but no.
But it's the bill of material on everything software.
So you know, how it was tested, how it was coded,
how it was set up, how it was done.
And if you have that SBOM, that changes the game too.
So I think we are gonna see those pressure pretty hard,
moving SBOM, security by design,
so these products are inherently secured.
<v Torrell>Mm-hmm.</v>
<v Jennifer>This is fascinating.</v>
So at C, how many employees do you need?
Or you know, how many do you need?
What type of skills do they need?
<v Torrell>This is also interesting.</v>
<v Jennifer>Do you have lots of open jobs?</v>
<v ->Cheryl is gonna take resume on the-</v>
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>
Like, how does it look from your perspective?
<v ->This is also a great question</v>
because I think it also can be a trap
for a lot of security programs
because they would make this decree
for infinite number of people, resources,
but are those resources deployed at the right problem
that align to the business?
So the first question is kind of what is our mission
and why are we doing what we're doing?
If we're here to manage and mitigate
and kind of de-risk the business strategy
and maintain our current operations, and how do we do that?
What are those critical processes like solutions to do that?
And then this back
into kinda who do we need to get that done
per that demand?
So, for us, I think we are doing a really good job at that.
And then you can leverage these emerging technologies
with kind of AI and automation to handle
kind of the, we call it L1, L1 procedural task.
And then raise expectations for the people you do have,
if it's more constrained resources
to focus on like a much higher-level outcomes
versus just tactical day-to-day things, right?
So, with the emerging technology kind of coming to fruition,
we are able to push some of the tactical day-to-day stuff
to the technology, but elevating the people
to oversee that technology
and then focus on the high-level outcomes.
<v Jennifer>And so are you doing,</v>
like, are you upskilling and training your people?
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v Jennifer>And how are you doing that?</v>
<v ->So Vishal made a credible point earlier</v>
about if you're skating to where the puck is going
and the puck is going to, say, cloud computing
or quantum computing or whatever, application,
whatever you're going to,
largely, you're not gonna find analysts
right outta undergrad to solve that larger problem.
What I do, what I prefer to do
is understand people who are already in cloud computing.
They may be cloud architects.
They may be software reliability engineers.
<v Jennifer>Interesting.</v>
So the ones who have built it.
<v ->Correct.</v>
<v ->Okay.</v>
Designed or craft, okay.
<v ->If there's an upcoming demand for SBOM, Bill of Materials,</v>
how do we get that?
Well, that's just technology integration
into things that they've already been doing to collect that.
So it's more of taking them and re-skilling them
and placing their focus and capabilities
on security focus like topics.
But to do that, I think is you have to build that pathway
to make them kind of want to do that
and then have some sort of career development.
<v Jennifer>So, that's like an investment</v>
inside your company.
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->Like, you know, so making those career pathways</v>
and, you know, continuous learning within your company.
<v ->Yeah, but it also-</v>
<v ->Which takes time and resources.</v>
<v ->But also strategically,</v>
if your security program is aligned to your company,
your company's business, these are the perfect people
to pull into your security program
'cause they intimately understand the company itself.
<v ->And you guys were talking about that</v>
before we came here,
you know, the importance of the employees
understanding the mission.
<v ->Mission correct.</v>
<v Jennifer>And the vision.</v>
Well, let's talk about that a little bit more.
Why does that matter so much?
<v ->I think the big part-</v>
<v ->Does it help them</v>
identify things more easily, like threats or-
<v ->It's definitely, I think it's a multifold</v>
because the security is sitting at this silo,
to some extent.
And I call it we gotta get security
to be on the grownup table a lot of time
because it's sitting on the side table, the kids' table.
And, if they understand the strategy and the mission,
then it starts changing the game.
I've got a very good friend,
she's been CISO for all her life
and she's very business-centric.
And I asked her, "Why did you became business-centric?"
She's like, "I like expensive stuff
and I that's why I wanted to get paid more."
<v Jennifer>Okay.</v>
<v ->"So I started speaking the executive language</v>
and that got me to the strategy table."
But then her team started becoming,
the side effect was
the team feels like we are protecting a mission.
<v Jennifer>Yes.</v>
<v ->So if you are, like we were turn</v>
and I were talking a few minutes ago,
we were doing some work with the hospital and I'm like,
okay, so what exactly are you doing?
And what is exactly the...
Oh, we are doing this security, this, this, this.
I said, "But your CEO wants patient safety."
<v Jennifer>That's right.</v>
<v ->"So what you're doing for patient safety?"</v>
"Oh, we got multifactor authentication."
We don't do, no, no, no.
Let's go back again.
Start from patient safety.
So, the challenge was
because if you're not mission-oriented,
then you're not gonna get the support of the leadership,
then they're gonna say,
"I gotta just keep moving and I'll deal with it." Right?
<v Jennifer>Right, so what it's like moving</v>
from just doing a transactional job
to serving a higher purpose.
<v ->The higher purpose.</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->And I think to build those skills,</v>
back to Torrell, your point, I think
it's thinking from that mission.
And I think if we do mission-based model
and we have seen it, there are models,
what I call it skill to risk.
So what I call it skill to risk
or skill to value kind of model.
It's a model which has been used,
which some of the companies have started doing
because no one is gonna be able to hire talent,
what you need.
But on the other side, after COVID and working remote,
we have ability to hire people,
the best people wherever we want.
I mean, you can be company in Charlotte
and you can have someone working from California
and they don't have to be there, right?
So skill to risk model, that's what I call it.
So if you understand where your biggest risks are,
whether it is, hey, I'm a health tech company,
and we tell everyone, "Give us your data and trust us."
Because people are giving you their data
to know all thing about your health
and what they care most about.
If that data goes out in public and knows everyone-
<v Jennifer>Right, so like for example, like an EMR,</v>
like an electronic medical record.
<v ->Think about like your health tech devices</v>
we were talking about, right?
<v ->Yes, we were.</v>
<v ->They know your blood pressure,</v>
what happens to your blood pressure, what makes you this.
You can do anything you want.
So people are giving that information
because they expect secrecy and trust.
That trust is based on keeping its secrecy.
So when you drive the skill to risk model is
you understand your mission,
you understand what your risks are,
and you hire to the skills, hire skills
which require to manage that risk.
And then the lower risk things,
you can start looking at talent globally like offshoring,
outsourcing, whatever you want to do,
and then you can outsource certain things.
And what we have seen is the companies
who start moving skill to risk model,
they train talent better
because they are training for a mission,
and those people can go into other career fields also,
like becoming a CTO and other career path.
They are not just-
<v ->Stuck in, yeah.</v>
<v ->Just look at protector, protector.</v>
I get it. But why?
And the second thing we start seeing is actually
the talent demand.
The talent needed is going down generally
goes down by 20 to 30%.
So we have seen companies go reduce their talent need by 30%
because they are hiring for skill to risk.
<v ->Okay.</v>
<v ->And the medium risk one,</v>
okay, what I need to do.
Okay, I can outsource or something.
And this one, that's okay.
I understand it's there.
I don't need to go manage everything
because that risk is so low, who cares?
<v Jennifer>Okay.</v>
<v ->Versus trying to be like we were working with one client,</v>
it's like back to this RiskGPS we were doing.
And like, but can you find out if anyone,
one of my servers is patched?
I'm like, what is on that server is more important
before you worry about whether that server,
that machine is patched or not.
<v Jennifer>Okay. Was there vital information on it?</v>
<v ->Yeah, if you don't.</v>
So firstly, understanding the skill to risk
is firstly understand where my risk is,
what the ecosystem I need to protect,
what mission I need to protect,
and then creating job description based on that,
and then hiring the talent,
that starts the strategy from top down.
<v ->I love that kind of motto.</v>
And as you were talking, I was kind of categorizing,
it's like three different sectors, right?
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->The skill to risk and to summarize the first group</v>
of like highly skilled people.
The thing that highly skilled people love the most
is purpose, right?
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->And if your strategy is aligned to the business,</v>
it gives them a vision and a purpose
for why they're doing what they're doing.
And that medium tier is your partner collaboration.
Like who are your partners
that help you solve those medium risk?
And then below that, your AI and automation, right?
So I love that.
<v ->I like that phrase too.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v Jennifer>Like I'm always amazed</v>
how the time goes by so quickly.
<v ->Wow.</v>
<v ->So we have nine minutes.</v>
And I do wanna take a few questions, if there are.
<v ->Sure.</v>
<v ->Let's talk about the entry level and like talent</v>
that's coming in.
In Northern Virginia, just by way of background,
George Mason University is the largest university
in our state, and they were the first in our state
to have a cybersecurity degree.
Am I right on that?
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>
And so in our region,
because of the collaboration
with a lot of our government agencies,
there's been a need to have this curriculum.
And I think the school graduates
a few thousand students a year.
How can we get more students to,
you know, pursue a degree in cyber
or, you know, pursue an apprenticeship in cyber?
Do you think that we should have increased awareness
about this career path?
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
<v ->We have a need for more people to study it, right?</v>
<v ->Yeah, I think it's absolutely needed.</v>
And I agree with what you're saying.
I would say not because we are associated with you
in Northern Virginia Techno,
but I think what we are in Northern Virginia,
we need to do more in other states.
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->Because you have created a collaboration</v>
between industry and the academia.
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->Right?</v>
So that's the number one important aspect.
The third big collaboration is you gotta bring
the government into it
because there have a lot of demand,
but there are also a lot of things which are happening,
which they can motivate in terms of how government
is trying to dive into the school education system.
So we are still doing George Mason,
and I wanna go back to schools actually.
So, when I was building, this is for Deloitte,
I was building their offshore,
their delivery capability centers around the world.
We used to hire people and someone will come,
"Oh, I just do IBM, XYZ product."
And you, so, "No, no.
Tomorrow we are gonna work with this product
and I will put them in the team and four weeks later,
they are back to IBM XYZ.
So I started saying like,
"Okay, I got a lot of people who are like a,
they adjust their hammer for a nail.
And if it's a three-inch nail,
then they don't know what to do with it.
<v ->Okay.</v>
<v ->How we shifted</v>
and what we did was exactly what you talked about.
We shifted everything to bring people from campus,
and then have a very structured hands-on training program
for six weeks, like a bootcamp.
You put them through the process
and work through their model, put them into the training,
and when they come out,
they understand a lot more about cyber.
And then what I call it,
it's more like a hourglass kind of a career model.
Don't start with getting into the swim lane quickly,
but start broad and then slowly you learn everything
and then you become more mission-oriented,
you understand the risk, you understand criminal behavior,
criminal thinking versus saying,
"I understand how to find hacker."
Okay, what are you gonna do after that?
"I don't know. That team.
<v ->Okay.</v>
<v ->No, you gotta understand.</v>
So I think we are seeing that model
played out in Northern Virginia.
And actually there are about two countries
and I'm connected with one.
Israel, I do work with a lot of their cyber product too.
Israel and Estonia.
Those are two countries actually
who are famous for building cyber talent from ground up.
<v ->Really?</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>
They have built that model very unique.
And it's basically exactly on those.
They have a...
Educate all the way from school time,
all the way to the college,
cyber is part of the curriculum, basic education
and then you go deep.
Very strong cross collaboration
between the government, academia
and industry councils like NVTC,
and then lot more investment on hands-on training.
You look at most of the cyber product companies
from Israel, a lot of those people actually work
in Israel Army.
<v ->Okay, okay.</v>
<v ->Most of these CISOs work from there.</v>
And even on our side,
if you look at some of the phenomenal companies,
I think you and I were talking about,
like CrowdStrike and MiniAn,
these companies were started by people
who came from that mission thinking of how to deal with it,
so that's why they, they moved so fast
because they're trying to deal.
So I think that's the collaborate hands-on training.
So I think those three aspect
of cross collaboration, education
and then last one I would say is constantly upskilling
because if we depend too much on AI, that is the challenge,
we are gonna get it.
Oh, AI will figure it out.
I can do this.
Pretty soon, we're gonna be like, okay.
But the AI is what I call, it's a very deterministic model.
You do A plus B equal to C.
The criminal operate on a probabilistic model.
Okay, what is the probability this person
is not gonna watch this so I go attack them?
<v Jennifer>Right.</v>
<v ->So we need that critical thinking</v>
and stuff into the model.
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>
Good, good.
All right, are there any questions from the audience?
Feel free to come up to the mic.
<v Participant>So a more basic question,</v>
just is there enough technology people
to fill all the roles?
Or is it a question of people
just don't wanna do cybersecurity work?
So I'm an IP and IT council.
So from the IP side, I've noticed I've lost a lot of people.
Well, I don't say I personally,
but the industry has lost a lot of people
where traditionally if you didn't wanna work in research
or industry, patents were like a side branch.
But now we're losing a lot of people
to private equity and venture capitalists
because they're using those skills.
It's very valuable for those guys.
And so, we're seeing a shift from,
instead of just being a patent attorney,
it's like, okay, I could be working venture capital
or I could be a patent attorney,
and so you've cut down the pool of people by 50%.
<v ->Wow.</v>
<v Participant>So I'm just throwing numbers out there,</v>
but are you seeing something similar in your profession
that either people are being shunted off
to different professions
or they don't wanna do cybersecurity work?
<v ->I have an opinion, but I'll let Torrell start with that.</v>
<v ->Honestly, because I think that's like a, I don't know,</v>
a complex question.
So I think the people that are very successful
in cybersecurity
are normally those high agency IT professionals.
But what comes with that is like a seven-post accountability
that makes them susceptible to burnout, right?
So you have really good people that come into cybersecurity
that kind of burn out.
But to directly answer your question,
I think that if we changed the problem
from a cybersecurity technology problem
to like an innovation problem,
I think we have better candidates of selling the innovation
and opportunity to innovate and solve
and within a very dynamic space.
I think it solves that problem.
I think if we try to scope it to cybersecurity,
you run into that problem, but-
<v ->So position the career-</v>
<v ->As innovative.</v>
<v ->As one that's innovative and solving problems</v>
and evolving, and it has a creative aspect to it.
<v ->Correct, yeah, correct.</v>
<v ->Yeah, but I mean, from what I'm reading, what I see,</v>
we don't have enough workers.
So there's so many strategies to attack that.
And in our region, there's many approaches,
but is getting industry and government
involved with the academic aspect?
But then also, we have to start in high school.
And like what we do as a tech council,
we work with our regional school districts
and we have career exploration days.
We bring the students to the offices,
we bring some of the staff to the classrooms,
so that they understand that these careers are available.
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->So, it's a challenge,</v>
but we have to encourage more kids to pursue,
you know, jobs in tech.
So anyway, go ahead.
<v Participant>I have a question.</v>
At Internet 2.0, Michael Kove had mentioned
in a conversation with Microsoft that due generative AI,
85% of the software engineers were no longer required.
So my suggestion or question is,
are you looking to leverage all of those engineers
losing their jobs to copilot,
to turn them into security professionals.
Because that would be phenomenal.
<v ->I don't know if they will lose the job.</v>
I still don't believe it because I think we are,
with a bunch of people, I'm sure in this room,
where we have seen the dot-com days, right?
It took 7, 8, 10 years before we realized the power of it
and then we needed all those skills.
I think we are with AI like version 0.1 or 0.5,
whatever you wanna call it.
We don't even know where it is gonna go.
So it's gonna take more people
with a lot of critical thinking skills.
And I think that's where, back to when Torrell was saying
that the security by design.
So we're gonna see, I completely agree with you.
In my view, even one of the reason
when I moved out of my big four and building my company,
I bring, I've got software developers, engineer, consultant,
and someone who has been in industry,
all four just attacking one single problem.
And you will always find much better solution
when you have the diversity of skillset.
So I completely agree with you.
The more diverse skillset we bring,
we are gonna be much better
because the hackers do the same thing, right?
I call it, I do a talk "Thinking Like a Criminal,"
but I use actually how many,
I'm sure "Ocean's Eleven" movie.
I use that as a framework.
And we have analyzed that framework.
It did not require one person, it required 11,
and those 11 had 11 unique skills to make that crime happen.
And so same way, we need to be thinking on the other side is
where I need to bring developer engineer.
And back to your point and what you were saying,
that will also create very interesting career models
because then you don't have to remain
just in a cyber field over time.
You may go become a CTO.
You may go become a product lead
because you understand how things are built from bottom up.
So I agree with you.
I think more engineers we can bring in,
but statistically the numbers are anywhere from like,
I think what Jen mentioned earlier, like half a million
to a couple of million people shortage.
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Great point.</v>
<v Torrell>Yeah, if this does happen,</v>
I would definitely welcome it.
<v Jennifer>Yeah.</v>
<v Crew>No, actually.</v>
<v Jennifer>Can we take one more question?</v>
<v ->No.</v>
<v ->No?</v>
Okay. Well, thank you all for being here with us
and I hope you enjoyed the last two days of CES,
day and a half.
