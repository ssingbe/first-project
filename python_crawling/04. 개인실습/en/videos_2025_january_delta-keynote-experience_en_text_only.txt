<v Announcer>Please welcome</v>
CEO of the Consumer Technology Association, Gary Shapiro.
<v ->Wow.</v>
This is incredible.
I am so thrilled to be here introducing a keynote at Sphere
for the first time in CES history.
And it's so fitting to do so
with Delta Airlines CEO Ed Bastian this year.
Just like CTA...
I know the applause line. It's Ed Bastian.
But we're lucky because just like CTA,
Delta is celebrating its centennial,
a century of innovation,
and also looking ahead for the next 100 years.
At CES 2020, Delta and Ed joined us in the main stage
for the first-ever keynote by an aviation company
highlighting the power of technology to move every industry,
every turn for CES 2023
to share the transformative power of human connection
and how Delta uses creativity, personalization,
and humanity to win customers' hearts and their minds.
And now I'm so thrilled to welcome him back
to share the airline's vision for technology
that enriches the human experience
today, tomorrow, and for the next 100 years.
It uses powerful AI capabilities
to create an accessible, tech-forward vision
for the future of travel.
You know, I had the chance to work with Ed
while writing my latest book, "Pivot or Die,"
and realized that we share some core beliefs.
We both recognize the importance of being open-minded,
trying something new, and not fearing the unknown.
And we both believe
that people are at the heart of every business.
As CEO of Delta and a 25-year veteran of the company,
Ed knows that doesn't just mean
Delta's customers or shareholders.
He's also thinking about the thousands of Delta employees
who are here tonight and who are back home.
I appreciate Delta employees.
This body's made of Delta food.
But you as the employees are the ones whose buy-in he needs
to make the changes and pivots
that are necessary to succeed.
And the millions of people who, like me,
step foot on a Delta plane
almost every month, every day, or every week,
and thanks to Ed Bastian's leadership,
Delta is making the world a little smaller
and creating human connections
that will transform global travel.
Let's take a look.
<v Viola>As human beings, we share an instinctive need</v>
to constantly look forward.
With each launch, the dream of distant places
ignites the desire to explore,
connect, and let the imagination soar.
With every flight, we become closer to each other
and to ourselves.
<v Announcer>Please welcome Emmy, Grammy, Tony,</v>
and Academy Award-winning actress Viola Davis.
<v ->Have I got a story for you,</v>
a story 100 years in the making, made possible by you,
the believers, the backers,
the champions who gave Delta the wings to fly even higher.
We've been connecting the world for a century now,
beating the odds, breaking barriers,
and flying in a class all our own
because like history has taught us,
there's nothing we can't do.
Whether blue skies or storm clouds,
nothing can ground the people
who have fueled us for a century.
Our indomitable spirit has propelled us forward
and defined the Delta difference decade after decade.
When times are tough, we're tougher.
When they say slow down, we say catch up.
And when they say it's impossible,
we say, sit back, relax, and enjoy the flight.
We'll never stop reaching for the skies
and shooting for the stars.
It's just who we are.
This is Delta.
And for 100 years and 100 more, we'll never stop climbing.
Over the long course of 100 years, you learn some things,
and one of the things we've learned
is that while others might use a big centennial moment
like ours to look back, at Delta, we look up.
Because while some say having your head in the clouds
is a bad thing, we say it's what dreamers do.
At Delta, this kind of imagination is a fuel
that's propelled us through the years.
It's how we thought beyond our first lone crop duster
in Macon, Georgia
all the way to becoming the longest-running US airline,
bringing you to every corner of the globe.
It's how we pioneered the first hub and spoke model
to help a world flourish,
not least of which was our home of Atlanta.
It's what inspired the DC-8,
the first jet to get you places faster
so you could spend more time
with the people you're going to see.
It's why we introduced fast free wifi,
because connecting you from anywhere to everywhere
has always been our ultimate destination.
Remember, it wasn't that long ago
that flight itself was impossible,
and yet now we know that no single innovation
has bound the world closer together,
getting people out to learn more,
to see more, to experience more
so we can all be together more too.
Now imagine where the next 100 years will take us from here.
And now please welcome to the stage Delta CEO Ed Bastian.
<v ->Thank you, thank you, thank you. What a great night.</v>
Well, welcome to the Sphere.
This is gonna be an amazing, amazing evening for us all.
But before we start,
please join me in a round of applause for Viola Davis.
Viola was just awarded...
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Viola was just awarded
the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's highest honor
at Sunday night's Golden Globes,
a testament to her longstanding impact
on the entertainment industry.
Congratulations, Viola.
And I want to thank all of you
for joining us on this journey today
through travels past, present, and its future.
Our Delta story began a century ago
near the dawn of commercial flight.
This is a story of how unparalleled innovation,
technological advancements,
and fearless thinking changed the world.
Well, most of all, it's a story of what can be accomplished
when you always put your values front and center.
For the past 100 years,
Delta has been driven by a simple mandate,
always put people first in everything that we do.
And it's as true today as it was in 1925
when the very first Delta pilots took to the skies.
Those values carried us
from being a tiny startup crop duster
to a global airline connecting the vast world.
We can only imagine how exciting
the world must have seemed a century ago.
Could you imagine?
The very concept of powered flight was only a few years old,
but this brand new technology,
it carried the promise of changing the world.
Traversing the skies at high speed created opportunities
that would've been impossible in the days of rail and ships.
It brought people and communities together
as never before in human history.
And it feels similar today.
New marvels like AI, the digital revolution,
and innovations in sustainability
are giving us incredible tools
to transform the travel experience.
But amid the wonder of new technology,
we've always understood that the entire point of innovation
is to lift people up.
As Viola so beautifully said,
that mandate to always put people first
continues to drive us forward,
just as it has for the past 100 years.
And it's not just the people we serve,
but the people who serve,
people like these, our great Delta employees.
The technician working below wing
to maintain our reliability
or the flight attendant who recognizes that customer
reaching their one millionth mile
or the reservation agent who's there,
ready to care for you as your plans change.
They are the history makers, the innovators,
and the champions of human connection.
They define what we're all about,
what welcoming, elevated, and caring really means.
And we feel their contributions reverberate through our past
and they carry us into our bright future.
And so I want to stop and take a moment
to celebrate a few of these people,
people like Diane Carvelli,
who together with her late colleagues, Jenny...
Yes.
Who together with her late colleagues,
Jenny Oxford and Gene Owens, led a grassroots effort in 1982
to buy an incredible gift for our airline,
our very first Boeing 767 aircraft.
Now, let me say that again.
Our very first Boeing 767 was purchased by our own people
and then gifted to our airline
during a troubled financial period.
That plane became known as the Spirit of Delta.
Thank you, Diane, for being here this evening.
People like Dana Nelson,
the first Black female pilot hired by Delta.
First Officer Nelson, thank you for all you've done
for breaking barriers in aviation.
And people like James Sarvis,
who served Delta for over 50 years
in a number of vital positions.
So good to see you here, James.
For your five decades of service to Delta, we thank you.
And finally, people like Joan Crandall.
Joan, another one of our legendary Delta flight attendants,
recently celebrated 65 years of service to Delta.
Joan, thank you for your dedication to our customers
and for the example that you have set
for so many of us at Delta.
These are the Delta professionals
that have written our story.
They embody our values, our culture, our history,
and they've helped build a foundation
that's going to power our next 100 years.
Thanks again to each of you.
<v ->Now we have to insert propeller blades to the hub.</v>
<v Viola>As we fly across continents and cultures</v>
toward adventures and achievements,
through times of turbulence and triumph,
we are propelled by curiosity
and a deep desire to forge bonds that transcend borders.
<v ->You did it.</v>
Yes. Great job.
<v Viola>With childlike wonder, we travel everywhere</v>
and imagine a world where everything is possible.
<v ->As we take flight,</v>
technology is transforming the way we travel,
with AI at the forefront of shaping our future.
But at Delta, it's not technology for technology's sake. No.
It's always about putting people first.
We call it innovating with heart,
using technology to create premium experiences
with humanity at the core.
Compared to a century ago,
our ability to innovate has grown exponentially
thanks to better data and smarter tools.
That helps us make a difference
at more points along your journey than ever before.
Today, you expect travel that feels tailored to you.
The goal is to create a seamless connected travel experience
from start to finish.
That's why we work with partners,
including rideshare providers
who serve the first and last miles of your trip.
Joby, which promises to bring
a new mode of transportation to market and wheels up
where elevated private solutions
complement Delta's premium service,
it all creates more choice for customers
to get to their destination
in a way that works best for them.
So how can we use AI to help each of you connect
more meaningfully at each step?
How can we couple it with human ingenuity, imagination,
and the world's most on-time airline?
The possibilities really are endless.
This evening,
we'll focus on four key moments along the journey
where we see opportunity for great innovation.
First, embedding modern technology
to power and enhance the operational experience.
Delta already is the world's most reliable airline,
but we're raising the bar even higher for you.
Second, convening partners
to create new means of seamless travel
that enable greater access and ease.
Third, re-imagining how you spend your time on board
and how we show our loyalty back to you.
And finally, bringing the world closer together
by unlocking more access to international travel
through new fleet technologies.
But let's begin with you.
It's critical that we have a deep understanding
of how you like to travel
and we're working with leaders in data and insights
to do just that,
to share more about how we're turning your feedback
into meaningful moments throughout your journey.
Please welcome to the stage the co-founder
and executive chairman of Qualtrics, Mr. Ryan Smith,
and one of our own iconic Delta flight attendants,
Jeanie Brady.
Well, Ryan and Jeanie...
Jeanie, you got your fan club already out there.
Including on stage.
Well, Ryan and Jeanie, thank you for joining us.
Ryan, Qualtrics is the leader in experience management
and has been an amazing partner for Delta,
helping us use data to better understand our customers.
Ryan, could you start to describe how we're using feedback
to shape the future of travel?
<v ->Well, thanks, Ed.</v>
It's been incredible to be a partner with Delta
for some time now,
but it really boils down to experience.
Experience is actually the currency of business today
and the travel experiences that Delta provides at scale,
you're clearly setting yourself apart.
Last year at Qualtrics,
we looked at nearly 7 million records of feedback
from Delta customers to identify the areas
which people actually care about the most.
And nobody's doing this at the scale that Delta is
across the global network
with nearly 200 million travelers that you serve each year.
Delta is clearly the leader,
but this experience data, the feedback that we're collecting
is critical to unlocking how Delta can meaningfully connect
with customers, exceed their expectations,
and ultimately anticipate their needs.
This anticipate word, anticipate the needs
to transform the whole travel experience,
because truly knowing customers better,
it really should mean that in turn, you're recognizing them
and you're improving that experience
as they move through each leg of the journey.
<v ->That's so perfect, Ryan,</v>
and you described the journey that we're on together
and it is a long journey.
Jeanie, you've been on our journey
for a while together with us.
Can you share your perspective about that?
<v ->Thank you, Ed.</v>
Every customer that walks through our boarding door
has a unique story.
As flight attendants, we hear those stories every day
and Ryan makes a great point about recognition.
It's not just about recognizing a birthday,
it's about making every moment they spend on Delta
feel welcoming, elevated, and caring.
As Ed said, it's in our DNA at Delta.
And if you take million milers as an example,
And what do all those customers,
those million miler customers have in common?
They all started at zero.
That's a lot of moments
through their travel history at Delta
where we have an opportunity to recognize
and celebrate them.
That data helps empower our frontline team members,
create moments of magic in real time
and in a way that fits that occasion.
Those million milers,
it first started with a handwritten card
and now it's developed into a full-blown program
at multi-level delivered by Delta people.
A handwritten note or card, it could be a small gift,
an announcement onboard, and so much more.
So think about it, if we take that concept, that idea,
and you now move it to moments, more moments,
if there was a digital continuity
in which that check encounter looks at that customer
and know exactly what their story is
and that transfers over to the gate agent
in the boarding house and they know how to treat 'em
and then they come on board our airplane
and all of us as flight attendants,
we know exactly how to celebrate them or care for them.
That is the opportunity ahead to go above and beyond
and it's exciting.
<v ->And you are so right, Jeanie,</v>
and that is the Delta difference right there.
While feedback informs the experience today,
there is much more we can and will be doing
in the years ahead
to deepen the connections that we're making
and give you all control over
how your experience is personalized.
Ryan, this isn't a futuristic vision.
This is something we're already starting on today.
<v ->Yeah, everything we're working on together</v>
is about these personalized moments
and you know, how do you deliver them in an individualized,
highly contextual experience at scale?
It's easy when it's one to a few.
It's hard when it's one to many as in 200 million.
So above all, what people want and what we're finding out,
people want to be seen, as you described.
And so we're combining intelligent listening
with the AI that we're working on together
to unlock new ways to deliver these elevated moments
while maintaining a personal touch
that Delta is known for all over the world.
For example, many of you in the audience
are traveling here on business,
but what if you were traveling for another reason?
What if it was for a honeymoon or a job interview
or your first mile or even your 15 millionth mile?
How might Delta act on that to change your experience
and meet you where you are on your journey
and actually make you feel understood?
In some ways, we're already doing this and Delta's a leader,
but what if we were to build in,
as you were describing, Jeanie, from the ground up,
what if you could let Delta know yourself,
how you're feeling, how you actually want to be cared for?
This is the opportunity that we're unlocking together
through AI and it's the years ahead
that we're looking forward to,
because that is what's making every single interaction
feel personal.
And Jeanie, I know you've seen the impact of this already.
<v ->Yeah.</v>
Last Friday, I was flying my trip Atlanta to Honolulu
and there were two customers who crossed over on that flight
to their millionth mile
and we had a great time celebrating them,
a honeymoon couple.
Then we had another couple
celebrating their 50th anniversary
and they brought their whole family on that flight
and that was wonderful to celebrate 'em.
In the future,
that connectivity between customer and employee tools
will help us proactively understand
how to create those moments of magic or moments of care
from the very start of their journey.
It's powerful to think about
and we think it's gonna transform the travel experience
as we move forward with human connection at the center.
<v ->Ryan and Jeanie are so right</v>
and we have an amazing opportunity to use data
and new technologies powered by AI
to preserve these moments, not disrupt them.
It's a reinforcement of Delta's commitment
to putting our customers at the center of our business.
Ryan and Jeanie, thank you for what you're doing.
Appreciate you being here with us today.
<v ->Thanks, Ed.</v>
<v ->Thank you.</v>
<v ->What feedback has also shown us is more than anything</v>
is how much you value your time
and specifically being on time.
For any given flight,
a series of carefully curated steps
must go exactly according to plan,
from inbound planes and crews and bags
to catering, connecting passengers, predicting the weather,
and everything in between.
At Delta, those steps happen over 5,000 times
each and every day.
But the center of all that is you, the Delta customer.
So how do we preserve that promise of reliability
and give you more control over your journey?
How do you create space for more meaningful connections?
Well, it starts with thinking differently
about how we blend the digital and physical experiences,
beginning with the Fly Delta app.
We know our customers count on the Fly Delta app
from home to airport and beyond.
In fact, in 2024,
we saw roughly 1.3 billion interactions in the app.
It's amazing number.
More than 97% of SkyMiles Medallion members use their app
as the go-to companion during travel.
And in 2025, we intend to make that even better
with an industry-leading experience
that we're calling, stay for it, Delta Concierge.
That's an announcement. Okay?
Delta Concierge.
Delta Concierge will serve as a thread
across your experience,
a Gen AI-powered personal assistant
that anticipates your needs, provides real-time guidance,
and delivers tailored recommendations,
combining the context of who you are
and how you travel with the deep knowledge and insights
that we've already built
as the world's most reliable airline.
Soon, elements of Delta Concierge will be available
across all our digital and onboard channels
and in the hands of our reservation agents,
making their ability to assist you even better.
Let's take a closer look at how we envision Delta Concierge
connecting your day of travel.
In a few moments, we'll meet Eve.
Eve is a few years into the future,
preparing for a business trip to Tokyo.
As she prepares for her trip, Delta is preparing for her.
Through AI and the Delta team,
we are anticipating her every need
to ensure her day of travel is not only seamless,
but also reaps the benefits of her SkyMiles membership.
<v Concierge>Good morning, Eve.</v>
We look forward to welcoming you aboard your flight today.
<v ->Great.</v>
I'll be ready to leave soon.
<v Concierge>Traffic to the airport is heavy.</v>
Time by car is 90 minutes.
Would you like to request a Joby flight?
Journey time is 10 minutes.
<v ->Oh, yes, please. Let's grab a Joby.</v>
<v Concierge>Joby confirmed.</v>
<v ->Delta Concierge uses Gen AI and voice processing</v>
to listen, understand, and then respond intelligently
to our customers' unique needs in real time.
Delta Concierge helped ensure that Eve's journey
to the airport was free of any stress.
It checked to make sure her passport is current
and whether she requires any additional travel documents.
It can even book end-to-end travel on her behalf
using only her voice.
Now, as we saw, Eve is running tight on time,
so taking a car is not gonna be an option.
Guess what?
Delta Concierge is already working on an alternate solution,
a Joby, a new breed of electric vehicle
vertical takeoff and landing aircraft,
which can get her to the airport
in a short fraction of the time.
Pretty cool, huh? I wish we had that in New York today.
All Eve needs to do is to ask Delta Concierge
to confirm the Joby and off she goes.
That's incredible.
Gary Shapiro, I think we need to get some
at the next CES in Vegas to be able to get us around
the mean streets of Las Vegas a lot easier.
Next year's conference.
Joby is going to transform
how we move through the travel experience,
and it's not a distant future that we're talking about.
We expect Joby to be flying in the next couple of years,
beginning with our service to Los Angeles and New York City.
And we're happy that the executive chairman of Joby,
Paul Sciarra, is with us here today.
Hey, Paul. Good to see you.
Thank you for being here.
Appreciate all you're doing at Joby. But back to Eve.
She's now arrived at the airport and Delta Concierge
has been preparing her travel in advance.
So the next steps are simple.
<v Narrator>Having dodged the traffic with a Joby,</v>
Eve heads straight to bag drop.
Using AR wayfinding,
Delta Concierge shows her exactly where she needs to go,
and Eve won't need to worry about her bag.
A permanent digital bag tag means
she can track her luggage in real time.
Delta Concierge will let Eve know
which gate she's flying from.
And by using biometrics and connected digital tools,
fumbling for documents will become a thing of the past,
meaning Eve can breeze through security
without breaking her stride.
A seamless airport experience means more time for Eve
to connect with loved ones before boarding her flight.
<v ->Hey, sweetie.</v>
<v ->Hi, Mommy.</v>
<v ->How are you?</v>
<v ->I'm good.</v>
Are you at the airport already?
<v ->I'm at the airport now.</v>
<v ->When are you coming back?</v>
<v ->I'll see you when I come back this weekend. Okay?</v>
<v ->Okay, I love you. Bye.</v>
<v ->Bye.</v>
<v Captain>Good morning.</v>
This is Captain Nelson in the flight deck.
From all of us in the Delta family,
it's our pleasure to have you on board.
<v ->Well, we just saw how Delta Concierge</v>
made Eve's airport experience pressure-free
by taking away the need for her to keep an eye on her clock,
but that commitment to an effortless travel experience
doesn't just stop at her departure airport.
If Eve has to take a connecting flight on her journey
to her destination,
Delta's AI-driven technology is ready to help.
Our systems analyze real-time arrival and departure data
to assign gates that bring customers even closer
to their connecting flights
that dramatically reduces the time you need
between connections.
Throughout her journey, Delta is using technology
to give Eve her time back, creating moments of connection
and delivering safe, secure travel
that protects her wellbeing.
It also enables us to personalize Eve's in-fight journey
with our best-in-class seatback screens and Delta Sync.
<v Narrator>Thank you for flying Delta.</v>
Log in with SkyMiles to your personalized onboard experience
via Delta Sync seatback from the moment you sit down
and enjoy everything from trip planning
to curated content at your fingertips.
To get started, real-time live translation will ensure
we're always speaking your language.
Tap into our onboard experience planner
to check out new wellness tools
and customize your food and beverage experience.
Then explore your recommendations from Delta Concierge
to take the hassle out of planning
and enjoy your destination as soon as you land.
When it's almost time to touch down,
arrival mode makes the moments after landing a breeze.
Get directions through the airport
and make sure your rideshare is ready when you are.
Now sit back, relax, and thank you again for choosing Delta.
<v ->Since we announced fast free wifi on Delta two years ago,</v>
millions of customers have signed on
to become SkyMiles members and access this great benefit,
which we expect will be completely rolled out
through our entire global system this year,
and millions more access Delta Sync on our seatback screens.
We have over 165,000 screens flying each and every day.
That's a heck of a movie change,
far more than any other airline,
providing endless opportunities
to give our customers new content.
Whether through Delta Sync wifi
or our industry-leading seatback screens,
we pride ourselves on giving customers content
that feels personal and meets you where you are.
And that's why we're announcing today
an exclusive partnership with a company
that knows content better than anyone else.
You guessed, YouTube.
Yes.
Beginning this year, YouTube will be the newest partner
to join Delta Sync exclusively.
Joining me to tell us more,
please welcome YouTube's Chief Business Officer,
Mary Ellen Coe.
<v ->Thank you so much for being with us.</v>
Well, Mary Ellen, we are so thrilled
to kick off our partnership with YouTube
beginning this year on Delta Sync.
Can you share with the audience
something about our partnership?
<v ->Yeah.</v>
Well, Ed, we are so thrilled
to be working with you and the team
and we know Delta is first in class
in how you prioritize your customers,
and that is so consistent
with how we think about our creators.
They're at the center of everything we do.
So what a great way to bring our missions together
to be able to bring your customers, Delta's customers,
the fantastic creator and content experience of YouTube.
Creators are producing the must-see TV of today
and viewers no longer distinguish
between content from traditional studios
and creator-led content.
They turn to YouTube for all of it,
whether it's episodic series, sports highlights,
podcasts, music performances.
And since the very first upload,
YouTube has opened up whole new ways for viewers
to get access to that content, any screen, anywhere,
and now even when you're in the air on a plane.
<v ->That's awesome.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>
So that's why we're so excited to partner with Delta
to bring YouTube's fantastic creators and content
in a highly curated way, unique and only for Delta's
in-flight entertainment ecosystem.
Through our partnership, Delta customers will be able
to enjoy our favorite creators, podcasts, music,
a wide variety of music artists, and all of this ads-free.
<v Ed>Ad-free, that's great. You heard that.</v>
<v ->Ads-free.
And that's all on personal devices
or on Delta seatback experience.
Even better, and this is the really exciting part,
we will be providing all Delta customers a free trial
of YouTube Music and Premium
that you can use even beyond travel.
<v ->Wow, that's awesome.</v>
Thank you, Mary Ellen.
Access to entertainment is really key
to having an enjoyable travel experience.
What role have you seen YouTube play
in the travel experiences to date?
<v ->Yeah.</v>
Well, personally, I really love catching up
on my favorite content or podcasts when I'm traveling
and I travel a lot and I know that I'm not unique.
So our creators provide just a fantastic viewing experience
and they take viewers along the road and along for the ride
and behind the scenes.
So just as an example, the Paris Olympics.
So we sent creators to the Paris Olympics.
Their fans loved to watch some of the games
and the events through their favorite creators,
but they also traveled all around Paris.
They unlocked new restaurants, underground restaurants,
new cafes, found all new ways to travel and tour the city.
So this is just a simple example.
We used to pick up books to travel, right?
And to get recommendations.
Now people experience that
through their favorite YouTube creator.
<v ->That's so cool.</v>
Okay, one more for the audience
and I'm sure all of our folks are here dying to know.
What is your go-to in-flight entertainment pick?
<v ->I don't think you're asking about email.</v>
<v ->I'm not asking about email.</v>
<v ->No. All right.</v>
Okay. I have a hot tip.
Sean Evans, Hot Ones.
<v ->Sean Evans.</v>
<v ->Fantastic interviews. That's the hot tip of the night.</v>
<v ->Good. Well, that's awesome.</v>
And I want to thank Mary Ellen for being with us tonight.
YouTube coming exclusively to Delta this year.
I could not think of a better way
to pass through an enjoyable trip.
Thank you, Mary Ellen.
<v ->So excited.</v>
<v ->Thank you.</v>
<v ->Thanks.</v>
<v ->Now, it's not enough to ensure that customers enjoy</v>
a personalized and seamless travel experience.
We also are exploring
how new partnerships can support customers' wellbeing too.
For example, Fount's FlyKitt is a complete jet lag solution
designed to help travelers adjust to new time zones
and feel refreshed upon arrival.
I'm sure some of our international guests here tonight
could be using some of that.
We'll be partnering with Fount later this year
to provide FlyKitts to our customers.
We're also working with SkyView's
circadian light technology, which aligns cabin lighting
with passengers' natural rhythms
to reduce jet lag during and after the flight.
And in 2025, we are launching a brand new series
exclusively available on Delta onboard
called "Well Traveled."
And it's designed to show you how to integrate wellness
into every flight you take.
Its host is someone who was charged with the responsibility
of performing at the top of his game
immediately after traveling,
no matter how far he had just flown.
Our host is with us here tonight
to give us a glimpse of what he's got in store.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage
seven-time Super Bowl winner, Tom Brady.
Tom, it's so great to be here,
especially since this is now one of your new towns
as one of the newest owners of the Las Vegas Raiders.
<v ->Thanks, Ed. I appreciate it.</v>
Thank you guys so much.
<v ->And do we have any Raiders fans tonight?</v>
<v ->How many Raider fans have we got in here?</v>
<v ->Okay, we got some.</v>
Now, as many of you know, Tom has finishing his first year
as an NFL announcer.
And by the way, I think you're doing an awesome job.
<v ->Thank you.</v>
<v ->I'm biased, but I do believe that.</v>
Now, how many miles a season would you say you fly?
<v ->A lot. I used to fly about half the time.</v>
So many of the games we had when I was playing,
they were home games.
But now as a broadcaster,
I'm basically on the road every single weekend,
which is really fun,
except when I go to some of these tough road environments
that heckle me every week.
But that's not that important right now.
Sorry for getting off topic.
<v ->That's okay.</v>
But you still manage to look so fresh. What's the secret?
<v ->I can't give you all the secrets.</v>
For that, you're gonna have to tune into "Well Traveled,"
my new travel show coming to Delta in 2025.
But I can give you my top three travel hacks.
You guys wanna hear those?
<v ->You're gonna give 'em to us? Okay, let's go.</v>
What's first?
<v ->All right, first up, hydration.</v>
I always make sure to have my electrolyte hydration packs
on hand and I'm well hydrated when I'm on the plane always.
I even bring my own water canteen.
You know that. You played a lot of golf with me.
I kind of tote it around.
It's never too far from when I need it
and it always helps me stay fresh.
It helps me stay energized
and as soon as I land, I'm ready to take on the day,
whether it's meetings, very cool events like this,
or even prepping for Sunday's game.
<v ->Okay, then.</v>
That's just one. What's next?
So next up, taking care of your physical health,
because my routine, it was always so important to me
and working out every day was crucial.
And even as I spent all my career on the field and training
and competing at the highest level was so important.
So working out, it's always been a great part of my life
and it really could be anything for us now.
I'm certainly retired.
I don't have to work out quite as hard as I used to.
But hiking, swimming, biking, just even a simple walk.
And I try to do those things in the morning
when I have the most energy before the kids wake up.
So today I woke up pretty early. I knew I was coming here.
I got a little bit of weight training in
because I truly believe this.
Just like our brains, our bodies are the same way.
If you don't use it, you lose it. So get up and get moving.
<v ->Okay, what's number three?</v>
<v ->So number three, I saved the best for last.</v>
So if it's okay, maybe, just maybe,
let's keep this one between you and me.
<v ->I think we can.</v>
<v ->And the 10,000 other people here.</v>
<v ->All right. Everybody good with that?</v>
<v ->Awesome.</v>
So number three, I try to use all the time
that I have on the planes in traveling
to stay very productive.
I love being productive on long flights
'cause it's actually time
where I can just lock in and focus.
I don't have people chirping at me all the time.
I can get the job done.
And I like to use that time to read up on all my notes
to be prepared for my meetings and events.
I even use the time to study game film as a broadcaster
of the different teams that I'm covering.
I did that when I was a player too.
So travel time is a little bit of rest,
but it's a lot of time studying.
Preparation's always been so important to me
and in order to feel confident in whatever I'm doing,
it's always about preparing
in order to get the results that I want.
<v ->Well, Tom, that's amazing.</v>
It's no wonder you look so great.
Now I want to ask everyone,
you ready to watch "Well Traveled?"
Okay. This is just a little preview.
We didn't give away all the good stuff.
But coming on Delta Sync and the seatback screens this year,
you'll be able to see Tom and "Well Traveled"
and enjoy those experiences.
Tom, thank you for coming out today.
<v ->Thank you, Ed.</v>
<v ->Appreciate it, brother.</v>
<v ->Thank you. Great to meet with you guys.</v>
<v ->Give it up for Tom Brady.</v>
<v ->Thank you. Thank you.</v>
<v ->Delta Sync, our partnership with YouTube,</v>
and content like Tom's "Well Traveled"
are all great examples of how anticipating your needs
and serving you with exclusive experiences
can elevate your journey.
We expect many of the features shown today
will be online on our planes this year,
and we continue to find new partners
to bring into our ecosystem.
Well, since we're here in Las Vegas,
the gaming capital of the world, it's only fitting
to announce a collaboration with DraftKings,
one of the world's leading online gaming platforms,
for the Delta Sync experience.
Jason Robins, DraftKings co-founder and CEO,
is with us today.
Is that you, Jason? Did I see you?
Did I see you staring at your phone
instead of watching the show?
Jason, stop looking at your phone.
Fantasy football season's over. Okay, it's over.
We love you, Jason.
From fantasy sports to online adventures,
gaming has become a regular part of the daily lives
of millions of our customers.
And you shouldn't have to hit pause
just because you're in the sky.
Our partnership with DraftKings
will build on the games portfolio
that we already offer today via Delta Sync
and our seatback screens, while using the deep expertise
that Jason and his team have developed over the past decade.
Now, let's check in with Eve
to see how she's doing one more time
to see what's in store for her upon arrival in Tokyo.
<v Narrator>Because Delta Concierge</v>
has been working on Eve's behalf,
her rideshare already knows when she'll land.
We'll have a car waiting to take her
wherever she wants to go.
<v ->Now let's talk more about that rideshare.</v>
And to help me, I'd like to welcome to the stage
someone that does not need an introduction with this crowd,
the CEO of Uber, Dara Khosrowshahi.
Dara.
Dara, thank you for joining us today.
<v ->Thank you, Ed.</v>
It is a privilege to be here with you
to celebrate the history of Delta
and to give us a glimpse of what's to come.
And I'm thrilled that we're coming together
to shape the future of travel.
<v ->It's so true. It's so true.</v>
And we could not be more thrilled
that you could be with us tonight.
And we're excited to be announcing
a new exclusive partnership with Uber,
the company that revolutionized how we go anywhere
and get anything at the simple tap of a button.
Okay, out of interest,
how many people took an Uber to get here today?
Show of hands. Okay.
Keep your hand up if you also flew on Delta.
Okay. Wow, we got more Delta people than Uber.
You got work to do.
<v ->I think you stacked the deck with the crowd.</v>
<v ->Just a little bit. Just a little bit.</v>
Well, you're gonna love what Dara has got to share.
Tell 'em what Uber customers can expect
from our new partnership together.
<v ->Gladly.</v>
So I'm incredibly excited to announce
that Uber will be teaming up with Delta
for a new exclusive partnership.
So travel's a big deal for us.
In fact, 50% of Uber bookings
either begin or end at an airport.
So that's why we're starting with something
that we know is very important to Delta customers,
and that's SkyMiles.
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
<v ->So SkyMiles members will be able to earn miles</v>
when they use Uber and Uber Eats.
So for every Uber X ride
that you take to the airport-
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>
As well as premium and reserved rides, you will get miles
and it doesn't stop there.
You'll also earn miles for eligible restaurant
and grocery deliveries that you order with Uber Eats.
But we're also evolving our airport experience
from providing easy step-by-step instructions
right in the Uber app to guide you
from the plane straight to your ride
to improve pickup and drop-off experiences at Delta hubs
and much, much more.
We're super excited to be launching our collaboration
just this coming spring.
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->And in the meantime,</v>
all of you sign up for the wait list at uber.com/delta.
<v ->Sounds good, right? You guys got that?</v>
Dara, what excites me the most are the new opportunities
that this partnership will create
as we work together over time.
As we start to better integrate the findings,
the learnings of Delta and Uber,
we're gonna be making the experience for our customers,
these people, less stressful, easier to manage,
and making sure that you, our customers,
are in control of every step of the way.
<v ->That's exactly right.</v>
And with our shared goals of always putting people first,
I think the possibilities are just absolutely endless.
Now, Ed, you've clearly been busy this afternoon,
this evening, so I hope you don't mind.
I took the liberty of ordering us
a little pick-me-up with Uber Eats.
<v ->Oh, you did?</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Wow. Awesome.</v>
<v ->Wow. This is so kind.</v>
<v ->Thank you. Thank you.</v>
Appreciate it.
<v ->Thank you. Thank you.</v>
<v ->I heard it's hazelnut with a little splash of cream.</v>
Did I get that right?
<v ->How'd you know? That's pretty cool.</v>
Smells great, doesn't it? Thank you for this, Dara.
Now, we're up here sipping coffee,
but it hardly seems fair
that we're the only ones enjoying a mid-keynote pick-me-up.
Have you got anything for these lovely people out there?
<v ->Well, of course I do.</v>
We're also thrilled to bring the joy of Uber Eats
to each of you today.
So, guys, come on in.
<v ->This is so cool.</v>
Thank you, Dara. This is really great.
And if you didn't get a chance to receive a gift card,
keep an eye out for the Uber Guides
as you exit the building.
Everyone please give it up for Dara.
Dara.
So as we saw with Eve,
data, Gen AI, and the ingenuity of the Delta people
are driving our ability to transform her journey.
At every step, new and connected experiences were unlocked
by her SkyMiles membership
before, during, and after her day of travel.
The idea of loyalty is changing and it has changed.
SkyMiles membership is the way to access new experiences
well beyond your day of travel.
It's at the center of our innovations
powering Delta Sync and the Fly Delta app.
Those of you who may use of our expedited badge pickup
this year when you landed in Vegas,
you know the power of SkyMiles membership.
And if there's anything that we've learned
over the past 100 years, it's that our mission isn't just
to move people around the world safely and comfortably.
No, it really is to harness the power of travel
to bring people together,
to connect communities across vast distances,
to create opportunities
that were unimaginable just a few years ago.
This mission is more important today than ever before.
<v Viola>We see a future</v>
where human ingenuity and imagination
simplify how we move through the world.
Human kindness ignites our endeavors.
As we travel effortlessly
to people, places, and cultures previously unknown,
differences melt away as we begin to understand
our shared humanity and what it means to live a life.
<v ->Our planet is vast</v>
and our opportunity to forge a better future
has never been greater.
But the amazing promise of technology
to bring us together has also at times driven us apart.
That's why what we do at Delta is so important.
Our purpose isn't just to transport people,
it's to bring them together.
When you come face to face with someone,
you discover what you have in common.
You start to bridge those gaps in understanding.
At Delta, we know better than anyone
that the power that travel holds to create opportunity
to power economies and dramatically change lives.
Just consider these facts.
People flew an estimated 5 billion times last year,
is sent by air,
and aviation generates 4% of the entire world's GDP.
It's no wonder that aviation supports
more than 86 million jobs globally.
And through innovation and technology,
we can connect developing nations to the world
as never before.
But it won't work unless it's both accessible
and affordable for everyone.
Countless regions remain underserved
by commercial air capacity.
Get this.
It's estimated that just one in five
of the world's population has even experienced air travel.
Can you believe that? One in five.
Our first century of flight was largely focused
on uniting regions and continents.
I firmly believe the next century of flight
will be about uniting the world.
Imagine the benefits
of conveniently connecting local farmers in Nigeria
to customers in Sweden
or students in Nepal to educational opportunities in Japan.
And so it's important to hear from those
who will be navigating that next century,
a group of people who have zero preconceptions
about how the next century of travel might look like,
a group of people who, in my experience,
tend to be our kids.
<v ->Welcome to Delta Airbus Innovation Lab.</v>
Today we are going to do a deep dive
on all the exciting developments and innovations in aviation
that will shape how we travel over the next 100 years.
We got some really cool things that we're gonna discuss.
Like who here likes Roblox?
<v Kids>Me, me, me!</v>
<v ->Yes. This is great.</v>
So Delta is working with Roblox
to create a game called Delta Locals,
where you can collect these cool souvenirs
and then learn more about places all around the world.
So that is one cool thing that we're doing.
What are your ideas?
<v ->How about a plane made of garbage?</v>
<v Kids>What?</v>
<v ->I like that.</v>
<v ->He's right. We have to save our planet.</v>
<v ->Great idea.</v>
One day, your seat may be made of plastic
that we remove from the oceans.
<v Kids>Whoa.</v>
<v ->I agree. Yeah.</v>
You know, we're working with all kinds of material
like algae and bamboo.
Anything is possible, guys.
<v ->What about a plane that has wings that flap like a bird?</v>
<v ->I like this. Well, how about folding instead of flapping?</v>
I mean, we're working on a new wing
that makes planes fly even more efficiently, a folding wing.
<v ->It's a good idea to copy birds.</v>
They've been flying forever. They're the literal experts.
<v ->Exactly.</v>
See, we're working on getting planes to fly in formation,
like when you see a group of geese
and they fly in that V shape,
it means quicker journeys and using less fuel.
And we're actually doing a test flight this year. Yeah.
<v ->Can I come?</v>
<v ->Not yet, but soon.</v>
Okay. Grab your headsets.
Using a combination of AR and VR in this device,
we can customize planes in whatever way we want.
<v Kids>Whoa.</v>
<v ->This is a plane and it also glows in the dark.</v>
<v ->Oh, that's fantastic. It's perfect for night flight.</v>
<v ->What about a plane with plants?</v>
<v Instructor>You're so innovative, everybody here.</v>
<v ->What about a plane with camouflage?</v>
<v Instructor>This is getting really good, guys.</v>
I'm loving all these ideas.
<v ->I don't know about you, but I think it's fair to say</v>
that the future is in pretty safe hands with these kids.
That was an exclusive look
at one of Delta's most important partnerships,
our partnership with Airbus,
the company which makes many of the airplanes
that carry our customers across the skies.
And it's a relationship that's been critical
to making Delta the airline who we are today.
And like Delta,
our friends at Airbus are playing the long game,
looking into the future to imagine how the magic of travel
will be changing our world for decades to come.
Joining me to discuss the steps we're taking together
to build a better world for the next 100 years,
I'd like to welcome Airbus's Chief Sustainability Officer
and Head of Communications, Julie Kitcher,
and renowned futurist and founder of WAYE, Sinead Bovell.
Ladies.
<v ->Hi, Ed.</v>
<v ->Thank you, Julie.</v>
Sinead, thank you.
Julie, what we just heard from those amazing kids
help us paint one vision of the future of travel.
But when you think about
the next 10, 50, 100 years of travel,
what kinds of big changes do you see
in how aircraft are being designed and then built?
<v ->Thanks, Ed, and hello, everyone.</v>
I'm so excited to be here with you
and our friends and partners at Delta.
So first, you're right to talk about shared values.
At Airbus, our purpose is to pioneer sustainable aerospace
for a safe and united world.
So it means we are pioneering innovation and technology
for global mobility and connectivity,
bringing the world together.
So that's really, you know,
over the next decade, over the next century,
we'll be bringing flight to future generations,
those brilliant kids that we saw on that video,
and today's aircraft go beyond the boundaries
we knew even a decade ago.
But we are actually imagining technological innovations
that seemed impossible.
So it's never been more exciting for engineers to design,
develop, and implement at Airbus.
And those kids are pretty smart.
<v ->They're pretty smart.</v>
<v ->They are pretty smart.</v>
So actually I'd like to share
that we are actually working on wings that do change shape.
If you think about an eagle in flight
and the way those wings bend and change shape,
well, we are actually working on longer,
leaner, lighter wings with moving parts
that change shape in flight to improve aerodynamics,
reduce fuel used to cut costs and emissions.
And that's what we're doing to support you at Delta.
And for those of you who grew up with Star Wars like I did,
that means science fiction is actually becoming a reality
when we see those wings moving.
So I'm really thrilled to be able to announce collaboration
with Delta and Airbus on early stage technology
between our innovation labs, including Airbus UpNext,
to explore wing performance, fuel efficiency,
superconductivity, which is about the efficiency
of electrical energy, and advanced aircraft assistance.
And so Ed, that collaboration will be key to us
because we need your feedback
to be able to continue to develop the best aircraft
and achieve our shared vision together.
<v ->That's really great, Julie.</v>
And I'm so excited about what we see out into our future,
which brings me to Sinead.
Sinead is a futurist,
a frequent speaker at the United Nations.
I think you've got one of the toughest jobs in the world
having to predict what's gonna happen into the future.
What are some of the big changes
that you see happening on our horizon?
<v ->That's a great question. Yeah.</v>
I would say augmented reality, virtual reality,
like we saw in that video, and AI first devices
will eventually become as standard
as in-flight wifi and entertainment screens are today.
And then AI, it's going to go on
to deliver extremely hyper-personalized travel experiences
where the planning just moves seamlessly
into the background.
And then there's rapid advancements in synthetic biology
and material science.
So we can build planes with biodegradable materials
that could even one day self-heal.
<v ->Self-heal. Explain that to me.</v>
<v ->Just the way, it's the same way nature heals itself</v>
if it gets a tear or it gets injured,
taking that biomimicry example,
building using similar materials
so planes in the future can heal and repair themselves,
copying nature again.
<v ->That's so incredible and I'm so excited to hear that.</v>
Julie, as someone who oversees sustainability at Airbus,
what are some of the advancements
that you see in fuel science
that's shaping the future of our industry?
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
And fuel science is actually becoming extremely exciting.
So first let's put aviation history into perspective.
So at Airbus,
we like to talk about four revolutions of aviation.
Well, the first was flight itself
because scientists believed
that machines heavier than air wouldn't fly.
The second is making aviation safer,
and that's a continuous priority for us all.
The third is making flight accessible.
So democratization of flight and air.
You were talking about that.
And now we are at the dawn of the fourth revelation.
So pioneering the technology for sustainable aerospace.
And at Airbus,
our mission is to significantly reduce fuel burn,
driving down costs and CO2 emissions
with each new generation of aircraft,
which equates to about 25% fuel burn reduction
with each new generation of aircraft.
And we're supporting Delta with that on the new aircraft.
And sustainable aviation fuel,
which is a nascent technology,
is now central to that mission too.
So for example, the cooking oil that you use at home
and throw away can actually be used today to fuel a plane.
So that's right.
Aviation fuels are now made from renewable sources
like cooking oil or agricultural waste.
And Airbus aircraft can actually fly
with a 50% blend today of this fuel.
And by 2030, that figure is going to grow to 100%.
But the real challenge is
to make those fuels more affordable
and increase production and fast.
So we are excited again about this partnership
we're announcing with Delta to drive and scale production,
which is going to combine our pioneering innovation
with Delta's vision and operational expertise.
And that collaboration will strengthen energy security,
which is a key issue today,
and drive economic growth and development
as well as social development,
particularly in rural communities.
Because this is a new business, it's a nascent technology,
so it will create jobs, it can foster innovation,
attract investment, and build more resilience.
So I think that's a pretty exciting future.
<v ->That's a very, very exciting, a very exciting future.</v>
And all of this is ultimately in the service
of making our world smaller, bringing us closer together.
And it's gonna cause each of us
to think differently about the challenges ahead.
'cause as we've seen today,
the future of travel a century from now
is not going to be recognizable to what we knew today.
Ladies and gentlemen, please thank Julie and Sinead
for spending this time with us today.
Thank you, ladies.
<v Julie>Thank you. Thank you.</v>
<v ->Wasn't that incredible?</v>
Feels like we've been on a journey tonight together.
At Delta, we want to make flying seem effortless,
but the truth?
It's not.
Flying requires the effort
of thousands of Delta employees every day,
each striving to make Delta the very best it can be.
And some of those amazing people
are standing behind me today
and I just want to take a moment to thank them...
Thank our team who put this amazing show together for us,
and all the Delta people who are here
for a great, great evening.
Thank you for what you all do for us.
I've always been an optimist.
When you work in the airline business, you have to be.
But even for me, sometimes it can be hard
to be optimistic about the future
when you see the challenges that we face today.
How are we gonna solve them? Is it even possible?
Well, once the idea of a person soaring through the clouds
seemed equally impossible.
And as those early Delta pilots learned,
by pushing against the wind, they could take to the skies.
I'm optimistic because we're on the verge
of a transformation that goes far beyond transportation.
It's about shrinking the world,
making even the most remote places feel closer than ever.
You can't do that on a phone or a screen
or via social media.
We tried that pretty unsuccessfully during the pandemic.
We don't live in the virtual world.
True connection comes when we're standing together,
sharing the same space.
That's when conversations begin,
when lifelong relationships are born.
It's the promise of the next century of flight
to me is exhilarating.
Just imagine the possibilities.
Travel powered by sustainable energy,
advancements in material science
that allow us to better adapt to new environments,
airplanes becoming immersive destinations in themselves.
Imagine when journeys won't be measured by distance,
but by the potential they unlock,
the physical and the digital blend.
Sustainable travel has been achieved
and entire regions of the world are transformed
by the power of travel and connection.
This is the future that we are building,
a future of limitless possibilities.
Behind every innovation are the people
who dedicate their lives to pushing ahead,
from that first passenger
who strapped into the back of a crop duster a century ago
to the innovators driving today's advancements.
It's the curiosity, creativity,
relentless drive of individuals
that shape the future of travel.
Thanks to them, the sky is no longer the limit.
It's just the beginning.
The innovations and partnerships that we've shared today
are more than advancements.
They're the foundation of a future
where technology links us to experience, places, and people
in ways we've only dreamed about.
Delta's not just preparing for that future.
We're creating it.
And with every innovation, daring idea,
and the passion of those who keep climbing,
we are transcending the boundaries of travel
and redefining what it means to connect.
It's as simple as this.
If you don't go, the world will never change.
When you go, anything is possible.
This is the beginning of a new era of travel.
So as we take off into our next century,
fasten your seat belts.
Our best is yet to come. Thank you all.
