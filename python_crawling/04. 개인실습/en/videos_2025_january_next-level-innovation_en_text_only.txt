<v Chris>Thank you so much for stepping in</v>
for our Next Level Innovation session.
Mr. John Ellis, president of Codethink.
And as I mentioned in the first session,
for those of you who are here,
this is our 25th anniversary for Connect2Car
and pretty excited about a lot
of the panels we have looking out to 2050.
John gave us a pretty interesting, for those of you,
how many of you were here
for last year's sessions and saw John?
Okay, so there were a couple of people in here
that was a pretty interesting presentation.
There were horses
and there were battery powered cars in 19 what, John?
<v ->Uh, wow, 1910.</v>
<v ->Yeah, 1910.</v>
So this isn't the first time we've tried it,
but I met John when he was
doing some really interesting things at Ford at the time,
and he spoke at Connect2Car
and we were having some issues trying to connect
some of our aftermarket devices to the OEM
and I mentioned we were having problems
and John was like, "Well, what's the problem?
"We can fix that."
And we've been friends ever since.
So John, I really appreciate you doing this.
I'll let you introduce your panelists
and we'll get this day rolling.
Thank you so much.
<v ->Thanks Chris.</v>
Happy holidays. Happy New Year.
Welcome to Las Vegas.
So Chris said, my name is John Ellis and I'm really thrilled
and delighted to be here again
on the stage at Connect2Car with you,
but I'm more thrilled to be joined
by some esteemed colleagues and friends
and I'll introduce 'em quickly.
And then I'm gonna do some level setting
of some rules about our conversation.
So to my immediate right is Madison Beebe
from Ford Motor Company,
an American OEM and provider
of the number one selling car in the US at this time.
To her immediate right is Jonathan Moore from Exida,
probably renowned for the leading cybersecurity
and safety assessment company.
Next to him is Sabina Schneider from Globant.
Globant is a global digital IT services company.
We're pleased to have that conversation.
And then last but not least to her immediate far right
is Joseph Perry from Sony Picture Entertainment,
a global content provider.
So we have a cast of characters with a lot
of different context backgrounds.
And as we begin talking about what we might want to do
as we talk about next level innovation was we came up
with a few different things that we're gonna do today.
First, we're not gonna take any questions from the audience,
we only have 39 minutes.
Panelists will be available afterwards
and they will also be available tonight at the Cavesa event.
And they will be available
throughout the course of the week.
If you use the app,
you can get ahold of them if you have questions.
Number two is each one of them
is gonna represent the context that they're coming from
and this is gonna be sort of like a bar conversation.
So while we might not be looking at you or the camera,
we are aware of you,
but we're we're just five folks here
trying to talk about innovation through a lens
of some future context, whether it's five years, 15 years,
2050, 2070, whatnot, okay?
So again, thank you so very much for joining us.
Appreciate you being here.
Look forward to following up with you all afterwards.
And with that, let me start.
Okay, friends, here we are.
Got our drinks.
Alright, so I asked a question earlier,
I'm gonna ask it again.
Next level innovation 2040, 2050.
I, last year was talking about 2050
and I talked about some things that had to happen.
But let's start with you Madison.
What do you foresee 2035?
So 10 years from today, 2035,
and maybe even up to 2045.
<v ->Yeah, I think we need to start with the perspective</v>
of the consumer and customer expectations
because during that timeframe,
you're gonna have a wide variety and growing awareness
of technology in the purchases of the vehicles.
More familiar with technology,
higher demand for seamless connectivity
and experiences from your apps to your, sorry,
from your phone to your car,
potentially to other methods of transportation,
whether it's your e-bike,
your Uber, or even your home, right?
So you have a highly educated consumer first of all.
And then depending on the region,
it's addressing the range anxiety is still a thing, right?
So I'm expecting evolutions
in the performance of batteries.
I'm expecting an evolution of the consumer expectation
from seamless connectivity,
seamless experiences
that are continuously updated over time,
but something that helps me transition from home to car,
to work to play.
And then through that, not just from a battery perspective,
but there's a shift from consumers feeling comfortable
with EVs to going full in and that being their only car.
So it's connectivity, it's experience,
it's long range EVs or EREVs right?
But beyond that, you have this massive
internal electrical architecture revolution.
And that varies if it's a startup, if it's a new EV company
or if it's a legacy OEM like Ford,
where you not only have current vehicles in production
that you have to maintain over time,
but you have next generation
electrical architecture development and the tuning of that.
So I view the internal innovation as just as important
as the experiences to develop new things at speed,
at velocity, at high quality, you know, automation testing
and all the DevOps infrastructure
that enables that innovation.
<v ->So building on that conversation, Joseph,</v>
I want to come come over to you
and ask you the following question.
So experience has obviously played deeply
in Madison's conversation and you know,
Ford a hundred and almost 125 years now in the making,
question that is Sony Pictures Entertainment,
Sony, I mean, we've had movies,
we've had content for a long period of time.
We start with, you know, silent films.
We've moved up into where we're at,
where do you see the content evolution occurring
such that consumption in 2035, is it immersive?
Is it three?
Where are we or where do you see coming from Sony
where that might ultimately end up given the role
that you're playing in trying to bring content to vehicles
and feel free to make this a global,
like if there's regional differences,
by all means, feel free to point on that.
<v ->Yeah, exactly.</v>
So I think before I deep into your answer,
dig deep into your answer,
I'd like to kind of comment on something
that she just mentioned, customer expectations.
And I think that's real important.
I think customer expectations right now
is that they should be able to watch their content
from their different various services in their vehicles.
And that currently is not available
in majority of the vehicles.
So let's start off with that.
That's the basic minimum of what consumers expect,
but where we expect to go from there,
Sony pictures as well as
other particular entertainment services.
We think about the future of
what those immersive experiences looks like,
and along with the technology
and the capabilities of the technology
such as the APIs that are being developed,
available inside the vehicle to create experiences
that are actually, you cannot duplicate inside the house.
You can't sit inside your living room and drive down,
let's say the 15 here in Las Vegas and move around the car
and then maybe have a content experience that reacts to
that particular momentum
or to be playing a game inside of a vehicle.
Sony has groups, has other gaming companies as well
that would react to that.
So I think taking the basic expectation of being able
to access my content in my vehicle
or wherever I am in a way that interacts
with my environment is where we're gonna go in the future.
And I think a leveraging the technology that enables
that experience is where
we're gonna see in the next 10 years.
<v ->So I want to, I'm gonna get to Sabina in a second here,</v>
but I want to jump back to you and ask you a question.
So are we ever moving away
from the single vehicle ownership model?
Are we moving away?
Because if we're gonna really enable the services
and experiences that Joseph just talked about,
I don't see drivers necessarily being able
to take advantage of that equally.
So where do we get to from,
say an OEM's perspective broadly?
You don't have to talk about Ford just broadly
to enable passenger awareness,
passenger content, not driver or owner content?
<v ->Help me clarify real quick.</v>
When you say passenger content, you?
<v ->Well, not the driver.</v>
So anybody who's not driving the vehicle.
So you have, right, you're in the car.
So some of the things that you were talking about
just very cool, like, you know,
and awesome except that it takes away
from being able to drive in safety.
So we now have to worry about
what's the rest of the occupants of the vehicle?
Yeah, sorry, non-driver.
<v ->That makes sense.</v>
I think you were spot on, right?
You have, if you're a single person, one car,
you're optimizing for safety
and the driving experience, right?
If you have a family, you have kids in the back,
you wanna entertain them, even in different markets
where many of the people use their vehicles
for a form of relaxation, right?
You park in the garage, relax,
you wanna have that connected experience
that you can actually evolve the vehicle
into more of a habitat on wheels type of a vibe.
And one of the things kind of aligned to what you're saying,
but in addition to the connected experiences,
it's more of the personalization of the vehicle.
So it's not just used for driving,
but it's like the physical aspects
of if it's a connected accessory,
a physical accessory for camping, for some adventure,
I think maybe the demand right now, especially in the US,
might not be so large for that type
of habitat on wheels environment.
Certainly in other regions
it's very pervasive and high demand.
And I think the vehicle will evolve to have to deliver
those seamless experiences, not just for the driver,
but for all the passengers in the vehicle.
<v ->So Sabina, conversations that we've had</v>
over the last couple of weeks
as we've been sharing our love of Latin America
and software and services,
everything that Joseph and Madison are talking about,
we can imagine, absolutely.
But it is deeply, deeply seeded in software.
<v ->Sure, yeah.</v>
<v ->Is this industry broadly, automotive,</v>
are we ready for it?
Are we there yet?
And I mean broadly, right?
There are elements, there's the traditional,
as we called it, OEMs.
There's the startup OEMs.
We have China, we have Asia, we have other,
so OEM is not equal to everyone,
but is the industry broadly ready for this?
And does it understand what that
challenge really looks like?
<v ->I think it's a very important question.</v>
And before answering the question,
I was dreaming about the experience
that we can have at the car.
If you are thinking more about 35 years from now,
even hundreds years from now, we were talking about,
you were talking last time about horses a hundred years ago.
So really thinking ahead
and probably I'm cutting it short,
but I think that the autonomous
and the electric vehicles are going to be
like a commodity at the time, a hundred years from now.
And the experience inside the car,
to your points, both of you,
is going to be the differentiator between the brands,
which is a brand that is offering smooth drive.
The entertainment inside the car
is going to be very important
because as this is going to be more autonomous,
I'm thinking more about the Disney movies,
about capsules driving themselves throughout the country
and getting you to one point to the other
without even hesitating, that's the objective
and is going to be fulfilled very easily.
So having that in mind, it's a lot.
And going back to your question,
AI is going to be core in the technology inside the car.
Cybersecurity of course is going
to be very important in order to make sure
that the car runs smoothly.
But above all, I think that to achieve that,
I don't see all the ecosystem being ready
to jump into something like that.
It's a very challenging envisioning
that we are putting in place
and that really requires the architecture to be
flexible to enable this type of technology inside the car
and also in the manufacturing of the car.
So I think that it involves a massive,
profound, to your point, Madison,
inside transformation in order
to make sure that we are ready for those technologies too,
like you mentioned, DevOps,
continuous deployment is something
that is one of the key points in technology in order
to achieve something like this type of envisioning.
And we are still struggling with with that I think.
<v ->So.</v>
<v ->Sorry and legacies.</v>
<v ->No, no. Yes.</v>
<v ->Legacies</v>
<v ->And what?</v>
<v ->Legacies.</v>
<v ->Legacy, okay. Yeah, yeah.</v>
<v ->Sorry, it's about thinking technology</v>
away from the traditional IT organizations.
It's not the traditional IT that of course is needed
for the manufacturing
and everything to get like the standardization,
don't get me wrong,
but what we are talking about the experience inside the car,
it involves a different technology,
flexibility, scalability, and more consumer centric
that is not the traditional IT for sure.
<v ->So software's product now.</v>
<v ->Right, yes.</v>
<v ->It's actually a product deliver.</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>
So then that Jonathan brings me to you.
And so as I build off everything
you've just heard from Joseph, Madison, and Sabina,
the first reaction that I have and question for you is,
is the industry ready for software
that is now a product in the car?
Where are we at in terms of sort of state of the art today?
Where might we need to go in terms of innovation
inside of how do we know that we can trust or that we can,
that we actually can use that,
which they've just talked about this amazing thing,
but coming from an industry that is not historically
software focused, where are we and where do we need to go?
<v ->Well I'm sure everyone's thinking</v>
what is a safety engineer doing at the leading innovation?
<v ->Because he's a friend of mine.</v>
He's a friend. Yeah, that's why, yeah.
<v ->And of course safety is regarded</v>
as one of the business prevention units
in most companies, right?
You might as well have a sign on the door that says,
"The answer to your next question is no," and-
<v ->What about the question after that?</v>
Also no?
<v ->Yes.</v>
Those silos are becoming ever more entrenched.
The standards get bigger.
The words that we have to read get more every year
and ultimately safety comes down to who you trust.
And software couldn't be a more abstract thing
to put your trust in.
Mechanical engineering,
which has been the dominant force in automotive,
is very easy to trust.
You can look at it and you can see how thick the metal is
and how strong the things are.
Software you have no idea where on the planet
that software was created.
And being able to trust software is crucial.
And which software do you trust?
And I'd love to see a button on my phone that tells me
whether I can trust my car for the next journey.
And how does a blind person trust the car is safe?
We're gonna be transporting
a whole new section of society, children.
There are gonna be parents
who want to put their child in the vehicle
and send them around the block a few times
because it sends them to sleep.
How do they trust that software?
So trust is at the heart of it.
And unfortunately the standards are mired in ancient dogma
from the 1980s where the software was written
by electrical engineers,
not by competent computer engineers
who understood how software works
and maybe didn't spend all of their time thinking like I do,
about how it can go wrong,
but spend enough time putting tools
in place to prevent that.
And so we need a huge upgrade in how we trust software
and what we do in order to achieve that trust.
And for me it's an existential threat to my organization
because we make a business out of periodically reviewing
the work you do and maximally,
we can do that about every six months.
And yet with the rate of change
and the number of recalls that are being suffered
by automotive OEMs today,
it's clear that we need to provide that assessment daily.
And yet most software safety engineers
want to hide away behind their sign that says no
and don't want to get involved in solving the problem.
So I'm here to encourage people to get involved
and want to understand how things can go wrong
in order that we can convey to our customers
that they can better trust our product and your product
and the claims that we make.
<v ->Sorry, John one point.</v>
<v ->No go. Yeah, go ahead.</v>
<v ->Follow up.</v>
I like how you stated to trust the software
and even more so with AI coming inside the car,
what do you think that trust can be fulfilled in a way?
<v ->Well, I think it's fairly clear</v>
that the uses AI are being put to today
are just a bullshit generator.
You take crap in and you regurgitate it.
And from a safety point of view,
something like an AI that's got at best an 85% success rate
is just not even close to being something
you'd want to trust your life in.
It's okay to win a game of go,
but would you trust the outcome
of the next game of go to your life?
And most people would have cause to think about that.
And if you're basing your large language model
on the information that's publicly available
on the internet,
of course we all know that the vast majority
of that information is written
for reasons other than accuracy
and contains information other than unbiased fact.
And of course that's a big influence
in the results of the language models.
Now, no doubt given 10 years,
there will be solutions to that.
But again, it's gonna come down to trust.
Which language model are you going to trust?
The one that's trained
on marketing and advertising click generation?
Is that really the right model to be using for safety?
And a lot of people
don't really know the answer to that yet.
<v ->They don't know or they're not willing to accept it?</v>
<v ->I know the answer to that.</v>
<v ->Alright, so Joseph, you've heard this.</v>
I could see what people don't know in the audience.
You are with me, an alum of Ford Motor companies.
So we have automotive in our,
I don't have it in my blood,
but I think you do have it in your blood as you claim.
But now in content and hearing what we just talked about
and where things are at,
what does that bring when you have conversations like,
I'm gonna bring content into a vehicle.
I came from a vehicle group so I understand the dimensions
of the problem safety and others,
but yet at the same time I'm here to make experiences.
Creative, consumptive artistic experiences happen
whilst you're in the vehicle.
How do you balance or where is Sony Pictures
or maybe just you personally,
where are you finding yourself in trying
to balance both the ask from OEMs or the ask from Sony
and the ability to deliver into that environment?
<v ->Well, I think it's not necessarily</v>
a challenge specific to Sony,
but I think it's a challenge
that we have multiple industries
that are now in a relationship
that didn't used to have a relationship
and that has created a whole new set of challenges
in terms of how we work together,
what our processes are, what our workflows are,
and integrating those two within those different industries.
So I think that is something going, speaking about trust,
I think that kind of feeds into that trust issue.
It's not so much when I talk to a lot of manufacturers,
when I talk to people in the industry
or even just consumers,
everybody wants content in the vehicles,
everybody wants these emerging experiences.
But a lot of the feedback is,
hey, we're just trying to stabilize our platform right now
just to be able to support the services
that we have to have.
And if we start introducing
all these additional other services,
our concern is being able to manage
all these changes at the same time.
So I think that is a really big concern with how we do that.
So how to operationalize that.
And then one of the other things that I think
that came to my mind as we were just talking
is that when you have all these changes,
it takes so long right now
for some of these things to get corrected.
You mentioned the recalls.
You know, I have had an issue just
with my simple wireless CarPlay in one of my vehicles
that has not worked right in a year.
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->I mean that we can't even get that fixed, right?</v>
And Apple's a company that, you know, embodies trust,
but I don't trust Apple when it comes to CarPlay
because I know that the technology struggles
and then you've got a challenge with the industry experts
and the retailers, the dealerships,
and they're struggling with it too.
So being able to fix all these things
where we can respond better, we can have workflows better,
we can have processes better,
I think all of that is gonna be necessary
to get people more comfortable.
<v ->Excellent, so I wanna tap on something</v>
and feel free, I've not, this is gonna be,
we're in the brand new space here, so feel free to say,
let's pass on to the question,
but what kind of innovation would we expect
to see in dealerships or at the point of sale?
Maybe just forget dealerships, at point of sale.
If I'm a consumer 20 years down the road,
am I still going to a physical location?
Am I still interacting with someone?
Like how might we imagine the car
actually suddenly being actually purchased
or being acquired?
Do you have a thought on that?
<v ->I mean, quite frankly,</v>
this is a bit out of my realm at Ford.
<v ->Okay.</v>
<v ->I do think that you touched on a few great points around,</v>
you know, it'll tie into this
in terms of collaboration and how we work together.
When you talk about operational models
across the supply chain, they're, I wouldn't say broken,
but they weren't established under the framework
of a truly software defined vehicle
or software as a product, right?
So when you talk about collaborative models
and even how we improve the point of sale,
there is a large opportunity for improvement
of how the OEMs collaborate with our supply chain,
how we integrate together,
how we integrate into our common build pipelines, right?
To manage that continuous deployment of new content.
But that also helps with the point of sale interaction
'cause you're ensuring that the vehicle is
as its intended state at the most fresh state
with the best and most recent content.
Things like that.
I think I'd have to pass personally
on the point of sale interaction.
<v ->Okay. Yeah, no, that's fine.</v>
So one of the things that Jonathan,
also an automotive background before into safety.
Madison just talked about the contracts
and the collaboration model having to change
as did Joseph, et cetera.
You and I have had a long conversation
over many, many months where the historic contracts
for suppliers were very steeped on hundreds
of pages about the physical building,
the ability not to delay the plant
very little into software.
And now however, software is in fact
some of the most increasing reasons
why either the hardware product is delayed
or the car is built out of the factory, but then can't ship.
Given where we're at in terms of either the safety industry
or our culture of trust for software, how do you see us,
what innovations have to actually happen do you think,
in order for us to actually
not only solve the problem but get ahead of the problem?
<v ->Well, the trust model I'm afraid,</v>
starts when you walk into the dealership
and not many people trust the dealership.
And there's not very much transparency there.
Not many people are sure they've got a fair price
for the vehicle having paid for it.
The information you're expected to read
and sign in many cases is longer than the Magna Carta
and the Magna Carta is sufficient
for the whole of the UK to declare freedom.
And if now I've got to go into the dealership
and believe I don't need airbags
and I don't need crash protection
because the car's not going to crash
'cause it's got crash protection software.
So a very long way you've got
to bring people in a short period of time
to persuade them of that.
And of course you think about cars
over the last even 15 years,
the widths have increased,
the weights have increased,
the current consumption has increased,
and all of that is the exact opposite
of what you need for an electric economy.
So at some point we have to reconcile
the safety improvements we get with safety,
with all these potentially unneeded safety features
that have evolved in the car that clearly
and demonstrably do a good job of keeping us safe.
And it's got to start with that initial experience
that you have with the people
that you hope are going to buy your product.
<v ->So everything you just touched on,</v>
so Sabina, again steeped in software,
where do you see globally,
so you're from Argentina, currently now in the States,
but Globant is international,
like, where do you see regionally,
like, are we globally prepared for this?
Not forget even just the automotive OEMs,
we just talked about the OEMs, but we have supply chains,
we have others that are part of a supply chain
that's bigger than just automotive.
Are we ready to actually do the kind of innovation
that are being asked of?
So powered by software in the context of this arena
being a very safe or trustable vehicle experience on a road.
Are we there?
<v ->I think there's a long way to get there</v>
from I think what you're referring
on the contracts put in place for the providers,
the IT providers.
I see that many of them
are mostly for the traditional providers, the IT areas,
but not for the innovative,
the customer centric type of thing,
or building the experiences, as you say,
from the dealership up to the OEMs.
I think there is a lot of work to be done there.
And even I think that we can think about
a different operational model inside the companies
where you can get that specific innovation,
that type of consumer centric IT software development
in a different way because it is,
it's a different type of product centric thinking,
more UX experience for the customers,
for the dealers as well.
So how to build that ecosystem of collaboration
from the digital standpoint
requires a different standpoint on the contract,
the architecture, the organizational,
and how you measure the success of those developments
is different to the more traditional IT areas, I think.
<v ->Okay, but I don't wanna let let you off the hook</v>
with just sort of the framing.
I want you to offer if you're willing to like,
how ready are we?
Are we?
<v ->Oh, we are not. We are not.</v>
<v ->Okay.</v>
<v ->No, no.</v>
We are far away from ready, I think.
<v ->Far from ready?</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->Okay. Are we like, ready in my lifetime?</v>
<v ->Depends on how-</v>
<v ->How long I live?</v>
You're right, you're right. Yeah.
<v ->No!</v>
<v ->I'm at the, for those in the audience that know me,</v>
I don't have a long expectation.
<v ->No, no, I-</v>
<v ->Too much drinking.</v>
<v ->I wish you long life.</v>
<v ->Yeah, yeah, I know.</v>
Thank you. Yes, yes, yes.
But for those in the audience that know me, it's not,
they're surprised I'm still here.
That's what they're really surprised I'm still here.
<v ->No, it's the willingness to change.</v>
I think the willingness to see a different mindset
inside the organization,
a willingness to get quicker cycles of development
inside the companies.
So that requires a different operational model,
different architecture again.
So, but it's the willingness to change that.
And you don't need to change the whole organization.
You can, as with any digital transformation,
you can set aside our organizational group
that is set up for success, for that development.
And then from getting those results,
you can start seeing what of those process
you can ingest in the organization,
but not really thinking about a massive organization
that will take like forever to do,
but thinking more about building different MVPs,
testing like a more agile approach
to the software development without thinking
about the Pharaonic transformation overall,
which, sorry, I've seen many of those
Pharaonic transformations that is not going anywhere.
The business gets super frustrated
and they stop the investment
and then you stop the transformation,
which is what you need in order
to continue having a good experience for the customer.
<v ->So Joseph, and I will ask through the lens of Sony,</v>
but it's really content creators broadly
coming from a different mindset,
strong software or strong content creation,
which probably maybe a much longer storytelling
and narrative of software and the creation of,
are you finding to what Sabina talked about,
the willingness in the collaborations to,
can Sony offer insights to how to move faster,
how to change faster?
Or any of your co-creators?
Again, I don't,
you don't even have to talk about your competitors, but.
<v ->Yeah, and I don't think it's just, it's with Sony,</v>
I think it's with all the stakeholders
that are gonna be partners in bringing these services
and experiences in the vehicle together.
And I think I like this idea of having an agile mindset,
but not only in terms of the product development
or the technology development,
but really for the whole operating model
in terms of the business model, how we partner together.
We have to work differently
within these different frameworks
and we cannot wait until it's done or built
because our grandchildren will be sitting here
still trying to figure it out if we wait that long.
So we have to start,
we have to start now with the small pieces,
with the small steps
and then that's our roadmap to get to where we need to be.
<v ->Excellent.</v>
So Madison, given what Jonathan talked about in terms
of the inverse relationship of size of vehicle,
weight of vehicle going into electric,
giving sort of technology roadmap being place
that you sort of occupy, where do you see,
what do you see an electric vehicle
either looking like, touching like,
feeling like in that 15 year timeframe?
Is it lighter?
Is it heavier batteries?
Is it fully consumptive?
Like where do you think,
and again, just more broadly,
where do you think that we as an automotive industry
will try and head to?
<v ->Well, I think coming from Ford,</v>
we have a bit of a unique perspective
because we have an electrified F-150,
which is at the high end
of the weight power, you know, scale.
And then we have a Mach-E, which is a crossover essentially.
So I think-
<v ->They're both awesome vehicles.</v>
I'm driven both. They're awesome.
<v ->Yeah, I have a Lightning, absolutely love it.</v>
So I think it's gonna be,
well I think it will vary based on
whether you're talking about
a Tesla, a Rivian, an EV startup,
or you're talking about an OEM with a very broad portfolio
and if you look at the distribution
and the applicability of an electrical architecture
and you're managing ICE, EV, PHEV,
potentially EREV, long term,
like from an OEM with such a broad portfolio,
you have to consider cost, weight, power,
but also the scalability of your platform
to the breadth of your portfolio, right?
So that's one challenge there.
From a long-term perspective,
I think we're gonna see higher performance batteries.
I think we'll see some mid-range
of a combination of plugin, hybrid EV and EREV,
especially depending on the region
in terms of infrastructure, charging infrastructure.
I personally took a drive out into the desert
with my Lightning and my main concern was,
is there going to be a charger available to me?
Is it going to be open and is it not going to be broken?
So I think there's gonna be an evolution in optimization
of the architectures that we have today
to span the breadth of your portfolio.
I think we'll see more higher performant batteries,
lighter weight, higher power,
but the mix of EV and EREV together.
And I think that has to be coupled with investment
and evolution in the infrastructure,
especially in areas in the US
where it's either difficult to find,
difficult to access or they're damaged.
<v ->So Jonathan, how do you,</v>
having heard what Madison just shared in the variants
as a safety person thinking of software, how do you,
how does that make you feel?
<v ->Well, thankfully we're not trying</v>
to dismantle nuclear bombs.
That's a good starting point.
There are far riskier, far more areas
that result in far more harm
than automotive will ever have to deal with.
So the technology, the solutions already exist there,
but scaling them to automotive
is of course always the difficulty.
And you know, I'm sure Madison would like
to talk about 10 exciting products like the Lightning,
but of course we're limited
by how quickly we can scale our engineering
and design process to deliver that.
We've got a finite number of people
that we can afford to do that work.
I'm thrilled to have given Red Hat a certificate this week
for a big component of their upcoming open operating system.
Certainly openness is going to play a crucial part.
What I really like about open software
is that the politicians can't do anything about it.
We can play around the world
to the best of our human ability in the open.
And of course there's the trustable framework at Codethink,
which is the only,
is the only initiative I'm aware of
that's even aware of the need
for trust in the entire software supply chain.
So I'm quite excited about that.
I'm an engineer,
so I'm a little bit more excited
about our ability to solve these problems,
but openness and trust are gonna be crucial in that.
<v ->Excellent.</v>
<v ->Sorry, I have a reflection on what John was saying.</v>
I think that's a very important point
about the crowdsourcing of the development.
If we are thinking about all these very good ideas
of where is the vehicle going in,
I don't know, a hundred years from now,
I think it's almost impossible to think
that only one team can solve these type of experiences
and the creative power is better if we can boost
and have the architecture safe, of course,
and scalable to allow different developers
to bring the applications on the car.
But that requires a good infrastructure
in place right there, good architecture.
<v ->Excellent, so we have four minutes left.</v>
I know the time has been so fast.
I'm gonna give each of you, we hadn't talked about this,
so audience, this is a surprise,
each of you, one minute public service announcement message
starting with you Joseph,
what do you wanna leave the audience with
about the topic of next level innovation
or about Sony Picture Entertainment
or about your thoughts
on where we are of vis-a-vis innovation?
I'll ask each of you then to go in one minute each.
<v ->I think I would like to leave with the fact</v>
that I think we are starting now.
I think you've seen some
and even announcements as recent as this week
in terms of small steps that start us to get to that place
of working collaboratively.
And just the plug, we do have a vehicle in the Xperi booth
that's partnered with our partner Mercedes vehicles
that talks about some of those
initial immersive experiences.
Please stop by and take a look at it
and I welcome to talk with any of you
about future partnership opportunities.
<v ->Fantastic, Sabina?</v>
<v ->I think that we barely touched upon that,</v>
but it is a huge topic about data.
Data monetization for AMS is a good opportunity.
Always focusing on the consumer
and getting that innovation from the consumer to the rest.
And I think that Globant
can have a privileged opportunity there
to help you step up in those transformationals,
process that you already have in place.
Or if you want to challenge yourself,
we can be the perfect partner for you
to get along the this journey and challenge.
<v ->Thank you, Jonathan?</v>
<v ->Well, become an automotive engineer.</v>
It's the most fulfilling and rewarding career you can have.
It's tremendously sensitive to small mistakes,
but I can tell you every single component on the vehicle
is one that the customer notices.
And if it's not one they're directly interfacing with,
and if it fails, they will notice.
And if they don't notice it,
it's going to be deleted as a cost save.
And I can't think of anything more rewarding
than working on something that your customers
actively have an interface with and have to deal with.
So come and become an automotive engineer,
come and solve complex software and safety problems.
<v ->Thank you, Madison?</v>
<v ->I guess my parting thoughts,</v>
first, it's great to be up here on stage with you guys
and thank you for everybody who joined.
I think a parting thought
on the technology advancements
is something that you mentioned is the complexity
of the systems that we're talking about.
And I think we're in a stage of tuning and then next gen,
we as an industry have evolved
to potentially a zonal based architecture.
But I talked about the beginning
about customer expectations.
Our customer's expectations
are about affordable vehicles as well.
So I think we're gonna be seeing tuning and optimization
and cost downs in addition to the management
of these complex systems,
the complexity of the software, so yeah.
<v ->Excellent.</v>
Ladies and gentlemen, please give a big round of applause
to my colleagues, Joseph, Sabina, Jonathan and Madison.
It's been great to put this show on for you.
It really was for us to show we, like I said,
we kind of ignored you and had our little conversation here.
All will be available for a few minutes after today.
They'll also be available
at the session tonight if you're interested.
And then as Joseph said,
there's booths now, feel free to find them.
Use the app.
Thank you again for coming and supporting Connect2Car.
Appreciate you.
Enjoy the rest of your show.
