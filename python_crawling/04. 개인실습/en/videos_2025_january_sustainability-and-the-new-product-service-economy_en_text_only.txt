- We're good. We have
a thumbs up, awesome.
Well, thank you all for being here.
It's a real treat for me
and hopefully for you.
We have an extraordinary panel
of sustainability leaders,
corporate leaders whose
companies are focusing on
the greatest challenges
that humanity faces today,
from very different
industrial perspectives,
but united in a goal of inventing a future
that is good for all of our
future citizens of this planet.
So I'd like to just go down the row,
these are actually the friends of mine,
so we'll go down the row and
they can introduce themselves
and then I'll give you a little context
and we'll get right into it.
So please.
- Hi, I am Amelia DeLuca.
I'm the Chief Sustainability
Officer at Delta Airlines
and I won't make you raise your hands,
as I often do to say how
many people flew in on Delta,
but I'm hoping you're familiar with Delta
and have enjoyed our
fast, free wifi recently.
- (laughs) I'm Barbara Humpton,
a proud Sky Miles member.
- Yes.
- At Delta.
- Exactly.
- And CEO of Siemens
in the US.
- I'm Lars Stenqvist, I'm
the CTO of Volvo Group.
And the Volvo Group is then trucks, buses,
construction equipment.
It's in principle everything
with a Volvo logo onto it,
but not passenger cars.
- I'm Angela Baker, Chief
Sustainability Officer
of Qualcomm and I'll keep my
miles program just to myself.
- Yes, we didn't invite her
to the sphere last night,
but she lives in DC, so she's forgiven.
- Fantastic.
So what's really exciting
about the panel is,
as I mentioned, each of
the companies is focused
with laser sort of
intensity on sustainability.
And we're gonna talk a
bit about that right now.
It's really exciting,
too, to have companies
that are so committed to
this and keynoting at CES
and talking about sustainability,
because the challenge is
so great and so close in.
So let me give you a
little quick framework
that we can think about
that we're gonna talk to you
and the real experts are gonna
lead us on an exploration
of where they see things going
for their companies and industries.
But when we talk about sustainability,
we really focus on the
notion of the amount of CO2
that's been put into the atmosphere.
And I live about a mile
and a half or two miles
from the fires that are going on
in Southern California right
now and destroying homes,
where I live is fine,
but I think all of us have
seen the recent effects
of weather and that could be storms
for water located communities,
fire, all sorts of really,
you know, impactful and almost
leave you incredulous moments.
And what you see in those
is a global atmosphere
that's heating up and the
reason why it's heating up
and putting more energy
into this closed system
called the Earth that has an atmosphere
that's only five miles high, roughly.
And you can drive that in five minutes
at highway speeds is because
we're taking dinosaurs
and plants from under the
ground called fossil carbon.
And they are all basically,
it's all sort of CO2
and we're using it to energize our world
and it goes in the atmosphere
and it doesn't go away,
for thousands of years.
So it's a massive challenge
to rethink everything we do as humans
in a way that we're not
utilizing that type of energy.
And the good news is that
renewable energy sources
are as prevalent as they
are and it's only growing
and they're the cheapest.
So the the last thing I want to say is
that if you look at this as a negative,
you'll put yourself in
that proverbial frog
that's in the water and
the water's heating up.
You're just in the hot water
and I can't do anything.
The real way to flip this is
that while it's an existential problem,
it's the largest
opportunity for innovation
in the history of humanity.
And to give you a number just
that you might want to use,
the IEA, which is a big
energy agency in Vienna,
says we're spending $2 trillion
a year on clean energy.
Most people think that number
in the next three to five
years, we'll go up to
five trillion a year.
We need to spend as much as we can.
The global economy is
about a hundred trillion,
so that's doable.
It's a new business opportunity.
And just to give you a sense
of how big that number is,
the five largest companies in the world
are all tech companies.
Their market cap is total 15 trillion.
We'll be spending that
every three years or more,
granted to save ourselves from ourselves.
But with companies like we have here,
the focus truly is on mass
scaling the opportunity
to reverse the problems that we're having
and leave future generations
with an Earth they can inhabit.
So with that, I would
actually like to dive right in
and hopefully that was helpful.
But I'd like to, you know, go to Barbara,
because Barbara's company
has an unbelievable history
in the world of sustainability
and its philosophy.
And I was hoping you could
talk a little bit about that,
Barbara, to the audience,
'cause it amazed me
when you gave me the background.
- Happy to do that, John.
Siemens, born over 175 years ago,
and it turned out in 2010,
a year before I joined the company,
the global strategists
came together and said,
"How should we focus
our business strategy?"
And they said, "We wanna
recognize the global mega trends
that are gonna affect our
business for the next,
between now and 2050," five of 'em.
Climate change, urbanization,
the aging demographics
of people everywhere,
the ever increasing global supply chain,
now we say glocal, and the
digitalization of everything,
five global mega trends.
The world is gonna look
completely different in 2050.
How can Siemens technology
actually address the global mega trends?
And it turns out if you
try your business strategy
to inexorable forces,
you're going to grow,
you're going to succeed.
This is the business
opportunity of our generation.
And so today, we publish an
annual sustainability report,
you would see that over
90% of our portfolio
can be used to address
sustainability challenges.
We're talking about decarbonization,
we're talking about energy efficiency.
We're giving people the tools to actually
design for a circular economy.
We're designing for
reusability even, you know,
using materials.
All of those tools, think about this,
using the digital tools that have come
to the commercial world,
to our entertainment world, et cetera,
and applying those to the real world.
I'm talking about AI for real,
combining the real and the digital,
so that we are designing things
that are more sustainable.
We're living in a more sustainable
way with digitalization,
with the tools and technologies
you're seeing at this very show.
We have the ability to do all of this
and be more productive, be more efficient,
and driving profitability,
driving sustainability,
it all goes hand in hand.
It's a fantastic opportunity.
- [John] I love that.
And if you do not do anything else,
but get down to our group members' booths,
at the Siemens booth,
you'll just see a brilliant explanation
of this future vision.
So that really, that really-
- Thanks.
I mean, what we've tried to
do is show our technology
through our customer's work.
So please come visit us.
- Please do.
I want to go to Lars next before Amelia,
then Angela, because Lars's industry,
they create extraordinarily large things.
And just to give you a sense,
we put 40 gigatons of CO2
into the atmosphere every year.
That would be the equivalent
of, just to give you,
that's a large amount, right?
So how large is that?
That would be 311 million Airbus A321s
or Lars's new state-of-the-art truck.
It would be roughly three
and a half billion of those.
My favorite is 8 billion elephants.
But the world that Lars works
in is called hard to abate.
It's very hard to make
these industries green,
like all of our and we're
gonna get to the others, too.
Can you tell me about how
you're thinking about this
as a complete system, because
it's really quite eye-opening.
- Yes, John.
And for us, since we are
in transport and logistics,
we have defined it very, very clearly
that we are in a fantastic industry,
because there will be a lot
of growth going forward.
We are a true growth case as a company.
So there will be much more
transport in the world
going forward, there's no doubt about it.
But we cannot go on as we are doing today,
because the planet can simply not cope
with even what we are
delivering in emissions today.
That means that the new
logistic and transport system
must be sustainable to a
completely different level
compared to today.
So our business idea, our
strategy going forward
is to deliver on the promise
of being fossil free by 2040.
Fossil free, both from
an emission perspective
coming out of the vehicles
but also and completely
decarbonized in the value chain upstreams.
And why 2040?
Because our vehicles are
on the road for 10 years
and by 2050, according
to the Paris Agreement,
our commitment is that the rolling fleet
of Volvo vehicles should
be CO2 free or fossil free.
So for us, John, we are
total around much about this.
This with sustainability is not
besides the normal business,
it's not anything that we are
discussing Friday afternoon
after three o'clock or
something like that.
That's really the business
idea of the company
and we believe that it's both necessary,
from a planet perspective
and it's definitely good business case.
- See, I think exactly to the point.
You have to remember, for the audience,
that roughly 85% of the
emissions of companies
have happened after their product
leaves the actual company's
factories and the like.
So this thinking that we're hearing about
is systems thinking and
it's an extremely complex
challenge and problem.
And that was what Lars,
you know, said so clearly
and what we all have to be doing.
You know, as Barbara as
well was talking about that.
Amelia, I'd like to, you
know, get your thoughts on,
you know, the vision in terms
of where you see Delta going
and you know, the opportunities,
but also there are significant challenges
in all of the industries represented here.
And aviation has a
specifically difficult one,
'cause it's basically moving
fuel and people around.
But you guys have taken a
very, very focused approach
of thinking about what the
next 20 or 30 years looks like,
even in what was called
a hard to abate industry.
So can you just give us,
you know, sort of the
thought process and how you
guys are looking at that?
- Yeah, exactly. We were really proud.
For those that did not
have a chance to join us
at the sphere last night, we
kicked off our celebration
of our hundred year, you know,
centennial birthday of Delta.
And so a hundred years ago,
there was no commercial aircraft flying.
There was crop dusters.
And you think about how far we've come
and how many of us now
travel by, you know, air,
but still only one in
five people in the world
have access to air travel.
And so our mission is to continue to grow
the number of communities that
are connected to air travel,
the number of opportunities
are facilitated by air travel
and we believe we can do
that with all the things
that make Delta special, right?
Safety, best in class,
operational reliability,
incredible customer experience
in a premium service,
and sustainability.
And so last night, we talked
about these three acts.
The past, the present, and the future.
And everything in the
future that Delta's gonna do
is gonna be all the things we're known for
and sustainability.
And we nestle sustainability
in thinking about what we fly,
how we fly, and the fuel we use.
We announced a partnership with Airbus.
We have many partners, of course.
Airbus is just a really
special partner to us.
And they, you know, we
don't make airplanes, right?
There are things we
can do in our operation
to control our fuel efficiency,
and we're doing that.
And then when it comes to
the fuels of the future,
it's gonna take a whole
ecosystem around that.
And so Airbus is committed to helping us
rethink the airplane of the future
that can be immensely more fuel efficient.
They're gonna help us think
about what can we do today,
especially looking at
the way nature operates,
biomimicry to potentially fly like geese,
to be able to start to do
some sort of drafting system,
where the airplane in the
lead is generating the draft
so that the airplane in the
back is potentially saving
five to 8% of fuel as it
crosses the transatlantic.
And then they're gonna help us
with many other great partners
try to rethink about
the fuels of the future.
That they don't need to come
from these finite resources
in the earth, but they can come from
renewable resources, while also
building rural communities.
And that exactly is what has been said.
That is a business imperative.
That's a win-win-win all around.
- Again, you're hearing
about the opportunity
mixed with the challenge,
and the challenge is
driving the opportunity.
So it's really exciting that people,
your companies are really
embracing this in such a big way.
Of course we want as many companies
to think the way you are.
Now we're gonna turn to something
that I think is, you know,
at the core of all of what is going on
in all of our economies, which
is the semiconductor world.
And Angela works at Qualcomm,
which is one of the largest
semiconductor companies,
one of the most innovative
semiconductor companies
in the world, powers so many
devices and large scale things.
And we know that there's some,
you know, issues in terms
of the amount of electricity
being consumed for AI.
I know you're, we could go through stats,
but we won't right now, it's a lot.
It could double the
amount of electricity used
within the next three to five years.
It's roughly, I'll do it, it's roughly..
Data centers are roughly
two to 4% of total CO2
output in the world.
Energy use and GDP are highly correlated.
So the work that you guys are doing
is helping to power a new economy,
and yet there are challenges
that you have in your business.
Could you lay that out
in whatever way you think
the audience would get the
benefit of your thinking
around sort of the
semiconductor sustainability,
you know, cross cut?
- Yeah, absolutely. I mean,
it's a very interesting point.
It's a point that's talked about a lot.
I mean, I think if you've
walked the show floor at all,
you see AI everywhere,
everybody's talking about it.
And there's a lot of promises as to what
AI can deliver, right?
And so from a Qualcomm perspective,
we are really focusing on AI
at the edge or AI on device,
which will have less of an
impact from an energy perspective
than if it goes to the cloud.
And so working with developers
across the ecosystem
to develop technologies
that can be, you know,
where inference can be done
on the edge or at the edge
or on device, which will use less,
it won't be driving
everything to the cloud.
It won't be needing all of
these massive data centers
to power it.
At the same time, there
will still be data centers.
There's a lot of large
cloud companies, right,
that are coming up with, I
think you saw Three Mile Islands
being reopened, right?
Nuclear, like a lot of
these new technologies
or old technologies that
companies are gonna try
to use again.
We're also a member of the
semi climate consortium, right?
We're working with other
semiconductor companies.
Right, 'cause Qualcomm sits
in a unique place, right?
We're primarily fabless.
We don't manufacture the
technology that we make,
we design it for the most part,
but working with others
with across the value chain
to help governments or
work with governments
in these areas like
Singapore, you know, Korea,
Taiwan, where it's very
expensive to get renewable energy
or impossible to get renewable energy,
to help them bring more
green energy to the grid
so that when you've got the
fabs or the the foundries
where they're making
these technologies, right?
So that they can be powered
by renewable energy.
So I think there's a lot of really
interesting things happening.
We're looking, you know,
AI use cases across auto,
you know, in handsets, MPCs.
And if you stop by the Qualcomm booth,
you can see sort of all of
these latest technologies.
We're really focused on
sort of this on-prem, right?
Like on device or AI at the edge.
And we think this is
gonna be a game changer
in terms of, you know, not
driving everything to the cloud,
which is really gonna increase
energy and water usage,
which is also a huge problem.
- It's a great counterintuitive point,
'cause a lot of people think
that charging your iPhone
or your Android phone is
actually the largest energy use.
It's actually the phone talking
to servers all the time.
So charging it is almost
nil in the global context.
- And a lot of it's
around the build, right?
So for a company like Qualcomm
who's mixed semiconductor,
it's very small piece of the phone,
but the plastic and the
phone and those other things
obviously have a much larger footprint.
- So when you're thinking about climate,
as Angela was just saying,
or sorry, around carbon,
you have to look at what
are the biggest pieces
of the system that are
providing, you know,
the fossil fuel outputs
or inputs to the system.
And when I think about, you know,
where each of you have been,
it's a integrated world of supply chains
and partners on the downstream,
which is outta the factory
who are often, you know,
they sell to end customers.
And then you have all the people,
Volvo told us this morning
they have 50,000 direct suppliers,
which is just extraordinary.
Barbara, I know you have
a great example on this,
of thinking this way,
and then Lars, you can
speak to this as well,
that supply chain is a great place
for helping make this problem one,
an opportunity for suppliers,
but two, for really reducing
carbon output quickly.
And I know you're focused on that.
- We are, we're focused on that.
Again, the question is
what knowhow can we bring
to the table in order to
facilitate this progress
with our groups of customers?
And you quickly see systems
thinking is required.
There's no one company, no
matter how big they get,
that actually verticalizes everything.
You really have to believe in ecosystems.
And actually what's even more
powerful is when industries,
whether it's the airline
industry or the tech industry,
you see their Chief
Sustainability Officers
stepping forward and saying,
"We're gonna work together,
because there are things we
need to do as a community."
Well, the automotive industry
in Europe is a great example.
If this is the example
you're thinking of, Catena-X.
- That's it,
- Right?
So what is the carbon
footprint of an automobile?
Well, to answer that question,
you have to get into the supply chain.
And I'm telling you it is
many, many, many layers deep.
Well, who's gonna be
revealing that kind of company
proprietary information and
building all of that up?
Turns out that we can use a
technology like blockchain,
which gives us the ability
to anonymize certain data,
but to share critical components,
put it onto a secure blockchain
so that within that supply chain,
there's clear communication
about the carbon footprint.
It can be then built up and
calculated using the data
that's in this very secure format.
This kind of commitment from
European car manufacturers
to recognize that solving this problem
helps us solve the bigger problem.
To me, this is a brilliant example.
- I just love it because you know,
the words that people often say is
you can't solve a system problem,
which is the climate problem in silos.
And the key piece is
bringing data together
that typically was competitive data
that you didn't want others to see.
But that is, of course,
cutting your nose off
to spite your face and trying
to solve a systems problem.
So there was an example this morning
that was so impactful to me, which is,
and Lars, you can tell us about it,
which is the Volvo group partnering
with its largest competitor
to solve the problem for humanity.
Can you tell us a little
more what you talked about?
It was amazing.
- Well, if I may start then John,
for us then we see very clearly that this
partnership is so important.
Our CEO and President Martin
Lundstedt has an expression
where he's stating partnership
is truly the new leadership.
And we are coming from a
point, let's say 10 years ago,
where we were extremely transactional,
extremely transactional,
sending out thick books of
specifications to suppliers
and asking them to suppliers exactly
according to that specification.
That doesn't work anymore. That's gone.
Now we know approximately in
what direction we are going.
We need to team up with those ones
that are on the same path,
thinking in the same direction,
sharing the same values,
wanting to solve the same
kind of problem without a
thick book of specifications.
So we are doing that
downstreams towards customers,
upstreams with normal suppliers,
but all sudden a little
bit unorthodox for us,
reaching out to our competitors.
And in this case,
we are reaching out to our main
competitor, Daimler Trucks.
It's really us and them against
each other in the world.
And we have decided that we
want to set up a joint venture
around something as core
as the software defined
vehicle platform, hardware and software
up to the level of the operative system.
This is really the core
of the future vehicles.
And that means that in the longer run,
we will have identical computers on board
on the vehicles, in both groups.
We will have identical software
after operative system.
But from that level and onwards,
we will continue to be fierce competitors.
So we are creating a joint venture,
where we are going to be friends, family,
hug each other in the board
meetings once a quarter
and every single minute of
the rest of the quarter,
the instruction to my engineers
is to beat the **** out of them.
- Love that.
- And you know, so why are we doing this?
Because we see that it
will be excessive amount
of investments in these
areas going forward.
Volumes in our industry
is relatively small
compared to (indistinct) et cetera.
So what we are doing here is that we are
freeing up resources in this development.
And to be honest, it is
not a computer as such,
it is not operative system as such
that will define customer value.
That will define if we
will win or lose the game.
It's all the vehicle
functions on top of this,
which we are going to develop on our own.
So for us, it's so
interesting with partnership,
it's downstreams, it's
upstream, it is with academia,
it is with competitors.
Partnership is the new leadership.
- I love that phrase.
And you know, it reminds me
an example that you can use
is from Angela's world.
Semiconductors are
customized in a lot of cases,
but they're often not.
They're put together to
provide different products
and services.
Lars, you're working in a
particularly important vertical,
but the innovation happens
on top in product service
differentiation.
But it would be as if we
didn't have a, you know,
specification for how our cell
phones talk to the network.
You're not gonna innovate unless you have
something like that, which
brings the thought to mind,
which is, and anybody can raise their hand
and take this one, which is this notion of
you have this world and
we're enthralled by it,
specifically here in the US,
of Silicon Valley innovation,
one of the most innovative
places in the world.
But what we were talking about before
and what I like to say is
the greatest VC companies
in the world mostly were software focused
and they would get maybe
one to 10% success rates
in their portfolios.
That means 90 to 99% of their activities
and investments fail.
Well, if the planet is at
the state that it's in,
we can't only rely on that.
It's sort of a mythology that goes on.
But there's something really important
that I've learned about and
these companies here have,
which is called entrepreneurship.
And so anybody would like to pick it up
or you know, from aerospace
to, what is this feeling
that you have about driving innovation
in working with the outside world?
Lars was just mentioning it,
but does someone wanna pick up on that,
'cause it's super important, I think.
- Yeah, I'll take it.
You know, I think sometimes
we wonder what is our role
as an airline to be innovative, right?
And one of the things that we
stood up at CES two years ago
was our Sustainable Skies lab.
And there was such a great
example yesterday that came up
with Airbus, again, coming
back to this flying V concept
that Airbus has proven
the science of this.
We know that this works, that the airplane
that's following behind
will get a 5% reduction.
The challenge is how do you
operationalize that, right?
And that's where you need
that entrepreneurial spirit,
but it has to also work in the real world.
And so these labs take that
and essentially translate
this exercise from a lab
into the real world because that is often
the hardest step, to a degree.
Yes, financing is a challenge.
Proving technology is a challenge,
but at least in our world,
the hardest thing is
how do you push it into an industry
that is just so complex
in terms of what we do.
But we have to start to
do these little pilots
and we also have to accept failure.
We did one this last year
with a company called Taxi,
but it wasn't a failure.
But it also didn't end up,
we didn't end the year
the way we thought it was.
And we had to come to terms
with that to celebrate the fact
that we piloted the product
not in the way we thought
we would, we didn't
necessarily get the results
that we wanted, we didn't
get all the parties on board,
but we still did something about it.
And learning that is
better than doing nothing.
- So, you know, I like that,
'cause these learning
systems are really important
and they're not traditional to the books
that Lars was mentioning
about product spec
to now needing innovation to
come from the supply chain.
And Barbara, in your world,
you work on some of the most complex,
multi-dimensional engineering
challenges at city scale
and beyond and building
entire infrastructures.
So to the extent that, you know,
you need to partner and have
an entrepreneurial spirit
and look for outside partnerships,
how do you guys think about that
just in terms of making it work
and we need to all make it work
faster, as you pointed out?
- Yeah, you know, this is
the lifeblood of a company
that survives more than a hundred years,
or in our case, 175 years.
It's pivot or die. It's innovate or die.
And I have a popcorn popper in my head
because this is where the opportunity is.
I'm looking at Annie Satto here,
she is our Head of Communications.
She introduced me to Fast Company
when I first stepped into the CEO role.
And I remember talking to the
editor at the time who said,
"Whoa.
Whoa, wait, you're telling me
a large company like yours,
sounds like you guys
are really innovative."
And a couple of years later after proving,
you know, showing the kind of
innovation we've been doing,
it's not just Silicon Valley companies
who can drive this.
Siemens was named World
Changing Company of the Year
by Fast Company.
One of the proudest moments of my tenure.
Well, where does this come from?
It comes from imbuing that
feeling, that innovation happens
with two people over a napkin.
Right?
That's where every innovation starts.
There's no magic, you know, machine
that puts out innovation.
No, it's people getting ideas
and then putting them into action.
Now in our case, what we try to do
is foster this in every aspect.
We've got a VC arm,
it's off exploring what's
the startup community doing
and are there things going on
that we need to be paying attention to?
We do it by investing.
We're actually, we have a
Siemens Financial Services
that goes and invests in an
ecosystem of small companies.
They've chosen things like
the future of agriculture
or battery manufacturing as areas
where we can deploy capital
with outside entrepreneurs
to get things going.
But when we did that, we say,
"But wait, what have we got inside?
We've got battery experts here."
And when you come to our booth,
right, you'll be able to meet folks.
So how can we tap into the
knowhow in our own organization.
We actually built a
decarbonization business optimizer
using Siemens knowhow,
handing it to our Siemens
Financial Services colleagues
so they could be advising
outside companies
about how they could start
their sustainability journey.
I mean, this is everywhere.
The challenge to our
organization is to simply say
"What talent, what resources
do you have in your remit?
And how can you be working toward
that sustainability objective?"
- I think it's a great point because
what it really reflects in my mind
is this need to be able to scale quickly
given the timeframes
that we're dealing with.
So you know, the classic
example in material science
to get green steel, you'd go
from lab and literally grams.
But to make the tons that Lars needs
could be decades in just
literally getting it to work.
So we're not talking about
like finding investors,
it's literally material
science, physics, chemistry.
So these types of amplifications
that we're talking about are what we need
because we don't have all the time.
- I'd love to ask how this
works in the semiconductor.
- I was just gonna go to semiconductors.
- Well, I mean, but mainly because,
I mean, it's such a
capital intensive business,
it has such long development cycles.
How do you drive that kind of innovation?
- And can I add to that?
Just maybe it'll help frame it too
is you're the most
partner driven industry.
I'm not saying the rest aren't,
but your partners spec in
many respects what you need.
So can you combine your
answer with that thought
and what Barbara just asked you,
or take it wherever you'd like?
- Yeah, I mean obviously
I'm not on the design side,
so I think there's probably other people-
- Chief Sustainability
Officer, doing the good work.
- Yeah, there's probably
other people at the company.
- With the green outfit on, perfect.
- Yeah. I'm very on brand.
But I do think for a
company like Qualcomm,
I mean obviously many
companies are very innovative,
but innovation at the heart of what we do,
we're 40-year-old tech company, right?
We've been doing this for a long time.
And under our current CEO,
really looking at a
diversification strategy.
So traditionally, right,
had been in handsets,
but it's handsets, it's auto,
it's AI, it's PCs, right?
And so those all have slightly different,
call it what you will, right?
And in addition to that,
once the semiconductor is developed
or once the chip is developed
and then it's out there, what
are the use cases for it?
Because there's so many use cases for it.
And the way that, you know,
I might be approaching use
cases, better for the planet,
better for people, for
humanity, social, you know,
might not have been the intended use.
You can think about like
GPS when GPS was designed,
it was for emergency services obviously,
but now like we've got programs
where fishermen are using it
or fisherpeople are using
it in many countries
around the world to ensure
that they're not crossing
international waters when
they're fishing, right?
So I mean, that's like
a very basic example,
but I think that's the key for innovation.
And for a company like Qualcomm,
which continues to innovate.
We are looking at things, I
mean it's been in our DNA,
but reducing the power that's needed.
Every chip, every new product
that we design, right?
That's not a sustainability
play, that's a customer play.
We've been doing that for a long time.
We wanna continue to drive performance
and to increase performance
while reducing power usage.
Why? Because our customers
are demanding that.
I'm a big fan of it because
from an energy perspective
it's a good thing.
But I think at the end of the day,
it's a business imperative.
And so I think for a company like Qualcomm
with over 140,000 patent or you know,
we continue to innovate.
It's something that the
company is very focused on.
And I think whether it's the process,
whether it's using digital
twins to design semiconductors,
like whatever that's
gonna be in the future,
I think it's imperative for us.
- [John] So I wanna ask, oh just..
Do you want a quick follow on on that?
- Sure. Because it's so good
to listen to you, Angela.
Because so much needs to happen
in the electronics industry.
What we are doing when
we are decarbonizing
the manufacturing footprint
of our vehicle as we take it
as a sort kind of
rubber, et cetera, et cetera.
Electronics comes surprisingly high, 10%,
all the manufacturing
footprint is electronics.
So Barbara, and you know,
there is some work to do here.
- We are hearing from-
- I do wanna, the points
are really interesting,
'cause if you think about
how we've been talking
and what we've been talking about,
we've been talking from a
leadership point of view
and so you know, many
companies, 30% of the S&amp;P 500
does not have a net zero plan.
So there are many company and the US
is a little bit all
over the place on this,
but many companies don't have
the commitment you're hearing.
Commitment doesn't mean it's easy.
Commitment doesn't mean
you'll hit the targets
at the right point, but it's a commitment.
I wanna flip it because in
many engineering driven firms,
the real issue in carbon
is in the bottom up,
the material science, how
you make things and the like.
But there's another really
important opportunity
in business around climate,
climate tech and sustainability,
which is your own people
and them feeling that
they are part of something
that's not destroying the planet.
You know, think cigarette companies,
once we all knew it caused
cancer and they said it wasn't.
But Angela, I can only
imagine what it might do
for the broader population
of people who work for Delta
to know that you're in
a leadership position
in a hard to abate industry.
Can you tell us about how that
actually changes the dynamic
in your company?
- You know, I think part
of this is evolution, too.
When we all started on our
sustainability journeys, right?
We talked so much about net zero,
being aligned to the Paris
Agreement, getting investors,
you know, satisfied with where we were at.
And now I think we spent
the last year-ish not only
building into our business,
that's the business imperative,
but making sure we deeply
understand how our customers
and our employees feel about the topic
so that we're meeting their needs.
Every one of us is an individual
and I think when it
comes to sustainability,
it's a very individual feeling
about what's important to me,
both at work and on the personal side.
So a couple examples I'll give
you from our customer data,
75% of customers, Gen Z,
premium loyalists, you name it,
they expect us to be sustainable.
We are a premium brand. They
expect us to be sustainable.
So that was great news.
Probably not super unsurprising.
That's great news.
When you actually ask them
what is causing you tension,
what is making you feel like
we're not sustainable, right?
I live and breathe CO2,
their issue is the plastic cup, right?
They're like, "I don't have
any plastic in my life.
And then I get on board this plane
and I have five plastic cups
that I see you're throwing in the trash."
Okay, so we prioritize and fast tracked,
making sure that we had a
truly plastic free paper cup,
which we debuted a couple months ago.
We'll roll out to the whole system.
Does that solve my carbon
problem? It does not.
But it keeps that trust
coming along with us
as we decarbonize a hard
to decarbonize sector.
Similarly, on the employee front,
they have so many different ideas
because they see our operation.
One of the things we're
trying to do is make sure
every employee who's a
frontline employee at Delta
knows what they can do to contribute
to our sustainability goals.
And I'm proud to say that
more than half of Delta's
100,000 people and almost all
of our frontline employees
now every single day know
what action they can take
to help us save fuel.
Now again, are they into it
because they're into saving the planet
or they're into our
saving our bottom line,
doesn't really matter,
it works either way.
- It's an opportunity.
- And those have been
the unlocks, 'cause each one
of us, we're in our roles,
but we will move on at some point.
And so when you talk about systems,
you have to build it into the system
so that the customers and employees both
will carry it forward,
regardless of if I'm the CSO.
- Yes. Yes, and.
So I'll share with you all
that I've been approached
by several Chief Sustainability Officers
from different companies going,
"How did you do this at Siemens?"
You know, it's integral
to the business plan.
And I shared with you that we were
looking at the mega trends.
And by the way, in 2015,
Siemens was the first
large industrial company
to make a commitment to
be carbon neutral by 2030.
To be halfway there by 2020
and do the hard stuff in this decade
we're living through now.
But the company did more than that.
The board actually made it measurable.
We've insisted that if we set targets,
they have to be auditable.
So we've got the financial reporting
we're doing on a regular basis.
Quarterly, quarterly, quarterly,
and annually we're putting out a document
of our non-financial measures.
This is showing the world that
we're true to the strategy
that we've put in place and
we hold ourselves accountable.
We audit the results.
And I think employees
feel great when they go,
"Oh, this rises to the same
level as our accountability
to shareholders."
- I do want to just,
those two answers were fantastic.
I just wanna highlight, 'cause
Amelia gave you a really
great point, which is you
can't just look at the thing
that people think is gonna
make a big difference.
Only 10% of plastic in
the world is recycled.
Plastic is made of oil.
So to the extent it's
reducing the amount of oil
you take outta the ground
and put into the atmosphere,
that's decent, but 10%,
we're long gone before
that's a difference.
What you said was build trust,
do that and primarily do the carbon thing.
'Cause that is the key consequential
thing to be working on.
- And John, I would be
remiss if I didn't add
that we did paper cups
and we also saved 41
million gallons of jet fuel
through our carbon council last year.
But our customers,
honestly, they don't know.
They don't care about it.
Anytime you land into LA anyone,
guys, we've changed how you're
landing, you'll never know.
But we're saving a bunch
of fuel when we do that.
Do you want to know that? No, you don't.
No you don't. And that's okay, right?
And so the whole point is
it's really, I agree with you,
it's the, and right now,
everything about sustainability
is we do everything else
at our companies perfectly.
Then we add in this other and,
and then we meet you where
your individual needs are at.
- So in a B2C world, that
has a different flavor
than in a Qualcomm world.
So in a Qualcomm world, Angela,
what is the sort of the challenges
and therefore I think of the longest-
- I have many.
- That's where I was gonna
go, for the bottom up of,
you know, not only just the
engineering and the like,
but getting it to sort of
move from the C-suite down to,
there's the virtual fab shop floor.
- Yeah, I mean I think,
you know, as I said,
we sit in a unique place
in the industry and right,
we have basically eight primary
manufacturing suppliers.
And those eight suppliers
are the suppliers
that supply to everybody else, right?
It's the TSMCs and the
Samsungs of the world.
And you know, we are working
with our supply chain
as our supply chain is also working
with all these other customers,
but there's only so far you can move them
because we have to make products, right?
So I think that is a challenge.
It's something that we're
continuing to work through.
A big part of us for scope three, right,
is that category 11, which
is use of sold goods.
That's like way bigger footprint
than purchase goods or
like the procurement,
the money you're spending on things.
But there's no one way to quantify that.
It's like if you looked at all
five semiconductor companies,
everybody would have a different formula.
It would look completely different.
You can't compare it, half of it's voodoo.
Like because no one's
figured it out yet, right?
So we're trying to work together
with other semiconductor companies
to identify what is that,
what does that look like?
I think it's really
interesting what Delta's done.
I mean, I think you really
do need that employee buy-in.
And a lot of this regulation,
particularly that's coming out of Europe,
I mean, we are just working
with so many more folks
in the last two years across the company
than we were before.
And arguably we probably
should have been doing it.
But again, as a B2B company,
there wasn't as much of a push.
But I think getting employees
engaged from the C-suite,
but all the way to, you know,
front, what'd you call them,
frontline employees?
And I mean, everybody really
has to be part of this journey
because it's not just gonna
happen in engineering,
it's not just gonna
happen in sustainability.
It's not just gonna happen at the C-suite.
It really, it's procurement,
it's legal, it's finance,
it's supply chain, right, it's everybody.
- So we are at the end
of what I would've called
a C-suite and practical Masterclass
in how the best corporations in the world
can focus on trying to
change and make a future
that really is better for all.
I think the things that
have risen to the top for me
is this new notion of
thinking in a system,
partnering data collection
and being analytic
about what you're doing.
Being very open and transparent
where there are very
hard to solve problems.
And if the leading companies in the world
that we have on stage are emphasizing that
and making it part of their core DNA,
it allows other companies,
no matter what the political environment,
no matter what the, you know,
speed bumps to use a car, a truck example.
But no matter what the problems are,
the long-term trajectory
has object lesson companies
that you can point to so that
others in the financial world,
in the investing world that
have a lot of influence,
say "They're doing it."
Not only government saying,
"You need to do it,"
they're doing it, it's
good business, and do it.
And I'll leave you with the
point that we started with.
This is the largest investment opportunity
in the history of humanity.
Every three years we'll spend as much
as the entire market cap for
the 10 most valuable companies.
Each of you, wherever
you are in your company,
can advocate for the consequential actions
which are about carbon that
you heard everybody talk about.
And if you do that, it becomes infectious.
As a positive example,
I've heard these companies,
you could say, that are
really making this a core,
whether it's to keep
their employees engaged
and then build on that, or
to reinvent supply chains
or to deliver products that
have never existed before
in the truck and equipment world,
or to change the way the world computes.
So you're all part of this as we are,
and that's the solution
to a systems problem.
It's a system of a social
nature, coming together
first over a napkin,
to use Barbara's point,
and then delivering at scale.
So we thank you, an incredible panel.
I couldn't have learned more.
And thank you for listening to us
and thank you to our panelists.
