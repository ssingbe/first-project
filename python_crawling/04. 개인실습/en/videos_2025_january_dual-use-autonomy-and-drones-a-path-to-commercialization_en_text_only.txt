<v ->My name's Mike Embrescia,</v>
I am the Chief Development Officer
for "Carnegie Robotics"
based in Pittsburgh PA.
We have a really cool name "Carnegie" before it,
but it is not the university, okay?
So, you know,
half the room's gonna walk out,
"Oh, I thought I was seeing someone CMU."
We were actually spun out
of Carnegie Mellon University,
and we have a very close relationship,
as does everybody on this panel here.
But, with us up here are four colleagues
from the Pittsburgh area,
that are all focused in drones,
marine, and military,
and we're gonna get to them in just a second.
Should I get to them in a second,
or can I tell my story?
I'm gonna tell my story first.
So, you all are here,
and you wanna you know,
talk about autonomy et cetera,
and I'm sure a lot of you
have also heard about Pittsburgh,
why Pittsburgh?
You know, why is Pittsburgh a buzz globally
with all things robotics?
Well yeah, Carnegie Mellon
has a lot to do with it,
but I figured I'd give ya a quick story,
I'll give you the quick 90-second,
whenever people come into our building,
what we like to share with them,
and here's how it goes.
Pittsburgh is the robotics
capital of the world,
we believe that very firmly
and here's why.
In the early '90s,
CMU, Carnegie Mellon University
and NASA put a bunch of money into a pot,
now some people may correct me on this story,
but this is just how we look at it.
CMU and NASA put a bunch of money into a pot,
they stirred that pot,
and out, spit out the child,
the "NREC",
the "National Robotics Engineering Center",
the "NREC",
that is the...
The large facility that houses
the Carnegie Mellon Robotics effort.
And so, the powers that be at the time,
they said,
"Where we wanna put this new facility?
We wanna put it on campus?
Nah, let's put it in the Lawrence Field
District of Pittsburgh."
"You mean that blighted,
rundown former steel town
that's about a mile
and a half outside of Downtown Pittsburgh?
You know all the steel companies left in the '70s
and '80s?"
"Yeah, that place."
"You mean where the police cars,
and the sirens,
and people getting shot every other day,
you mean that part of town?"
"Yeah, that part of town?"
"Well, why?"
"Because they have
all this amazing building stock.
They had these massive warehouses
left over from when steel
and manufacturing was the mecca in Pittsburgh."
"Great."
So, NREC was established.
In the early '90s,
they had a director,
coincidentally happened to be my CEO,
and my current boss,
who helped build the NREC
to a few hundred people.
And then, subsequently,
Carnegie Mellon did something really neat,
they established the world's first PhD
and Masters Program in Robotics,
"Ah, so that's why."
Lot of folks from across the globe
started to matriculate to Pittsburgh
to get this new cutting-edge degree,
so there's where you started to see this...
This rumbling of activity in tech,
and AI that really started to blossom
in our backyard, right?
And so today,
we boast about 120 robotics companies up
and down what the media likes to call
"Robotics Row", right?
Lot of the companies were there
before there was a "row",
the gentleman to my left here
is one of those people,
our company was certainly there
before there was a "row",
and there's a lot of upstarts here as well.
But the reason I share that story with you,
is because the four-people seated to my left,
are four of the...
Four of some of the premiere companies
that we have in our backyard,
so we're very happy to have them
here in Vegas with us.
So, without further adieu,
I'm gonna introduce Sanjiv Singh
who's the Founder CEO of "Near Earth Autonomy".
I recently found out that Sanjiv was the first
Masters in Robotics out of Carnegie Mellon,
possibly the world, so um...
We have Phil Hahn here,
Phil was until recently,
the Chief Strategy Officer for "AFWERX"
based in Pittsburgh,
who has, I believe as of this week,
started a new role with Divergent,
he can share all that about...
All of that with you,
also Lieutenant Colonel in the service.
we have Xiaoyu Kaess,
Co-founder and COO of "Aquatonomy".
And we have Olga Pogoda from KEF Robotics,
K-E-F Robotics here,
wonderful drone company.
So, here's our panel, guys.
Hey, you done hearing me talk? Right.
<v ->Keep it going.</v>
<v ->Oh okay, you got it.</v>
Xiaoyu, I'll start with you,
because you're the nicest one to me today.
Why don't you tell us
a little bit about Aquatonomy?
Now, full-transparency?
I actually learned about your company
watching a Sunday news program
and said,
"I really like what you guys are doing."
And then, two days later,
I got asked to do a panel with you.
<v Xiaoyu>Oh, what an honor,</v>
thank you, thank you.
I'm Xiaoyu Kaess,
co-founder and COO of Aquatonomy,
at Aquatonomy, we're creating underwater drones
to address the inspection of underwater assets,
they're including,
but not limited to dams,
bridges, and ports,
and we provide action-driven insights
to help the owners
make better maintenance decisions
and strategize their cost,
and get confident decisions,
and get better financial-return.
<v Mike>Great, thank you.</v>
Olga, how 'bout you guys?
<v ->Hi, my name is Olga,</v>
I'm the Chief Operating Officer at KEF Robotics.
At KEF, we work on GPS-denied navigation,
so what we try to do is build software
that leverages cameras,
and other very low-cost,
off-the-shelf censors,
to get an aircraft from point "A" to point "B",
and back,
and then, maybe do something smart along the way.
And we wanna do that in highly-contested
GPS-denied communication jams environments.
<v ->Well, it's great to be back in Vegas,</v>
I spent a lot of my former years
as a flight-test engineer out this way.
To your point earlier,
I need to add "former" in front of my role
at AFWERX, I just...
As of this week,
transitioned out back to the private sector.
AFWERX as a whole?
It's the innovation,
and investment arm of the air force
and space force,
so I spent the last four
and a half years building that out
in really the way that we work in the DoD
to bridge the technology gap
and work with commercial entities,
to partner with the government
and find pathways through,
and I think a lot of the panelists here with me
have experienced that process that we've built
over the last four
and a half years,
and we've executed well over $5-billion
in my time at AFWERX.
I'm transitioning over
to "Divergent Technologies",
it's a advanced manufacturing company,
started out in the automobile sector
to 3D print vehicles,
so Singer Vehicles is underneath that
with super cars,
so I do everything from Bugatti parts,
and now I'm working with our former director
at AFWERX Nate Diller,
working through
and developing the Aerospace &amp; Defense section
of Divergent Technologies.
<v ->Great, thanks Mike.</v>
So, I'm Sanjiv Singh,
I'm the CEO of "Near Earth Autonomy",
what we do,
is we build an autonomy stack
for all kinds of aircraft,
but we are focused on rotorcraft,
and we're focused on logistic missions,
so we have a big engagement with the DoD,
especially the marine corp
and the army,
to work on various scales of aircraft.
And our value proposition,
I like to say is that we enable aircraft
to fly safe,
land safe,
do it without GPS,
even when things go wrong.
And the idea is that,
if the world were perfect,
and the aircraft were perfect,
then you know,
you don't need any sensors,
and you just take off,
and fly some...
Fly some...
Going through some breadcrumbs,
but in fact,
the world is not perfect,
all sorts of things in maps are not correct,
you have weather,
you have things break down on an aircraft,
so what we want is autonomy,
to be able to do what a pilot would do,
which is to deal with the varying conditions
on the aircraft.
So, for different scales of aircraft,
this matters differently,
but especially if they're flying low,
if they're gonna be...
The root that's been given to them
is gonna go through a tower,
they should see the tower
and fly around it, okay?
So, the autonomy part we've been doing
for a long time,
and the big focus of our company right now
is to make sure that the autonomy is there
when you need it.
So, autonomy is gonna keep you out of trouble,
but how do you know that it's gonna be there?
And that's what you need
when you get to a larger aircraft,
for example, if you're flying
a Black Hawk autonomously,
then you better be able to say
to all the stakeholders like,
"Look, here's why even if some
of the main systems on the aircraft
fail during flight,
the aircraft is gonna be okay."
So, that's the emphasis on our program,
of our company,
we develop this...
This kind of software
and hardware combination that,
that aircraft use to do their mission.
<v ->Thank you, that's wonderful.</v>
So, a couple of ground rules
that I did not mention at the top.
First of all,
I didn't share anything about Carnegie Robotics,
if ya ask later,
I'll tell ya.
But, this is really about you guys.
And trust me,
I will tell you,
'cause I'll talk a lot about what we do.
Also, if you wanna go on social media,
and you wanna start you know,
saying amazing things about this panel,
please tag everybody here,
their names,
and their companies,
'cause we're selfish like that.
So, the theme up here,
and it just kinda hit...
It kinda struck me this morning
when we were having our pre-brief,
that, with respect to autonomy,
and drones,
and heck, even AI these days,
lot of the folks probably thought
they were gonna come in here
talking exclusively about
commercial-type opportunities.
However, there is a huge tilt towards defense,
pretty much in everything that we do
on this stage here,
how does that,
focusing on defense-work,
how does that help get your product to market
and help grow your business?
Because after all,
we are not non-profits.
So Olga, help us understand that,
I think we just had a conversation about that.
<v ->Yeah, I mean,</v>
I think we've seen over the years
that the military is a great first customer.
First of all,
they have funding to help you
take a very early prototype,
to something that can be tested,
even on the front lines,
and there's very...
Various programs that you can go through,
and maybe we'll touch on them later.
But, as we've seen throughout the years,
you know GPS, right?
Like, we're trying to replace GPS,
but GPS itself,
when it was first invented,
it was first invented for the military,
they were the first adopters,
they were the first users
before it hit the market.
So, I think what we're seeing
with a lot of different technologies
is that the DoD is really good at testing things
and being that first customer,
when the commercial market
is just not ready for your product yet,
it may be in the future,
and there's applications that exist,
but it just needs time to get there,
and that's kind of the space that I live in.
So, I think that in the future,
there'll be plenty of opportunity
for our company to work with commercial airlines,
with rotorcraft,
with all different kinds of commercial customers,
but right now,
it's really defense.
<v ->Right. And years ago I...</v>
Thank you.
Years ago, I learned about "Near Earth Autonomy",
we had not yet know each other,
and you had...
It was published that you were doing
some work with Boeing,
and that put my antennae up
because I always wanted to be a pilot,
and Boeing makes airplanes,
"So maybe I should go work
for Near Earth Autonomy."
But again, your business...
You know, maybe we will, buddy.
But your business is...
Your business is really evolved
to focus on military work,
can you help explore that with everybody?
<v ->Yeah, so like Olga said you know,</v>
almost every aviation innovation
has started with the military,
and the idea is that if you look
at the commercial world,
commercial end-users don't want something
that is sort of there,
and comes with an engineer,
but the military is willing to do that,
so they...
Big emphasis on robustness,
big emphasis on performance,
but not so much on the economics.
So, the problem with the...
With staking new technology is,
straight to the commercial world
is that it needs very deep pockets
if you're going to make everything work,
it has to be...
It has to be feasible,
it has to be easy to use,
and it has to be economically viable,
so all of those things are hard to make work
at the beginning,
to get this technology in a military setting
where there is funding,
there's a lower bar for success,
and a higher tolerance for risk,
this is what makes it much more easy to work,
start with the military.
And then of course these things migrate,
like from the internet to GPS,
to all sorts of other...
Every aircraft that has been,
except for one rotorcraft,
has started with a military application.
Right, and Xiaoyu when you
and team got Aquatonomy off the ground,
was there an emphasis on filling a gap?
Filling a need for the military services
with your product?
<v ->Actually, our two technical co-founders</v>
started their early career by solving complex
national security challenges,
one is Dr. Michael Cass,
he dedicated 15-years of academic research
on autonomous navigation,
and mapping in GPS in night environments,
and his work was used by the navy,
the army,
and founded by the Office of Naval Research,
and army research labs at first,
and his work is used
in the International Space Station
before we incorporated our company.
Our second technical co-founder
also dedicated his work
in marine robotics collaboration,
he was a award winner of Young Investigator Award
by the navy...
Office of Naval Research.
And so, we're kind of testament
of how national security needs drove innovation,
that later we could use
as a solid tactical foundation
in commercial applications
and we continue to observe this as a trend.
National security applications drive,
especially in defining old,
pioneering use-cases
and goals,
and be a stable,
predictable founding source
for innovations to happen.
<v ->Right. And, so with military work,</v>
the requirements,
there's a high-bar,
middle-spec, middle-grade et cetera,
so that translates well
if ever the commercial markets
ever were to take over,
or integrate set product
across their portfolio.
So, I can't see a show of hands here
of folks who have worked with military,
or any defense conduit in any way,
or form, but Phil Hahn at AFWERX,
is accustomed to people like us
beating down his door,
asking for help
and guidance, really we just want money,
but he helps guide us,
he and his folks would help guide us
towards the right path
of this particular program,
this funding conduit,
"Here's where the necessary players are,
and here's where you have to go to achieve
said project."
So, can you help understand...
Help everybody understand
your side of the fence
when you're dealing with people like us?
<v ->Sure, yeah.</v>
So, I mean,
a lot of why AFWERX was founded,
was to kind of bridge that gap
of the commercial innovation to the...
To the department,
in our case,
air force
and space force.
But, if you look back the...
You know, the research labs,
the DARPA's of the world,
they still...
They still have all all their projects
and programs that they're working,
but we really needed to tap into
all of the amazing technology that was out there,
we talked through the requirements process,
the acquisition process in the...
In the DoD is very slow,
and a lot of times we have to have
that very solid requirement at the forefront.
And so, what we did at AFWERX,
was we developed something called
"The Open Topic"
and this was more of a,
"Come pitch the government,
come show us what your technology is,
we wanna be a partner,
we don't need to be the only partner."
I think in that aspect of it.
And so, that has lead
to different funding streams,
different ways that you
could get your foot in the door,
get some...
Get some of that you know,
startup capital,
get some funding early on,
and then provide those opportunities,
provide that foresight to...
To showcase your technology
to different parts of the DoD,
that we could then pass that along.
And so, that development life cycle
was something that we built out at AFWERX
and at the other innovation
organizations in the DoD to really help
with more of a...
Think of it more as a partnership,
instead of just an ownership aspect
that the government is starting to play.
<v ->Great. I'm gonna pick on you a little bit more,</v>
so keep that mic.
<v ->What we've seen,</v>
the companies have seen the military evolve,
and I'm gonna get off the military talk
in a second.
But, we've seen the necessary groups evolve
from just a traditional RFI/RFP process,
with evolutions of having an AFWERX,
having a SOFWERX,
DIU has been especially refreshing,
the "Defensive Innovative Unit",
which in translation,
instead of going to the robust,
$700-billion army website
and looking at it,
and you know it's...
It's a massive,
massive entity, the army.
But, the DIU has unleashed
a really interesting conduit
where you go to a website with great gooey,
great user interface,
it's easy to navigate,
it's modern, they put out a project,
this is all new within the last couple of years,
and instead of closing down your business
for a couple of weeks to write
this robusto proposal,
they simply ask you for a five-page
written proposal,
or 15-slides, not 16,
not 13, 15-slides.
Ya hit "submit",
they let you know within two or three-weeks
whether or not you move on,
and they have simply streamlined the process.
So, how have you seen that evolve
in your career,
I mean, now your former career at AFWERX?
You had a hand in helping
generate that evolution.
<v ->Yeah, the whole point coming into this</v>
was understanding it through the eyes
of the small business,
through the eyes of the startup,
through the eyes of the technologist.
You know, before...
Before really the DIU's
and the AFWERX's of the world,
playing in...
Playing in the defense space
was kinda taboo from that standpoint,
like they didn't wanna invest...
You know, venture capital
actually told investors to not go
work with the military,
or work with the...
Work with the Department,
for the sole factor of,
"It's just gonna take a long time,
it's gonna suck resources."
So, a big key point
that we were trying to get to was,
"How do we make this process quicker?
How do we let them know
whether we wanna play or not?
And do we have the capital,
and the funding that we can put in place,
you know, for the technology companies,
to run them through the life-cycle
that is the...
You know, the larger acquisition process
in the department?"
And it's not just military application,
like we talked about dual use,
you know, the title this is "dual use",
and so, that was a real key factor
into what we were looking at,
'cause we don't want to necessarily
be that end customer,
because when you look through again,
the acquisition life cycle
in the department,
there are valleys,
there are cliffs,
there are you know,
we're in a CR right now,
a Continue Resolution where the funding
may not come,
so we definitely look for those
dual use technologies,
to be able to have your private sector client,
your commercial client,
as well as working with...
Working with the department to better develop
your technology.
<v ->And just super quick,</v>
and then we'll...
We'll evolve the discussion.
More commercial?
Xiaoyu, can you give us an example
of if you have leverage any of these
new form submittals for funding?
Because after all,
our businesses need to eat,
and in order to get off of the ground,
you need...
Some of us need to find capital to go out there,
to help fuel said projects.
<v ->Yeah, definitely.</v>
We actually recently won a contract
from the US Army Corp of Engineers,
to provide a technology that can be used
to invest, to monitor,
and inspect dams,
and lochs in the Pittsburgh area.
And the process was smooth as you said,
you know, because it's improved
based on the needs
of the small businesses,
and the contract is very easy to execute,
and it really provides a stabilizing cash flow
for us to further devolve our technology,
and really focus on getting the technology out,
rather than satisfying investors' requirements.
So, this is a...
This kind of a innovation in a governing space
is really helpful,
critical for innovation.
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->And if I can add to that?</v>
So, I mean that's a perfect example
where it's...
It's you know...
You think you're working with the military,
you're working with the army,
it's not just you know,
bombs and drones,
and stuff that gonna you know,
attack things,
we have critical infrastructure,
we have you know,
the lochs,
and the dams,
and everything else.
And so, finding the technologies,
so we don't have to send a diver down
to look at things,
or you know...
Those are the real reason of dual-use
that we're looking at.
You know, I don't wanna...
I wanna make sure that everyone understands
it's not just the weaponization
of your technology, it is...
It is how we can further build
the national security industrial base.
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>
The same with you Olga,
you guys saw early,
really quick bids
that were able to help keep your...
Get your company off of the ground,
and you were leveraging simpler platforms
as opposed to these large robust,
government, scary proposals.
<v Olga>Yeah, absolutely.</v>
Congrats on your win by the way.
But yeah, our business,
we've been in business for six-years,
and that is how we have won
the majority of our contract,
is through flexible,
and these like new,
smart operations,
like SOFWERX,
Army Applications Lab, AFFWERX.
And we were able to apply quickly,
get an answer quickly.
And I think one of the biggest benefits
is the reporting on it is so much easier
than anything you've ever encountered,
if you've ever applied for like an NSF grant,
or anything like that,
you know, the reporting on it is so easy,
and the payout on it is very quick,
and flexible as well.
For example, for folks that have not
worked with SOFWERX,
I don't know that there's been a time
in six-years that I've billed them,
and they haven't turned around a payment
in like three days.
So yeah, lots of really amazing
opportunities out there.
<v ->Yeah, that's...</v>
This is vital in order
to get our businesses off the ground
and keep them fed until they hit
that magic button where they don't need
the runway over here,
where they have found the path to productivity
into revenue generation,
and then subsequently profit.
So, I have something I wanna pitch to you
about commercial...
About transitioning to commercial,
but I'll...
I'll share a little of how
we view it at Carnegie Robotics,
so we've...
The group up here views it as commercial
and defense,
and I'm sure you do the same, right?
So, the revenue that we bring in,
and the projects,
and the programs that we work on,
be it software,
hardware, or just...
Just a thing,
just a product or an engineering service,
we like to segment our revenues
between commercial
and defense.
Now, how you break that down revenue-wise,
or just hypothetically,
commercial's the fun stuff, right?
Those are the programs
that you're working with a privately held...
A private company,
a publicly traded company or whatever,
non-military, right?
And you build a relationship,
and you get that contract,
you get that work,
you get that collaboration,
that partnership,
and you know,
ya gotta go through this
master of services process
where you're gonna arm wrestle over the IP,
and the exclusivity,
and the termination clauses,
and basically who gets the kids
in the divorce, right?
Margins are higher in work like that,
north of 10/15/20% margin 'cause it's cool,
exciting work with a private,
or a publicly traded company.
Then you have defense work, right?
I'm not saying that it's boring,
because it's not,
it's actually quite exhilarating
and exciting, 'cause it leads to commercial
in the future, right?
You have to go through a difficult time sometimes
to get said government contract,
the margins on government work are much smaller,
5%/6%/7%,
but it's non-dilutive capital, right?
It's non-dilutive capital.
I know with our work we get pretty special
intellectual property rights
to help us build subsequent platforms.
So, the reason that I share that with you,
is because we have been successful
as a company now at 15-years-old
and growing,
to create a diverse model,
whereas years ago,
our government
and defense work was probably around 15/20%
of our revenues,
where now at the close
of last year's about 50/50,
so that is a diverse model, right?
So, I share that with you because we believe that
that's what we have to do as a company
in order to...
Listen, there could be,
sadly, a global conflict,
that could impact our business
with private companies, right?
There could be a presidential election
just occurred,
or there could be shifts in congress,
Taylor and Travis may break up,
I don't know,
there's a lot of things that could occur
that could impact the trajectory of our business,
that's why we must be diverse at all times.
So, I turn over to commercial,
and I'm looking at you Sanjiv,
you guys started on commercial,
you were really working heavily in military,
are there plans longterm
to take your technologies,
and to adapt them,
and integrate them into the commercial world?
<v ->That's great,</v>
and since the topic of this panel
is about dual-use,
we think about this all the time,
and it's a good thing to bring up.
I'll tell you about
a conference I went to in Huntsville,
where the Army Aviation is,
and what they talked about is that,
we have three uses of drones,
or unmanned aircraft,
they called it,
"Find it. Move it. Kill it." Okay?
It's a little hard to take sometimes,
is I love the brevity of it.
The "it" is not the same thing, right?
You don't move the thing that you find
and then kill the thing that you moved,
it's three missions, right?
So now, that...
Having said that,
so the question is,
"Where, if we're going to do
a military kind of start,
will we find a commercial use-case?"
So, I'll tell you that the two cases,
the "Find it"
and the "Move it" part
have commercial applications.
The "Find it" may be a little bit more nuanced,
because "Find it" might not be
just find a target,
but it's like finding something,
a fault in there.
So inspection is a big deal with drones,
we can...
We actually have a enterprise much like yours,
like Thorough,
we have a division called Proxim
that is looking to inspect large aircraft
with small drones, okay?
And the idea is just like,
you want to do all sorts of predictive analysis,
you wanna be able to capture some data,
we use these small drones that can fly around
without any infrastructure,
map a larger aircraft like the C-17,
but also could be a A380,
or a 777,
787, and then be able to find the defects
and deal with all of the sort of logist...
The data analytics that's associated
with containing aircraft,
which is a very big deal,
hard to do in the military
for reasons of footprint,
you know, the number of people involved,
but also, very,
very useful for the commercial side, okay?
So, we have deployments in Doha,
working with Emirates,
and other places.
Also at the same time,
we're working with the US Air Force
to inspect large aircraft.
The other side,
the "Move it" side is like an obvious thing,
you know?
We need DHL,
UPS, you name it,
FedEx want to move things,
and the idea is that
if you could move these things autonomously
without somebody,
and safely from "A" to "B",
not the last mile,
but the mid-mile,
you could actually be able
to meet the cost per kilo of a truck,
and that's a very,
very attractive kind of a proposition
to be able to do that.
So, all of these things
are a little futuristic,
they will take some time,
The FA is not eager to be super progressive,
or, progressive is the wrong word,
"cutting edge"?
Because they care deeply about safety,
and you know,
don't get a lot of benefit from making these...
Accelerating these technologies,
get their hand slapped when something bad happens.
So, I think the...
You know, we have to prove these technologies out
before they enter commercial service,
how we're gonna do that?
Well you know,
if you've had some technology flying
for tens or hundreds of thousands
of hours on a military setting,
then you know,
we might be able to make the case
that it's okay to fly between Allan Town
and Zelienople, think about that.
<v ->Yeah, that's far away.</v>
Thank you.
Olga, the same with you guys,
there's gonna be an evolution
into the commercial space,
so what kind...
I mean, without giving away too much,
and people tweeting it out,
what can you share
of what you're looking at
in the commercial space?
<v ->Yeah, I mean,</v>
I think that for us,
I agree with everything you said Sanjiv,
you know, safety is very,
very important.
So, I see in the future, KEF...
KEF's products being a backup system
for you know,
large aircraft, right?
So, GPS fails,
comms fail, pilot can't figure out
how to land an aircraft,
might not know where they are in air space,
a system like ours could be able
to lead that pilot home safely.
So, this is in the future,
right now, you know,
we're having...
We can see this all over the world,
right now we can't even get a small drone
from point "A" to point "B" without conflict,
right now, there's been a ton of news
about airplane accidents,
and also just confusion in you know,
GPS, so we need to solve
these smaller problems first in my opinion.
<v ->So, 10-years ago,</v>
I remember, I think a lot of people can relate
to this in the room.
I remember going home,
I saw a drone,
then I went
and told my wife,
go, "Babe, I saw a drone."
"Really?"
"Yeah, I saw a drone."
The dude had a little joystick,
and he had a little camera on it,
it was a GoPro,
like the guys that jump off the mountain,
like really, could see like perfectly
crystal clear,
"Oh, how about that."
Fast-forward 10-years now,
everybody and their step sister has a drone,
and there's a drone company sprouting up,
probably 10 today,
in this room, right?
So, it's...
And I love that,
I love that innovation,
I love that entrepreneur spirit.
So, those are the challenges
that you dealt with in you know,
to try to find that unique value prop.
You know, we also saw it in autonomy
with military,
if you went 10-years-ago to an AUSA,
Association for US Army,
you walked in
and you were autotomizing a thing,
you were the belle at the ball,
today everybody's doing it.
So, our businesses are tasked
with constantly evolving
and finding that unique valued prop,
so in the Aquatonomy space, how...
How are you looking at the future?
Because right now you guys
are building software for cutting-edge processes,
but you're gonna see where you're gonna go
in the commercial space,
or is it the unknown?
<v ->It is actually not unknown,</v>
the reason I can say this
is because we're fortunate enough
to have very...
To fuel very early customer engagement,
even before our products are ready
to deeply understand
what the customer's paying points are,
what their needs are,
and how they will like solution
to work for them, both in...
Because we're in duel technology space,
we engage customer both
in the government sector,
and also in commercial sector.
Under water environments
are very difficult to reach,
navigate, there's no GPS,
and it presents a very different
set of challenges,
compared to land
and sky.
Amazingly, currently,
most of the underwater inspections
are still done by divers,
it is very dangerous,
and a hard...
Difficult work environment,
and it's also very expensive
because of the challenges.
By introducing autonomy,
as I said that we're specialized
in autonomous underwater navigation,
and mapping.
Especially in complex areas,
and even in turbulent water,
so by introducing autonomy,
we drastically accelerate,
and simplify underwater data collection.
And because of the localization technology
that we develop,
we're able to build 3D models that are accurate,
allowing the users to identify problems
and keep track of changes.
So, by introducing the cutting edge technology
in the industry,
we transform how things are done,
so that is the future that we're seeing.
<v ->I love it.</v>
I wanna jump really quick,
because we have five-minutes left,
to see if there's any questions,
if everybody's okay with that?
And we already got one,
go for it.
Do it buddy, shout it!
<v Aaron>Okay. Hi, my name's Aaron,</v>
so, I wonder how you all think about
the evolution of the ground control station?
I mean, some drones are big,
and maybe they're not gonna ever you know,
like send their...
Send what they're looking at or sensing
into a human at the ground,
but a lot of the smaller form drones you know,
the legacy is the come with some custom GCS,
and if that thing breaks,
then whatever the drone was doing,
it's you know kinda worthless.
So, how do you guys think about that?
How do you think about,
as a drone company,
what's your responsibility
to think about the network?
Or do you leave that to others?
Just looking for your thoughts.
<v ->Yeah, thank you.</v>
We decided that not only did we want
to actually work on the autonomy in the air,
but we wanted to create a whole ecosystem
for how drones could be used
to request for supplies,
to then monitor the aircraft
that actually deliver it,
to re-task them,
or doing anything that exceptional.
So, we created a thing
called "Push Button Delivery",
which sits on top of some standards
like 8TACK, okay?
So, "Push Button Delivery"
has exactly the amount of information
that a person in the field needs
for just the logistics task,
and you can imagine I think the way to do this
is not a confusing kind of a panel
with all sorts of status,
like somewhere in here with lots of tabs,
et cetera, to be able to look
at the different status,
you wanna know as the requester,
"Hey, I asked for something,
I asked for this in the field,
and now, how far away is it?"
And it's close by,
is it okay to land...
Loiter or land,
okay to land,
and if it's not,
if the person doesn't respond,
it has to make it's own mind up
whether she's okay to land,
or go back.
So, this is the idea of what we call
"Push Button Delivery",
and I think the idea of comms channels,
I think you wanna be completely transparent
to whatever is out there.
So, in our case,
we use mesh radios,
the ones that the marine corp uses,
we use some sort of a Satcom kind of thing
and any other kind of like cell service,
that's all built into a comms panel,
which is completely transparent to the user.
So, if you're...
If you're nowhere where there's infrastructure,
then you have a slower link, okay?
And the idea is that the person
on either end of the delivery thing
is gonna only look at very,
very low bandwidth kind of information
using all the information
that's already out there.
And so, you can get it faster,
or you can get it,
you know, whatever is the...
Is the mode that works the best at that time,
so that's just completely transparent,
we don't wanna take any kinda stake
into what kind of...
What kind of challenge should be used.
<v ->Thank you. Any...</v>
Anybody else, another question?
Oh. Enthusiastic in the front. Here.
<v Shonya>Hi, my name is Shonya,</v>
and my question was around a point
that you mentioned,
that the FA's being super cautious
with you know,
allowing commercialization
of technology like drones,
but then we see companies like Zipline,
Prime Air already building infrastructure
for you know,
delivery, last time delivery.
Do you have a metric
or a number of years where you can say,
"Okay, in these many years,
commercial drones are going to be
a normal thing in society."?
Or at least in the US.
<v ->We have to go,</v>
15-seconds or less,
answer it, 'cause I wanna get to work.
<v ->I don't think that there is any such thing,</v>
any prediction that works here,
I think it has to do with politics,
it has to do with a level of safety
our society decides it wants to, okay?
I can say more later if you like.
<v ->Who else?</v>
This person. That person.
<v Bob>Bob Kurt, Wilkins &amp; Barker.</v>
I had a quick question on the public panic,
the fever pitch over drone sightings
in the North East,
do you think that's going to be
good for business or bad for business,
and why?
<v ->Those were Olga's drones.</v>
<v ->Mike, you said you weren't gonna tell anybody.</v>
<v ->Olga, do you have a response to that, or?</v>
<v ->I could just tell you at Thanksgiving,</v>
it was the sat with this.
"Those are your drones?"
"Those are your drones?"
Sorry, can't say.
If I ever told ya,
I'd have to shoot you.
I think that there's some hysteria here
about the kinds of drones,
and we just haven't gotten used to it,
just like self-driving cars,
this is a technology that has...
I mean, the technology works,
but there's a question of public acceptance,
it's just gonna take some time
for us to be able to do this.
<v Terran>Hey folks, my name is Terran.</v>
Very nice discussion,
I kind of have a very,
maybe like a general question for folks,
as someone who's worked on
autonomy systems in the past.
With the advent of where AI is going,
and all the innovations in AI specifically,
how fast are your guys' development cycles
for your stacks?
And, is there an AI tool,
or an AI system that you think
would make your work faster?
<v ->Let me give it to you again.</v>
Go for it.
<v ->Okay, so look,</v>
AI and machine learning
are sort of being conflated, right?
I don't know what you call AI,
but I'm betting that,
that is the case,
that it's machine learning.
We try as a company,
not to put any of that
into safety critical systems, okay?
Safety critical systems need a process,
it's that part I talked about,
about the assurance that you need
to prove to people that...
All the stakeholders, right?
That the user,
the sponsor,
and even the insurers
that this thing is gonna work.
And aviation has very establish standards,
170A/DO254, you can't skip those kinds of things,
if these things is gonna have
some sort of a lasting impact.
So you know,
hey you wanna use machine learning
to possible detect lung cancer early?
Go for it.
You know, you want it to detect
that your carburetor is potentially misfiring
ahead of time,
early warning,
or your tires are getting worn out?
Go for it,
you know, ahead of time.
But, to put it inside a decision loop,
I think is a mistake
and you know,
all of these people trying to think
that more data is gonna solve the problem,
just see how many years it is
before we have a million
Robotaxis running around.
That was promised many years ago,
I'm still waiting,
so I think, you know...
<v ->We take a similar approach.</v>
I know we're over time,
but if you wanna get up
and leave, you can leave,
but I know there's probably two more questions,
if you'd like?
Go ahead, sir.
Go ahead.
<v Audience Member>So, as a member</v>
of the RC model aircraft community,
once the Walmart drones came out,
basically the FA nearly killed the hobby.
So, seeing...
And it has a massive track record,
very long track record of no incidents.
So, keeping that in mind,
when I see this commercial drone...
over cities,
I always think about this technology,
and then actually trying to get
the technology into the public sphere.
Something as simple as,
you don't have a camera,
it won't have video feeds,
you're gonna record those video feeds,
now what about,
you flew over someone's backyard
and they were sunbathing without any clothes,
you know?
Just simple stuff like that you know,
that's an extreme example, but...
And like for example,
wind turbines,
they fail not because of the technologies,
because of local...
<v ->Yeah, thank you.</v>
<v Audience Member>So, the question was,</v>
is there...
What are...
What's in place to start addressing
those kind of concerns?
Whether it's amongst you,
or is there like a lobby group
that is starting to think about this,
and has to come up with education
for the politicians...
<v ->Get him, Sanjiv!</v>
<v ->Oh jeez.</v>
<v ->Sorry rest of panel,</v>
I'm just gonna have Sanjiv just take 'em.
<v ->Okay, so there's a simple thing</v>
that I think the mayor of Pittsburgh,
the ex mayor of Pittsburgh said,
we we were talking about this,
and he said,
"Well, what is the rule
that you'd have to have,
what is the common sense idea
that if somebody put up a camera on your house,
looking into the neighbor's yard?"
You know?
The same thing should apply to drones, you know?
So, there's some common sense things
I think...
I'm not as worried about privacy
as I am with safety.
And here's the thing that I wanna say,
a little controversial,
the same things that we are working on
to keep these...
Make these aircraft fly safely,
even when things go wrong,
could be used in not so great uses.
If you have a low-flying aircraft
that can fly by itself,
that doesn't need any comms,
and doesn't need any GPS,
where could it not go, right?
So, I think that the safety issue
is a bigger issue right now,
both from the idea,
"What happens if it doesn't work,
and it falls?"
You know, somebody walking their dog,
and then a drone falls on them?
Okay, that's no good.
But, what if it also works?
What if it works really well?
That's also not that great in the hands...
In every set of hands.
So, I think there's safety issues on both sides
that are much bigger than the privacy issues,
which I think some common sense will sort out.
<v ->I'd like to end it there</v>
because we're over time,
and Sanjiv needs water.
But, we're gonna be sticking around,
if anybody has any questions,
wanna come up
and see us?
Please look up all of our companies,
"carnegierobotics.com',
"Near Earth Autonomy",
"Aquatonomy", "Divergent",
"KEF Robotics".
I'd be remise in not closing remark saying,
thank you, special thanks
to the Pittsburgh Technology Council,
and the Allegheny Conference
who are our two flagship entities,
and Pittsburgh who helped put this together,
we rely upon them for everything.
So, Pittsburgh Technology,
"pittsburghtech.org"
and Allegheny Conference
on community development.
Also, two things.
One, I gotta mention the
Brunswick Corporation booth,
because that's who are our partner is,
we developed the autonomy
for the large Boston Whaler that you'll see
right downstairs,
West Hall 6116.
And finally-finally,
all of this works because of collaboration
and partnership,
Pittsburgh is known as the robotics capital,
if you haven't been there,
please come, because it is a special place,
it's magnetic, it's electric,
everybody wants to be a part of it, right?
We have a friend
and a colleague who's sitting out here,
Dr. Amanda Scrowe from NAYA Systems,
NAYA's a competitor of ours, right?
It's probably the only two competitors in town,
but guess what?
We're friends,
and we are invested in each other's success,
so next year we'll have Amanda
sitting up here with us,
wherever you are Amanda.
And, all of these companies here
work together,
you've heard of Aurora,
the self-driving truck?
They are a partner of ours,
they were in our high bay you know,
using our water jet last week,
10-people, 12-people,
my facilities people brought them lunch, right?
This is who Pittsburgh is,
this is who we are,
we are not siloed,
and that's what makes us different,
and special.
Thank you, enjoy the rest of your conference.
