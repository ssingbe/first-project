<v ->All right. Hi everyone.</v>
We're so glad you could join us.
And good afternoon, CES.
It's really great to have all of you here with us today.
So we're gonna have a great panel discussion today
on smart cities and cybersecurity.
We're going to address how smart cities can stay smart
when it comes to cybersecurity.
As our cities become more connected and intelligent,
safeguarding the flow of information
and protecting critical infrastructure is paramount.
I think we all can agree to that.
So today we're gonna explore some of the challenges
and the opportunities of securing smart cities.
Also discussing innovative strategies
to ensure safety, privacy, and resilience
of these rapidly evolving urban environments.
So before we get started, I'd like to intro-
Standards programs at the Consumer Technology Association.
I'm also the president
of the US National Committee of the IEC.
And in that role, we're focused on global standardization
and conformity assessment.
So bringing a lot of the work
that I do in American National Standards internationally.
I'm also the first woman to hold that position,
which I'm really proud of.
The IEC got it start in 1906.
So imagine all the way through 2024,
it took that long to get a woman elected.
So very proud to hold that role.
And being a member of that group,
I'm also a member of the IEC Board,
their business advisory committee,
which looks at how we might globally influence
standardization among some of the big three.
I'm also on the American National Standards
Institute Board of Directors.
So standards are something I hold very dear to my heart.
I'm also a US Army veteran
because it seems like I really like
to take on a lot of jobs. (laughs)
So I'm really thrilled to have our panel of experts
here with us today.
They'll bring some diverse perspectives
to what we're talking about
when it comes to smart cities and cybersecurity.
So I'm gonna let each of them introduce themselves.
So Michelle, we'll start with you.
<v ->So nice to be here.</v>
It's my first time speaking at the CES,
so I'm pretty excited.
My name is Michelle Sahar.
I'm the Cybersecurity Director of OpenPolicy.
OpenPolicy, it's the first AI powered platform
that democratize access to startups and innovators
engaged in regulatory engagement, not only hold visibility,
but also have the proactive knowledge
and participate in this great landscape.
So in my job, I advise clients not only
on how to address all this information of regulation,
but also how they can engage in helping info sharing
with amazing government agencies.
So my specialties are in IOT, which is very interesting
about what we're gonna talk about today, AI, iCloud,
and yeah, and I'm very excited for this, yeah.
<v Veronica>Glad to have you here.</v>
<v ->Matthew Straeb, I'm with Global Security Systems.</v>
Our brand is ALERT FM,
and we've been delivering communication systems
that work when cell and other systems fail
or you lose power or internet.
So we kind of came in this from a different point of view
because what we found out is that we work mostly
in state and local communities,
and they're all obviously have a very strong interest
in alerting their citizenry.
And a lot of these disasters
can get into a situation where they fail very quickly.
The power, internet and cell can all just fail
right in five to 10 minutes,
depending on what the disaster is.
And we found that cybersecurity,
cyber communications is the same profile.
There's, you know, two types of cyber communication issues.
One is ransomware, I'll just get in.
And then the other one is, you know,
they're gonna go after something
that's gonna be important to you
and that's gonna be typically communications.
So we fill that gap.
And we developed, I'm a co-founder, we developed a system
where we basically use existing FM radio infrastructure.
So you know how you get your song
and title information on your car radio,
we turn that into a alert system.
And what's unique about it, it's independent because,
and we deliver all of our data
to the radio stations by satellite.
So the only way you would be able to hack the system
would be able to physically, you'd have to break into the,
to knock at the satellite uplink.
So we fill that gap.
So when everything goes to, you know, goes south,
our system would continue to work.
So thank you.
<v ->Thank you.</v>
<v ->And good afternoon everyone.</v>
Great to see you all again here at CES.
My name is Billy Bob Brown Jr.
I'm the executive assistant director
for Emergency Communications
at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.
We spend most of our time talking about the idea
of how do we improve cyber safety across the nation,
and how do we encourage partners across the world
to think about creating a world that's secure
for all of our internet connected devices.
<v ->Great. So glad to have all three of you with us.</v>
And I have so many questions, some of which I've shared,
but I love the mindset that we have here.
I think we've got lots to talk about.
So why don't we start with the biggest question maybe.
What are the biggest cybersecurity challenges
that you think smart cities face today?
Maybe from each of your perspectives.
<v ->So, smart cities, with the great technology comes,</v>
there's like multiple layer vulnerabilities.
And when we're talking about interconnected systems,
basically, right, Smart cities wants to help us
and help our lives to get better by interconnecting systems.
So one of the vulnerabilities is IoT product, right?
This interconnectivity can lead to vulnerabilities
that we need to know how to mitigate
from the outgoing, from the starts, right,
from the development of the product itself
before it's even connected.
And the attack surface management now that we see
if smart cities get expanded exponentially, right?
There are so many small items,
products, AI powered platform,
we're not even mentioning the amount of data
that flows through all the critical infrastructures.
So all of this attack surface, someone needs to manage
and needs to manage it in real time.
And to be able not only to predict what can be,
what can happen or which threat we can encounter,
but also which kind of security measurements,
which can cybersecurity protocols we need to do
to also remediate and be resilient
to the ever evolving threats.
So I think how smart cities are built, it's great,
but they're unfolding so many small pieces
that we need to have some kind of a security baseline
to know how we are addressing them.
<v ->Yeah, I love that.</v>
Security baselines, I think, are quite important,
especially in standardization.
We talk about that a lot.
So do you envision, I think,
maybe in your view of smart cities is,
I agree we have so many products, IoT products,
and we're bringing all that data together.
Do you almost envision that there needs to be
sort of like maybe a city management sort of a,
you know, overview of?
<v ->One centralized?</v>
Yeah, or do you think it needs to be more,
I mean, 'cause I know we definitely want to see
more of the customers being proactive
and in being cyber smart,- but knowing that
<v ->The IoT Cyber Trust Mark, right?</v>
I am a great fan of that initiative
and I think it's forming beautifully
with the idea of smart cities, right?
Because if someone is not aware,
the US Cyber Trust Mark is a great initiative
to trying to not only raise awareness of customers, right,
and to understand if the consumer,
if my mom wants pay the extra 10 bucks
to have a better, more secure IoT product.
But also, how we are forming
this security baseline for IoT product?
What is like the basic threshold of security standards?
And I think that this initiative,
it's exactly what you just mentioned.
And I think that smart cities and local government
can use that and emphasize the importance of this initiative
and try to see if the consumer, how we can raise awareness,
which is crucial for security for smart cities.
And also to protect the basic lines of IoT products,
which are the basic foundation of smart cities, right?
<v ->Absolutely. Absolutely.</v>
So Matthew, what do you think?
<v ->Well, there's, there's two sides to it.</v>
One is, you know, we wanna be able to use these devices.
We don't want burden people.
But at the same time we have privacy issues
and people don't even realize
that there could be a entry point too
for a cybersecurity breach or attack, particularly if,
and we deal mostly with government, you know,
government employees, law enforcement,
emergency management, those types of folks.
And, you know, a lot of times we'll walk in and we'll say,
you know, so that's on the IOT side or the device side.
Now on the infrastructure side,
the challenge is they've got so many disparate systems,
you know, some are, I would say non-cyber security,
you know, protectable because they're old
and no one's even thinking about it.
<v ->That's true.</v>
<v ->So they either have</v>
to throw the system out,
spend the money to do the X, Y, Z to replace,
and they're not willing to do that.
And a lot of the governance, we found,
is a lot of the governance that goes into the cybersecurity,
you know, laws, protection, regulations is on a state level,
every state's different, every locality's different,
every budget's different.
And so, you know, a lot of times
we'll walk into a sheriff's office
and we'll say, "Cybersecurity."
And they'll say, "What's that?" You know?
I mean, unfortunately.
<v ->That's true.</v>
<v ->And so we have to educate them, but it's a serious thing.</v>
And you know, as an example,
I was in a media headquarters, a large media headquarters,
and, you know, there's a thousand employees working there
and they gave me a tour and they said,
"That's the operation center.
Only three people are allowed to go in there."
So, you know, people are locking down.
It's not just, it's physical security,
it's other layers of security.
So I think the challenge is that,
and I think CISA is doing a great job.
They had a billion dollar grant program
and we were at this Q&amp;A.
And, you know, basically it's just there for them
to write a cybersecurity plan, not even implement it.
So we still have a long ways to go.
<v Veronica>Yeah, right. I'd agree.</v>
What do you think about that?
<v ->Yeah, so I'm gonna be a little bit contrarian</v>
and I'm hoping for a little dialogue this afternoon.
So I think about the vulnerability in smart cities
from the perspective of the greatest challenges,
the people, you know?
So we're in the people business.
We're trying to create partnerships
across government spaces, across industry spaces,
across nonprofit spaces, across academia,
'cause we recognize in order to secure
the nation to improve resilience,
it takes all of us actually working together.
So some of the people problem
relates to a way of thinking about products
in a former style, which was, if it had that,
and I don't want to call anyone out,
but if it had that seal of approval, then it's good.
So set it and forget it.
You know, I'm only gonna buy the product
that has the seal on it so I can set it and forget it.
And which meant that you never looked at it
and you never thought that there could be a vulnerability
discovered last night,
somebody in the basement somewhere spent up all night
and they figured out a way to exploit a vulnerability.
And now that they have that exploit,
they're gonna use that in order to try
and compromise your system for some purpose.
And you might not actually be the target,
you may be the avenue of approach
to get to a target that they're trying to get to.
You know, so the set it and forget it kind of mindset
is what we really need to overcome.
You know, how do we create a movement of people
that are thinking about how do we secure our world?
You know, how do we think of those basic security principles
as being a responsibility that all of us,
even at the individual consumer, should be thinking about.
And then we should be demanding that from the producers of,
so as, you know, as we talk about secure by design,
secure by default, you know, it comes from consumers
also requiring a higher threshold of security
in those all internet connected devices
as they're developed in the future,
as they're created in the future,
even applications, you know?
So it really is a mindset.
And but I wanna say, you know,
in some ways it's like a mindset
that we had before, but we forgot about it.
<v ->You know, so you buy a horse and you think, yeah,</v>
this horse is gonna gonna get me from point A to point B.
You know, but that horse had to be fed every day.
That horse had to be groomed every day.
That horse had to be actually taken care of every day.
We had to do something to make sure
that that was going to successfully perform the function.
But somehow we got away from that
and the idea that, oh yeah, we can buy a product.
It had that seal so I don't need to do anything.
I don't even need to think about it
that that number one doesn't really make sense.
And today, as we see certainly cyber crime,
cyber crime for hire as a problem and a challenge,
that we all need to be more cyber smart
to ensure cyber safety.
<v ->Yeah, I really love that,</v>
'cause I think if we think about it now,
for me, I always use this example with, to your point
about when you have a seal of approval on something,
you do tend to have that set it and forget it mindset.
So if you have a hair dryer, you know,
maybe had a little hair dryer this morning,
or a pot of coffee, you just plug it in
and you don't check to see if it was certified in testing
and it's met all the electronic standardization
that it needs and has been tested appropriately,
and you're not gonna catch on fire
or blow the building up, right?
But I agree when it comes to cybersecurity,
because it's moving so quickly
and there are so many devices,
there are all these different entry points into there.
So I think we do have to ask people come together.
What do you think?
What's your view for how we might make that work?
I mean, 'cause that's a huge task, right?
<v ->Yeah, and I definitely would like to hear</v>
kind of what some of the other thoughts are.
But, so I've been on a quest for a couple years now
trying to sort out how do we create a movement.
So one of the things that the,
as I've been going around the world
talking a little bit about,
certainly emergency communications,
that's where really my primary focus and expertise is,
you know, but as we think about communications capabilities,
you know, it is the same challenges.
You know, some of the legacy way
that we moved information by voice,
you used an analog capability,
that is going by the wayside.
And more and more and more
of that voice communications capability is all IP
and it's using technologies that are internet connected.
You know, some are behind firewalls,
some of them are, you know, have some walled garden,
but there are still opportunities for remote accessing.
And I actually had a conversation with someone
a couple years ago and they were telling me,
"Oh yeah, no, no, this is closed off."
And then I watched them reach into their pocket,
they pulled out their smart device
and they did something and they put their smart device away.
And, you know, a few minutes later
they leaned over and said, "Yeah, I've got this ability,
I can remotely, you know, tune this thing in up
and I just got something so I fixed it.
And so I waited about an hour and then I asked,
I was like, "Oh, you know, that remote access that you use,
that's a internet vulnerability that you just opened."
They said, "What?" (chuckles)
They didn't even realize, you know,
but it's the idea of how do we, you know,
as I'm talking to governments around the world,
all of us have the same challenge
of moving emergency information to protect citizens.
We should all be very cognizant of the fact
that the all interconnected IP environment
requires all of us to be thinking
and to be partnering, you know, across our organizations
with the information security specialists.
<v Veronica>Yeah.</v>
<v ->I would say, I know education and awareness is, right?</v>
And then where does the responsibility fall?
Is it with the manufacturer or with the user?
I think that's gonna be become more and more of an issue.
And I think people are willing to pay for that.
You know, from a consumer electronics point of view,
I wanna know that I have a secure system
and I don't wanna worry about it
and I'll pay you for that, you know?
<v Veronica>Right. Yeah.</v>
<v ->And I think that's a real opportunity</v>
for a lot of manufacturers to take advantage of that.
'Cause if anyone's ever been a victim of identity theft
or any of that kind of stuff, I mean, it's a real pain.
<v ->Yes. Yes.</v>
<v ->So, you know,</v>
and it costs time and money
and I think people, there's a value to it.
And if we can avoid that,
then I think that's gonna be something
that manufacturers are gonna start promoting
that their system is closed.
And there's a few that I come to mind
that are kind of in that camp
that have been pretty successful so.
<v ->Yeah, that's very interesting.</v>
Especially I do agree,
I think that there's a good opportunity for manufacturers
to help educate consumers.
And I think the more,
especially me being in the standards business,
I feel like the more manufacturers that are involved
in talking about these cybersecurity vulnerabilities
and how we might be able to work together
to create awareness without dipping
into the secret networks, right?
But if we can work together
and create standards that help make a stronger system,
it's definitely a better way.
Plus we can definitely get that out to the consumers
that these manufacturers follow these standards.
So I think that's a very important way.
<v ->I think it's gonna be a feature.</v>
It'll become a feature that people are wanna pay for.
<v ->But at some level too, like all of us though,</v>
have a responsibility.
Even at the consumer end,
all of us have a responsibility to be looking at it daily.
You know, so for anyone that's got a smart device right now,
I don't think anyone in the room has any problem
with the idea of checking, you know, the application store
and seeing that there's been an update to an application
for, you know, if you've got, you know,
it's I wanna call out names here but.
So if you've got an app for getting a ride somewhere,
you know, you don't think anything of updating that app,
you know, 'cause some new features have been, you know?
But also, some security flaws have been updated, you know?
So there's a responsibility on the consumer side
to do something, you know?
On the application developer side or the manufacturer side,
they did something,
but it also requires the consumer to do something.
And part of that, I believe,
is consumers also having the mindset,
I should be demanding good security, right?
So somebody should be doing something when they find out
that there's an exploit in the wild,
doing something to close that
to make this application more safe for me.
<v ->Yeah, I agree wholeheartedly.</v>
So when we're thinking about technical strategic approaches,
what role do you think emerging technologies
like AI and blockchain will play
in securing smart city infrastructures?
<v ->Wow, the full potential of AI in smart city</v>
can unleash new capabilities and new things
from real time detections and predictive analytics.
It can be everything.
It can be even helping just detect
the vulnerabilities we just spoke about
of IoT product basically, and isolate them from the system
and basically mitigate the threats.
But we are all talking about the other side of AI
and what is happening if we are integrating
AI full potential in smart cities.
And I think that when it can introduce great stuff,
also we need to look about the AI risk
as an holistic perspective about what we just spoke about,
about data security, cybersecurity,
critical infrastructures.
How we can manage and mitigate all the risks
that involve through that specific connection
because of the fragile elements of smart cities,
which is everything is interconnected.
<v Veronica>Right. Right.</v>
<v ->And if we are not looking at as an holistic thing,</v>
we are missing out.
And it can be a very hard aftermath
that we need to think about it from the start.
<v ->Yeah, for sure.</v>
What do you think?
<v ->You know, to managing all, you know, this data,</v>
we have unbelievable amounts of data.
We don't know what to do with
We have no idea this falling on the floor all the time
and nobody knows what to do with it,
whether it's coming from a jet engine or whatever.
And, you know, cybersecurity
is just gonna be another application
that goes inside of the AI world.
So it's gonna be a while,
but I think definitely that has lots of potential.
On the blockchain side. I mean, that's gonna be,
you know, help us a lot with privacy.
You know, that's gonna be the answer.
So it's, you know, I think as we have these things
that really come into up, you know,
cybersecurity has become more of an issue,
we've got responses to it, so the technology.
So that's a good thing.
<v ->Yeah, and I think to your point about privacy,</v>
I feel like most concerns tend to be based around privacy.
When you talk to consumers, it's not, you know,
not so much their understanding of the,
about their data is going to be out there so.
<v ->I just wanna get in my app.</v>
I've been working on three weeks to get in this app
and you can help me, please help me,
because it's so, you know what I mean.
<v ->Yeah, for sure. What do you think about the power of AI</v>
and the future potential there?
<v ->Yeah, I'm super excited about emerging technology</v>
and the ability to help citizens to bring safety
and responders to support citizens in everyday life, right?
You know, so Matt mentioned a little bit earlier
about the idea of, you know, a disaster happens
and we sort out how to help people.
I'm from Washington, DC,
we got like three inches of snow on the ground,
that's a disaster for us.
<v ->Yeah, it's a disaster.</v>
<v ->Yeah, you know,</v>
so they're going through that right now,
trying to sort that out.
But, you know, in the everyday situation,
you know, we have people that are in trouble.
Something happens, they need help.
They need to do a request for assistance using 911,
you know, next generation of 911 is coming out,
which will in only increase the IP connectedness
of those call, those public safety answering points
and the ability to do distributed calls
and some sort of collective support
across regional environments.
But it also brings a cybersecurity concern.
But as we were talking a little bit before the panel today,
you know, the thing I think about all the time
is the large scale challenge at scale.
You know, so I think about an earthquake.
In the center of the country,
there's a fault line called New Madrid.
The New Madrid earthquake is prime for 100 year challenge,
and there's gonna be tens of millions of people
impacted by that.
Artificial intelligence gives us the opportunity
to try at scale to understand where people are
in order to better manage the ability
to get responders to help those citizens
as those responder organizations are marshaled.
You know, so and in terms of blockchain, you know,
I'm super excited personally about blockchain.
I just think that there's unlimited potential
that has not really been thought about,
about how we can actually validate.
And that's where I see blockchain helping out,
validate, you know, who is trying to send information.
You know, so I'm super excited.
<v ->I'm really excited about too.</v>
It's kind of great to have fellow tech nerdy up here.
into future focus.
What do you think about when we're thinking
about more of these advanced technologies,
ow should our cybersecurity strategies evolve
to address new threats?
And that's always, that's the big question, right?
Like how do we stay ahead of the new threats?
<v ->Yeah, so I'll just sort of jump right in</v>
and, you know, at some level it cannot only be government
that's trying to figure that out, you know?
So and again, as it is a mantra of our organization
that we are partnering, you know,
we want everybody to come to the table.
You know, industry has gotta be a part of the equation.
Nonprofits have gotta be a part of the equation.
Academia has gotta be a part of the equation.
You know, we believe cybersecurity really has no borders.
You know, someone from across the world
could be making a cyber intrusion into a device.
And, you know, therefore every good government on the planet
should be working together to try to figure out
how are we creating a cybersecurity framework
that allows all of us to secure information
so that it can perform the actual work
that it's intended to perform
in that application or the device.
You know, but it takes all of us
bringing ideas to the table to actually create a solution
even as the emerging technology comes into play.
So like I'm a huge proponent for Quantum.
You know, I've been talking to my team
and, you know, nobody agrees with me.
So if everybody in the room wants to say,
"I don't agree with you either," join the club.
Nobody agrees with me.
But I believe Quantum is going to radically transform
the way we move information in the future.
<v Veronica>Yeah, I agree.</v>
I agree with you.
<v ->Can I also?</v>
<v ->Go ahead.</v>
<v ->I would add</v>
from the innovator perspective,
I totally agree with you.
And also info sharing, information sharing is so critical
to help not only the regulator,
but also to have some kind of a resilient framework
that is updating constantly, right?
As we are very pushing on updating apps,
we need to update frameworks of cybersecurity
and understanding that cybersecurity is a great pillar
of the security of smart cities, for example.
But how we make it update?
By talking with the people on the ground,
by talking to researchers,
by seeing which kind of vulnerabilities and threats.
For example, the clients of the kinds that work with us
have so many information and white papers
about things that they see.
And this information is critical
not only just to map what's going to be the next threat,
but also like which kind of solution,
technical solution we can bring to the table.
And basically, yeah, help raising this resilient aspect.
<v ->Yeah, and that's a lot of data.</v>
And to your point, we don't want it to fall on the floor,
maybe as a good opportunity for AI
to train against all that data
and share that in a secure way of course.
<v ->In quantum we'll just..</v>
<v ->In quantum.</v>
Right. Exactly.
<v ->Just sweep.</v>
<v ->There you-</v>
<v ->It just takes out</v>
a whole layer.
<v ->You got more believers.</v>
<v ->It just takes out a whole layer.</v>
It just takes out a whole layer processing that,
you know, is going to exponentially
provide more solutions so.
<v ->Yeah, that's excellent.</v>
So I think maybe going back to disaster management,
thinking about the snowstorm (laughs)
and being very happy to be here
and not shoveling snow back in DC,
how do you think we can, in smart cities, I mean,
leverage some of that technology we talked about
for certainly improving first response in 911,
but how can we work on that overall
with disaster management strategies?
You spoke about the potential for the earthquake,
and I think back to when we had
a very tiny earthquake in the DC area,
but you would've thought it was the largest
like we were in California or something,
but it was very tiny.
Having grown up in California was hardly worth mentioning.
But it's still important
to have disaster resilience strategies
to address all of that.
What are your thoughts on what smart cities could be doing?
<v ->Well, I mean, they have to protect their networks,</v>
first of all, so that they can operate.
And then on the edge, like, you know, I was going to this,
where is my, there's only two ways to alert people.
I lost my phone.
There's two ways to alert people.
One is the cell phone
and the other is another device that we make actually.
<v Veronica>Oh, there you go.</v>
<v ->And this is the device</v>
that actually is a geo-targeted device
that will receive earthquake alerts, weather alerts,
and it's works even when the internet and the power fail
'cause it has a battery in it,
and the cell network fails
because it's on a totally independent network.
<v ->So the thing that people underestimate</v>
is how quickly we can lose all of our communication tools
and people are then basically stuck
and that's where people get upset.
So that's the gap that we're filling.
And it goes back to analog.
I mean at the end of the day, I mean,
I don't care what kind of AI you got
or, you know, how big your television is or whatever.
It's that FM, it's a radio infrastructure
that's gonna save lives
in those disasters that you talked about.
Cell is great until we get to that point,
but those networks are not built.
A lot of this stuff is not built
because we didn't think about all of this
for all these other disasters and cybersecurity
and all this things, pop, came up.
So, you know, we have all the infrastructure now.
It's just educating people.
The way that disaster management works though in the US
is that each state decides
how they wanna manage their disasters.
So you're basically dealing with 50 plus countries,
you know, in essence.
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->So trying to get them all to agree,</v>
I mean, forget about the international space.
And everyone's got a different idea.
Everyone's got a different experience.
Some come from law enforcement,
some come from fire, it's all different.
So that's the challenge is bringing all of those together
and then educating them so that they can protect their,
you know, protect their citizens.
<v Veronica>Yeah, I agree.</v>
<v ->And I believe, as you were saying,</v>
the idea of, you know, educating
even those that may have differing perspectives, right?
You know, state of California, state of Missouri,
they think differently, they have a different population,
they have different geography.
You know, certainly in terms of scale and size,
the opportunity in their tax base to do things
are different.
You know, so they think about how they're gonna manage
to the resources that they have differently.
And, you know, I believe that's totally okay.
There's no problem with that.
And, you know, but there should be some way
that we think about saving the life of a citizen
as being universal, right?
So it doesn't matter what state you're from,
it doesn't matter what country you're from, you know,
that we all think about saving of a life
from the same perspective.
And I think smart cities are going to help with that
because we're bringing more and more and more connectivity.
And, you know, in the standards arena, you know,
there's something they were talking about pro,
say, side link, you know, way for mesh to make mesh.
Really capable, even for those cellular devices
to be able to move signals one device
to another device in order to move,
whether it's request for assistance information
or alerting information.
You know, I think that technology
is moving farther forward that that'll help us
with that disaster management thing.
<v ->And what that infers is a federal solution,</v>
which we all are afraid of.
<v ->I'm not afraid of it.</v>
I love federal solutions.
<v ->That's Billy Bob. (laughs)</v>
But maybe even cybersecurity,
'cause it is a national threat.
So I'm not suggest, I'm just-
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
<v ->We've been dealing a lot with these different states</v>
and it's very, very complicated.
They all have different priorities,
as you mentioned financially, you know,
and they get different budgets.
You're not gonna get there unless it comes from the top down
and meet somewhere in the middle.
So that's just my opinion, personal opinion.
<v ->Right, right.</v>
<v ->Unfortunately.
And certainly when you start</v>
thinking about like-
<v ->Unfortunately.</v>
<v ->The critical areas, right, like power.</v>
<v ->Yeah, power, right.</v>
<v ->Power. (laughs)</v>
Communications, the big ones, yeah.
Well, we're getting down to, gosh, that panel went so fast.
Because we have about eight minutes left,
I wanna make sure if anyone has questions in the audience,
we have time to answer them.
But if you don't have any questions,
I'll come up with some of my own.
<v Participant>I've been in the embedded space a long time.</v>
I've worked for a very large manufacturer
that did an IoT SOC.
And what I found in that situation
was people weren't paying for security.
And so when you get to the actual consumer,
I understand everything you said,
and I personally believe everything you said,
but I think we all have propellers in our head
or secure propellers in our head.
But when it gets to the consumer,
people buy the cheapest thing.
And we found in that company that the cost would've been $20
and the vendors wouldn't accept that.
We lowered it down to a dollar
and the vendors would not accept that.
So when I hear you say, you know,
convince the manufacturers,
I think the manufacturers are convinced.
So no manufacturer wants to know that it was, you know,
ACME, whatever, IoT device that caused this break.
You know it's a huge problem.
So I think the challenge for us,
and I'm kind of throwing that out,
how do we get people to accept security?
You know, and Michael, something you said at the end,
maybe it has to be top down, right,
'cause otherwise it's, you know, it's the cheapest part
that I buy, that the consumer buy, throw that out.
<v ->Well, I mean, you start with standards.</v>
You try to be nice, do it the the nice way,
get people to adopt it and implement it.
And if that doesn't work, then you have to go to,
you know, keep escalating.
So it just, there's a, I mean there's a huge liability here
that nobody really talks about that, you know,
that could sink a business if they don't play,
you know, take care of it so.
Right, sink a city too.
Right, exactly.
<v ->Yeah, so in kind of our secure fault,</v>
secure by design conversation, you know,
we expressed the idea that corporate boards,
you know, so on the manufacturer,
on the developer side, have some responsibility.
All of the risks shouldn't be translated
right directly to the consumer.
You know, there should be some on that side.
But I equate that same thought process, you know,
to how we think about partnering, you know, all of us.
So if we just talk about the United States, you know,
we have, you know, so now I'm gonna go off script,
hopefully somebody's not recording this, you know,
but so I'm gonna go off script for just a second.
We have something like $23 trillion
running through our gross domestic product, you know?
So in my opinion, you can't tell me that we can't figure out
a creative way to inside of $23 trillion
sort out how we can improve security.
You know, so at some level, you know,
what Matt sort of mentioned the idea of, you know,
maybe the consumer side picks it up, you know,
is there maybe an idea that at some level,
maybe there's some insurance that could be reduced?
On some level,
ts there some tax relief that could be introduced?
You know, is there some way to create that ability
to ensure that security is baked in
and it's looked at each and every day?
You know, by thinking more creatively
about, you know, the entire GDP
and how that could be utilized to bring us to a common place
where we all recognize and believe that,
hey, it takes all of us to improve resilience and security
across the entire nation.
It should take all of the GDP
as we think about how can we get to that solution
that makes it more cyber safe for all of us.
<v ->Yeah, I think you're right on point</v>
when it comes to things like perhaps tax incentives
or, you know, or insurance incentives.
So those sort of the key ways to help manufacturers
that are saying, we've got a product
and we've already gotten the price as low as we can
and it's still, we don't wanna be the ACME, you know,
IOT device that takes down the US, right?
No one wants that.
But I do think that, to your point,
we certainly have a large GDP
and we should be able to figure that out.
<v ->I think it's shortsighted</v>
because, you know, a current incident cost
And I was a shareholder, so I know that 100 billion's gonna,
I mean that's like real, real money.
So I think there's gonna be more of that,
you know, as these attack, as these different,
you know, threats come into play so.
<v ->Just to add, I think that it's the biggest question</v>
of the young generation.
I think that the young generation that was born
to this interconnected world cannot be just like, you know,
they don't have any knowledge about cybersecurity.
It's not like when I was born, we didn't have computers.
That's great.
But now, like what?
So I think this is the role of the next educational systems.
And I think that the FCC is involved in that.
And also, they're trying not to figure out
how to make the, for example, the IoT Trust Mark
more friendly for consumers to make them more incentivized,
trying to convince my mom why she need to pay more, right?
But this is the old generation.
What about the new TikTok generation, right?
It means something, this currency of data,
it means something that, as we talked about before,
we understand it because we are from it.
But how I make sure that the next generation
willing to pay for it
because the understanding significant of that.
And I think this is the biggest question
that we need to touch it, like we need to find a solution.
<v ->Yeah, I think, there one more question?</v>
Yeah?
<v ->Yeah.</v>
So really loving that, you know,
fantastic point for you Michelle.
Perhaps a question to the audience, to the panelists,
building on that, and we love your perspective
as well on this, Michelle,
we talked about perhaps consumer salience,
consumer awareness.
Great, we're working at maybe not enough,
but what we have seen is fellow procurement
and we've seen fellow procurement
potentially prioritizing the trust mark, right?
There's been some reporting on that coming in soon.
We've seen fellow procurement prioritizing security
based on measures.
That's the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act.
I heard from you maybe the states
and cities can take that approach.
So we'd love to hear more all, you know,
audio your perspective on this.
Should we have state and local officials
using their procurement authority, right,
to incentivize those manufacturers of IoT
who are putting the secure by design culture in.
What do you think?
<v ->I think it's important, significant, obviously,</v>
and also this is exactly the point,
If it'll make smart cities smart enough on cybersecurity
or not, because we can all agree it depends
on which state local it'll be
and who will be deleting authority, right,
and which who, what you will incentivize.
and if cybersecurity even will be something
that you think about
when you're thinking about smart cities.
So exactly to your point.
And I think that this gap
that we see not only in smart cities
but in so many different elements of security
or national security, we need to mitigate the gap
between the federal and the federal perspective
and the local government.
And we need to see how we can make sure
that the same security baseline,
exactly the point that we just talked about,
how there is a threshold that is we can make sure
that the foundation is equal to every state,
<v Veronica>Right, and that's definitely a challenge,</v>
I'd say, in some of my time working with the states.
And we have 30 seconds,
so make that a quick question for me.
<v Participant>Yeah, you talked a lot about cyber attacks,</v>
how to protect the critical infrastructure.
So when we had some windstorms to Texas,
cable was cut.
<v ->Yeah, yeah, no that's 100% right.</v>
And as we think about cyber security,
we think about the actual nexus
between physical security and cybersecurity.
You know, so physical challenges
that were experienced in Texas a few years ago
and that ice storm, you know,
when power was lost was, it was a fuels problem.
You know, there was some decisions made on fuels
and, you know, they've since recognized
that the temperatures could be sub-zero
and it's a problem the way they're doing fuels then.
So, you know, they've started to correct that,
but that's kind of thinking all across the nation
and recognizing and understanding physical threats
and how those physical threats can also impact
the security on the cyber side of our systems
that are more and more IP connected.
<v ->Well we are now out of time,</v>
so I wanna thank my panelists for joining me.
It was a great conversation.
I can't believe it went so fast.
So thank you very much for attending today.
We really appreciate it.
