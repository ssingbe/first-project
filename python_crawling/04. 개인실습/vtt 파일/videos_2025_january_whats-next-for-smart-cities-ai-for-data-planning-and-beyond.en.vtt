00:00.000 --> 00:03.167
(gentle bright music)

00:10.620 --> 00:11.460
<v ->I'm David Shrier.</v>

00:11.460 --> 00:13.680
I am your host for this session.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.840
We are joined by an esteemed panel

00:15.840 --> 00:18.510
who I will introduce as we go through the questions,

00:18.510 --> 00:19.950
and we'll be talking about,

00:19.950 --> 00:22.140
What's Next for Smart Cities:

00:22.140 --> 00:25.353
AI for Data, Planning and Beyond.

00:26.340 --> 00:30.120
So my first question goes to Sheri Bachstein,

00:30.120 --> 00:32.070
who leads The Weather Channel,

00:32.070 --> 00:33.930
excuse me, The Weather Company,

00:33.930 --> 00:35.760
a role which has given her the chance

00:35.760 --> 00:38.223
to chase eight tornadoes in a day.

00:39.120 --> 00:41.040
Sheri, you may have insight into something

00:41.040 --> 00:43.230
that I'm rather interested in.

00:43.230 --> 00:47.220
Last year, we saw devastation to regions of the US

00:47.220 --> 00:50.430
that don't normally get impacted by hurricanes,

00:50.430 --> 00:52.830
like the mountains of Eastern Tennessee

00:52.830 --> 00:56.070
and the west end of North Carolina.

00:56.070 --> 00:58.410
Not to mention, extreme heat,

00:58.410 --> 01:03.410
which killed people at a rate 100% higher than 20 years ago,

01:03.690 --> 01:06.060
mostly in urban environments, right?

01:06.060 --> 01:08.580
So we're dealing with these extreme weather events.

01:08.580 --> 01:11.700
How do we better prepare cities and communities

01:11.700 --> 01:14.460
so that they, in turn, can better protect people

01:14.460 --> 01:15.810
and infrastructure?

01:15.810 --> 01:17.190
<v ->Well, David, thank you for including me</v>

01:17.190 --> 01:18.023
on the panel today.

01:18.023 --> 01:18.870
It's great to be here.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.840
And, you know, there is absolutely no doubt

01:21.840 --> 01:23.490
that our climate is changing

01:23.490 --> 01:27.330
and we are seeing more extreme events.

01:27.330 --> 01:29.580
But, not only that, we're seeing weather events

01:29.580 --> 01:32.220
happen outside of their seasonal norms, right?

01:32.220 --> 01:34.050
So that becomes very challenging,

01:34.050 --> 01:36.060
because it's not predictable anymore.

01:36.060 --> 01:38.760
And so you definitely saw that with the devastation

01:38.760 --> 01:39.900
that happened in Asheville,

01:39.900 --> 01:43.410
you would never think a hurricane would impact inland.

01:43.410 --> 01:45.750
And so there's a few things as we look

01:45.750 --> 01:50.750
at how AI can really help as it relates to extreme weather.

01:50.910 --> 01:54.090
One of the areas is around urban design, right?

01:54.090 --> 01:57.180
And really being able to design an infrastructure

01:57.180 --> 02:00.180
that can hold up to events

02:00.180 --> 02:02.010
that we've never seen before, right?

02:02.010 --> 02:05.730
And so the power of AI, you can take a lot of climate data

02:05.730 --> 02:08.220
and be able to come up with those scenarios

02:08.220 --> 02:09.540
that we haven't seen

02:09.540 --> 02:11.310
versus what we kind of do today

02:11.310 --> 02:13.980
is we look back at historical data, right?

02:13.980 --> 02:16.830
And so this gives us the ability to be more predictive,

02:16.830 --> 02:19.140
so then we can redesign those infrastructures,

02:19.140 --> 02:22.770
we can redesign those emergency response systems,

02:22.770 --> 02:24.810
which I think are critically important.

02:24.810 --> 02:28.080
And then, the other thing that I'm very excited about,

02:28.080 --> 02:30.540
because it plays right into what The Weather Company does,

02:30.540 --> 02:32.070
and The Weather Channel is one of our brands,

02:32.070 --> 02:35.070
so that's okay, is that, you know,

02:35.070 --> 02:39.390
traditionally, AI is now giving us the ability

02:39.390 --> 02:43.320
to much further our forecasting capabilities, right?

02:43.320 --> 02:46.200
And so a lot of the weather that you get,

02:46.200 --> 02:48.930
whether you look at your forecast as deterministic, right?

02:48.930 --> 02:52.680
That, for decades, we've delivered a deterministic forecast,

02:52.680 --> 02:56.190
which means one single prediction, right?

02:56.190 --> 02:59.040
With AI now we can really turn

02:59.040 --> 03:01.530
to look at probabilistic forecasting.

03:01.530 --> 03:05.370
And that means that we can take the power of AI

03:05.370 --> 03:08.250
and run thousands of scenarios

03:08.250 --> 03:11.310
to give us a better look at what's the probability

03:11.310 --> 03:13.800
that while this is the best forecast,

03:13.800 --> 03:16.170
there is always going to be the probability

03:16.170 --> 03:18.660
that it could go either side of that forecast.

03:18.660 --> 03:21.060
So this can give communities and governments

03:21.060 --> 03:23.670
the ability to better scenario plan,

03:23.670 --> 03:26.790
again, looking at it to be more predictive,

03:26.790 --> 03:28.410
more preparation.

03:28.410 --> 03:31.740
You know, we can't control Mother Nature, right,

03:31.740 --> 03:36.510
and the forecast will always, you know, be interesting.

03:36.510 --> 03:39.180
But we can better plan for the uncertainty,

03:39.180 --> 03:42.000
and I think that's really where smart cities

03:42.000 --> 03:43.350
can really benefit.

03:43.350 --> 03:44.790
<v ->Great, thank you.</v>

03:44.790 --> 03:49.230
So Barbara Bickham is a CTO and venture capital leader,

03:49.230 --> 03:52.500
and has won two poker championships.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.563
She'll be running a game after the panel just in Hall C.

03:56.580 --> 03:58.230
Barbara, you've worked at the convergence

03:58.230 --> 04:01.140
of different technologies with AI, like blockchain,

04:01.140 --> 04:03.510
in crafting innovative city environments

04:03.510 --> 04:06.360
from Honduras to Ohio.

04:06.360 --> 04:10.803
How are you using technology to improve citizen experiences?

04:11.970 --> 04:15.510
<v ->So we utilize AI (audio drops)</v>

04:15.510 --> 04:17.820
in quantum computing, Internet of Things,

04:17.820 --> 04:20.040
'cause we are gonna be one of the things

04:20.040 --> 04:23.880
in these smart cities, and also Web3 experiences,

04:23.880 --> 04:27.810
in order to not only plan a city,

04:27.810 --> 04:31.260
how do you go about moving around in a city,

04:31.260 --> 04:36.260
but what should a city really look like and be governed?

04:36.510 --> 04:39.480
So we are looking at using DAOs,

04:39.480 --> 04:42.300
distributed autonomous organizations,

04:42.300 --> 04:45.450
in order for citizens to have more say

04:45.450 --> 04:48.450
in the governance of a smart city.

04:48.450 --> 04:51.420
So instead of having a traditional centralized government

04:51.420 --> 04:53.730
where you would go to a DMV,

04:53.730 --> 04:55.170
well, we still would have DMV,

04:55.170 --> 04:57.390
those records would be on a blockchain.

04:57.390 --> 05:02.390
But instead of having certain centralized services,

05:02.910 --> 05:06.480
you could utilize something like Clean &amp; Safe,

05:06.480 --> 05:09.690
where citizens could be involved in their area

05:09.690 --> 05:12.240
and say, "Well, we don't want the graffiti here.

05:12.240 --> 05:16.890
We wanna vote to have that remitted or abated.

05:16.890 --> 05:19.470
We don't wanna have this types of crimes here.

05:19.470 --> 05:21.990
We want to have more policing

05:21.990 --> 05:25.200
and more kind of socialized services over in these areas."

05:25.200 --> 05:27.810
So it's a way for the citizenry

05:27.810 --> 05:30.510
to be more involved in their community

05:30.510 --> 05:32.460
and more connected to each other

05:32.460 --> 05:36.900
versus having this kind of one layer of person

05:36.900 --> 05:38.730
that is in between

05:38.730 --> 05:41.970
where you kind of feel disconnected amongst each other.

05:41.970 --> 05:43.828
<v ->Okay, thank you.</v>
<v ->Mhmm.</v>

05:43.828 --> 05:47.100
<v ->So Prachi Vakharia is strategic advisor</v>

05:47.100 --> 05:50.400
for innovations and infrastructure with ARPA-I,

05:50.400 --> 05:52.380
a US government initiative

05:52.380 --> 05:54.540
to deliver transportation innovation.

05:54.540 --> 05:56.220
So, Prachi, tell us a little bit

05:56.220 --> 05:58.620
about this new ARPA-I initiative

05:58.620 --> 06:00.540
around leveraging emerging data sets

06:00.540 --> 06:03.000
and new techniques in AI

06:03.000 --> 06:05.790
for better understanding infrastructure assets.

06:05.790 --> 06:07.080
<v ->Wonderful, thank you.</v>

06:07.080 --> 06:09.540
Good afternoon, everyone, great to have you here.

06:09.540 --> 06:11.850
ARPA-I, before I get into ARPA-I,

06:11.850 --> 06:13.050
can I see a show of hands,

06:13.050 --> 06:15.303
how many of you have heard of DARPA?

06:16.230 --> 06:18.720
Okay, wow, this is a really impressive crowd.

06:18.720 --> 06:21.300
All right, so you all know DARPA was created,

06:21.300 --> 06:23.490
actually, it was a reaction to the Soviets

06:23.490 --> 06:25.320
at the time launching Sputnik,

06:25.320 --> 06:26.940
and Eisenhower waking up and saying,

06:26.940 --> 06:28.140
you know, "We, as a country,

06:28.140 --> 06:30.330
should never be caught by surprise again,"

06:30.330 --> 06:31.380
and, within four months,

06:31.380 --> 06:33.360
creating this agency that used to be called ARPA,

06:33.360 --> 06:34.680
now it's called DARPA.

06:34.680 --> 06:37.290
But DARPA has given us things like the internet.

06:37.290 --> 06:38.970
I think we can all appreciate that.

06:38.970 --> 06:41.700
Nearly a lot of the foundational technologies here at CES

06:41.700 --> 06:43.320
actually come from DARPA funding.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.900
Drone technologies, for example, internet, like I mentioned,

06:45.900 --> 06:48.570
GPS, global positioning systems,

06:48.570 --> 06:50.610
so on and so forth.

06:50.610 --> 06:52.980
And given how successful this model has been,

06:52.980 --> 06:54.600
about two years ago, the US government,

06:54.600 --> 06:57.090
and especially the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,

06:57.090 --> 06:59.430
created a whole new agency called ARPA-I.

06:59.430 --> 07:01.680
So it's not an initiative, it's actually an agency.

07:01.680 --> 07:04.290
We're in the process of setting it up,

07:04.290 --> 07:06.300
and it ties into infrastructure.

07:06.300 --> 07:07.710
Why infrastructure?

07:07.710 --> 07:10.170
You know, we have so much amazing existing infrastructure

07:10.170 --> 07:11.100
in this country,

07:11.100 --> 07:13.263
and still it certainly can be improved.

07:15.030 --> 07:16.567
What ARPA-I is tasked to do is saying,

07:16.567 --> 07:18.210
"Well, can we use this DARPA model

07:18.210 --> 07:20.340
that's given us so much exciting technology

07:20.340 --> 07:22.770
and apply that to our roads, bridges,

07:22.770 --> 07:24.390
maritime sector, aviation?"

07:24.390 --> 07:27.060
And that includes, I get to look at amazing technologies,

07:27.060 --> 07:29.880
everything from self-healing concrete

07:29.880 --> 07:32.610
to new kinds of sensors that are way more precise

07:32.610 --> 07:33.930
than traditional sensors have been

07:33.930 --> 07:36.150
or classical sensors have been.

07:36.150 --> 07:36.983
To then, of course,

07:36.983 --> 07:39.000
things like electrification and automation,

07:39.000 --> 07:40.050
these trends we've been seeing

07:40.050 --> 07:42.750
for at least the last 10 years in the sector.

07:42.750 --> 07:43.920
Another side note, by the way,

07:43.920 --> 07:47.460
DARPA is also to be credited for creating the AV industry,

07:47.460 --> 07:49.110
the automated vehicle industry.

07:49.110 --> 07:51.420
This is coming from their 2004, '06, and '07

07:51.420 --> 07:52.447
Grand Challenge, which said,

07:52.447 --> 07:55.510
"Hey, can we have a vehicle that's operated

07:56.824 --> 07:58.260
without an operator inside?"

07:58.260 --> 08:00.090
And especially for battlefield environments,

08:00.090 --> 08:01.680
this became quite a necessity.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.090
So they kicked off this whole industry

08:03.090 --> 08:05.340
simply with the power of one challenge.

08:05.340 --> 08:07.680
So really ARPA-I has a great path,

08:07.680 --> 08:10.890
and possibility, and promise ahead.

08:10.890 --> 08:13.890
Now, why are we looking at transportation infrastructure?

08:13.890 --> 08:15.630
A couple of reasons.

08:15.630 --> 08:18.360
You know, I'm always in awe of the defense sector.

08:18.360 --> 08:20.040
Like they know more of what's happening

08:20.040 --> 08:21.930
in the streets of Iraq, for example,

08:21.930 --> 08:24.840
more than we know what's happening in our country.

08:24.840 --> 08:27.990
I used to work at city and state DOTs, and if you ask

08:27.990 --> 08:30.607
a DOT Department of Transportation commissioner,

08:30.607 --> 08:33.630
"Hey, you know, how many bridges do you have in your state,

08:33.630 --> 08:35.550
and what condition are they in?"

08:35.550 --> 08:37.200
and many of them will not be able

08:37.200 --> 08:39.450
to give you a precise answer on that.

08:39.450 --> 08:42.270
We just don't know the condition of many of our assets.

08:42.270 --> 08:44.850
So, last year, we launched a very creative initiative

08:44.850 --> 08:47.280
called Complete Streets AI, with the goal being,

08:47.280 --> 08:49.500
you know, can we use this amazing satellite imagery

08:49.500 --> 08:52.140
that we have access to today?

08:52.140 --> 08:53.820
New, you know, AI models as well,

08:53.820 --> 08:55.770
just new types of computer vision tools,

08:55.770 --> 08:57.240
put that all together

08:57.240 --> 08:59.880
and better make sense of our built infrastructure.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.250
You know, what is the condition of our roads,

09:02.250 --> 09:04.200
our bridges, our highways?

09:04.200 --> 09:07.290
Where do we spend our infrastructure dollars first

09:07.290 --> 09:08.610
and where should we not spend them?

09:08.610 --> 09:11.370
You know, what is in a state of good repair, what isn't?

09:11.370 --> 09:13.650
So really this is why we created the initiative.

09:13.650 --> 09:16.104
I will add one small side note again here is,

09:16.104 --> 09:17.910
I think this is much needed.

09:17.910 --> 09:20.820
If you even think of basic technologies like GPS,

09:20.820 --> 09:23.490
even today, GPS accuracy in defense applications

09:23.490 --> 09:25.560
is at centimeter-level accuracy,

09:25.560 --> 09:28.650
while in the civilian space it's at meter-level accuracy.

09:28.650 --> 09:31.110
So really our mandate is how do we be the best

09:31.110 --> 09:33.090
and use the most cutting-edge technologies

09:33.090 --> 09:34.020
that are out there

09:34.020 --> 09:36.840
or create and inspire them to be built for us?

09:36.840 --> 09:39.270
So this is exactly what we are doing at ARPA-I.

09:39.270 --> 09:41.107
<v ->And I recommend to everyone the book,</v>

09:41.107 --> 09:44.670
"The Entrepreneurial State" by Mariana Mazzucato,

09:44.670 --> 09:46.500
which tells you more detail

09:46.500 --> 09:48.990
on how almost every innovation enjoyed today

09:48.990 --> 09:51.420
was funded by a large-scale government program,

09:51.420 --> 09:53.043
not by Silicon Valley.

09:54.360 --> 09:57.030
So her stage name is Nadia Hansen.

09:57.030 --> 10:00.540
She drives digital transformation at Salesforce.com

10:00.540 --> 10:03.000
and actually lives in Las Vegas.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.460
She is the rare Las Vegas local.

10:05.460 --> 10:09.360
So, Nadia, you used to be the CIO of Las Vegas,

10:09.360 --> 10:11.250
and I'm sure you have some interesting stories

10:11.250 --> 10:12.840
to share both on your past role

10:12.840 --> 10:15.180
and what you're doing with Salesforce.com.

10:15.180 --> 10:18.810
How is AI being used to drive transformation

10:18.810 --> 10:23.160
across cities and countries in Vegas and globally?

10:23.160 --> 10:25.920
<v ->Thank you, well, good afternoon, welcome to my city.</v>

10:25.920 --> 10:29.550
I know nobody says that, I've been here for 25 years.

10:29.550 --> 10:32.460
I've seen the city grow firsthand.

10:32.460 --> 10:35.370
I live in Henderson, which Henderson didn't even exist.

10:35.370 --> 10:38.430
So coming back to your question, David.

10:38.430 --> 10:39.780
You know, some of the things that we're seeing

10:39.780 --> 10:42.000
just globally, I have the privilege of working

10:42.000 --> 10:44.460
with a lot of different state and local agencies,

10:44.460 --> 10:48.900
and it really starts with some foundational basics.

10:48.900 --> 10:53.850
If I want an Amazon experience, I want an Airbnb experience,

10:53.850 --> 10:56.040
I want an Uber experience,

10:56.040 --> 10:59.610
why can't government provide me with that same experience?

10:59.610 --> 11:01.170
So it's very foundational.

11:01.170 --> 11:03.510
I want seamless, I want easy,

11:03.510 --> 11:06.900
intuitive interaction with my government.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.060
How many of you love going to the DMV,

11:09.060 --> 11:11.520
Department of Motor Vehicles, to get a license?

11:11.520 --> 11:13.500
How many of you love to pay your bills,

11:13.500 --> 11:14.490
and then, you know what?

11:14.490 --> 11:16.260
Sometimes you can't pay it online.

11:16.260 --> 11:17.970
Yes, except for one person in back.

11:17.970 --> 11:19.590
Thank you very much for that.

11:19.590 --> 11:22.050
Nobody loves to pay their bills.

11:22.050 --> 11:24.840
But let me tell you, if you make the process,

11:24.840 --> 11:27.840
and if you make the experience easier

11:27.840 --> 11:30.150
for constituents and for citizens,

11:30.150 --> 11:32.100
yes, the interaction will be a lot better.

11:32.100 --> 11:33.600
So a lot of the conversations

11:33.600 --> 11:36.870
are around how can we have an omnichannel approach?

11:36.870 --> 11:38.853
And what I mean by omnichannel is,

11:39.750 --> 11:41.820
look, we're serving five different generations

11:41.820 --> 11:42.750
in government.

11:42.750 --> 11:45.540
We have the Traditionalists, we have Baby Boomers,

11:45.540 --> 11:49.830
we have the Gen Xs, we have pretty soon the Gen Zs,

11:49.830 --> 11:53.130
and all of them want to be served differently.

11:53.130 --> 11:54.180
Some people want to come

11:54.180 --> 11:56.220
into a brick-and-mortar building, great.

11:56.220 --> 11:58.680
Some people never want to see a human, great.

11:58.680 --> 12:00.690
Some people only want to talk

12:00.690 --> 12:03.060
through a mobile device, great.

12:03.060 --> 12:04.770
I think this is the imperative

12:04.770 --> 12:07.740
of us being able to move forward in providing that,

12:07.740 --> 12:10.950
especially with now AI being as part of the realm,

12:10.950 --> 12:14.493
which I'm sure everybody has used ChatGPT in this room.

12:15.510 --> 12:17.370
Pretty much most people.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.890
We're talking about instant gratification.

12:19.890 --> 12:22.170
Okay, and I think we live in this world right now

12:22.170 --> 12:23.820
where every state and local agency

12:23.820 --> 12:25.357
that I speak to is thinking about,

12:25.357 --> 12:28.770
"How do I set up AI governance in my institution?

12:28.770 --> 12:30.990
How do I set up a cyber policy?

12:30.990 --> 12:34.050
How do I have a data governance committee?"

12:34.050 --> 12:36.750
'Cause essentially everything starts with data.

12:36.750 --> 12:37.770
Data is your foundation.

12:37.770 --> 12:39.150
And, in government, I used to work

12:39.150 --> 12:40.800
in government for 15 years,

12:40.800 --> 12:43.500
I have to tell you, we have petabytes of data.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.030
And you don't know how to visualize it,

12:45.030 --> 12:47.250
and you don't know how to make data-driven decisions

12:47.250 --> 12:48.930
because there's so much of it.

12:48.930 --> 12:51.270
So I think it really starts with basics.

12:51.270 --> 12:54.150
What is the outcome that we're trying to achieve?

12:54.150 --> 12:57.360
And then, how can we reverse engineer back to that?

12:57.360 --> 12:59.160
So I'll pass it back to you,

12:59.160 --> 13:00.450
but I wanna talk about agents too

13:00.450 --> 13:03.360
in the next set of questions.

13:03.360 --> 13:04.380
<v ->Sure, well,</v>

13:04.380 --> 13:07.639
so now we're gonna get into some collaborative questions.

13:07.639 --> 13:11.850
So this first one is for Barbara and Nadia.

13:11.850 --> 13:15.097
Data seems pretty central to the AI conversation, right?

13:15.097 --> 13:17.580
And so what are some of the challenges

13:17.580 --> 13:21.873
around working with AI and data in the smart city context?

13:23.100 --> 13:24.657
<v ->I can kick it off?</v>
<v ->Yeah, please.</v>

13:24.657 --> 13:29.250
<v ->So, okay, so a lot of the agencies</v>

13:29.250 --> 13:30.810
that, one, I used to work for,

13:30.810 --> 13:33.750
and, two, a very simple example,

13:33.750 --> 13:36.840
what's the number one thing, when you think of Las Vegas,

13:36.840 --> 13:39.840
what's the number one thing that you think of?

13:39.840 --> 13:41.103
<v ->Casino.</v>
<v ->Casinos.</v>

13:42.390 --> 13:44.850
Gambling, entertainment.

13:44.850 --> 13:46.530
Hockey.
<v ->Water.</v>

13:46.530 --> 13:47.550
<v ->Losing money.</v>

13:47.550 --> 13:49.000
Could be all of those things.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.970
When we were redesigning the website for Clark County,

13:53.970 --> 13:57.330
which is the county here that runs Las Vegas,

13:57.330 --> 13:58.770
we were like, "What do people come here for?

13:58.770 --> 14:00.780
Maybe they come here for a marriage license."

14:00.780 --> 14:02.550
So we decided to design it that way.

14:02.550 --> 14:03.660
But guess what?

14:03.660 --> 14:05.940
We went back and took a look at the data,

14:05.940 --> 14:09.330
and the data actually showed the number one search

14:09.330 --> 14:12.487
on Clark County's website at the time was,

14:12.487 --> 14:15.390
"We're searching for an inmate in jail,"

14:15.390 --> 14:18.120
'cause people just end up missing somehow in Vegas

14:18.120 --> 14:19.020
and they end up in jail,

14:19.020 --> 14:20.820
because there's a lot of things happening.

14:20.820 --> 14:23.287
So coming back to data, this is why when you think,

14:23.287 --> 14:25.860
"Ah, people come here for different reasons,"

14:25.860 --> 14:27.690
yeah, that's an assumption,

14:27.690 --> 14:30.120
but you need evidence to be able to prove it.

14:30.120 --> 14:33.180
So data is imperative in order to do any kind of AI.

14:33.180 --> 14:34.890
So we're talking about AI agents,

14:34.890 --> 14:37.620
that's a digital agent you can have on your side,

14:37.620 --> 14:40.140
your buddy who can actually do everything for you,

14:40.140 --> 14:44.490
and that's kind of augmenting existing workers, right?

14:44.490 --> 14:46.500
And I think that's in the era where we're at,

14:46.500 --> 14:49.350
but you really need to have clean, accurate data

14:49.350 --> 14:51.900
to provide you with the results that you're looking for.

14:51.900 --> 14:54.330
That's the foundation.
<v David>Thank you.</v>

14:54.330 --> 14:56.220
Barbara, Prachi, would you like to build on that?

14:56.220 --> 14:58.650
<v ->I'll build on that a little bit.</v>

14:58.650 --> 15:03.450
Back to the fact of you have massive amounts of data,

15:03.450 --> 15:08.040
petabytes of data, and that it's probably siloed off,

15:08.040 --> 15:13.040
so the data is not in kind of an easy way to access.

15:13.680 --> 15:17.460
So that's an opportunity to start using

15:17.460 --> 15:21.480
kind of decentralized AIs so that they can start

15:21.480 --> 15:23.790
having conversation amongst each other,

15:23.790 --> 15:26.197
the AIs can have the conversations and go,

15:26.197 --> 15:28.110
"Hey, I need this data,

15:28.110 --> 15:32.220
because someone is looking for someone in jail,"

15:32.220 --> 15:34.650
or "someone is looking for a marriage license,"

15:34.650 --> 15:35.880
or "someone is looking

15:35.880 --> 15:40.740
for where is the loop here."

15:40.740 --> 15:43.470
So depending upon what people are thinking

15:43.470 --> 15:44.700
about and looking for,

15:44.700 --> 15:47.970
that siloed area is also a problem,

15:47.970 --> 15:50.490
because data can be hidden in one place

15:50.490 --> 15:52.620
that needs to be surfaced somewhere else.

15:52.620 --> 15:56.070
So that's a very common problem, not only in a city,

15:56.070 --> 15:58.830
but many companies have this common problem

15:58.830 --> 16:01.050
of where is all the data?

16:01.050 --> 16:03.480
Why is the data not transparent?

16:03.480 --> 16:07.290
And why is it so siloed off into certain sections?

16:07.290 --> 16:09.060
So that's where the decentralized AI,

16:09.060 --> 16:13.623
decentralized data concepts can help move a city forward.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.930
<v ->Adding to both these points,</v>

16:15.930 --> 16:17.910
I recently just this afternoon

16:17.910 --> 16:21.030
ran into the economic minister of Estonia.

16:21.030 --> 16:23.400
And I asked him, you know, "What makes Estonia special?"

16:23.400 --> 16:25.237
And the one thing he mentioned is,

16:25.237 --> 16:28.230
"We have lots and lots of digitized data."

16:28.230 --> 16:29.250
And this is really key,

16:29.250 --> 16:31.327
'cause data can be in all different forms and formats.

16:31.327 --> 16:33.150
"We have so much historic data."

16:33.150 --> 16:35.190
Well, it turns out no one's managed to digitize it

16:35.190 --> 16:36.420
and put it in the right format,

16:36.420 --> 16:37.560
you know, structural, unstructured,

16:37.560 --> 16:39.270
but, you know, hopefully, structured data

16:39.270 --> 16:41.520
in a way that actually makes it usable.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.500
Now in the transportation sector,

16:43.500 --> 16:45.720
that gets amplified quite a bit.

16:45.720 --> 16:47.640
We have a federated system of building stuff

16:47.640 --> 16:48.480
here in this country,

16:48.480 --> 16:51.600
that means we have nonstandard curb cuts

16:51.600 --> 16:52.980
or curb ramps, for example.

16:52.980 --> 16:55.590
You know, the sidewalk itself is designed differently,

16:55.590 --> 16:57.210
and it's designed differently in every town,

16:57.210 --> 16:59.043
every city, every state.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.100
We have national centers,

17:02.100 --> 17:03.240
but sometimes states do,

17:03.240 --> 17:04.530
or cities and regions do

17:04.530 --> 17:06.330
what they need to serve their people,

17:06.330 --> 17:07.650
which means they go about building things

17:07.650 --> 17:10.110
the way they've been building for the last 50 years.

17:10.110 --> 17:11.400
And this is a big problem,

17:11.400 --> 17:13.560
because there's no lack of standardization.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.300
Well, how do you then put something

17:15.300 --> 17:17.070
at a national level that makes sense

17:17.070 --> 17:20.730
and create a kind of national database of things?

17:20.730 --> 17:23.910
You know, one small example is you could have,

17:23.910 --> 17:27.270
I could have a national database of bike routes,

17:27.270 --> 17:28.897
for example, in this country, and say like,

17:28.897 --> 17:30.990
"Hey, you know, if I wanna bike from A to B,

17:30.990 --> 17:33.000
can I take a bike route across the way?"

17:33.000 --> 17:34.470
But, you know, how do you define bike routes?

17:34.470 --> 17:36.900
And turns out, there are many different definitions of it,

17:36.900 --> 17:39.300
many different ways they're protected, unprotected.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.550
So lots and lots of variations,

17:41.550 --> 17:43.890
so this is one about data quality itself.

17:43.890 --> 17:46.380
Another anecdote I'll share is when I was working

17:46.380 --> 17:48.080
with the Massachusetts government,

17:49.252 --> 17:51.960
you know, I was in charge of enhancements,

17:51.960 --> 17:53.040
especially to stations,

17:53.040 --> 17:55.500
especially those people coming into transit stations

17:55.500 --> 17:56.730
in the Boston region.

17:56.730 --> 17:59.010
And when I asked for maps of these stations

17:59.010 --> 17:59.942
so I could start, you know, building

17:59.942 --> 18:03.510
on what enhancements we needed to build on top of it,

18:03.510 --> 18:05.700
I got a Dropbox folder,

18:05.700 --> 18:07.620
which was randomly created by a contractor,

18:07.620 --> 18:12.620
with PDF files of the station as-built maps from the 1970s.

18:12.780 --> 18:14.940
This is the best and the most recent data

18:14.940 --> 18:17.580
they had of our infrastructure.

18:17.580 --> 18:19.200
So that tells you there's a lot we need to do

18:19.200 --> 18:22.380
and improve in terms of data quality, data standardization,

18:22.380 --> 18:25.380
and then, of course, your AI tools can come on top of that.

18:25.380 --> 18:26.910
AI itself is really exciting.

18:26.910 --> 18:28.710
You know, along with all these hundreds of models

18:28.710 --> 18:29.880
we've seen applicants use,

18:29.880 --> 18:33.120
even things like visual language models.

18:33.120 --> 18:35.310
Again, that combines and helps you do extraction

18:35.310 --> 18:37.170
from maps or images,

18:37.170 --> 18:39.480
and also combine it with language.

18:39.480 --> 18:40.500
So there's a lot of hope,

18:40.500 --> 18:44.520
and I think AI can fill a lot of gaps in this data spectrum.

18:44.520 --> 18:46.110
So I'm excited.

18:46.110 --> 18:48.540
<v ->And so kind of extending this point,</v>

18:48.540 --> 18:50.880
data's obviously a big part of the intersection

18:50.880 --> 18:53.250
of weather and infrastructure.

18:53.250 --> 18:54.870
So this is for Sheri,

18:54.870 --> 18:56.940
and then, Prachi, you can build on this.

18:56.940 --> 18:59.610
Are there places where public-private partnerships

18:59.610 --> 19:02.890
could help us around getting better AI

19:03.870 --> 19:06.750
and better quality data going into that AI?

19:06.750 --> 19:07.583
<v ->Oh, absolutely.</v>

19:07.583 --> 19:09.990
And, Nadia, I would've thought the most searched term

19:09.990 --> 19:11.823
would've been "What's the weather in Las Vegas?"

19:11.823 --> 19:13.920
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->But maybe not.</v>

19:13.920 --> 19:16.980
But, no, The Weather Company,

19:16.980 --> 19:18.780
for years we've had partnerships

19:18.780 --> 19:21.810
with NOAA, NWS, with the government,

19:21.810 --> 19:24.240
with universities

19:24.240 --> 19:28.230
that we're doing science and projects with,

19:28.230 --> 19:29.610
and then with other companies.

19:29.610 --> 19:32.850
Right now, for example, we are partnering with Nvidia

19:32.850 --> 19:37.200
to build the next generation of AI weather modeling.

19:37.200 --> 19:40.470
And it's a weather model, it'll be the first of its kind,

19:40.470 --> 19:43.830
that will be down to a one kilometer.

19:43.830 --> 19:46.680
It's an AI numeric-based model.

19:46.680 --> 19:50.700
And so, you know, there's a lot of ways to get data

19:50.700 --> 19:52.620
and to partner to get that data.

19:52.620 --> 19:54.960
Our forecasts, we use 100 different models,

19:54.960 --> 19:56.790
some from governments around the world,

19:56.790 --> 19:59.520
some from, you know, private sector,

19:59.520 --> 20:02.070
from sensors, as you were talking about,

20:02.070 --> 20:03.630
from airplane sensors,

20:03.630 --> 20:06.600
from your cell phones, if you give us permission.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.820
All of that goes into input,

20:08.820 --> 20:12.720
because I think the more quality data that we can look at,

20:12.720 --> 20:14.670
the better the answer will be.

20:14.670 --> 20:17.190
And so I think having an ecosystem

20:17.190 --> 20:20.100
where you have partnerships across different sectors

20:20.100 --> 20:22.230
is really fundamental

20:22.230 --> 20:25.113
as we continue down this AI journey collectively.

20:26.340 --> 20:28.770
<v ->Yeah, I'll touch more on just how weather</v>

20:28.770 --> 20:31.620
and infrastructure connect together.

20:31.620 --> 20:33.217
One example is, of course, like, all of us,

20:33.217 --> 20:36.030
you know, a lot of times our routes get disrupted

20:36.030 --> 20:38.160
if there's rain or there's snow,

20:38.160 --> 20:41.220
things take just much longer to get to than before.

20:41.220 --> 20:42.600
During my time at Amazon as well,

20:42.600 --> 20:45.217
I know they've explored using weather companies

20:45.217 --> 20:46.770
and weather services

20:46.770 --> 20:49.530
that even give information at the very block level,

20:49.530 --> 20:52.260
so you know exactly at this block how much traffic there is.

20:52.260 --> 20:53.940
You also wanna understand, "Well, are the tires

20:53.940 --> 20:56.910
on this truck going to be slippery?" for example.

20:56.910 --> 20:58.890
From a kind of public sector side,

20:58.890 --> 21:00.960
a lot of cities and states can also do things

21:00.960 --> 21:03.030
like continuous route planning,

21:03.030 --> 21:04.980
and this is, again, a technology

21:04.980 --> 21:06.570
that could be possible in the future.

21:06.570 --> 21:07.680
'Cause right now, route planning is,

21:07.680 --> 21:08.513
you know, "I wanna go from A to B

21:08.513 --> 21:10.200
and here are the steps to get there."

21:10.200 --> 21:12.060
But what if it's something that's continuous?

21:12.060 --> 21:14.070
And, you know, new kinds of technology can enable that.

21:14.070 --> 21:15.240
So that means, you know,

21:15.240 --> 21:17.070
as you're moving through your route,

21:17.070 --> 21:18.127
you can then figure out,

21:18.127 --> 21:19.440
"Well, there's traffic here

21:19.440 --> 21:20.670
or there's a weather event here

21:20.670 --> 21:22.410
or there's a blockage there,

21:22.410 --> 21:24.990
this road is closed, well, let's reroute it,"

21:24.990 --> 21:26.790
but all happening in real time.

21:26.790 --> 21:30.120
So imagine a digital twin of your city or your region

21:30.120 --> 21:32.880
and that helps you go from A to B.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.470
One technology I'm excited for,

21:34.470 --> 21:36.990
again, weather infrastructure is also perhaps the role

21:36.990 --> 21:39.390
that quantum computing can play in this.

21:39.390 --> 21:41.730
Quantum computers are still very far away,

21:41.730 --> 21:43.164
but we started to see some models

21:43.164 --> 21:45.600
that look interesting and promising.

21:45.600 --> 21:47.520
For example, with tsunamis or hurricanes,

21:47.520 --> 21:50.970
how do you have evacuation done in a way

21:50.970 --> 21:52.890
that's really intelligent and optimized?

21:52.890 --> 21:54.960
Because, again, quantum computers,

21:54.960 --> 21:56.160
you know, they work in sort of bits

21:56.160 --> 21:57.180
which have zeros and ones,

21:57.180 --> 21:59.760
quantum qubits can have multiple different states,

21:59.760 --> 22:02.370
zero-one or zero and one at the same time.

22:02.370 --> 22:05.430
Anyways, it's this exponential and fast compute time

22:05.430 --> 22:06.990
that makes them really great,

22:06.990 --> 22:09.120
which means you could add just way more constraints,

22:09.120 --> 22:11.550
way more variables into your model

22:11.550 --> 22:13.140
and make that better and better and better.

22:13.140 --> 22:15.360
So we certainly see a lot of great technologies

22:15.360 --> 22:17.307
in the future that can help with weather and infrastructure

22:17.307 --> 22:19.020
and how they connect together.

22:19.020 --> 22:21.090
<v Barbara>David, I'd like to add on to this</v>

22:21.090 --> 22:22.950
a little bit.
<v ->Yeah, please.</v>

22:22.950 --> 22:26.130
<v ->So Honduras, we are dealing with, like,</v>

22:26.130 --> 22:28.260
they had a weather event.

22:28.260 --> 22:31.740
And had we been able to see that ahead of time,

22:31.740 --> 22:33.360
now their port is stuck.

22:33.360 --> 22:36.120
Like, they can't ship anything out of their port,

22:36.120 --> 22:38.670
so we're trying to help them move products

22:38.670 --> 22:39.510
out of their port.

22:39.510 --> 22:41.070
So now their economy has stopped,

22:41.070 --> 22:43.020
like, their economy is stuck,

22:43.020 --> 22:45.030
because they can't ship out their crabs

22:45.030 --> 22:47.760
and their other kind of high-end things

22:47.760 --> 22:50.490
that they use for their economy.

22:50.490 --> 22:53.760
So we're going in there and helping solve that immediately.

22:53.760 --> 22:56.227
But if there were weather models that said,

22:56.227 --> 22:57.810
"Hey, this is hurricane season,

22:57.810 --> 23:00.960
these hurricanes are gonna come in here at these times,"

23:00.960 --> 23:03.540
you could potentially reroute those products

23:03.540 --> 23:05.940
into a whole different area

23:05.940 --> 23:09.420
so that they can still have their economy functioning

23:09.420 --> 23:11.310
versus now they're stuck and-

23:11.310 --> 23:13.500
<v ->Supply chain optimization.</v>
<v ->Yeah, we can help-</v>

23:13.500 --> 23:15.840
<v ->Supply chain resiliency.</v>
<v ->Yeah, the resiliency</v>

23:15.840 --> 23:17.257
of the supply chain, 'cause we know,

23:17.257 --> 23:19.740
"Okay, we know to the centimeter,

23:19.740 --> 23:22.200
like, the hurricane's gonna be hitting in these areas,

23:22.200 --> 23:25.920
so now we need to migrate these products this way initially,

23:25.920 --> 23:28.800
and then we can kind of reset it back

23:28.800 --> 23:30.390
when the weather is better,"

23:30.390 --> 23:32.400
and so it's a powerful-
<v ->I mean, I think this lends-</v>

23:32.400 --> 23:34.200
<v ->Powerful use case for that.</v>

23:34.200 --> 23:36.750
<v ->Yeah, please.</v>
<v ->Itself to governments,</v>

23:36.750 --> 23:40.110
businesses all have to have a weather strategy, right,

23:40.110 --> 23:42.570
because of the changes in the climate.

23:42.570 --> 23:45.690
So you no more can just predict it or ignore that,

23:45.690 --> 23:48.235
that would be not responsible to do that.

23:48.235 --> 23:51.858
So I agree, like, if they had a weather strategy and a plan,

23:51.858 --> 23:54.870
you know, because AI is giving us that ability

23:54.870 --> 23:56.610
to better predict, right?
<v ->Yes.</v>

23:56.610 --> 23:58.800
<v ->Especially down to a storm scale level,</v>

23:58.800 --> 24:00.000
which is really critical.
<v ->Well, they know,</v>

24:00.000 --> 24:00.870
and they know, right?

24:00.870 --> 24:02.220
Because every year this happens.

24:02.220 --> 24:04.080
So it's not like it's a surprise,

24:04.080 --> 24:07.140
but they just weren't prepared.

24:07.140 --> 24:09.540
Maybe it was a little bit worse this year than last year,

24:09.540 --> 24:12.360
or the year before, but it's a constant thing.

24:12.360 --> 24:15.780
And it's absolutely impacting their supply chain now

24:15.780 --> 24:17.160
and their economy has stopped.

24:17.160 --> 24:19.680
So at that, you know, it's unfortunate,

24:19.680 --> 24:21.450
like, we all know about North Carolina,

24:21.450 --> 24:24.660
but like this country, their GDP is going down,

24:24.660 --> 24:26.280
because they can't ship any products out.

24:26.280 --> 24:28.350
<v ->Sure.</v>
<v ->Well, and so,</v>

24:28.350 --> 24:31.620
we're talking about AI, obviously, on this panel.

24:31.620 --> 24:32.640
It's a hot topic.

24:32.640 --> 24:35.460
Everyone is very excited by the new Nvidia announcement

24:35.460 --> 24:37.950
that we heard this week at CES.

24:37.950 --> 24:40.860
So there's lots of talk about artificial intelligence,

24:40.860 --> 24:43.170
but what about human intelligence?

24:43.170 --> 24:46.200
I mean, where does the humanity intersect

24:46.200 --> 24:49.620
with this artificial intelligence?

24:49.620 --> 24:53.520
How do you see AI and human intelligence working together,

24:53.520 --> 24:54.600
and what's the potential

24:54.600 --> 24:56.390
for that collaboration to look like?

24:56.390 --> 24:57.810
So I throw that open to the panel,

24:57.810 --> 24:59.460
whoever wants to jump in on this.

24:59.460 --> 25:01.863
<v ->So I'm working with a company called Reliable,</v>

25:02.700 --> 25:06.780
and they have a mix of AI and human intelligence.

25:06.780 --> 25:10.050
So what they do is they try and take bias out of the data,

25:10.050 --> 25:13.080
because it's not only about how the model is created,

25:13.080 --> 25:17.160
it's also how the model algorithmically starts

25:17.160 --> 25:20.520
looking at the data, and then surfacing data.

25:20.520 --> 25:23.880
So they have the ability to auto-tag

25:23.880 --> 25:26.790
and also for you to tag it yourself

25:26.790 --> 25:30.120
so that the data ends up becoming more robust

25:30.120 --> 25:34.833
and more clear so that the accuracy is better.

25:35.760 --> 25:39.797
And so that product kind of helps surface

25:42.060 --> 25:44.370
all of the different pieces of data

25:44.370 --> 25:46.620
that AI could utilize there.

25:46.620 --> 25:51.620
It's not just, you know, we talked a lot,

25:51.630 --> 25:53.477
okay, I'll leave it there.

25:53.477 --> 25:54.910
<v ->Yeah, sure.</v>
<v ->I'll leave it there.</v>

25:54.910 --> 25:56.550
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>
<v ->Thank you.</v>

25:56.550 --> 25:59.040
<v ->If I can provide a sort of mental model or taxonomy,</v>

25:59.040 --> 26:02.970
or if you wanna call it, for AI and humans,

26:02.970 --> 26:04.530
one way to think about it is,

26:04.530 --> 26:05.820
think of it in four stages.

26:05.820 --> 26:07.350
One is like a human only, right?

26:07.350 --> 26:08.790
So any task that's given,

26:08.790 --> 26:10.260
and depending on the variety of tasks,

26:10.260 --> 26:11.910
but tasks are human only

26:11.910 --> 26:14.070
with very little assistance from AI.

26:14.070 --> 26:16.230
The next level is human-in-the-loop.

26:16.230 --> 26:18.330
And this is where, again, AI does some of the work,

26:18.330 --> 26:21.030
but it's really meant to assist the human being themselves

26:21.030 --> 26:22.350
and, you know, the human, like us,

26:22.350 --> 26:25.530
maybe using ChatGPT once in a while to ask questions,

26:25.530 --> 26:26.620
that's human-in-the-loop.

26:26.620 --> 26:29.190
Well, the next after that is human-on-the-loop,

26:29.190 --> 26:32.280
and this is where AI is doing a lot of the planning,

26:32.280 --> 26:34.440
it's doing a lot of the planning, a lot of the execution,

26:34.440 --> 26:36.690
but key decision making or supervision

26:36.690 --> 26:38.340
happens from the human side.

26:38.340 --> 26:40.500
And then, the last stage is AI only,

26:40.500 --> 26:42.840
which is where the AI system is in full control

26:42.840 --> 26:46.230
of all execution planning, of task operations, et cetera.

26:46.230 --> 26:48.000
<v ->I think to add to Prachi's point,</v>

26:48.000 --> 26:50.910
you know, AI's been around for, what, 10 plus years,

26:50.910 --> 26:53.040
and it really started with automation.

26:53.040 --> 26:54.150
It was very simple.

26:54.150 --> 26:56.400
It's like workflow processing automation,

26:56.400 --> 26:59.610
making sure things get routed to the appropriate region,

26:59.610 --> 27:01.950
department, agency, whatever that might be.

27:01.950 --> 27:04.500
And then, the second wave was more on predictive analysis,

27:04.500 --> 27:06.240
which is what we talked about.

27:06.240 --> 27:08.280
So you could still do predictive analysis.

27:08.280 --> 27:09.840
AI has a lot of different flavors.

27:09.840 --> 27:11.250
It's not just generative AI,

27:11.250 --> 27:15.090
which is now the third wave which we're in right now.

27:15.090 --> 27:17.940
And I do feel with the evolution of LLMs,

27:17.940 --> 27:20.520
we're not quite there yet to be fully automated, Prachi,

27:20.520 --> 27:22.680
like, you know, with the only AI

27:22.680 --> 27:24.390
being the central hub of everything,

27:24.390 --> 27:26.490
just because you brought up bias,

27:26.490 --> 27:29.550
there's a consistency, there's transparency,

27:29.550 --> 27:30.570
there's accountability,

27:30.570 --> 27:33.510
there's all of these things that have to be in place

27:33.510 --> 27:37.500
before you can fully rely and trust a robot

27:37.500 --> 27:40.290
or a machine to be able to do everything.

27:40.290 --> 27:42.330
We're getting really good at reasoning,

27:42.330 --> 27:45.240
we're getting really good at logic, and processing,

27:45.240 --> 27:46.200
and making sure...

27:46.200 --> 27:49.710
Like, I was recently using NotebookLM for fun,

27:49.710 --> 27:51.420
and I was trying to create a podcast.

27:51.420 --> 27:54.420
And I love how it has the ums and the ahs,

27:54.420 --> 27:57.750
so we can take the transcript of this entire session

27:57.750 --> 27:59.580
and put it into an LLM,

27:59.580 --> 28:02.400
and it can generate a podcast between the four of us.

28:02.400 --> 28:06.030
That's where we're at right now with human-like feeling.

28:06.030 --> 28:08.477
So I feel we're kind of there, but not really there,

28:08.477 --> 28:10.860
so you still need to have humans in the loop

28:10.860 --> 28:13.950
to be able to augment, to be able to test,

28:13.950 --> 28:16.260
to verify the accuracy,

28:16.260 --> 28:18.780
especially, since our data is kind of all over the map.

28:18.780 --> 28:20.820
And you had mentioned silos before.

28:20.820 --> 28:22.170
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->Like, especially</v>

28:22.170 --> 28:24.240
in government, if we're trying to be a smart city,

28:24.240 --> 28:27.330
you cannot be smart without having your data integrated

28:27.330 --> 28:29.580
so you can see a cohesive picture.

28:29.580 --> 28:32.550
John Smith is maybe in 19 different systems

28:32.550 --> 28:33.383
in different ways.

28:33.383 --> 28:36.360
John A. Smith, J.A. Smith, John Smith,

28:36.360 --> 28:37.680
but it's the same person.

28:37.680 --> 28:40.830
So it really comes back to personalization of services,

28:40.830 --> 28:42.150
really knowing your customer,

28:42.150 --> 28:43.950
understanding what are they here for,

28:43.950 --> 28:46.170
and let me just provide the services

28:46.170 --> 28:47.370
that they're looking for,

28:47.370 --> 28:49.620
rather than them having to dig it up.

28:49.620 --> 28:50.970
<v ->So back to the tagging,</v>

28:50.970 --> 28:53.040
because we were talking about humans,

28:53.040 --> 28:55.290
and I'm glad you brought that up,

28:55.290 --> 28:58.770
Reliabl helps you do the human pieces

28:58.770 --> 29:01.950
of that tagging.

29:01.950 --> 29:05.430
It's not just all AI doing it, humans are doing it as well.

29:05.430 --> 29:08.680
So that we have a say in how we wanna see

29:10.050 --> 29:13.290
the data and information that we wanna see from AI.

29:13.290 --> 29:16.140
<v ->I mean, I think it's a combination, right?</v>

29:16.140 --> 29:20.310
Man and machine really, that's what we have always done.

29:20.310 --> 29:22.410
We call it actually human-over-the-loop

29:22.410 --> 29:25.200
in what we do in looking at all the weather models,

29:25.200 --> 29:27.300
'cause, you know, it's a paradox, right?

29:27.300 --> 29:31.530
Because AI provides just a vast amount of information,

29:31.530 --> 29:34.020
but, in some cases, you're still needing humans

29:34.020 --> 29:35.460
to actually make the decision

29:35.460 --> 29:37.980
off whatever that information is surfacing.

29:37.980 --> 29:40.560
And so I think, you know, in this stage of AI,

29:40.560 --> 29:42.990
and I agree, we've been using it for a couple decades

29:42.990 --> 29:45.360
actually in our weather forecasting,

29:45.360 --> 29:48.180
it's changing now with generative AI.

29:48.180 --> 29:50.760
But, you know, I think at this point in time,

29:50.760 --> 29:52.920
and where we are in the AI journey,

29:52.920 --> 29:56.160
I think, you know, the match between AI and HI,

29:56.160 --> 29:57.900
we can really learn a lot from each other,

29:57.900 --> 30:01.470
and it's, you know, AI's augmenting human intelligence

30:01.470 --> 30:03.870
to help us make better decisions essentially.

30:03.870 --> 30:06.870
<v ->Great, so we now have time</v>

30:06.870 --> 30:08.550
for questions from the audience.

30:08.550 --> 30:09.600
If you do have a question,

30:09.600 --> 30:12.750
please go up to one of those two microphones

30:12.750 --> 30:14.370
so we can hear you.

30:14.370 --> 30:17.490
If you don't have questions I'll just keep going.

30:17.490 --> 30:19.970
But we did wanna invite you to be part of this conversation

30:19.970 --> 30:21.050
if there is anything you'd like to ask.

30:21.050 --> 30:21.990
If you have a question-
<v ->Go ahead.</v>

30:21.990 --> 30:24.150
<v ->Make sure you go to the mic so we can hear you.</v>

30:24.150 --> 30:25.470
<v Attendee>I just had one clarification.</v>

30:25.470 --> 30:27.210
AI is not there for the last 10 years.

30:27.210 --> 30:29.400
It is there for 40 years, 60 years back, right?

30:29.400 --> 30:30.233
<v ->Right.</v>
<v ->Right.</v>

30:30.233 --> 30:31.620
<v Attendee>It is just in computational space-</v>

30:31.620 --> 30:33.270
<v Nadia>10 plus years, yep, absolutely.</v>

30:33.270 --> 30:34.180
<v Attendee>It's there for a long, long time.</v>

30:34.180 --> 30:35.520
<v ->Mhmm.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

30:35.520 --> 30:38.970
Yes, AI was invented in World War II by Alan Turing

30:38.970 --> 30:41.190
to crack the code on the German submarines.

30:41.190 --> 30:42.360
So it's been around for a long time.

30:42.360 --> 30:44.220
<v ->Very true, very true.</v>

30:44.220 --> 30:46.707
<v ->Hi, Prachi, this is Siva.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

30:46.707 --> 30:48.630
<v Attendee>And, I mean, I think this is a question</v>

30:48.630 --> 30:50.610
for any one of the speakers here.

30:50.610 --> 30:54.690
But, I mean, what I'm hearing

30:54.690 --> 30:59.280
is different ways of analyzing where AI is a tool

30:59.280 --> 31:01.050
and where it is the decision maker,

31:01.050 --> 31:02.970
and you guys are vacillating,

31:02.970 --> 31:06.060
because the use case is what's making it vacillating.

31:06.060 --> 31:09.667
So from the person listening, I'm kind of wondering,

31:09.667 --> 31:11.010
"Are you shooting left, right?

31:11.010 --> 31:11.910
Which, what the heck?"

31:11.910 --> 31:15.090
I mean, because I've seen the same thing in transportation.

31:15.090 --> 31:18.060
I work in the automation, not autonomous,

31:18.060 --> 31:20.340
I'm not there yet, but automation.

31:20.340 --> 31:25.050
So my question to you is, while you sound vacillating,

31:25.050 --> 31:26.880
you're not, you're deliberate.

31:26.880 --> 31:29.730
You're trying to say there's a trust factor

31:29.730 --> 31:31.527
and there's a use-case-based thing,

31:31.527 --> 31:34.590
and I've known Prachi for a long time, but,

31:34.590 --> 31:38.730
so one of you, can you help us understand

31:38.730 --> 31:40.920
in the maturation cycle,

31:40.920 --> 31:44.257
what will it take for us to kind of say,

31:44.257 --> 31:45.870
"Hey, this kid's grown up?"

31:45.870 --> 31:50.100
The AI that is, "Maybe once in a while we can let him ride

31:50.100 --> 31:51.507
and I'll sit in the back."

31:52.680 --> 31:55.980
<v ->So is your question, when will we have L4 mobility,</v>

31:55.980 --> 31:57.333
fully autonomous?

31:58.590 --> 32:00.570
<v Attendee>I mean, for that you need a whole 90 minutes,</v>

32:00.570 --> 32:02.661
but, for this question... (laughs)

32:02.661 --> 32:03.960
<v ->No, we don't need that.</v>

32:03.960 --> 32:05.400
<v ->I think the question is more like,</v>

32:05.400 --> 32:06.540
how do you do validation?

32:06.540 --> 32:07.800
What's trustworthy AI?

32:07.800 --> 32:09.630
What is AI insurance looking like?

32:09.630 --> 32:13.050
<v Attendee>Yeah, when is social acceptance likely?</v>

32:13.050 --> 32:14.654
Because it's social engineering, it's not-

32:14.654 --> 32:16.830
<v ->Okay, so when will people trust AI?</v>

32:16.830 --> 32:18.120
<v Attendee>When will governments,</v>

32:18.120 --> 32:20.160
and governments are also people,

32:20.160 --> 32:22.080
so when will systems

32:22.080 --> 32:25.593
and institutions start trusting AI?

32:26.700 --> 32:28.410
<v ->I have a hot take on it.</v>

32:28.410 --> 32:31.110
My take is education is important.

32:31.110 --> 32:35.370
So a lot of re-skilling and upskilling needs to happen,

32:35.370 --> 32:39.690
not just within government, agencies, employees,

32:39.690 --> 32:43.740
but also constituents, citizens, just regular people.

32:43.740 --> 32:46.020
I think there's a lot of mistrusted places

32:46.020 --> 32:48.210
where people are just like, "Hmm, I'm not so sure.

32:48.210 --> 32:50.130
I don't wanna give government more information

32:50.130 --> 32:52.320
than I have to," since we're on the government panel.

32:52.320 --> 32:54.450
So I feel there needs to be a bit

32:54.450 --> 32:57.290
of one transparency aspect to it.

32:57.290 --> 32:59.880
So what are we gonna do with your data?

32:59.880 --> 33:01.200
I think that needs to happen.

33:01.200 --> 33:03.390
<v Attendee>Yeah, especially with your background</v>

33:03.390 --> 33:04.953
being the county.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

33:04.953 --> 33:06.690
<v ->Thanks.</v>
<v ->No, absolutely.</v>

33:06.690 --> 33:08.790
So I think that's kind of part of it.

33:08.790 --> 33:13.790
I feel there needs to be an active movement

33:13.800 --> 33:15.960
towards making sure that we are providing,

33:15.960 --> 33:18.150
there's a lot of free tools right now to educate,

33:18.150 --> 33:19.650
but are people actually grabbing them?

33:19.650 --> 33:21.360
Google does it, Salesforce does it.

33:21.360 --> 33:24.090
We have Trailhead, it teaches you soft skills, hard skills,

33:24.090 --> 33:26.460
AI, whatever you need to know.

33:26.460 --> 33:28.920
But I feel like are people actually utilizing

33:28.920 --> 33:30.750
that information to learn, absorb,

33:30.750 --> 33:32.550
and try to get comfortable within,

33:32.550 --> 33:34.830
and then say, "Ah, these are the risks.

33:34.830 --> 33:36.390
Here's how we can mitigate it."

33:36.390 --> 33:39.543
But that transparency level's not quite there yet.

33:40.800 --> 33:43.140
<v ->AI is rather ubiquitous actually.</v>

33:43.140 --> 33:45.270
When you go to McDonald's you use AI.

33:45.270 --> 33:47.160
I call the bank the AI phone weave,

33:47.160 --> 33:49.620
which is the most annoying thing when you call.

33:49.620 --> 33:51.330
It's so annoying.

33:51.330 --> 33:53.220
I mean, AI is rather ubiquitous.

33:53.220 --> 33:56.040
Most people don't recognize that they're using AI

33:56.040 --> 33:58.320
on a daily basis in life.

33:58.320 --> 34:02.520
So when is it gonna be massly adopted or massly accepted?

34:02.520 --> 34:05.760
We're stealthily accepting it,

34:05.760 --> 34:09.540
because it's out there in the real world every day.

34:09.540 --> 34:12.660
If you go to certain things, AI is there.

34:12.660 --> 34:14.913
We don't call it AI, we don't call the,

34:16.080 --> 34:17.760
I call it the AI phone weave for the bank.

34:17.760 --> 34:20.190
But when you call the bank and they have all the prompts,

34:20.190 --> 34:22.920
we don't call that an AI specifically,

34:22.920 --> 34:25.353
but it is a form of AI.

34:26.400 --> 34:27.810
<v Sheri>I think with any change</v>

34:27.810 --> 34:30.390
there's always gonna be a long tail, right,

34:30.390 --> 34:33.363
of people that there's gonna be the early adopters.

34:34.320 --> 34:36.780
But I agree with you, it's a silence accepter,

34:36.780 --> 34:40.980
it's been happening for decades where AI is being used.

34:40.980 --> 34:44.583
You know, it came to the forefront because of ChatGPT.

34:44.583 --> 34:45.540
<v ->That's right.</v>
<v ->That's how consumers</v>

34:45.540 --> 34:46.953
really found out about it.

34:48.060 --> 34:50.163
Which is good, but for all the companies

34:50.163 --> 34:51.990
that have been doing it for decades,

34:51.990 --> 34:52.980
they're like, "What the heck?

34:52.980 --> 34:53.937
We've been using this for a long time."

34:53.937 --> 34:55.860
<v ->Exactly.</v>
<v ->And so I do agree,</v>

34:55.860 --> 34:57.960
but there's always gonna be a long tail to anything.

34:57.960 --> 35:01.353
I mean, look how long it took for us to all get on HD,

35:02.280 --> 35:04.710
to get on to use (audio drops) phones, right?

35:04.710 --> 35:08.430
I think it'll happen much faster than those technologies,

35:08.430 --> 35:12.750
but I still think it's gonna take time to trust, right?

35:12.750 --> 35:13.740
<v Prachi>I disagree a little bit,</v>

35:13.740 --> 35:14.940
just a quick point.
<v ->Sure.</v>

35:14.940 --> 35:16.950
<v ->I think AI, Siva, to your point,</v>

35:16.950 --> 35:18.420
I forget where you're sitting now,

35:18.420 --> 35:20.010
is just it's use-case dependent.

35:20.010 --> 35:22.980
It's gonna take a lot longer for defense applications.

35:22.980 --> 35:25.620
It's gonna take maybe shorter if it's a productivity app

35:25.620 --> 35:28.350
that has no financial or safety consequences,

35:28.350 --> 35:30.720
yeah, then use case is immediate.

35:30.720 --> 35:32.460
<v ->Great, quick question from the audience.</v>

35:32.460 --> 35:34.770
This is the last question before we wrap up.

35:34.770 --> 35:37.170
<v Attendee>So I have, it's more of a curiosity</v>

35:37.170 --> 35:39.000
than a question for Ms. Bickham.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.833
What was the first DAO

35:42.810 --> 35:43.800
you launched, what city?

35:43.800 --> 35:46.380
What was the first city to use a DAO?

35:46.380 --> 35:47.520
Is there one?

35:47.520 --> 35:49.920
<v ->We were looking at using a DAO,</v>

35:49.920 --> 35:52.830
so in 2019, part of the pandemic,

35:52.830 --> 35:56.460
I had four smart cities that I was working on,

35:56.460 --> 35:59.310
some in Africa, some not, some in the Caribbean.

35:59.310 --> 36:02.040
And we were looking at utilizing DAOs

36:02.040 --> 36:03.960
as governance and compliance,

36:03.960 --> 36:05.700
and we were gonna layer AI

36:05.700 --> 36:09.060
on certain of the types of that, those DAOs,

36:09.060 --> 36:12.720
because we knew that autonomy was important,

36:12.720 --> 36:14.130
we knew the data was important,

36:14.130 --> 36:16.170
and we knew that the communities,

36:16.170 --> 36:18.210
it was more important for the communities

36:18.210 --> 36:20.880
to actually have more of a say

36:20.880 --> 36:24.540
than having a centralized way

36:24.540 --> 36:25.980
of having a say in the community.

36:25.980 --> 36:27.120
So if you're in The Bahamas,

36:27.120 --> 36:28.710
this is one of the ones we were doing,

36:28.710 --> 36:30.450
like The Bahamas is not just one island,

36:30.450 --> 36:32.760
it's, like, multiple islands.

36:32.760 --> 36:34.950
So we were looking at doing a DAO,

36:34.950 --> 36:38.430
because communities were not gonna be

36:38.430 --> 36:40.230
in one centralized place.

36:40.230 --> 36:43.680
<v Attendee>Yeah, it seems like it'll be easier to start</v>

36:43.680 --> 36:46.020
in an emerging environment

36:46.020 --> 36:48.600
versus something that's already established.

36:48.600 --> 36:49.983
<v ->Well, it depends.</v>

36:51.356 --> 36:53.730
I mean, most of these I was doing from dirt.

36:53.730 --> 36:55.350
So, like, most of the smart cities

36:55.350 --> 36:59.340
I work on are kind of like from zero, I'll call it,

36:59.340 --> 37:01.350
versus something that was already there.

37:01.350 --> 37:05.460
But when you're creating something from kind of zero,

37:05.460 --> 37:09.120
you wanna reimagine how do you really want governance?

37:09.120 --> 37:10.260
How do you want governments?

37:10.260 --> 37:12.360
How do you want communities to interact?

37:12.360 --> 37:14.790
How do you want people to work with each other?

37:14.790 --> 37:17.400
How do you want people to interact, right?

37:17.400 --> 37:18.990
We're gonna have the extremes.

37:18.990 --> 37:20.820
You're gonna have the ones that wanna do everything,

37:20.820 --> 37:21.930
and then you're gonna wanna have the ones

37:21.930 --> 37:24.390
that opt out of everything and they're paranoid.

37:24.390 --> 37:27.000
We know that, so where is kind of the middle ground.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.497
And so we kind of looked at the middle ground, and said,

37:29.497 --> 37:33.060
"This is how we wanna reimagine a smart city,"

37:33.060 --> 37:36.330
because we're thinking about the future.

37:36.330 --> 37:38.280
Because the quantum computer is coming,

37:38.280 --> 37:40.260
'cause Google had a crack on their chip

37:40.260 --> 37:41.880
or something had happened with them.

37:41.880 --> 37:43.560
We watch that very carefully.

37:43.560 --> 37:45.060
And when that comes,

37:45.060 --> 37:48.870
then how are you now going to govern anything?

37:48.870 --> 37:50.790
<v David>So we're getting close to the end of time,</v>

37:50.790 --> 37:52.680
so we're gonna get into lightning round.

37:52.680 --> 37:53.513
<v ->All right.</v>
<v ->We're gonna go down</v>

37:53.513 --> 37:55.380
the panel on two questions,

37:55.380 --> 37:56.670
and you'll each give an answer.

37:56.670 --> 37:58.470
So the first question is,

37:58.470 --> 38:02.760
what's one AI trend that has surprised you

38:02.760 --> 38:03.963
in the past year?

38:06.030 --> 38:07.650
Nadia, lead us off.

38:07.650 --> 38:09.597
<v ->Ah, I would say-</v>
<v ->Hot takes.</v>

38:09.597 --> 38:11.700
<v ->Hot take, okay, I would say, you know what?</v>

38:11.700 --> 38:15.000
I use AI for everything and so do my kids, number one.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.070
They use it for school.

38:17.070 --> 38:18.510
I have the privilege of teaching

38:18.510 --> 38:20.190
at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas

38:20.190 --> 38:21.660
as a part-time professor.

38:21.660 --> 38:25.290
Every single student is using some level of ChatGPT or AI

38:25.290 --> 38:28.260
to be able to augment essays, and answers, and all that.

38:28.260 --> 38:30.750
So that's not going away.
<v ->Ubiquity, yeah, okay.</v>

38:30.750 --> 38:32.880
<v ->Flat out, so I think that's been a bit of a,</v>

38:32.880 --> 38:36.180
how quickly everybody has absorbed it

38:36.180 --> 38:37.710
and using it in the day to day,

38:37.710 --> 38:39.510
I think it's been a bit of a surprise,

38:39.510 --> 38:41.460
especially since it's been out

38:41.460 --> 38:43.410
for like the last 10 plus years.

38:43.410 --> 38:44.787
<v David>All right, Barbara, hot take.</v>

38:44.787 --> 38:47.520
<v ->Hot take, years ago-</v>
<v ->Surprising trend.</v>

38:47.520 --> 38:48.960
<v ->Hot take, I said, years ago,</v>

38:48.960 --> 38:50.850
there would be no reason to learn how to code.

38:50.850 --> 38:52.590
I said that in 2016.

38:52.590 --> 38:56.910
So earlier, in 2024, I literally,

38:56.910 --> 38:57.960
I'm in the CTO Forum,

38:57.960 --> 39:01.230
and all the CTOs have figured out how to not code

39:01.230 --> 39:02.760
and be more strategic.

39:02.760 --> 39:05.670
So they're utilizing all the GPTs,

39:05.670 --> 39:07.320
they're creating all their own LLMs,

39:07.320 --> 39:10.950
they're creating all their own algorithmic methodologies

39:10.950 --> 39:13.560
in order to advance coding faster

39:13.560 --> 39:16.560
so that these large companies now can,

39:16.560 --> 39:20.550
something that two weeks, can take maybe three days.

39:20.550 --> 39:22.380
<v ->Sheri.</v>
<v ->I think it's interesting</v>

39:22.380 --> 39:26.040
how quickly AI has been adapted into HR systems.

39:26.040 --> 39:28.800
I mean, that is the human connection point, right?

39:28.800 --> 39:31.650
And I think it's fascinating on all aspects

39:31.650 --> 39:34.110
of hiring in HR.

39:34.110 --> 39:38.250
It's really, it's almost pretty much taken over

39:38.250 --> 39:40.530
that type of environment,

39:40.530 --> 39:42.030
and I think that that's really interesting,

39:42.030 --> 39:44.100
'cause that's where you kind of feel

39:44.100 --> 39:46.680
some of the most trusted pieces of your company.

39:46.680 --> 39:48.690
So I think that's interesting.
<v ->Prachi.</v>

39:48.690 --> 39:50.580
<v ->Yeah, what's been interesting is just how large</v>

39:50.580 --> 39:52.950
these models are and how much data they need.

39:52.950 --> 39:55.380
And a challenge maybe to this room and this conference is,

39:55.380 --> 39:58.020
can have AI models for smaller data sets,

39:58.020 --> 40:01.380
and especially an infrastructure is engineering data sets.

40:01.380 --> 40:03.600
And, you know, you don't have too many of the same

40:03.600 --> 40:05.820
to be tagging everything.

40:05.820 --> 40:07.320
So that would be a kind of challenge is,

40:07.320 --> 40:09.870
like, can we work on smaller data sets?

40:09.870 --> 40:11.910
<v ->All right, great, well, I wanna thank our panelists,</v>

40:11.910 --> 40:14.100
Prachi Vakharia, Sheri Bachstein,

40:14.100 --> 40:16.200
Barbara Bickham, and Nadia Hansen.

40:16.200 --> 40:18.270
And thank you all for joining us here

40:18.270 --> 40:20.543
on this discussion about AI and smart cities.

40:20.543 --> 40:21.612
(audience claps)

40:21.612 --> 40:23.140
(gentle bright music)

40:23.140 --> 40:26.723
(gentle bright music ends)
