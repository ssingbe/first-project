00:00.060 --> 00:03.227
(bright upbeat music)

2
00:10.440 --> 00:12.900
<v Sherry>Welcome to the Globetrotter's Guide</v>

3
00:12.900 --> 00:14.340
to Tech Travel.

4
00:14.340 --> 00:17.576
My name is Sherry Huss and I'm head of community at Freeman.

5
00:17.576 --> 00:20.580
Freeman is a global leader in events

6
00:20.580 --> 00:23.426
and we like to make moments matter.

7
00:23.426 --> 00:26.739
Today we wanna talk about making moments matter in travel

8
00:26.739 --> 00:31.739
and have a great panel here to share what they're up to.

9
00:32.126 --> 00:35.010
But you know, I think it's a combination of everything

10
00:35.010 --> 00:37.080
from technology, how's that gonna work?

11
00:37.080 --> 00:40.860
To seamless and frictionless travel.

12
00:40.860 --> 00:43.740
And we've got a generational overlay

13
00:43.740 --> 00:45.122
and a whole host of other things.

14
00:45.122 --> 00:49.618
So without further ado, let me introduce Dr. Richie.

15
00:49.618 --> 00:54.480
Call him Dr. K, and he's going to give a little bit

16
00:54.480 --> 00:56.460
about his perspective about what's going on

17
00:56.460 --> 00:57.483
in the travel world.

18
00:58.860 --> 01:00.573
Oops, there you go.

19
01:02.130 --> 01:02.963
<v ->All right. Good morning.</v>

20
01:02.963 --> 01:04.290
Thank you for coming.

21
01:04.290 --> 01:05.760
So my name is Dr. Richard Karaburun.

22
01:05.760 --> 01:08.850
I teach in hospitality school at NYU.

23
01:08.850 --> 01:11.400
I predominantly teach entrepreneurship,

24
01:11.400 --> 01:15.300
hospitality technology, and trans, and travel, and tourism.

25
01:15.300 --> 01:16.860
So our semester is 14 weeks.

26
01:16.860 --> 01:18.450
So I'm gonna actually give you

27
01:18.450 --> 01:20.864
what we teach in 14 weeks in the next five minutes.

28
01:20.864 --> 01:22.920
And I'm not gonna charge you $7,000,

29
01:22.920 --> 01:24.930
which is our tuition for this class.

30
01:24.930 --> 01:28.200
So that's basically this whole conference is all

31
01:28.200 --> 01:30.630
about revolutionizing every single industry.

32
01:30.630 --> 01:32.310
So we're gonna focus on travel,

33
01:32.310 --> 01:35.160
and what are the technologies, and the trends basically.

34
01:35.160 --> 01:39.060
So I'm just gonna go quickly on what trends are.

35
01:39.060 --> 01:42.570
So these are some of the trends that we see in the industry.

36
01:42.570 --> 01:45.510
And one is all about experiential travel, right?

37
01:45.510 --> 01:48.216
So with the technology, how technology is going to help

38
01:48.216 --> 01:50.370
with the experiences.

39
01:50.370 --> 01:54.000
We used to say data is the king, cash is the king.

40
01:54.000 --> 01:56.790
Now we say experience is the new currency.

41
01:56.790 --> 01:57.960
So it's all about that.

42
01:57.960 --> 02:01.073
What experiences do you actually want your customers to do?

43
02:01.073 --> 02:04.080
This is in every single industry, by the way.

44
02:04.080 --> 02:06.403
Not only travel, education, healthcare, et cetera.

45
02:06.403 --> 02:09.447
The second one, we talk a lot about the sustainable tourism

46
02:09.447 --> 02:12.120
in the age of AI, even now.

47
02:12.120 --> 02:14.880
And it was very nice for me to see AI

48
02:14.880 --> 02:17.460
and sustainability together and the all aisles

49
02:17.460 --> 02:19.830
of the convention center this week.

50
02:19.830 --> 02:21.360
So I'm sure you're gonna see

51
02:21.360 --> 02:23.400
that from the panelists as well.

52
02:23.400 --> 02:26.460
That every single vertical in the travel business, airlines,

53
02:26.460 --> 02:30.300
hotels, OTAs, they're all talking about sustainability.

54
02:30.300 --> 02:34.620
And this became very critical issue after the COVID as well.

55
02:34.620 --> 02:38.820
We always say BC and AC. Not before COVID, after COVID.

56
02:38.820 --> 02:41.793
So we have one planet, one planet only.

57
02:41.793 --> 02:43.680
So that's really the case.

58
02:43.680 --> 02:46.290
The one of the thing, what COVID also did is

59
02:46.290 --> 02:49.590
the expedited digitalization of the society.

60
02:49.590 --> 02:52.103
So digital first experiences.

61
02:52.103 --> 02:56.100
So how you basically digitize the entire customer journey.

62
02:56.100 --> 02:58.860
And again, you are gonna see from my esteemed panelists,

63
02:58.860 --> 03:02.190
that how they do that when you actually travel.

64
03:02.190 --> 03:05.434
This is again, the case for every single industry,

65
03:05.434 --> 03:08.550
anywhere from education into travel as well.

66
03:08.550 --> 03:10.800
The other is all about the cultural

67
03:10.800 --> 03:13.380
and the generational issues.

68
03:13.380 --> 03:15.780
And you see in every single panel I go,

69
03:15.780 --> 03:17.910
we've talked about Gen Zs and millennials,

70
03:17.910 --> 03:19.320
they're now in the workforce

71
03:19.320 --> 03:20.880
and they have the money to spend.

72
03:20.880 --> 03:23.700
How are you actually basically catering

73
03:23.700 --> 03:25.204
that generation as well?

74
03:25.204 --> 03:27.510
The one of the most important thing

75
03:27.510 --> 03:30.690
that I think during COVID, people realize death is real.

76
03:30.690 --> 03:32.004
We can die anytime.

77
03:32.004 --> 03:35.940
And then that wellness, and wellness travel, and health

78
03:35.940 --> 03:37.590
and wellness, and bleisure.

79
03:37.590 --> 03:38.730
Some people hate that word,

80
03:38.730 --> 03:41.089
business slash leisure altogether.

81
03:41.089 --> 03:44.550
So a lot of the travel suppliers are actually talking

82
03:44.550 --> 03:46.170
about how they can actually add,

83
03:46.170 --> 03:49.110
and I'm sure you're gonna be hearing this from RD as well,

84
03:49.110 --> 03:51.000
that they do great Hyatt hotels

85
03:51.000 --> 03:52.766
and similar to other hotel chains as well,

86
03:52.766 --> 03:56.207
everyone's into wellness as well here.

87
03:56.207 --> 03:59.803
So the key, we actually talk a lot

88
03:59.803 --> 04:04.347
about this personalization versus hyper-personalization.

89
04:04.347 --> 04:06.149
We used to talk 10 years ago,

90
04:06.149 --> 04:08.730
we used to call this customization.

91
04:08.730 --> 04:11.267
Customized travel, customization.

92
04:11.267 --> 04:14.760
And it was just a general market segmentation.

93
04:14.760 --> 04:18.210
If you're a millennial making over $60,000 living

94
04:18.210 --> 04:20.530
in the east coast, ah, let's actually customize

95
04:20.530 --> 04:22.620
the travel, travel offerings.

96
04:22.620 --> 04:27.620
Now what AI did is a great tool that hyper-personalization,

97
04:27.631 --> 04:31.131
basically using all the data that we actually,

98
04:31.131 --> 04:34.645
the hotel suppliers or the airlines are gathering it.

99
04:34.645 --> 04:37.980
How can you actually hyper-personalize

100
04:37.980 --> 04:39.840
the experience of travel?

101
04:39.840 --> 04:41.849
Whether it's the airfare,

102
04:41.849 --> 04:44.958
whether it's the, you know, the hotels.

103
04:44.958 --> 04:46.590
So that's just really the case.

104
04:46.590 --> 04:49.800
So ask yourself in your companies as well

105
04:49.800 --> 04:52.050
that how do you hyper-personalize?

106
04:52.050 --> 04:57.050
Do you use AI to hyper-personalize the cases anywhere?

107
04:57.420 --> 05:00.090
I mean we spent what in by now,

108
05:00.090 --> 05:03.000
like almost 48 hours in this hotel in the rooms.

109
05:03.000 --> 05:05.430
They should have tremendous amount of data.

110
05:05.430 --> 05:08.305
What I like, what I dislike about my hotel stay.

111
05:08.305 --> 05:11.340
Do they actually use that for my next stay?

112
05:11.340 --> 05:14.670
And unfortunately not that everybody is actually doing that.

113
05:14.670 --> 05:18.611
So I put a couple of the examples on this as well.

114
05:18.611 --> 05:22.170
Some travel suppliers are ahead as well.

115
05:22.170 --> 05:23.820
Some are just getting that.

116
05:23.820 --> 05:27.090
But really you're gonna be hearing a lot more

117
05:27.090 --> 05:29.171
because the new generation demands

118
05:29.171 --> 05:32.812
the hyper-personalization as well.

119
05:32.812 --> 05:36.630
The other one, Sherry mentioned "frictionless" travel.

120
05:36.630 --> 05:39.273
We talk a lot in the classes about the customer journey

121
05:39.273 --> 05:42.900
from the dreaming, booking, pre-travel,

122
05:42.900 --> 05:44.610
during travel, post travel.

123
05:44.610 --> 05:49.560
So, and now everything is supposed to be connected from Uber

124
05:49.560 --> 05:52.050
to airlines, to hotels, the restaurant as well.

125
05:52.050 --> 05:54.870
So the, again, the new generation is really demanding

126
05:54.870 --> 05:58.770
frictionless travel during their travel time.

127
05:58.770 --> 06:01.706
So again, ask yourself, do you, what do you do about it?

128
06:01.706 --> 06:06.060
AI, I always say 800 pound gorilla in the room,

129
06:06.060 --> 06:08.911
even in CES and it started a couple of years ago.

130
06:08.911 --> 06:11.280
People think AI is the future.

131
06:11.280 --> 06:13.710
I say, "No, AI actually is the present."

132
06:13.710 --> 06:14.940
And look where we are.

133
06:14.940 --> 06:15.773
We are already starting with chatbots

134
06:15.773 --> 06:18.210
and virtual assistants.

135
06:18.210 --> 06:20.490
Everybody's getting better and better at it.

136
06:20.490 --> 06:23.250
Predictive analysis, some actually companies

137
06:23.250 --> 06:26.910
are using greatly how to predict the demand,

138
06:26.910 --> 06:28.680
how to predict the prices.

139
06:28.680 --> 06:31.980
Dynamic pricing is the key right now that I've seen a lot

140
06:31.980 --> 06:34.770
of AI companies on the convention center talking

141
06:34.770 --> 06:36.840
about the dynamic pricing and again.

142
06:36.840 --> 06:39.000
How can you actually help the environment

143
06:39.000 --> 06:42.960
with sustainability using AI basically as well?

144
06:42.960 --> 06:47.297
And I'm gonna move, be moving the next emerging trends.

145
06:47.297 --> 06:50.370
Basically it's all space tourism is a big thing.

146
06:50.370 --> 06:51.837
I've seen some companies over here.

147
06:51.837 --> 06:54.625
It's right now it's very niche.

148
06:54.625 --> 06:57.180
I'm waiting about 15 to 20 years,

149
06:57.180 --> 06:59.310
especially with Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos

150
06:59.310 --> 07:01.110
with all the billions that they have.

151
07:01.110 --> 07:02.822
And I think space tourism is going to be

152
07:02.822 --> 07:06.545
a mass market product about 20 years.

153
07:06.545 --> 07:10.220
Metaverse, a lot of the companies are actually using this

154
07:10.220 --> 07:13.290
with extended reality, especially with all the tools

155
07:13.290 --> 07:16.557
that you guys are seeing in CES that's only gonna help that

156
07:16.557 --> 07:18.206
and that's gonna make the smart hotels

157
07:18.206 --> 07:20.100
in our business as well.

158
07:20.100 --> 07:22.170
That's basically even the hotels

159
07:22.170 --> 07:26.310
are now integrating with Amazons and all the Alexas

160
07:26.310 --> 07:29.550
for the voice controlled room settings and and many more.

161
07:29.550 --> 07:30.570
And sustainability.

162
07:30.570 --> 07:33.390
And again, AI can talk about high drive program

163
07:33.390 --> 07:35.580
incorporating environmental sustainability

164
07:35.580 --> 07:37.290
into operations as well.

165
07:37.290 --> 07:39.750
This is just really a great tool.

166
07:39.750 --> 07:43.860
So key takeaways is hyper-personalization is the key.

167
07:43.860 --> 07:46.110
And again, ask yourself what do you do about it?

168
07:46.110 --> 07:47.160
Frictionless journey.

169
07:47.160 --> 07:49.358
Are you really actually giving the frictionless journey

170
07:49.358 --> 07:51.346
for all your customers?

171
07:51.346 --> 07:53.666
Again, pre-purchase, post-purchase.

172
07:53.666 --> 07:56.400
And AI expanding the role.

173
07:56.400 --> 07:59.820
AI is a tool that how you can actually use this.

174
07:59.820 --> 08:02.400
And sustainability and innovative leadership.

175
08:02.400 --> 08:03.720
And that comes from the top.

176
08:03.720 --> 08:06.485
Some of the CEOs in our industry are really pushing that,

177
08:06.485 --> 08:10.410
and that's just really one of the key things as well.

178
08:10.410 --> 08:13.590
I think I covered it all in 14 weeks, in five minutes, so.

179
08:13.590 --> 08:16.546
<v ->Excellent, excellent. Thank you so much Richie.</v>

180
08:16.546 --> 08:19.650
And now I'd like to introduce Heather Dahl,

181
08:19.650 --> 08:21.154
who's the CEO of Indicio.

182
08:21.154 --> 08:22.620
Heather?

183
08:22.620 --> 08:23.597
<v ->Thank you.</v>

184
08:23.597 --> 08:26.430
One of the areas that we talk about when we talk

185
08:26.430 --> 08:28.521
about frictionless, we talk about AI,

186
08:28.521 --> 08:32.323
we talk about what's next in travel and hospitality,

187
08:32.323 --> 08:37.323
but the lifeblood under that is the traveler, the passenger.

188
08:37.846 --> 08:39.870
It's actually the identity.

189
08:39.870 --> 08:42.990
And it's not only the identity of the actual person doing

190
08:42.990 --> 08:44.966
the traveling who are your guests,

191
08:44.966 --> 08:47.679
it's the identity of the organizations

192
08:47.679 --> 08:50.400
in which that person engages with.

193
08:50.400 --> 08:52.890
When you think about fraud or phishing,

194
08:52.890 --> 08:55.500
how do they know that they're really buying a ticket

195
08:55.500 --> 08:57.420
from your organization's website?

196
08:57.420 --> 08:59.720
And that's where we see the future

197
08:59.720 --> 09:02.506
of how do you remove friction,

198
09:02.506 --> 09:06.346
and create this frictionless, seamless experience

199
09:06.346 --> 09:11.346
when you have all these different centralized ways of data?

200
09:11.580 --> 09:14.550
So what I'm gonna talk about is maybe seen as some

201
09:14.550 --> 09:16.681
of the most unglamorous part of this story,

202
09:16.681 --> 09:20.959
but is actually the linchpin that brings this together.

203
09:20.959 --> 09:24.420
You're also emerging in a world where we talk

204
09:24.420 --> 09:26.266
about this frictionless experience,

205
09:26.266 --> 09:31.266
but you also have growing regulations around the world

206
09:32.178 --> 09:36.664
that are prohibiting centralized databases,

207
09:36.664 --> 09:41.190
centralized ways of storing that are prohibiting

208
09:41.190 --> 09:44.490
how you gather and how much information you can gather.

209
09:44.490 --> 09:47.220
So then it becomes more difficult if you're depending

210
09:47.220 --> 09:51.000
on data masses in order to make your decisions

211
09:51.000 --> 09:52.260
and make your offers.

212
09:52.260 --> 09:56.580
Then you throw in AI, where are they getting that data?

213
09:56.580 --> 09:57.990
How are they getting that data?

214
09:57.990 --> 10:00.840
And are you just making faster, more personalized decisions

215
10:00.840 --> 10:02.126
with bad data?

216
10:02.126 --> 10:04.320
So that's not gonna achieve your goal.

217
10:04.320 --> 10:08.400
One of the things that we can see is that we are moving

218
10:08.400 --> 10:10.864
to a world of a Digital Travel Credential.

219
10:10.864 --> 10:14.820
This is called a DTC, an IKO,

220
10:14.820 --> 10:17.610
Digital Travel Credential Type 1 for the nerds

221
10:17.610 --> 10:18.443
in the room.

222
10:18.443 --> 10:19.950
What this does is think of it

223
10:19.950 --> 10:22.226
as your paper passport for instance.

224
10:22.226 --> 10:24.520
But instead of holding the paper, you have the freedom

225
10:24.520 --> 10:28.581
of your passport because it is stored in your device.

226
10:28.581 --> 10:31.920
It is not stored in a centralized database run

227
10:31.920 --> 10:33.660
by another party.

228
10:33.660 --> 10:37.602
And that DTC that is held in your phone is trusted

229
10:37.602 --> 10:40.646
just like the passport you carry with you.

230
10:40.646 --> 10:43.098
This DTC Type 1 is creating

231
10:43.098 --> 10:45.919
the seamless cross border experiences.

232
10:45.919 --> 10:49.706
In fact, just about a month ago we worked with Delta

233
10:49.706 --> 10:54.450
in using the DTC Type 1 to facilitate seamless travel

234
10:54.450 --> 10:56.398
from Atlanta to Aruba.

235
10:56.398 --> 11:01.020
What happened was the passengers were able to clear borders

236
11:01.020 --> 11:03.660
before they even left for the airport.

237
11:03.660 --> 11:05.463
And when they arrived in Aruba,

238
11:05.463 --> 11:09.240
they used a biometric that the traveler provided directly

239
11:09.240 --> 11:10.362
to the government of Aruba

240
11:10.362 --> 11:15.362
and cleared the border upon arrival in about eight seconds.

241
11:15.726 --> 11:19.770
That reduced it down significantly from what you do.

242
11:19.770 --> 11:22.624
But the key here is all this is done privacy-by-design.

243
11:22.624 --> 11:26.859
It's the traveler who is holding their information now.

244
11:26.859 --> 11:30.630
We're also moving to a world to bring your own biometrics.

245
11:30.630 --> 11:33.646
So the biometric token, that's so 2024.

246
11:33.646 --> 11:38.640
Bring your own biometrics allows you to have the ability

247
11:38.640 --> 11:42.506
to obtain and verify a person without holding

248
11:42.506 --> 11:45.279
the biometric in a centralized database.

249
11:45.279 --> 11:49.116
This means there are no tokens, no centralized storage,

250
11:49.116 --> 11:53.160
it's shared by consent, and it meets GDPR.

251
11:53.160 --> 11:56.490
So if you don't have the EU digital identity wallet

252
11:56.490 --> 12:00.360
on your bingo card for 2025, 2026,

253
12:00.360 --> 12:03.923
I would add that because that will surprise you.

254
12:03.923 --> 12:07.260
Just like I think for much of us outside the EU

255
12:07.260 --> 12:09.960
on GDPR one day we didn't think about it,

256
12:09.960 --> 12:11.606
and the next day it was everything.

257
12:11.606 --> 12:14.878
Same thing's gonna happen with your digital identity wallet.

258
12:14.878 --> 12:16.501
So you wanna be ready for it.

259
12:16.501 --> 12:19.917
The key here is with the DTC is

260
12:19.917 --> 12:23.596
that it works with any system.

261
12:23.596 --> 12:28.069
That you don't get into locked in proprietary platforms,

262
12:28.069 --> 12:30.840
that you have to stay within that system.

263
12:30.840 --> 12:33.870
There is interoperability through the protocols

264
12:33.870 --> 12:37.501
and specification of a Digital Travel Credential.

265
12:37.501 --> 12:41.006
And I will also say that the Digital Travel Credential is

266
12:41.006 --> 12:45.120
a credential that other industries are deploying now.

267
12:45.120 --> 12:48.242
This is not specific to travel, it grows across finance,

268
12:48.242 --> 12:52.586
education, agriculture are all moving to this DTC.

269
12:52.586 --> 12:55.444
When you think about your travel right now,

270
12:55.444 --> 12:57.510
from the time you book your ticket

271
12:57.510 --> 12:59.400
to the time you sit in your hotel room,

272
12:59.400 --> 13:04.006
you go through more than 11 presentations of identity,

273
13:04.006 --> 13:07.020
or something about yourself.

274
13:07.020 --> 13:08.947
That is exhausting.

275
13:08.947 --> 13:12.630
And the how, if this continues, how do you create

276
13:12.630 --> 13:17.280
that frictionless experience when you don't remove 11 steps?

277
13:17.280 --> 13:20.604
When you depart some countries you are sharing your identity

278
13:20.604 --> 13:22.800
from the time you showed up at the airport

279
13:22.800 --> 13:24.300
to the time you sit in your seat.

280
13:24.300 --> 13:28.410
More than 23 times. This is what the friction is.

281
13:28.410 --> 13:32.160
So until we solve this identity and create systems

282
13:32.160 --> 13:34.710
that are interoperable, we're never going to have

283
13:34.710 --> 13:36.868
that seamless journey that we talk about.

284
13:36.868 --> 13:39.758
And the fact is, is you can't reset a face.

285
13:39.758 --> 13:43.047
And this is what makes biometrics

286
13:43.047 --> 13:46.046
and the reliance on biometric tokens for instance,

287
13:46.046 --> 13:50.126
or the centralized storage of biometrics by enterprises,

288
13:50.126 --> 13:53.199
especially concerning as we move forward.

289
13:53.199 --> 13:57.270
When you read Gartner, you look at court rulings

290
13:57.270 --> 14:00.080
that are coming outta European Union, we're starting to see

291
14:00.080 --> 14:02.970
that biometrics are becoming decentralized.

292
14:02.970 --> 14:06.418
What I mean by that, is you carry your biometrics

293
14:06.418 --> 14:11.010
in your wallet and you share a template in which

294
14:11.010 --> 14:13.112
to verify upon consent.

295
14:13.112 --> 14:17.190
And that's the world we're moving to is that when we travel

296
14:17.190 --> 14:20.421
the seamless journey, when we engage with chatbots,

297
14:20.421 --> 14:25.110
when we use AI, that we're the ones in control providing

298
14:25.110 --> 14:27.360
our information directly with consent.

299
14:27.360 --> 14:29.910
So in a way, companies no longer have

300
14:29.910 --> 14:32.700
to anticipate what we want because they collected data

301
14:32.700 --> 14:34.260
on us over the years.

302
14:34.260 --> 14:36.879
We can tell them how we feel right now.

303
14:36.879 --> 14:38.886
What we need in the moment,

304
14:38.886 --> 14:41.449
and how they can serve us better based

305
14:41.449 --> 14:43.773
on the experience that we're in.

306
14:43.773 --> 14:47.220
And that's ultimately I think all of our goals

307
14:47.220 --> 14:49.388
in travel and hospitality.

308
14:49.388 --> 14:51.386
<v Audience Member>Woo!</v>

309
14:51.386 --> 14:52.219
(audience applauding)

310
14:52.219 --> 14:54.720
<v ->Wow, that's great. That was excellent.</v>

311
14:54.720 --> 14:56.426
Thank you so much.

312
14:56.426 --> 15:00.720
Next up we have Ranjan Goswami, who is at Delta

313
15:00.720 --> 15:05.156
and is the SVP of Customer Experience Design.

314
15:05.156 --> 15:08.166
Ooh, that's a big one. And I'll just take a moment.

315
15:08.166 --> 15:13.060
How many of you attended the Delta keynote the other day?

316
15:13.060 --> 15:14.440
Pretty amazing, right?

317
15:14.440 --> 15:17.915
And I would say if the others that you haven't attended,

318
15:17.915 --> 15:20.460
you should actually go and check it out online

319
15:20.460 --> 15:25.440
because it pretty much, like I told Ranjan, they nailed it.

320
15:25.440 --> 15:27.961
Just everything from talk about experience

321
15:27.961 --> 15:29.721
and then hitting all the key points.

322
15:29.721 --> 15:32.550
So Ranjan, take it away.

323
15:32.550 --> 15:35.490
<v ->Thanks Sherry. Well first thank you all for being here.</v>

324
15:35.490 --> 15:38.790
We're thrilled to celebrate our centennial,

325
15:38.790 --> 15:42.180
our 100 years starting with this kickoff at CES.

326
15:42.180 --> 15:44.970
And if you haven't seen our presentation from the sphere,

327
15:44.970 --> 15:46.224
please do tune in.

328
15:46.224 --> 15:49.470
Dr. K. I'm really happy, I'm relieved actually,

329
15:49.470 --> 15:51.778
as you went through all of your big takeaways,

330
15:51.778 --> 15:55.814
I think we hit on a lot of them for the next 100 years

331
15:55.814 --> 15:57.960
of travel and we couldn't be more excited.

332
15:57.960 --> 16:00.990
Even though we are 100, we are actually invigorated

333
16:00.990 --> 16:02.790
about the innovation that's before us,

334
16:02.790 --> 16:04.960
and everything Heather also discussed.

335
16:04.960 --> 16:06.990
So I actually thought what we would do is

336
16:06.990 --> 16:11.373
just start real quick with a clip from our CES presentation.

337
16:14.030 --> 16:17.697
(narrator speaking faintly)

338
16:36.669 --> 16:38.515
<v Narrator>Tools, and customize your food</v>

339
16:38.515 --> 16:39.348
and beverage experience.

340
16:39.348 --> 16:42.292
Then explore your recommendations from Delta concierge

341
16:42.292 --> 16:44.640
to take the hassle out of planning,

342
16:44.640 --> 16:47.334
and enjoy your destination as soon as you land.

343
16:47.334 --> 16:49.415
When it's almost time to touch down,

344
16:49.415 --> 16:53.095
arrival mode makes the moments after landing, a breeze.

345
16:53.095 --> 16:54.915
Get directions through the airport

346
16:54.915 --> 16:58.189
and make sure your Rideshare is ready when you are.

347
16:58.189 --> 17:03.189
Now, sit back, relax and thank you again for choosing Delta.

348
17:04.800 --> 17:07.789
<v ->So the idea here is how do you create a true experience?</v>

349
17:07.789 --> 17:10.650
Yes, we've gotta get you from point A to point B on time

350
17:10.650 --> 17:12.060
with your bags every single time.

351
17:12.060 --> 17:14.310
We're the most reliable airline to do that,

352
17:14.310 --> 17:17.610
but you can make the experience that much more enriching.

353
17:17.610 --> 17:20.651
And we have customers half a million to 700,000 a day

354
17:20.651 --> 17:22.755
on our airplanes spending at least two

355
17:22.755 --> 17:24.155
and a half hours with us.

356
17:24.155 --> 17:28.350
And what we believe we can do is engage them meaningfully

357
17:28.350 --> 17:32.435
in a hyper-personalized way through our onboard environment.

358
17:32.435 --> 17:34.950
So Delta two years ago came to CES

359
17:34.950 --> 17:37.890
and launched free Wi-Fi to all of our members.

360
17:37.890 --> 17:40.770
We're now at 730 airplanes with free Wi-Fi.

361
17:40.770 --> 17:43.530
And what we essentially did was created two new channels

362
17:43.530 --> 17:45.330
for our customers to interact with us.

363
17:45.330 --> 17:47.475
Live, logged in, member channels.

364
17:47.475 --> 17:49.770
The first of course is through your pad device

365
17:49.770 --> 17:52.380
where you log in and you get to Delta Sync Wi-Fi,

366
17:52.380 --> 17:53.820
which not only gives you the internet,

367
17:53.820 --> 17:57.630
but gives you all these experiences to also take part in

368
17:57.630 --> 17:58.463
because of a member.

369
17:58.463 --> 18:00.700
We just launched that YouTube is gonna join

370
18:02.188 --> 18:04.020
that partnership, bevy of partnerships,

371
18:04.020 --> 18:06.840
where you'll be able to enjoy all of YouTube premium

372
18:06.840 --> 18:09.919
while you're on your flight, no matter where you are,

373
18:09.919 --> 18:13.160
and for 24 hours, so that portability as well.

374
18:13.160 --> 18:15.480
But what you just saw in that video is taking

375
18:15.480 --> 18:16.800
the screens that we have.

376
18:16.800 --> 18:18.870
We have 165,000 screens.

377
18:18.870 --> 18:20.600
More than any airline in the world.

378
18:20.600 --> 18:22.680
And making them smart screens.

379
18:22.680 --> 18:25.560
So Delta Sync seatback allows you to log in as a member to

380
18:25.560 --> 18:28.830
that screen and now that screen with hyper-personalization,

381
18:28.830 --> 18:31.740
and with AI, is gonna help you make the best of all

382
18:31.740 --> 18:34.770
that content, help you plan your arrival mode.

383
18:34.770 --> 18:38.008
So this is really a journey of the aircraft being a platform

384
18:38.008 --> 18:39.520
for digital engagement.

385
18:39.520 --> 18:42.510
It's a journey for us where two new channels join

386
18:42.510 --> 18:46.260
our Fly Delta app, which is the ultimate personalization app

387
18:46.260 --> 18:47.910
and companion for our customers.

388
18:47.910 --> 18:51.780
And ultimately I think the seamlessness between the app,

389
18:51.780 --> 18:53.990
Delta Sync Wi-Fi, Delta seatback,

390
18:53.990 --> 18:57.982
all of these things that, and to your point Dr. K.,

391
18:57.982 --> 19:01.470
we have such an opportunity to learn about our customers.

392
19:01.470 --> 19:03.048
They spend so much time with us.

393
19:03.048 --> 19:05.610
And then you put AI on top of this,

394
19:05.610 --> 19:08.180
and essentially taking friction out of every step,

395
19:08.180 --> 19:11.280
and creating a delighted experience in every step

396
19:11.280 --> 19:12.113
in its place.

397
19:12.113 --> 19:14.463
So super excited to talk more about that today.

398
19:19.350 --> 19:21.630
<v ->Excellent, thank you Ranjan.</v>

399
19:21.630 --> 19:25.380
And now I'd like to introduce Arlie Sisson from Hyatt,

400
19:25.380 --> 19:30.380
and Arlie is the SVP Global Head of Digital and that's big.

401
19:31.847 --> 19:32.874
So Arlie.

402
19:32.874 --> 19:33.707
<v ->(laughing) That's very kind, thank you.</v>

403
19:33.707 --> 19:36.180
So thrilled to be here and Dr. K.

404
19:36.180 --> 19:37.710
and I get to partner on a ton,

405
19:37.710 --> 19:40.590
not only in terms of our education programs at Hyatt,

406
19:40.590 --> 19:43.500
but also we had a recent publication published I think

407
19:43.500 --> 19:45.587
just yesterday on the neurodivergent traveler

408
19:45.587 --> 19:47.070
and their experiences.

409
19:47.070 --> 19:48.810
So I'm so thrilled to be here.

410
19:48.810 --> 19:50.580
And I would say the innovation that the two

411
19:50.580 --> 19:52.680
of you lead are inspirations to myself

412
19:52.680 --> 19:53.790
and team every single day.

413
19:53.790 --> 19:55.516
So thank you also for sharing that.

414
19:55.516 --> 19:59.340
We have a quick video and I'm gonna start with that.

415
19:59.340 --> 20:02.318
I think it very eloquently illustrates not only

416
20:02.318 --> 20:05.113
the antithesis of what we want, you know,

417
20:05.113 --> 20:08.440
everyone to think about in terms of as you move forward

418
20:08.440 --> 20:11.486
in travel, but also I would say the excitement,

419
20:11.486 --> 20:13.830
the care that we want to bring to our guests.

420
20:13.830 --> 20:16.410
Because as my panelists also just described,

421
20:16.410 --> 20:18.514
there is absolutely a ton that you could do.

422
20:18.514 --> 20:19.980
But what should you do?

423
20:19.980 --> 20:21.870
And I think that the video I'll show you here

424
20:21.870 --> 20:25.293
is very illustrative of what we are trying to accomplish.

425
20:29.163 --> 20:32.330
(bright upbeat music)

426
20:59.774 --> 21:03.774
(bright upbeat music continues)

427
21:28.080 --> 21:31.230
I love that video 'cause I think it clearly illustrates

428
21:31.230 --> 21:33.835
a lot of what Dr. K. had as well in his opening slide.

429
21:33.835 --> 21:36.780
So can we personalize things? Absolutely.

430
21:36.780 --> 21:37.860
How are we gonna start doing that?

431
21:37.860 --> 21:39.210
And we'll get into that in a few questions

432
21:39.210 --> 21:40.950
I know we have prepped and so I'll save that.

433
21:40.950 --> 21:43.793
But I think it's also about what do travelers want?

434
21:43.793 --> 21:45.750
And what do they want from certain companies

435
21:45.750 --> 21:46.620
at certain points?

436
21:46.620 --> 21:48.780
And we take that in a very valuable,

437
21:48.780 --> 21:50.790
I would say, deep perspective way at Hyatt.

438
21:50.790 --> 21:53.130
We make sure that care being the center of everything

439
21:53.130 --> 21:54.060
that we do.

440
21:54.060 --> 21:56.334
We do that in a way that feels comfortable, trusted,

441
21:56.334 --> 21:59.700
because we have point A to point B,

442
21:59.700 --> 22:01.830
but we are also where people stay, right?

443
22:01.830 --> 22:02.940
When they're in these places.

444
22:02.940 --> 22:04.620
And so we take that very seriously,

445
22:04.620 --> 22:05.761
both from a security perspective,

446
22:05.761 --> 22:08.520
but also from the experiences that we build.

447
22:08.520 --> 22:10.740
And frictionless to us just doesn't mean being able

448
22:10.740 --> 22:11.573
to book a room.

449
22:11.573 --> 22:12.990
It means the entire journey.

450
22:12.990 --> 22:15.600
And so what you're seeing there is even outside of,

451
22:15.600 --> 22:17.620
we call it day to day instead of stay to stay,

452
22:17.620 --> 22:20.310
and how are we making sure that we're prevalent

453
22:20.310 --> 22:21.630
in people's lives where they want us

454
22:21.630 --> 22:23.505
and we're also enriching exciting experiences

455
22:23.505 --> 22:24.873
to them along the way.

456
22:28.650 --> 22:31.050
<v ->Great. Well where do we start?</v>

457
22:31.050 --> 22:31.994
There's lots of questions.

458
22:31.994 --> 22:36.030
I think the biggest one that I have is security.

459
22:36.030 --> 22:38.513
Like I have, there's so much data about me out there.

460
22:38.513 --> 22:42.450
I can never remember what was my password? Where's this?

461
22:42.450 --> 22:43.735
I have to go and look it up.

462
22:43.735 --> 22:46.440
How is everyone feeling about security?

463
22:46.440 --> 22:50.490
You know, it's, yeah, I'll just stop there.

464
22:50.490 --> 22:52.595
How's everyone feeling about like cybersecurity,

465
22:52.595 --> 22:55.563
and where is my data, and where's it going?

466
22:56.670 --> 22:59.880
<v ->I can just say that we call this in our research</v>

467
22:59.880 --> 23:03.660
as paradoxical Ps, personalization, and privacy.

468
23:03.660 --> 23:05.911
And this has been discussed a lot.

469
23:05.911 --> 23:08.610
And then that's why if you look at it,

470
23:08.610 --> 23:11.280
many of the universities are actually opening a Master's

471
23:11.280 --> 23:12.450
in cybersecurity.

472
23:12.450 --> 23:15.450
Cybersecurity is one of the highest growing career track.

473
23:15.450 --> 23:17.514
I tell my students to consider that as well.

474
23:17.514 --> 23:20.490
And there's a huge difference.

475
23:20.490 --> 23:24.260
I mean our generation versus my students' generation.

476
23:24.260 --> 23:27.300
They actually don't care about their data.

477
23:27.300 --> 23:29.730
Their data is already everywhere with TikTok

478
23:29.730 --> 23:30.960
and everything as well.

479
23:30.960 --> 23:33.840
They trust. And I think the trust is the key here.

480
23:33.840 --> 23:36.510
Trust breeds transparency, we always say.

481
23:36.510 --> 23:38.580
And I think as long as the brands like Hyatt

482
23:38.580 --> 23:41.370
and Delta are actually creating

483
23:41.370 --> 23:43.380
that trust and that's gonna actually,

484
23:43.380 --> 23:45.090
that paradoxical P is gonna disappear

485
23:45.090 --> 23:47.970
and definitely with the digital identity coming in.

486
23:47.970 --> 23:50.850
And that's gonna actually take care of this as well.

487
23:50.850 --> 23:51.683
<v ->No, I like that.</v>

488
23:51.683 --> 23:53.340
I actually do think brands

489
23:53.340 --> 23:55.260
and trust are gonna become even more important.

490
23:55.260 --> 23:56.550
So we can park that.

491
23:56.550 --> 23:59.250
But actually Heather, what's your thought on security?

492
23:59.250 --> 24:02.760
<v ->The world of hoarding data is coming to an end.</v>

493
24:02.760 --> 24:05.460
Think of it as you're going to Marie Kondo here.

494
24:05.460 --> 24:08.710
You do not need to take the data that you used to

495
24:08.710 --> 24:11.940
from your customers because your customers are going

496
24:11.940 --> 24:13.920
to be carrying their own data.

497
24:13.920 --> 24:18.478
And what that does is reduces your security risk.

498
24:18.478 --> 24:21.340
Why are you sitting on all the data you don't need

499
24:21.340 --> 24:24.540
on a regular basis and creating yourself as a target,

500
24:24.540 --> 24:25.650
as an organization?

501
24:25.650 --> 24:27.750
You don't need to do that anymore.

502
24:27.750 --> 24:29.880
You're going to have the ability

503
24:29.880 --> 24:33.780
with a verifiable credential or a Digital Travel Credential

504
24:33.780 --> 24:35.520
to use selective disclosure,

505
24:35.520 --> 24:39.420
and only take the information you need

506
24:39.420 --> 24:42.520
to make a business decision about your guest.

507
24:42.520 --> 24:47.130
SITA is leading the effort in the travel

508
24:47.130 --> 24:50.614
and hospitality space around a Digital Travel Credential

509
24:50.614 --> 24:53.098
in creating specifications

510
24:53.098 --> 24:56.070
in which everyone can participate.

511
24:56.070 --> 24:58.950
In fact, they recently signed a collaboration agreement

512
24:58.950 --> 25:03.330
with IDEMIA talking about how technically you can do this.

513
25:03.330 --> 25:06.054
But ultimately security that we're doing now,

514
25:06.054 --> 25:09.695
it doesn't work, it's not protecting people.

515
25:09.695 --> 25:13.600
Younger people are also traveling with paper.

516
25:13.600 --> 25:15.600
Well they're not traveling with paper

517
25:15.600 --> 25:18.870
because they end up in places without their paper passport

518
25:18.870 --> 25:21.780
asking, "Can't you just have my mom send it to you?"

519
25:21.780 --> 25:26.040
We have an entire generation that does not understand why

520
25:26.040 --> 25:30.090
for trust in travel you need a plastic card

521
25:30.090 --> 25:31.120
or a piece of paper.

522
25:31.120 --> 25:34.558
So how do we create the security and trust

523
25:34.558 --> 25:39.120
in a digital mechanism that these new generations

524
25:39.120 --> 25:42.973
that are coming into experience can take with them?

525
25:42.973 --> 25:47.073
And that's what organizations like CDA, or IDEMIA,

526
25:47.073 --> 25:50.112
or those that have moved to the Digital Travel Credential,

527
25:50.112 --> 25:53.271
and are collaborating with Delta and hotels

528
25:53.271 --> 25:56.370
to bring those online because ultimately

529
25:56.370 --> 26:00.663
it delivers far more security than what we experience today.

530
26:01.500 --> 26:02.340
<v ->Great. Thank you Heather.</v>

531
26:02.340 --> 26:03.173
Ranjan?

532
26:04.075 --> 26:04.908
<v ->You know, I think a couple of things.</v>

533
26:04.908 --> 26:08.460
First, giving customers the choice to opt in is fundamental.

534
26:08.460 --> 26:11.220
And everything that we do really focuses on that.

535
26:11.220 --> 26:13.551
Let the customer choose how much they want you

536
26:13.551 --> 26:16.640
to know about them and how much they want you to use that.

537
26:16.640 --> 26:18.630
The second thing that's really interesting though,

538
26:18.630 --> 26:20.520
especially with Gen Z and Gen Y,

539
26:20.520 --> 26:24.150
is there's an orientation to expect personalization.

540
26:24.150 --> 26:26.430
And what that means, therefore is you need to use data

541
26:26.430 --> 26:28.940
to create relevant experiences for them.

542
26:28.940 --> 26:33.330
But that interest is in the almost 90%.

543
26:33.330 --> 26:37.530
So how do we meet that expectation while still being secure?

544
26:37.530 --> 26:39.750
And then I'm gonna mirror what Heather is saying.

545
26:39.750 --> 26:41.760
You know, when we launched digital ID here

546
26:41.760 --> 26:43.620
in the United States, we were the first airline

547
26:43.620 --> 26:45.000
to launch it with the TSA.

548
26:45.000 --> 26:48.540
Notice that we're not storing the pictures.

549
26:48.540 --> 26:50.820
The way digital ID works is you have to show an ID,

550
26:50.820 --> 26:53.130
you just use your face to go through TSA.

551
26:53.130 --> 26:55.350
And because you have a passport number on file

552
26:55.350 --> 26:58.170
with your Delta SkyMiles profile, we're able to run

553
26:58.170 --> 27:01.691
that passport as your ID against the CBP database,

554
27:01.691 --> 27:04.530
and see if there's a match between the photo we take of you

555
27:04.530 --> 27:06.210
and the photo on your passport.

556
27:06.210 --> 27:08.040
We don't store that photo, right?

557
27:08.040 --> 27:11.460
But we're enabling a more seamless experience for you.

558
27:11.460 --> 27:13.650
So how you design the process

559
27:13.650 --> 27:16.620
and the product without having to capture the data

560
27:16.620 --> 27:18.876
but run it up against other existing data sources.

561
27:18.876 --> 27:20.520
That's another piece of it.

562
27:20.520 --> 27:24.030
So I think the key for us is customer choice, opting in,

563
27:24.030 --> 27:26.040
and designing experiences that are relevant,

564
27:26.040 --> 27:27.630
and then designing them in a way

565
27:27.630 --> 27:29.620
that doesn't hoard the information.

566
27:29.620 --> 27:31.260
<v Sherry>Wow, that's great.</v>

567
27:31.260 --> 27:33.630
<v ->The only thing I'd add, 'cause I absolutely agree,</v>

568
27:33.630 --> 27:35.370
is the data stewardship behind all of this

569
27:35.370 --> 27:36.810
and only taking what you need.

570
27:36.810 --> 27:38.497
I think in the beginning it was a lot of like,

571
27:38.497 --> 27:40.080
"Just take it all because why not?"

572
27:40.080 --> 27:40.913
And I don't think that

573
27:40.913 --> 27:43.110
that's brands' approaches anymore, right?

574
27:43.110 --> 27:45.540
One, there's too much risk associated with storing

575
27:45.540 --> 27:47.450
that kind of data in that mass.

576
27:47.450 --> 27:49.950
And then you're, as we were just discussing,

577
27:49.950 --> 27:51.450
that's your job now to protect it.

578
27:51.450 --> 27:54.210
So truly focusing in on the aspects and the assets

579
27:54.210 --> 27:55.650
that you need within that is absolutely.

580
27:55.650 --> 27:57.990
I think we're, you'll see not just obviously Hyatt hotels,

581
27:57.990 --> 27:59.250
but all brands pushing,

582
27:59.250 --> 28:00.570
because that's just the more efficient way

583
28:00.570 --> 28:02.673
to also just enact business day to day.

584
28:03.900 --> 28:05.460
<v ->Great. Thank you.</v>

585
28:05.460 --> 28:07.950
So when tech works, it's great, right?

586
28:07.950 --> 28:08.783
I think we all agree on that.

587
28:08.783 --> 28:11.540
And when it doesn't work, hmm, not so great.

588
28:11.540 --> 28:15.166
I have to say, my experience traveling here,

589
28:15.166 --> 28:18.780
I didn't talk to one person at the hotel.

590
28:18.780 --> 28:22.830
I downloaded the app, I went in, I went to a kiosk,

591
28:22.830 --> 28:26.430
I put in my room number, thought for sure made a key.

592
28:26.430 --> 28:28.500
Thought, "For sure this isn't gonna work, right?" You know?

593
28:28.500 --> 28:30.817
Hmm. Traveling up there, it worked,

594
28:30.817 --> 28:35.216
Got a note, "Ready to check out Sherry?" Boom, same thing.

595
28:35.216 --> 28:37.380
I didn't have any human interaction,

596
28:37.380 --> 28:39.505
and I'm not sure what I felt about that.

597
28:39.505 --> 28:42.364
So I'm curious what everyone thinks about that

598
28:42.364 --> 28:45.705
because I think that's gonna be one of the key things

599
28:45.705 --> 28:48.059
that we need to consider for the future.

600
28:48.059 --> 28:50.640
<v ->But as Ranjan said, that's optional, right?</v>

601
28:50.640 --> 28:53.176
So you chose to not to talk to people.

602
28:53.176 --> 28:56.278
So we are always talking about human touch and technology.

603
28:56.278 --> 29:00.723
So as long as the companies can actually give that choice.

604
29:00.723 --> 29:02.392
And then again, new generation,

605
29:02.392 --> 29:05.100
after 10 hour flights, 16 hour flights

606
29:05.100 --> 29:07.295
and they might not wanna talk to the receptionist

607
29:07.295 --> 29:10.740
or even wait in line 10 minutes, 15 minutes.

608
29:10.740 --> 29:12.186
So I do the same thing.

609
29:12.186 --> 29:15.630
And you can actually order your quiet car in Uber or Lyft.

610
29:15.630 --> 29:17.370
And that's just really the choice.

611
29:17.370 --> 29:20.130
And I think they should, you have a choice,

612
29:20.130 --> 29:22.170
you had a choice, you can just wait in line,

613
29:22.170 --> 29:24.736
and talk to the receptionist, and then do that.

614
29:24.736 --> 29:26.298
So I think that's the key is

615
29:26.298 --> 29:29.580
the supplier should actually give that choice.

616
29:29.580 --> 29:33.660
Do you want have that frictionless, no human touch?

617
29:33.660 --> 29:35.610
You can still talk to them if you like,

618
29:35.610 --> 29:37.290
but I think that's just really the case.

619
29:37.290 --> 29:38.250
<v ->Right, no, that's fair.</v>

620
29:38.250 --> 29:39.960
And actually I could have stood in line,

621
29:39.960 --> 29:41.985
and I actually, I like technology so I wanted

622
29:41.985 --> 29:44.432
to see if it would work, but fair enough.

623
29:44.432 --> 29:45.480
Heather?

624
29:45.480 --> 29:47.640
<v ->And we're moving into a world where you</v>

625
29:47.640 --> 29:51.032
have peer-to-peer connections that can stay persistent

626
29:51.032 --> 29:54.570
after you leave and continue that relationship.

627
29:54.570 --> 29:57.390
So if anything, you're moving into a world

628
29:57.390 --> 29:59.879
of stronger digital relationships based

629
29:59.879 --> 30:03.210
on actual information that you've provided, consent.

630
30:03.210 --> 30:06.750
But in your experience, why are you traveling?

631
30:06.750 --> 30:09.240
It's probably not to talk with a check-in.

632
30:09.240 --> 30:12.330
It's probably not to spend time trying to get a room key.

633
30:12.330 --> 30:14.812
You're traveling for the experience of the hotel,

634
30:14.812 --> 30:19.423
to engage with the restaurant, or the spa, or the excursion.

635
30:19.423 --> 30:23.681
And what you just described actually gave you more time

636
30:23.681 --> 30:27.990
to do and engage with the people you want to engage with,

637
30:27.990 --> 30:29.640
and the reason why you're traveling

638
30:29.640 --> 30:30.570
and spending money.
<v Sherry>Fair enough.</v>

639
30:30.570 --> 30:32.962
So if anything, you got a higher value

640
30:32.962 --> 30:35.040
when you depart the property

641
30:35.040 --> 30:37.110
because you're spent that extra 10

642
30:37.110 --> 30:40.950
to 1 hour doing what you wanna do.

643
30:40.950 --> 30:42.110
<v Sherry>That's right. That's right.</v>

644
30:42.110 --> 30:43.410
<v Ranjan>You know, we're in the business</v>

645
30:43.410 --> 30:45.030
of bringing people together physically.

646
30:45.030 --> 30:47.400
We've brought billions of people together for 100 years.

647
30:47.400 --> 30:49.950
So we believe living life in person

648
30:49.950 --> 30:52.610
with human connection is fundamental, truly.

649
30:52.610 --> 30:54.923
The second thing that's really interesting, I think Arlie,

650
30:54.923 --> 30:58.590
you and I probably share this, is the number two thing

651
30:58.590 --> 31:00.960
besides fundamental on time that people,

652
31:00.960 --> 31:04.244
our customers care about, is actually the connection

653
31:04.244 --> 31:07.744
with our people, our Delta people and the customer.

654
31:07.744 --> 31:10.250
No customer wants to feel like a number.

655
31:10.250 --> 31:13.200
And when we carry half a million to 700,000 people a day,

656
31:13.200 --> 31:16.107
there is a high risk of people feeling like a number, right?

657
31:16.107 --> 31:19.225
And so where we find personalization to be so powerful is

658
31:19.225 --> 31:22.241
when a flight attendant can seek out a customer,

659
31:22.241 --> 31:24.329
and celebrate their Million Miler status,

660
31:24.329 --> 31:26.760
or thank them for their business,

661
31:26.760 --> 31:28.650
or acknowledge a service failure, right?

662
31:28.650 --> 31:31.530
These are really important human connections that again,

663
31:31.530 --> 31:33.840
the data and personalization enable.

664
31:33.840 --> 31:36.210
So I think there's a, there's two things here.

665
31:36.210 --> 31:39.110
Sure you have the choice to avoid that interaction,

666
31:39.110 --> 31:40.990
but when that interaction happens,

667
31:40.990 --> 31:44.650
your people need to know about that customer, their context,

668
31:44.650 --> 31:47.280
and meet them where they are with the right set

669
31:47.280 --> 31:48.900
of empathy and engagement.

670
31:48.900 --> 31:50.970
'Cause that's what people will talk about

671
31:50.970 --> 31:52.327
when they get through their trip.

672
31:52.327 --> 31:53.700
"I had this incredible experience

673
31:53.700 --> 31:54.533
with this flight attendant.

674
31:54.533 --> 31:56.250
She or he did X, Y, Z for me.

675
31:56.250 --> 31:58.440
They knew me, they understood what I wanted."

676
31:58.440 --> 32:00.070
And so how do we balance that while

677
32:00.070 --> 32:02.460
of course giving customers back time,

678
32:02.460 --> 32:06.360
and making things more frictionless and travel free.

679
32:06.360 --> 32:08.705
<v ->I started at the front desk, that was my first like</v>

680
32:08.705 --> 32:11.706
I would say, exposure to the hospitality team.

681
32:11.706 --> 32:14.984
And so I started on property and I would say even the joy

682
32:14.984 --> 32:17.370
that I feel now doing my job, empowering,

683
32:17.370 --> 32:19.470
and building tools for our colleagues on property comes

684
32:19.470 --> 32:20.700
from that experience of mine

685
32:20.700 --> 32:22.080
and being able to engage with guests.

686
32:22.080 --> 32:24.420
And you will remember someone's name at the restaurant.

687
32:24.420 --> 32:25.560
You'll remember your server's name.

688
32:25.560 --> 32:27.660
You'll remember Jessica who checked me in

689
32:27.660 --> 32:29.370
at the front desk yesterday at the Venetian.

690
32:29.370 --> 32:31.650
So you remember these people, in places, in time.

691
32:31.650 --> 32:33.990
I think having the optionality to do things

692
32:33.990 --> 32:34.860
in a more expedited way?

693
32:34.860 --> 32:35.693
Absolutely.

694
32:35.693 --> 32:36.840
And actually our research shows

695
32:36.840 --> 32:37.980
that we've conducted ourselves

696
32:37.980 --> 32:40.110
that pre-COVID up, and up, and up.

697
32:40.110 --> 32:40.980
No one wanted to see anyone.

698
32:40.980 --> 32:43.140
We wanted to go, we wanna do, you know, seamless check-in.

699
32:43.140 --> 32:44.070
We wanna go right to our room.

700
32:44.070 --> 32:45.570
We wanted to have our mobile keys.

701
32:45.570 --> 32:48.590
Post-COVID, a huge resurgence of wanting to speak

702
32:48.590 --> 32:50.520
to someone, wanting to ask questions,

703
32:50.520 --> 32:53.280
wanting to get insights about the locale

704
32:53.280 --> 32:54.113
that you're visiting.

705
32:54.113 --> 32:56.280
And so the pendulum I think will continue to switch.

706
32:56.280 --> 32:57.810
So as long as you have that optionality,

707
32:57.810 --> 32:59.160
and you're building products again

708
32:59.160 --> 33:00.330
that is frictionless for those

709
33:00.330 --> 33:01.510
and what they want to do in the moment,

710
33:01.510 --> 33:03.090
your brand will be winning.

711
33:03.090 --> 33:05.970
I think removing all person from that

712
33:05.970 --> 33:08.820
I think will never be the true answer.

713
33:08.820 --> 33:10.230
And I think that that's where care

714
33:10.230 --> 33:12.030
and empathy absolutely merges in.

715
33:12.030 --> 33:13.640
Because whether it's a service recovery

716
33:13.640 --> 33:15.390
or a special moment that you can help make,

717
33:15.390 --> 33:16.965
or you learn something as a colleague to make

718
33:16.965 --> 33:18.620
that event even more special,

719
33:18.620 --> 33:21.483
that's really what we're here to do and make happen.

720
33:23.100 --> 33:23.933
<v ->Oh great.</v>

721
33:23.933 --> 33:26.940
I think I shared this with a couple of folks on the panel,

722
33:26.940 --> 33:28.661
but I've been traveling for over 30 years

723
33:28.661 --> 33:29.970
in the event space.

724
33:29.970 --> 33:32.668
And obviously again, we all traveled to get here.

725
33:32.668 --> 33:37.380
Pre-9/11, and again, we were doing a big tour,

726
33:37.380 --> 33:40.270
an Oracle world tour, 25 cities, 26 weeks.

727
33:40.270 --> 33:44.290
We would get to the airport 25 minutes before our flight

728
33:44.290 --> 33:48.570
and the reservationist would say, "Can I see your ID?"

729
33:48.570 --> 33:49.403
Pull it out.

730
33:49.403 --> 33:50.437
"Did you pack your bag?" "Yes."

731
33:50.437 --> 33:51.700
"Did anyone give you anything?" "No."

732
33:51.700 --> 33:53.640
Boom. Right?

733
33:53.640 --> 33:56.164
I mean, look how things have changed in 25 years.

734
33:56.164 --> 34:00.710
I can't imagine the future and I'm so happy.

735
34:00.710 --> 34:04.410
And actually even in the Delta keynote,

736
34:04.410 --> 34:06.041
there are a few things.

737
34:06.041 --> 34:07.980
I like the augmented reality way finding.

738
34:07.980 --> 34:09.907
'Cause again, the worst thing is you get off a plane,

739
34:09.907 --> 34:11.610
"Wait, where am I going? I'm tired."

740
34:11.610 --> 34:16.130
But man, that would be killer even here at CES.

741
34:16.130 --> 34:19.650
And then what I loved the most was the predictions

742
34:19.650 --> 34:23.310
about the future and actually a panel that with children,

743
34:23.310 --> 34:26.104
what children envision.

744
34:26.104 --> 34:29.550
Things like ROBLOX or wings that, you know,

745
34:29.550 --> 34:33.821
wings that expand or contract or sustainable materials.

746
34:33.821 --> 34:37.890
So maybe everyone could give a little bit of like,

747
34:37.890 --> 34:40.590
what do you think is gonna happen, or what are your?

748
34:40.590 --> 34:42.150
I mean, I'm completely optimistic

749
34:42.150 --> 34:43.201
about the future of travel.

750
34:43.201 --> 34:45.145
I think that we're on the right direction.

751
34:45.145 --> 34:47.147
I love everything that you're all doing.

752
34:47.147 --> 34:50.105
I love the students that we're really getting them involved

753
34:50.105 --> 34:54.948
in the future and in, and by 2030, you know,

754
34:54.948 --> 34:57.890
70% of the workforce is gonna be millennials and Gen Zs.

755
34:57.890 --> 35:00.821
They're gonna have a big say on all of this.

756
35:00.821 --> 35:02.880
So maybe the last few minutes

757
35:02.880 --> 35:04.440
we could maybe like predictions

758
35:04.440 --> 35:07.230
or things that you'd like to share that you haven't shared.

759
35:07.230 --> 35:09.270
And I don't know if we can open it up for,

760
35:09.270 --> 35:11.424
if anyone has questions too, feel free to jump in.

761
35:11.424 --> 35:14.463
But maybe we could use the last few minutes for that.

762
35:15.300 --> 35:17.130
<v ->I think my prediction is not even prediction,</v>

763
35:17.130 --> 35:18.240
it's reality now.

764
35:18.240 --> 35:21.207
In the future, even now, AI is gonna be part of our lives.

765
35:21.207 --> 35:22.650
Whether you like it or not.

766
35:22.650 --> 35:26.010
So AI is the key big part of our lives.

767
35:26.010 --> 35:30.708
And then it just, my only fear is right now wild, wild west

768
35:30.708 --> 35:34.830
who's going to basically regulate AI?

769
35:34.830 --> 35:36.630
Right now, people talk about AI

770
35:36.630 --> 35:38.513
as we've talked about internet in 1990s, right?

771
35:38.513 --> 35:42.759
It's exactly the same that the regulation of AI is

772
35:42.759 --> 35:44.010
that where I'm actually kind

773
35:44.010 --> 35:47.997
of curious what's gonna happen on that.

774
35:47.997 --> 35:52.080
EU is far ahead of America and Asia in this case.

775
35:52.080 --> 35:54.770
So I'm looking forward for governmental involvement

776
35:54.770 --> 35:56.940
in terms of regulating AI.

777
35:56.940 --> 36:01.134
But AI is there, is going to be a big part of our lives.

778
36:01.134 --> 36:03.127
<v ->Yeah, fair enough.</v>

779
36:03.990 --> 36:07.312
<v ->That you're moving into the center of your travel journey.</v>

780
36:07.312 --> 36:11.130
That you are the one that are gonna be in a position

781
36:11.130 --> 36:14.409
to provide information and your preferences.

782
36:14.409 --> 36:16.083
And so frictionless travel,

783
36:16.083 --> 36:18.835
you are going to be the center of that.

784
36:18.835 --> 36:21.630
And there's tremendous collaboration

785
36:21.630 --> 36:23.716
across the industry, across technology,

786
36:23.716 --> 36:28.070
airlines, hotels, even global regulations,

787
36:28.070 --> 36:31.383
and especially in the technology world

788
36:31.383 --> 36:33.725
to really bring this together.

789
36:33.725 --> 36:36.860
So as we're moving into this world of AI,

790
36:36.860 --> 36:40.736
the AI is powered by you and the information that you want

791
36:40.736 --> 36:43.053
to share about yourself.

792
36:43.890 --> 36:46.065
<v ->Oh, well I'm gonna say I love your BYOB,</v>

793
36:46.065 --> 36:48.300
so bring your own biometrics.

794
36:48.300 --> 36:49.306
<v ->Bring your own biometric.</v>

795
36:49.306 --> 36:51.210
<v ->I think that's something we should mandate</v>

796
36:51.210 --> 36:52.542
for going forward.

797
36:52.542 --> 36:54.240
<v ->You know, I think we all agree on this panel</v>

798
36:54.240 --> 36:55.380
that travel is a gift.

799
36:55.380 --> 36:56.880
Every time you travel, you learn,

800
36:56.880 --> 36:58.654
you experience the world, it's fantastic.

801
36:58.654 --> 37:01.157
Travel can also be stressful.

802
37:01.157 --> 37:03.210
If you think about planning your trip

803
37:03.210 --> 37:05.160
and coordinating all the things you need to coordinate.

804
37:05.160 --> 37:06.737
If you think about showing up at an airport you don't know

805
37:06.737 --> 37:08.250
and navigating through it.

806
37:08.250 --> 37:12.360
How to navigate the whole process can be stressful.

807
37:12.360 --> 37:14.760
And I think in the future it that stress,

808
37:14.760 --> 37:16.890
if we do our jobs properly, will go away.

809
37:16.890 --> 37:20.160
And people will be delighted at every single stage.

810
37:20.160 --> 37:23.287
So imagine having a conversation with the Delta concierge

811
37:23.287 --> 37:24.841
about the trip you wanna have.

812
37:24.841 --> 37:26.580
And you're not having to go and search

813
37:26.580 --> 37:28.050
in five different Google searches

814
37:28.050 --> 37:29.190
and take all these notes down,

815
37:29.190 --> 37:30.914
and figure out how to do all these multiple bookings.

816
37:30.914 --> 37:32.640
But you're having that conversation

817
37:32.640 --> 37:34.773
and that becomes a seamless thing.

818
37:34.773 --> 37:36.060
Then you get to the airport

819
37:36.060 --> 37:38.760
and someone is helping you navigate through

820
37:38.760 --> 37:40.830
at the right time, everything you need to know,

821
37:40.830 --> 37:42.900
and offering you opportunities along the way.

822
37:42.900 --> 37:44.520
And then you get onboard the airplane,

823
37:44.520 --> 37:46.258
and you've got thousands of hours of content,

824
37:46.258 --> 37:49.080
and they help you, based on your interest, to utilize

825
37:49.080 --> 37:50.730
that time in the best way that you want in

826
37:50.730 --> 37:51.840
that connected environment.

827
37:51.840 --> 37:54.810
And then they help you on the journey on the ground, right?

828
37:54.810 --> 37:58.470
We showed yesterday this cool notion of Uber, Joby

829
37:58.470 --> 37:59.790
and Delta working.

830
37:59.790 --> 38:02.640
So imagine doing an address to address search

831
38:02.640 --> 38:04.140
on Delta.com, right?

832
38:04.140 --> 38:06.676
I think that's the future is taking all the stress out,

833
38:06.676 --> 38:10.650
making what is an amazing experience, delightful as you go

834
38:10.650 --> 38:13.410
through the entire journey from inspiration of your trip

835
38:13.410 --> 38:15.762
all the way to the execution of getting to that destination.

836
38:15.762 --> 38:17.310
<v ->Yeah, and the only layer I'll say</v>

837
38:17.310 --> 38:19.110
is like adding personalization throughout that.

838
38:19.110 --> 38:20.130
So as an experiential,

839
38:20.130 --> 38:21.810
are you in different modes while you travel?

840
38:21.810 --> 38:24.150
I travel with three children under six often

841
38:24.150 --> 38:25.830
when I'm not traveling by myself.

842
38:25.830 --> 38:27.750
And that is a very different mode for me, right?

843
38:27.750 --> 38:29.400
Very different shoes, very different mindset.

844
38:29.400 --> 38:32.130
So I think in that sense, that's where you'll start to see

845
38:32.130 --> 38:34.110
as well, the layers of what you need

846
38:34.110 --> 38:35.730
to accomplish in that moment.

847
38:35.730 --> 38:37.110
And so for me on this trip,

848
38:37.110 --> 38:40.470
it's get to the hotel seamlessly, quickly.

849
38:40.470 --> 38:41.910
Have different things along the way.

850
38:41.910 --> 38:44.910
Be able to bypass with the most time possible

851
38:44.910 --> 38:46.150
and get into the work mode.

852
38:46.150 --> 38:48.540
In different modes, it's completely different.

853
38:48.540 --> 38:50.310
And I think whether that starts with an offer,

854
38:50.310 --> 38:51.840
whether that starts with the correct destination

855
38:51.840 --> 38:54.030
of where you're staying, whether that states exactly

856
38:54.030 --> 38:56.150
what seating arrangement you need while going through this.

857
38:56.150 --> 38:59.400
All of that together allows us to be more proactive

858
38:59.400 --> 39:01.046
and put these experiences in front of our guests

859
39:01.046 --> 39:03.510
to have a better experience along the way,

860
39:03.510 --> 39:05.853
and achieve that delightful intent.

861
39:07.590 --> 39:09.960
<v ->Excellent. Well we have about a minute left.</v>

862
39:09.960 --> 39:11.640
Any quick questions, comment?

863
39:11.640 --> 39:12.950
Yes.

864
39:12.950 --> 39:15.270
<v Chase>My name is Chase</v>

865
39:15.270 --> 39:16.740
and nice to hear your presentation.

866
39:16.740 --> 39:18.150
I think one of the partnerships I saw

867
39:18.150 --> 39:20.150
that was missing at the Delta 100 was

868
39:20.150 --> 39:22.250
if there could be a partnership with Delta Hyatt.

869
39:22.250 --> 39:24.664
I know there's already a Delta hotel somewhere,

870
39:24.664 --> 39:28.970
but I see that when event activations are being done,

871
39:28.970 --> 39:31.980
technology can go a longer way that from the time

872
39:31.980 --> 39:34.182
I'm stopping at the airport to checking into a hotel,

873
39:34.182 --> 39:36.023
I should be able to have a brief

874
39:36.023 --> 39:38.359
of what is happening at an event.

875
39:38.359 --> 39:41.885
If I need to order some grocery. Like CES is overwhelming.

876
39:41.885 --> 39:44.700
And I would like to see, like from next year,

877
39:44.700 --> 39:47.700
travel companies can also start working with event partners

878
39:47.700 --> 39:50.563
to say, "Okay, how do we make this easy for delegates

879
39:50.563 --> 39:53.400
who are coming out of the country to be able to be aware

880
39:53.400 --> 39:56.220
of what is on ground and how we can support them?"

881
39:56.220 --> 39:57.053
Thank you.

882
39:57.053 --> 39:57.886
<v ->Excellent.</v>

883
39:59.430 --> 40:01.500
Well, what I'm gonna say is you've got

884
40:01.500 --> 40:03.960
the best panel up here and these folks

885
40:03.960 --> 40:07.380
have been spending every day leading and innovating.

886
40:07.380 --> 40:10.282
And so I'm sure that they'll take your your words to heart.

887
40:10.282 --> 40:11.310
Yes?

888
40:11.310 --> 40:12.840
<v ->[Audience Member 2] Yeah, I'm just curious about,</v>

889
40:12.840 --> 40:14.580
you know, the whole idea that the digital nomad,

890
40:14.580 --> 40:16.440
the person who's traveling all the time.

891
40:16.440 --> 40:18.090
Do you see a rise in that percentage

892
40:18.090 --> 40:20.457
or just trying to make it very just bleisure,

893
40:20.457 --> 40:23.280
but just not living anywhere, living in hotels?

894
40:23.280 --> 40:24.800
Do you see that at all?

895
40:24.800 --> 40:26.580
<v ->We do and we have specific programs.</v>

896
40:26.580 --> 40:28.800
I think Dr. K. actually mentioned one,

897
40:28.800 --> 40:32.610
which is called "Together by Hyatt" or "Work from Hyatt."

898
40:32.610 --> 40:33.840
And so we did have a lot of that.

899
40:33.840 --> 40:36.446
I would say the continuation of that program still

900
40:36.446 --> 40:38.790
in existence today and seeing great responses,

901
40:38.790 --> 40:41.970
which is, "I want to be able to go to The Bahamas,

902
40:41.970 --> 40:43.980
I'm going to work online for a week,

903
40:43.980 --> 40:45.000
and I need a different mode."

904
40:45.000 --> 40:47.340
Like I was mentioning before, to be able to accomplish that.

905
40:47.340 --> 40:49.560
And then I will have two weeks of vacation post that,

906
40:49.560 --> 40:51.510
and that'll all be within the same contained environment.

907
40:51.510 --> 40:52.650
So absolutely.

908
40:52.650 --> 40:54.240
And I think the programs around

909
40:54.240 --> 40:56.520
that was a direct reflection of us listening.

910
40:56.520 --> 40:58.790
So your question just now, we listened to our guests

911
40:58.790 --> 41:00.690
as we went through specifically the pandemic,

912
41:00.690 --> 41:02.100
and what needs they were having change,

913
41:02.100 --> 41:03.840
and we responded with programming around that,

914
41:03.840 --> 41:06.060
and it's been immensely successful.

915
41:06.060 --> 41:08.280
<v ->You know, and just going back to Chase's question,</v>

916
41:08.280 --> 41:12.727
I think there is so much choice that it is overwhelming.

917
41:12.727 --> 41:16.020
You don't even know how to go through Netflix

918
41:16.020 --> 41:19.804
or YouTube's library of content or what to go do at CES.

919
41:19.804 --> 41:22.200
And this is where personalization can come in,

920
41:22.200 --> 41:24.510
and we can help you based on what we know about you,

921
41:24.510 --> 41:25.584
what you've shared with us.

922
41:25.584 --> 41:28.680
Serve up recommendations that are far more curated.

923
41:28.680 --> 41:30.960
And I think this is where AI has such an opportunity

924
41:30.960 --> 41:33.420
to help travelers all over the world make the best

925
41:33.420 --> 41:35.760
of the limited time they have at a destination.

926
41:35.760 --> 41:38.550
So it's thanks for the push on that.

927
41:38.550 --> 41:41.560
<v ->Great and then I think one more question back in the back.</v>

928
41:41.560 --> 41:42.780
<v ->[Audience Member 3] Yeah, so first of all,</v>

929
41:42.780 --> 41:43.890
great panelists.

930
41:43.890 --> 41:45.810
I just wanted to echo what Ranjan was saying

931
41:45.810 --> 41:47.960
because you know, being employed, let's say,

932
41:47.960 --> 41:50.610
at the training center, we wanna make sure

933
41:50.610 --> 41:53.082
that all of us are empowered in using AI

934
41:53.082 --> 41:54.990
to personalize that service.

935
41:54.990 --> 41:57.147
So every moment matters (speaking faintly).

936
42:02.514 --> 42:03.347
<v ->Oh, that's great.</v>

937
42:03.347 --> 42:05.520
Well, you know, that actually adds a whole nother overlay

938
42:05.520 --> 42:08.007
on this too, about even training our employees on AI.

939
42:08.007 --> 42:09.749
I know at Freeman we've started

940
42:09.749 --> 42:12.000
actually doing AI round tables

941
42:12.000 --> 42:13.916
and getting people to not be afraid of it.

942
42:13.916 --> 42:16.890
And as Dr K. said, I mean, you're already using it,

943
42:16.890 --> 42:17.731
it's in your world.

944
42:17.731 --> 42:19.268
But really kind of pulling that out,

945
42:19.268 --> 42:22.975
and I don't know, last question, or comment on that one?

946
42:22.975 --> 42:26.010
<v ->One of the first places we're gonna deploy AI is actually</v>

947
42:26.010 --> 42:29.074
at our reservation call centers to arm our specialists with,

948
42:29.074 --> 42:30.607
when you get all these questions,

949
42:30.607 --> 42:33.600
and they've gotta go into seven or eight different systems,

950
42:33.600 --> 42:36.540
let the Delta concierge have an employee-facing version

951
42:36.540 --> 42:38.567
of it and help them answer those questions faster,

952
42:38.567 --> 42:40.620
to give time back to the customer.

953
42:40.620 --> 42:43.009
And also allow the specialist to really spend time

954
42:43.009 --> 42:44.820
on connecting with the customer, right?

955
42:44.820 --> 42:46.440
And being hyper relevant.

956
42:46.440 --> 42:49.410
So I think that the next CES we'll learn a lot more about

957
42:49.410 --> 42:52.714
how we're using AI agents to help our own people navigate,

958
42:52.714 --> 42:54.836
be smarter, understand context.

959
42:54.836 --> 42:55.980
<v ->I agree.</v>

960
42:55.980 --> 42:57.897
We have three major segments we're looking at, right?

961
42:57.897 --> 43:00.840
And I have the bespoke privilege of being over,

962
43:00.840 --> 43:02.810
not only obviously all of our guest-facing tools

963
43:02.810 --> 43:06.316
that you all use every day, our customer-facing tools

964
43:06.316 --> 43:08.730
if you're booking events, but also our colleague tools.

965
43:08.730 --> 43:12.300
And so I think watching that arc of the empowerment,

966
43:12.300 --> 43:15.870
we always say from bellman to CEO will be empowered by this.

967
43:15.870 --> 43:17.580
Now, whether or not they need to be trained

968
43:17.580 --> 43:19.793
on what an LLM is, no, right.

969
43:19.793 --> 43:22.920
Can they feel empowered because they have better information

970
43:22.920 --> 43:26.220
than ever and they know that your name is Dr. K.

971
43:26.220 --> 43:28.020
and you wanna be called Dr. K. instead of Richie,

972
43:28.020 --> 43:28.860
and what that means to you?

973
43:28.860 --> 43:30.346
Absolutely.

974
43:30.346 --> 43:31.380
Right, and I think that that's where we get really excited

975
43:31.380 --> 43:33.076
about the personalization that we can offer.

976
43:33.076 --> 43:38.076
<v ->AI is really the empowerment of personalization.</v>

977
43:38.427 --> 43:42.394
That's really key because authenticity is the currency

978
43:42.394 --> 43:43.496
of the future.

979
43:43.496 --> 43:47.550
And you face a world where AI becomes an easy way just

980
43:47.550 --> 43:49.512
for everyone to make the same decision,

981
43:49.512 --> 43:51.355
everyone to say the same thing.

982
43:51.355 --> 43:54.916
But it's how you empower yourself with that information

983
43:54.916 --> 43:58.803
to create an authentic response and experience.

984
43:59.790 --> 44:00.623
<v ->Excellent.</v>

985
44:00.623 --> 44:03.450
Well, I think before, it's been zero here for a number

986
44:03.450 --> 44:05.940
of minutes on our countdown timer, but thank you all.

987
44:05.940 --> 44:07.176
You've been a great audience.

988
44:07.176 --> 44:10.489
Thank the panel, you're excellent and keep on innovating.

989
44:10.489 --> 44:12.930
I'd also like to thank Robin Raskin and her team

990
44:12.930 --> 44:15.656
from The Virtual Events Group and Carrie and whatnot.

991
44:15.656 --> 44:17.991
Maybe we'll see you all next year

992
44:17.991 --> 44:19.950
and I think we'll probably be around too

993
44:19.950 --> 44:21.720
if you'd like to actually ask any questions.

994
44:21.720 --> 44:23.631
So enjoy your time at CES,

995
44:23.631 --> 44:26.340
and hopefully your travels will be seamless.

996
44:26.340 --> 44:27.416
<v ->Thank you for moderating.</v>

997
44:27.416 --> 44:30.191
(audience applauding)

998
44:30.191 --> 44:33.358
(bright upbeat music)
