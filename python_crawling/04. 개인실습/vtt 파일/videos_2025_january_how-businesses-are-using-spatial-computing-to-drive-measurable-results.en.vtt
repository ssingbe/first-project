00:00.250 --> 00:02.833
(upbeat music)

00:11.094 --> 00:13.533
<v ->Good morning.</v>

00:15.450 --> 00:18.250
And welcome to this second session

00:19.200 --> 00:22.050
that my business partner Tim Bajarin and I put together,

00:22.050 --> 00:25.050
it was meant to kind of go back to back.

00:25.050 --> 00:26.100
Just out of curiosity,

00:26.100 --> 00:28.020
how many of you attended the previous session?

00:28.020 --> 00:30.390
Just raise your hand. Okay, that's great.

00:30.390 --> 00:32.520
So it was kind of meant to be a back to back.

00:32.520 --> 00:35.170
So Tim presented the whole technical side

00:36.270 --> 00:39.600
and then I'm coming in with the business side

00:39.600 --> 00:42.750
and we link together, as Tim already alluded to

00:42.750 --> 00:47.250
in our AI and spatial computing resource center.

00:47.250 --> 00:50.040
And also Tim and I do a podcast together.

00:50.040 --> 00:53.490
So we kind of like to use this format.

00:53.490 --> 00:56.550
Okay, here's what we're gonna do for today.

00:56.550 --> 00:59.850
We have three very distinguished

00:59.850 --> 01:02.220
industry subject matter experts

01:02.220 --> 01:04.020
and executives in their own rights.

01:04.020 --> 01:06.210
I'll be introducing them

01:06.210 --> 01:09.150
or they'll be introducing themselves momentarily.

01:09.150 --> 01:11.940
We're going to have them give some indication

01:11.940 --> 01:14.970
of how they're using spatial computing today

01:14.970 --> 01:18.870
in their day-to-day businesses and the impact it's having.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.820
We're gonna then go to a group of questions.

01:20.820 --> 01:23.370
I've got five pre-made questions,

01:23.370 --> 01:26.340
but I love a little bit of serendipity and surprise.

01:26.340 --> 01:29.520
So I'm gonna actually ask the audience for some questions.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.560
So you do be prepared as you hear us.

01:31.560 --> 01:32.725
If you feel like,

01:32.725 --> 01:35.250
you know, I want to ask somebody or them all,

01:35.250 --> 01:36.570
that's perfectly fine.

01:36.570 --> 01:37.403
And then I'll close

01:37.403 --> 01:39.840
with some observations and remarks, okay?

01:39.840 --> 01:41.430
So with that, and without further ado,

01:41.430 --> 01:43.590
let me click the first slide.

01:43.590 --> 01:45.240
And by the way, I hope you're in the right session.

01:45.240 --> 01:48.450
This is how businesses are using spatial computing

01:48.450 --> 01:50.310
to drive measurable results.

01:50.310 --> 01:51.570
If you're in the wrong session,

01:51.570 --> 01:54.900
this is the appropriate time to exit the stage.

01:54.900 --> 01:57.960
Okay, so let me start with my immediate left,

01:57.960 --> 02:00.990
and Peter, would you be kind enough to introduce yourself?

02:00.990 --> 02:03.420
<v ->Yeah, thank you, Barton, and good morning everyone.</v>

02:03.420 --> 02:05.340
It's great to have you.

02:05.340 --> 02:06.810
So my name is Peter Koerte.

02:06.810 --> 02:10.950
I am the CTO at Siemens German conglomerate

02:10.950 --> 02:12.970
in terms of tech company

02:12.970 --> 02:16.080
where we provide all the software and hardware

02:16.080 --> 02:17.100
in the industrial space.

02:17.100 --> 02:20.070
And I'm very, very pleased to be here today.

02:20.070 --> 02:22.590
<v ->Thank you, Peter. And we welcome you.</v>

02:22.590 --> 02:23.890
Jane, I think you're next.

02:25.110 --> 02:25.943
<v ->Good morning everyone.</v>

02:25.943 --> 02:27.540
My name is Jane Nakagawa,

02:27.540 --> 02:32.130
and I'm the vice president of R&amp;D at American Honda Motors,

02:32.130 --> 02:33.930
which sounds very technology,

02:33.930 --> 02:36.600
but it's actually mostly the design center

02:36.600 --> 02:38.550
about a couple hundred designers

02:38.550 --> 02:42.570
in addition to some other divisions, but mostly design.

02:42.570 --> 02:43.440
Thank you.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.030
<v ->We welcome you, Jane. Harvey?</v>

02:45.030 --> 02:48.030
<v ->Good morning everybody. My name is Dr. Harvey Castro.</v>

02:48.030 --> 02:50.970
My friends lovingly call me Dr. GPT.

02:50.970 --> 02:52.020
Honestly wrote the first book

02:52.020 --> 02:54.720
on how to use chat GPT in healthcare back in 2022.

02:54.720 --> 02:55.807
And last year I wrote a book

02:55.807 --> 02:58.530
on how to use the Apple Vision Pro in healthcare.

02:58.530 --> 03:01.170
Quick background, I created about 30 companies.

03:01.170 --> 03:02.760
The largest was a healthcare company

03:02.760 --> 03:04.200
I grew it to about 400 employees

03:04.200 --> 03:07.320
and it was emergency rooms, hospitals, urgent cares.

03:07.320 --> 03:10.350
Fast forward now I'm working consulting companies

03:10.350 --> 03:13.050
like Singapore, countries like Singapore,

03:13.050 --> 03:15.090
helping them with AI and healthcare.

03:15.090 --> 03:17.340
NASA has asked me to help them with Mission Mars

03:17.340 --> 03:19.110
and so I'm really excited about this space

03:19.110 --> 03:20.820
and so thanks for coming.

03:20.820 --> 03:22.080
<v ->Thank you, Harvey.</v>

03:22.080 --> 03:24.810
Okay, to help the panelists,

03:24.810 --> 03:26.430
I'm gonna ask a couple of questions.

03:26.430 --> 03:28.020
Just raise your hand and I'm gonna have to stand up

03:28.020 --> 03:29.670
'cause these lights are terribly bright,

03:29.670 --> 03:30.900
but I'm trying to figure out

03:30.900 --> 03:32.550
who's in the audience to help the the panelists.

03:32.550 --> 03:35.490
So how many of you are in the business side of the house

03:35.490 --> 03:36.323
please raise your hand,

03:36.323 --> 03:39.990
working a business function, represent a business function?

03:39.990 --> 03:44.340
So I'm gonna guess that's about about 20, 30%

03:44.340 --> 03:46.980
how many are on the IT side of the house?

03:46.980 --> 03:48.663
So working in an IT function.

03:50.190 --> 03:52.050
Kind of a similar number.

03:52.050 --> 03:53.820
So let's just say a third, a third.

03:53.820 --> 03:55.950
And for those, just out of curiosity,

03:55.950 --> 04:00.450
how many of you are on the business to business side?

04:00.450 --> 04:02.223
So doing business to business.

04:03.210 --> 04:05.190
That's very interesting. There's a lot more there.

04:05.190 --> 04:08.790
And on the business to consumer, would you raise your hands?

04:08.790 --> 04:12.300
Yeah, so we are business to business focused more

04:12.300 --> 04:13.170
than business to consumer.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.550
And pretty much evenly split,

04:14.550 --> 04:18.713
as I saw the hands go up between business and IT, okay?

04:19.680 --> 04:22.170
So with that in mind, would you start,

04:22.170 --> 04:25.050
Peter, I'll ask just 'cause it's simpler, you're on my left.

04:25.050 --> 04:26.490
Why don't you spend about three minutes,

04:26.490 --> 04:30.600
tell us a little bit about how you and Siemens,

04:30.600 --> 04:33.780
one of the world's greatest companies, and your clients

04:33.780 --> 04:38.550
have been able to use spatial computing today

04:38.550 --> 04:41.820
to drive measurable business results.

04:41.820 --> 04:46.820
<v ->Yeah. So the spatial computing conversation,</v>

04:47.130 --> 04:50.010
last year, we had that also the panel

04:50.010 --> 04:50.910
as you as you remember.

04:50.910 --> 04:53.910
And at the time we were talking a little bit more about the,

04:53.910 --> 04:55.650
what we call the industrial metaverse.

04:55.650 --> 04:57.930
So obviously from a terminology perspective,

04:57.930 --> 05:02.310
we haven't really moved over to call it spatial compute,

05:02.310 --> 05:04.740
we are still stuck with that term

05:04.740 --> 05:07.800
or we are sticking to this term of a industrial metaverse.

05:07.800 --> 05:09.180
Why?

05:09.180 --> 05:10.920
The answer is that we believe

05:10.920 --> 05:13.230
in the combination of hardware, software

05:13.230 --> 05:15.030
to bring both worlds together,

05:15.030 --> 05:17.820
digital worlds and the real worlds.

05:17.820 --> 05:19.470
And the reason being is

05:19.470 --> 05:22.680
that you can solve problems in the digital world

05:22.680 --> 05:25.440
a thousand times faster than in the real world.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.180
Because once you have abstracted them,

05:27.180 --> 05:30.600
once you have modeled them by the means of digital twins.

05:30.600 --> 05:31.560
And the data,

05:31.560 --> 05:34.020
I'm sure probably gonna talk about AI today too,

05:34.020 --> 05:35.540
you're so much faster.

05:35.540 --> 05:38.370
And I can give you an example

05:38.370 --> 05:42.840
where we are using this already today for our own purpose.

05:42.840 --> 05:47.430
So every factory we are building, it's being built twice,

05:47.430 --> 05:49.980
it's being built first in the digital world

05:49.980 --> 05:53.130
and then actually it's being built in the real world.

05:53.130 --> 05:54.450
It doesn't stop there though.

05:54.450 --> 05:56.080
So once you have built it, then we connect the two

05:56.080 --> 06:00.810
and then actually the model that was originally there

06:00.810 --> 06:03.420
is actually being continuously updated.

06:03.420 --> 06:04.950
What's the benefit?

06:04.950 --> 06:09.480
We see that we can actually increase capacity by 200%,

06:09.480 --> 06:13.440
200% without adding any new floor plans or whatever that is.

06:13.440 --> 06:16.440
And the reason being that you can optimize,

06:16.440 --> 06:18.690
you can optimize a thousand times

06:18.690 --> 06:20.880
and see how the material flow, how it's gonna be,

06:20.880 --> 06:22.740
how the machinery set up is gonna be,

06:22.740 --> 06:23.970
how people and brokers

06:23.970 --> 06:27.360
are gonna gonna rock on that shop floor.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.670
We increased productivity by 20%,

06:29.670 --> 06:32.490
we reduced significantly energy usage

06:32.490 --> 06:35.010
because again, you can all simulate that.

06:35.010 --> 06:38.580
So we find it incredibly, incredibly helpful.

06:38.580 --> 06:42.180
And together with NVIDIA for example, we have helped Foxconn

06:42.180 --> 06:45.600
to move some of their factories also into Mexico.

06:45.600 --> 06:48.420
Same story, incredible savings.

06:48.420 --> 06:51.780
So we certainly believe that bringing

06:51.780 --> 06:53.190
by the means of special compute

06:53.190 --> 06:54.348
meaning industrial metaverse,

06:54.348 --> 06:57.720
the reality in the digital world optimizing it,

06:57.720 --> 07:02.190
it has the major impact of becoming more sustainable

07:02.190 --> 07:03.900
and more competitive.

07:03.900 --> 07:04.733
<v ->Thank you, Peter.</v>

07:04.733 --> 07:07.770
And I just wanna make sure everybody heard clearly.

07:07.770 --> 07:10.110
So Peter, this is not something you're gonna do tomorrow,

07:10.110 --> 07:12.330
this is something you're doing today, is that correct?

07:12.330 --> 07:13.530
<v ->That's correct.</v>

07:13.530 --> 07:16.980
<v ->And Peter actually last year, when he spoke for us</v>

07:16.980 --> 07:20.700
and he actually showed a video of how the two factories,

07:20.700 --> 07:23.370
the digital factory and the real factory,

07:23.370 --> 07:25.320
how the real factory moves into the digital

07:25.320 --> 07:26.820
and then how you optimize the digital.

07:26.820 --> 07:28.920
So it's a very, very fascinating process.

07:28.920 --> 07:31.290
I should have mentioned spatial computing.

07:31.290 --> 07:34.200
Today we look at that, at least for this panel purposes,

07:34.200 --> 07:37.200
augmented reality, virtual reality, extended reality,

07:37.200 --> 07:38.070
and mixed reality.

07:38.070 --> 07:39.960
Okay, it's kind of an umbrella term

07:39.960 --> 07:42.930
the industry seems to be moving towards, but quite knows.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.850
Okay, Jane, would you be kind enough

07:44.850 --> 07:46.200
to spend a couple of minutes

07:46.200 --> 07:48.780
and tell us a little bit about how you are,

07:48.780 --> 07:51.720
you and or your clients are using space computing today

07:51.720 --> 07:54.180
to drive measurable business results?

07:54.180 --> 07:57.570
<v ->Yeah, so our work is, it starts today,</v>

07:57.570 --> 07:59.250
but the output we don't really see

07:59.250 --> 08:01.107
until about five years from now.

08:01.107 --> 08:05.520
And we're trying to shorten that development timing.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.770
We use it today because of,

08:07.770 --> 08:10.980
maybe some of the same reasons for speed and efficiency,

08:10.980 --> 08:15.980
but also for us it's expanding the creative possibilities.

08:15.990 --> 08:20.990
So we believe that the digital tools that we have,

08:21.150 --> 08:24.510
it's almost like having hundreds of extra,

08:24.510 --> 08:28.080
you know, creative staff, and, you know, at your service.

08:28.080 --> 08:31.080
And we are able to

08:31.080 --> 08:34.410
really expand the way we think the future might be

08:34.410 --> 08:37.290
for the way we provide value in automobiles

08:37.290 --> 08:39.570
and other transportation devices.

08:39.570 --> 08:42.750
And we can do so without as much risk

08:42.750 --> 08:45.420
in making mistakes so much

08:45.420 --> 08:48.750
because there's so much at stake when we launch a car.

08:48.750 --> 08:53.550
And so, I think for us it's really this amazing tool

08:53.550 --> 08:55.840
to be able to create better

08:56.970 --> 08:58.920
while being able to sort of not worry

08:58.920 --> 09:01.830
about making mistakes right away.

09:01.830 --> 09:02.850
So we use the tools,

09:02.850 --> 09:06.300
but really it's all about creating value for Honda.

09:06.300 --> 09:10.620
So Honda I see as in kind of three trimesters.

09:10.620 --> 09:14.485
The first founding of Honda had two semesters.

09:14.485 --> 09:17.940
The first one was when we invented the motor,

09:17.940 --> 09:20.040
you know, so the Honda Motor Company,

09:20.040 --> 09:22.110
Mr. Honda stuck a motor onto a bicycle

09:22.110 --> 09:24.150
and thus began the two wheeled business,

09:24.150 --> 09:27.000
which eventually turned into the four wheel business,

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
which was the, you know, the kind of the second trimester.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
And it was an area where we did a lot of package magic.

09:35.040 --> 09:38.370
So this idea that the car was much bigger on the inside

09:38.370 --> 09:41.940
than we believed it would be from the outside.

09:41.940 --> 09:46.440
So machine minimum and human maximum.

09:46.440 --> 09:49.950
And then we just kind of kicked off a few years ago,

09:49.950 --> 09:51.180
the second founding of Honda,

09:51.180 --> 09:54.510
and it's all gonna be about immersive experiences.

09:54.510 --> 09:56.400
So that's kind of how we see it.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.410
So everything we're doing right now

09:58.410 --> 10:02.760
is to create value through digital immersive experiences

10:02.760 --> 10:07.170
and it's an incredible time to be in automotive it,

10:07.170 --> 10:12.170
in the creative area, it's turning the work inside out,

10:13.020 --> 10:13.853
literally.

10:13.853 --> 10:18.360
So, you know, if there were auto OEMs present here today,

10:18.360 --> 10:21.750
most of them, if not all, would be exterior designers,

10:21.750 --> 10:23.880
even at Honda that's also the case.

10:23.880 --> 10:26.370
But I think in the very new near future

10:26.370 --> 10:27.930
it will be interior designers.

10:27.930 --> 10:31.590
So we're starting the work of car design

10:31.590 --> 10:33.660
from digital experiences

10:33.660 --> 10:35.550
and what is the value we're bringing

10:35.550 --> 10:37.260
from an immersive experience,

10:37.260 --> 10:39.450
then we go into interior design,

10:39.450 --> 10:41.580
then we do color and materials,

10:41.580 --> 10:44.130
and then finally we'll do package.

10:44.130 --> 10:46.110
And then the exterior design

10:46.110 --> 10:49.350
is really just the wrapping and the bow on the package.

10:49.350 --> 10:51.150
So it's gonna be inside out

10:51.150 --> 10:53.040
and we're already starting to design that way,

10:53.040 --> 10:56.100
and that's all because of this technology, so.

10:56.100 --> 10:58.680
<v ->Is, just out of curiosity, is Mr. Honda still alive?</v>

10:58.680 --> 10:59.786
<v ->No, he's not-</v>

10:59.786 --> 11:01.470
<v ->Because I think he would roll in his grave right now</v>

11:01.470 --> 11:03.877
if he saw what's happening to his two wheel company.

11:03.877 --> 11:05.617
<v ->I think. I think, well,</v>

11:05.617 --> 11:07.440
I think I know what you're talking about,

11:07.440 --> 11:10.170
but yeah, we don't want to talk about that right now.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.090
<v ->Harvey, why don't you share with us,</v>

11:12.090 --> 11:14.130
and obviously you bring a very different perspective

11:14.130 --> 11:15.570
from the medical side.

11:15.570 --> 11:17.610
Tell us a little bit about how you and/or your clients

11:17.610 --> 11:19.530
are using spatial computing today

11:19.530 --> 11:21.570
to drive measurable business results.

11:21.570 --> 11:24.780
<v ->Yeah. So my favorite phrase when I was a med student</v>

11:24.780 --> 11:28.440
was see one, do one, teach one.

11:28.440 --> 11:29.940
And basically it was,

11:29.940 --> 11:32.250
hey Harvey, come over here, we need to intubate this person.

11:32.250 --> 11:33.990
And I'm like, oh, I read about it.

11:33.990 --> 11:35.490
And they're like, no, no, no, here I'm gonna show you

11:35.490 --> 11:36.323
and I'd do it.

11:36.323 --> 11:37.320
And they're like, okay, now go to room three

11:37.320 --> 11:38.460
and we gotta intubate this person.

11:38.460 --> 11:41.790
And I'm like, I just saw it and then I would do it.

11:41.790 --> 11:42.623
And then they're like,

11:42.623 --> 11:44.730
okay, now you need to teach Jane how to do it.

11:44.730 --> 11:46.620
And I'm like, wow, that's a lot of stress,

11:46.620 --> 11:47.453
a lot of pressure.

11:47.453 --> 11:49.410
But now spatial computing,

11:49.410 --> 11:52.200
I could do it a hundred times before I even touch a patient.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.550
Amazing.

11:53.550 --> 11:56.610
Second, I'm really big on empathy, I think,

11:56.610 --> 11:59.730
and I'm curious of show of hands on healthcare,

11:59.730 --> 12:00.930
do you think empathy's really high?

12:00.930 --> 12:02.130
Do you think your healthcare provider's

12:02.130 --> 12:04.320
like yeah, he's right on there.

12:04.320 --> 12:05.370
I think some doctors

12:05.370 --> 12:07.800
and healthcare professionals sometimes miss the boat.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.680
And I think spatial computing can help in so many ways.

12:10.680 --> 12:12.690
Now, the spatial computing, I'm putting it on

12:12.690 --> 12:14.790
and it's analyzing how am I speaking?

12:14.790 --> 12:17.490
How am I talking, what's my tone? What's my voice?

12:17.490 --> 12:20.430
Or am I just like looking at my phone? Am I standing?

12:20.430 --> 12:23.700
That brings that to it, to that second patient effect.

12:23.700 --> 12:26.970
The third, as this technology continues,

12:26.970 --> 12:29.280
I see it as a segue to train robots

12:29.280 --> 12:31.020
to put that into the next level.

12:31.020 --> 12:33.360
So I really think that's how we're gonna be using this

12:33.360 --> 12:34.650
in the healthcare field.

12:34.650 --> 12:36.603
And there's a zillion other examples.

12:37.440 --> 12:40.710
<v ->Yeah, we've gotten to know Harvey, he's on our podcast</v>

12:40.710 --> 12:42.810
and just as a friend.

12:42.810 --> 12:45.420
He's a very interesting individual and is committed

12:45.420 --> 12:48.210
to these technologies both in the operating room,

12:48.210 --> 12:49.800
in the emergency room.

12:49.800 --> 12:50.910
And it's just very fascinating.

12:50.910 --> 12:52.110
He's written extensively about it.

12:52.110 --> 12:53.850
We are gonna get into a couple of health questions

12:53.850 --> 12:55.080
during today's session,

12:55.080 --> 12:56.880
but we're delighted to have you on the panel,

12:56.880 --> 12:58.230
so thank you.
<v ->Thank you.</v>

12:58.230 --> 13:01.920
Okay, let's start asking a few questions.

13:01.920 --> 13:04.560
So one of the things that I've always found fascinating

13:04.560 --> 13:06.570
is I, and I should have introduced myself,

13:06.570 --> 13:08.010
I'm Barton Goldenberg,

13:08.010 --> 13:11.760
I'm 40 years in applying leading edge technologies

13:11.760 --> 13:13.050
to global corporations

13:13.050 --> 13:16.080
in the area of sales and marketing and customer service.

13:16.080 --> 13:19.170
And I cut my teeth as a CRM guy, wrote three books,

13:19.170 --> 13:20.910
and managed many conferences,

13:20.910 --> 13:23.970
moved into digital technologies

13:23.970 --> 13:26.730
in the form of digital communities.

13:26.730 --> 13:29.970
Then I moved into Metaverse with my colleague Tim Bajarin.

13:29.970 --> 13:33.030
And ultimately we're also working with AI.

13:33.030 --> 13:35.280
During that period in time we have,

13:35.280 --> 13:36.360
I think it's very important,

13:36.360 --> 13:39.780
we've looked at literally hundreds of use cases

13:39.780 --> 13:44.780
for XR, VR, AR whatever you wanna put in there, MR as well.

13:45.540 --> 13:47.520
And that's what's in the resource center.

13:47.520 --> 13:50.550
And that helped Tim and I learn about, is this stuff real?

13:50.550 --> 13:53.460
Is it gonna happen now? Is it soon?

13:53.460 --> 13:54.713
There's a case study from Siemens,

13:54.713 --> 13:56.670
there's a case study, I think even,

13:56.670 --> 13:58.710
well not from Honda but from Mercedes

13:58.710 --> 14:00.360
and a couple of other car companies.

14:00.360 --> 14:03.300
And what Tim and I learned was, it's amazing

14:03.300 --> 14:07.290
what is being done right now using these technologies

14:07.290 --> 14:08.580
for success.

14:08.580 --> 14:12.030
And how many people were still clouded in their minds,

14:12.030 --> 14:13.260
is this something I do now?

14:13.260 --> 14:14.760
Do I put the stakes in the ground?

14:14.760 --> 14:17.190
Do I wait a couple years until it matures?

14:17.190 --> 14:18.480
Is the technology there?

14:18.480 --> 14:20.100
How are we gonna deal with the people side?

14:20.100 --> 14:23.280
There were lots of questions that everybody was asking.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.080
So let me ask this question to the panelists,

14:25.080 --> 14:27.870
and Harvey, I'll start on all the way down your side.

14:27.870 --> 14:29.970
So what would you say

14:29.970 --> 14:32.130
would be the top three reasons

14:32.130 --> 14:35.730
why companies should invest in spatial computing today

14:35.730 --> 14:38.115
versus wait till tomorrow?

14:38.115 --> 14:38.948
<v ->Yeah.</v>

14:38.948 --> 14:42.060
You know, I'm gonna speak as an emergency room doctor

14:42.060 --> 14:45.510
when seconds count, when I need that information now,

14:45.510 --> 14:47.820
not in five minutes, not in 10 minutes.

14:47.820 --> 14:51.600
Think about a surgeon wearing the VR glasses

14:51.600 --> 14:53.250
and being able to do surgery

14:53.250 --> 14:54.540
and not have to pull up an x-ray

14:54.540 --> 14:57.000
and then put his attention span at different places.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.670
He could be in the visual field of doing surgery

14:59.670 --> 15:01.110
and get that data.

15:01.110 --> 15:04.440
As an ER doctor to my example of when seconds count,

15:04.440 --> 15:08.370
I truly think when I have the lab results showing up,

15:08.370 --> 15:10.560
if I have a patient that's had an overdose,

15:10.560 --> 15:12.840
I need to know which one it was and I'm treating,

15:12.840 --> 15:15.360
but once I know, then I know how to channel it.

15:15.360 --> 15:18.210
So that's one way the efficiency in the workflow.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.010
Second, going back to my first point,

15:20.010 --> 15:22.890
I really think this is huge in training.

15:22.890 --> 15:24.743
I truly think these devices are gonna,

15:24.743 --> 15:26.370
instead of having a workforce

15:26.370 --> 15:27.990
of taking medical students four years,

15:27.990 --> 15:29.580
I think in the future we'll be able to push it

15:29.580 --> 15:30.780
to maybe three.

15:30.780 --> 15:31.980
Because I'm learning quicker,

15:31.980 --> 15:34.320
I'm seeing pattern recognition, I'm able to see,

15:34.320 --> 15:37.470
so from an efficiency point, the hospital systems,

15:37.470 --> 15:41.910
I think now is the time in medical training and the empathy.

15:41.910 --> 15:45.480
And then the last for me, when I look at this technology,

15:45.480 --> 15:47.790
I just see it as such a game changer.

15:47.790 --> 15:50.430
I see it as something that will help us today.

15:50.430 --> 15:53.400
And so being able to link this VR to AI

15:53.400 --> 15:54.750
and we'll talk about that later,

15:54.750 --> 15:55.980
that gives us another entity.

15:55.980 --> 15:57.090
And that's why I would be nice

15:57.090 --> 15:58.860
to start that infrastructure today

15:58.860 --> 16:00.660
so that when these newer technologies come,

16:00.660 --> 16:02.460
you already have that.

16:02.460 --> 16:05.130
<v ->Yeah, you know, we did a, I think it was a podcast</v>

16:05.130 --> 16:07.500
or I think it was a podcast with Mayo Clinic

16:07.500 --> 16:11.940
and I don't think they let anybody join Mayo Clinic today,

16:11.940 --> 16:12.773
any physician,

16:12.773 --> 16:17.550
unless they go through a very comprehensive virtual reality

16:17.550 --> 16:19.320
and augmented reality program

16:19.320 --> 16:21.780
where they learn all of the equipment at Mayo Clinic

16:21.780 --> 16:23.910
and how to work the labs and so forth.

16:23.910 --> 16:25.260
'Cause as Harvey has already alluded to,

16:25.260 --> 16:26.520
it's brought down tremendously

16:26.520 --> 16:28.560
the amount of time it takes to bring them in,

16:28.560 --> 16:30.780
but they're also better at what they do when they do it.

16:30.780 --> 16:32.460
so it's really quite interesting.

16:32.460 --> 16:33.870
Jane, in your opinion,

16:33.870 --> 16:35.880
three reasons why companies should invest

16:35.880 --> 16:37.713
in spatial computing today?

16:39.120 --> 16:41.670
<v ->I think that there's a couple of reasons</v>

16:41.670 --> 16:45.330
that are very different from each other.

16:45.330 --> 16:48.840
The first one is, for us, it's really important

16:48.840 --> 16:53.790
to be able to figure out what the customers are gonna want

16:53.790 --> 16:56.100
in the near future and in the far future.

16:56.100 --> 17:00.360
And that is harder and harder to do these days.

17:00.360 --> 17:03.210
You know, back when I first started in auto 30 years ago,

17:03.210 --> 17:04.050
it was a little bit easier.

17:04.050 --> 17:07.140
The pace of change wasn't as rapid

17:07.140 --> 17:12.090
and the type of change was a little bit more predictable.

17:12.090 --> 17:13.290
Well, I didn't think so at the time,

17:13.290 --> 17:16.500
but now looking back, it was definitely the case.

17:16.500 --> 17:19.290
So I think what spatial commuting

17:19.290 --> 17:22.260
and metaverse and playing around in that area

17:22.260 --> 17:27.260
helps us to envision the future in a really realistic way,

17:27.930 --> 17:29.610
even though none of it has happened yet.

17:29.610 --> 17:33.240
And I think that helps us with our storytelling

17:33.240 --> 17:36.360
and putting the context around the product concepts

17:36.360 --> 17:37.560
that we're launching.

17:37.560 --> 17:40.380
So that's more about the creative process.

17:40.380 --> 17:43.560
And then the other one is really about efficiency.

17:43.560 --> 17:48.560
So, in terms of process, so, you know, designing a car

17:48.900 --> 17:52.020
is a very labor intensive activity,

17:52.020 --> 17:54.330
usually you have a design person

17:54.330 --> 17:57.300
who's really good at illustration and concept making,

17:57.300 --> 18:00.390
but it's usually in 2D, then you bring it to someone

18:00.390 --> 18:02.697
who can create a 3D model of it,

18:02.697 --> 18:04.980
and then it goes to a clay modeler

18:04.980 --> 18:06.960
and they literally make a lump of clay

18:06.960 --> 18:08.370
that looks like a car.

18:08.370 --> 18:11.220
And then, you know, once that's measured and approved,

18:11.220 --> 18:15.570
then you have to send that data to the development people,

18:15.570 --> 18:17.340
then they tweak it, make final,

18:17.340 --> 18:18.480
and then it goes to the factory

18:18.480 --> 18:19.800
and that's the car that's made.

18:19.800 --> 18:24.000
And I think all of the tools that are available now

18:24.000 --> 18:26.280
is going to shorten that period.

18:26.280 --> 18:28.680
So right now, we're using it a lot more

18:28.680 --> 18:30.990
at the front end of the design process

18:30.990 --> 18:34.500
because at the the farther end it's a little bit harder.

18:34.500 --> 18:38.250
Even at the final design decision making,

18:38.250 --> 18:41.280
it's still not good enough compared to reality.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.140
So right now we're doing the awful thing

18:43.140 --> 18:45.570
of having both the clay and the digital model,

18:45.570 --> 18:46.863
you know, side by side.

18:47.790 --> 18:49.890
It's also a human problem.

18:49.890 --> 18:52.740
A lot of our top executives

18:52.740 --> 18:55.770
are not as familiar with these tools,

18:55.770 --> 18:57.840
so they're not as accepting

18:57.840 --> 19:00.390
and, you know, they don't wanna wear the big goggles

19:00.390 --> 19:03.030
and I complain it ruins my makeup and things like that.

19:03.030 --> 19:08.030
So, I think, you know, people who are in the evaluation area

19:10.680 --> 19:13.470
also need to evolve and accept these tools.

19:13.470 --> 19:16.036
<v ->And this is a real transition in the automotive industry.</v>

19:16.036 --> 19:16.869
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->And-</v>

19:16.869 --> 19:17.702
<v ->It's huge.</v>

19:17.702 --> 19:19.710
<v ->It's amazing what companies are doing</v>

19:19.710 --> 19:21.090
and how quickly it's evolving

19:21.090 --> 19:23.100
and how new companies are coming in

19:23.100 --> 19:25.260
and the, it's just, it's a whole new bogging.

19:25.260 --> 19:27.030
<v ->Yeah. And it's really exciting.</v>

19:27.030 --> 19:27.863
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

19:27.863 --> 19:28.860
<v ->I can imagine.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

19:28.860 --> 19:30.960
<v ->Peter, share with us top three reasons</v>

19:30.960 --> 19:32.370
why you feel companies should invest

19:32.370 --> 19:33.900
in spatial computing today.

19:33.900 --> 19:38.130
<v ->Well, first off, these are great examples by the way.</v>

19:38.130 --> 19:41.010
It has to prove its value.

19:41.010 --> 19:43.332
I mean obviously it's an investment, so it's an ROI

19:43.332 --> 19:45.180
and what I mentioned earlier,

19:45.180 --> 19:47.340
building a digital twin, make it immersive,

19:47.340 --> 19:48.840
getting perhaps, you know,

19:48.840 --> 19:51.360
in an immersive engineering jointly do it.

19:51.360 --> 19:54.750
If you can cut down time and if you improve the quality

19:54.750 --> 19:56.940
and if you can work more concurrently,

19:56.940 --> 19:57.990
that's the major benefits.

19:57.990 --> 20:02.990
So the results there and the savings are demonstrated.

20:03.090 --> 20:06.150
So therefore I think there's a very good case to be had.

20:06.150 --> 20:09.453
The second reason though, also where Jane was going is,

20:10.410 --> 20:13.800
it's technology, but in the end it's the humans,

20:13.800 --> 20:16.020
it's the people that have to use it.

20:16.020 --> 20:17.640
And what we find is

20:17.640 --> 20:20.250
it's not just only how do you use the devices,

20:20.250 --> 20:22.020
but very often

20:22.020 --> 20:25.140
you bring different departments together, right?

20:25.140 --> 20:30.140
So in R&amp;D, in engineering, in supply chain, in service,

20:30.840 --> 20:35.100
they have to work collaboratively, come together

20:35.100 --> 20:37.080
and actually are in this virtual world

20:37.080 --> 20:39.180
to solve that very problem.

20:39.180 --> 20:41.550
But I can tell you from our own organization,

20:41.550 --> 20:43.740
but all the companies that we're working with is,

20:43.740 --> 20:46.530
usually, this is the hardest part to crack.

20:46.530 --> 20:49.080
How do you bring all the different disparate parts

20:49.080 --> 20:52.440
of an organization together so that they jointly do that?

20:52.440 --> 20:55.230
So therefore, I think you have to start now

20:55.230 --> 20:57.210
because here's the third one.

20:57.210 --> 20:59.940
This is just the beginning of what we're gonna see.

20:59.940 --> 21:01.920
We are gonna see more and more work happening

21:01.920 --> 21:05.730
in that digital world immersive or 2D,

21:05.730 --> 21:08.250
but it's really happening.

21:08.250 --> 21:11.220
And so I firmly believe if you don't start now

21:11.220 --> 21:13.350
in exploring what are the use cases,

21:13.350 --> 21:16.260
getting the people in there, getting them together,

21:16.260 --> 21:18.360
used to that kind of environment,

21:18.360 --> 21:20.940
you're gonna fall behind in the future.

21:20.940 --> 21:22.500
<v ->Yeah, it's very, very insightful.</v>

21:22.500 --> 21:26.340
When I first met Peter, he was the chief technical officer

21:26.340 --> 21:27.173
and I think he was also

21:27.173 --> 21:29.700
the chief strategy officer for Siemens.

21:29.700 --> 21:30.780
And for those that are not familiar,

21:30.780 --> 21:32.820
this is one of the world's greatest companies

21:32.820 --> 21:34.710
dating back a hundred and some odd years,

21:34.710 --> 21:35.910
even more than that now.

21:36.780 --> 21:40.170
But what is very interesting is Peter was recently appointed

21:40.170 --> 21:41.850
a member of the managing board,

21:41.850 --> 21:43.920
and that's just recently in the last few months.

21:43.920 --> 21:45.090
And I thought that was a,

21:45.090 --> 21:47.880
first of all, an indication of how wonderful Peter is

21:47.880 --> 21:51.780
as a evangelist of all of these technologies within Siemens,

21:51.780 --> 21:54.540
which can be a very conservative and serious company,

21:54.540 --> 21:55.680
but equally important,

21:55.680 --> 21:58.830
how willing the board was to bring in this thinking

21:58.830 --> 22:01.710
so that it could become pervasive within the organization.

22:01.710 --> 22:04.950
So I thought that was a real signal about both you and them.

22:04.950 --> 22:06.497
<v ->Well, thank you. Thank you, Barton.</v>

22:06.497 --> 22:07.740
<v ->You're welcome.</v>

22:07.740 --> 22:11.190
Okay, somebody mentioned the magic word AI,

22:11.190 --> 22:14.610
and I think it was very funny in the last session Tim said,

22:14.610 --> 22:18.690
I think this is probably an emerging trend.

22:18.690 --> 22:20.970
I think we're way beyond an emerging trend,

22:20.970 --> 22:24.300
this is an obsession trend, but it's also fantastic.

22:24.300 --> 22:27.390
So now that AI's become a dominant force,

22:27.390 --> 22:29.730
both at this event, but Harvey and what you do

22:29.730 --> 22:31.980
and Jane and Peter and all of what you're doing,

22:31.980 --> 22:34.320
Would you be kind enough to share with us

22:34.320 --> 22:37.800
as you continue your work in digital twin whether it be

22:37.800 --> 22:40.320
or design or whether it be medical applications

22:40.320 --> 22:43.350
using VR and AR tool sets,

22:43.350 --> 22:46.500
how will you maximize AR technologies

22:46.500 --> 22:48.660
in these spatial computing efforts?

22:48.660 --> 22:51.030
And for that, Jane, I'll start right in the middle.

22:51.030 --> 22:56.030
<v ->Okay. I think for us, a good way to explain it</v>

22:56.660 --> 23:00.450
is the difference between Google and Chat GPT.

23:00.450 --> 23:02.940
And the way we talk about it at Honda

23:02.940 --> 23:05.250
is Google is kind of like what you use

23:05.250 --> 23:07.950
when you're looking for an answer to something.

23:07.950 --> 23:11.250
So all the arrows are, you know, the questions are pointing

23:11.250 --> 23:12.600
into the dot in the middle,

23:12.600 --> 23:15.180
which is the question you're trying to ask.

23:15.180 --> 23:19.650
I think Chat GPT is more about going out,

23:19.650 --> 23:21.360
so all the arrows are pointing out.

23:21.360 --> 23:24.330
So it's expanding the possibilities.

23:24.330 --> 23:29.220
And I think that's why we in creative love AI

23:29.220 --> 23:34.110
because it's really prompting us to ask questions

23:34.110 --> 23:36.180
that we didn't even know we should be asking.

23:36.180 --> 23:37.380
So it's asking us questions

23:37.380 --> 23:39.480
about what questions we should ask, you know?

23:39.480 --> 23:43.830
And it really does help kind of trigger a part of the mind

23:43.830 --> 23:48.150
that was of dormant or wasn't active.

23:48.150 --> 23:50.580
And it's all happening within us,

23:50.580 --> 23:54.630
but this tool is helping us to think about possibilities

23:54.630 --> 23:56.580
in ways that we hadn't thought about

23:56.580 --> 23:58.890
because automotive is kind of old,

23:58.890 --> 24:00.780
you know, and we've been doing things a certain way

24:00.780 --> 24:02.190
for a long time

24:02.190 --> 24:04.290
and now everything is turning inside out.

24:04.290 --> 24:06.030
And so, we really have to make sure

24:06.030 --> 24:07.800
that we're using the right tools

24:07.800 --> 24:11.040
and asking the right questions to make sure that we're

24:11.040 --> 24:13.447
looking into the right kind of possibilities.

24:13.447 --> 24:14.850
<v ->Great.</v>
<v ->If that makes sense.</v>

24:14.850 --> 24:16.587
<v ->Yeah, it does makes a lot of sense. Thank you.</v>

24:16.587 --> 24:20.100
Harvey, how are you leveraging AI

24:20.100 --> 24:22.470
in some of your spatial computing efforts

24:22.470 --> 24:23.550
in the medical field?

24:23.550 --> 24:27.180
<v ->Yeah, I'm really stoked about education.</v>

24:27.180 --> 24:29.850
So I've been going to the medical schools, PA schools

24:29.850 --> 24:32.383
and analyzing how well they're doing.

24:32.383 --> 24:35.520
They call it OSCE exams, just the physical exam,

24:35.520 --> 24:39.030
but the beauty of medicine, it's the art of medicine.

24:39.030 --> 24:41.280
So that's where we're taking AI,

24:41.280 --> 24:42.780
combining it with the human,

24:42.780 --> 24:45.210
I have 20 years experience, putting it together.

24:45.210 --> 24:48.000
And so then I could take a video of that student

24:48.000 --> 24:49.230
recording the patient,

24:49.230 --> 24:50.790
how they're interacting, how they're speaking.

24:50.790 --> 24:52.410
Then I can throw that in AI

24:52.410 --> 24:54.180
and I can give him a five page report on,

24:54.180 --> 24:56.670
look, you held a stethoscope wrong,

24:56.670 --> 24:58.320
you talked to the patient wrong.

24:58.320 --> 25:01.200
And honestly, the medical students sometimes

25:01.200 --> 25:03.600
like the bot to tell them versus me telling them

25:03.600 --> 25:06.960
because it's not as horrible to them.

25:06.960 --> 25:09.030
The other thing that I'm really stoked about

25:09.030 --> 25:10.110
is mental health

25:10.110 --> 25:12.990
because some patients would rather talk to a bot.

25:12.990 --> 25:16.950
They'd rather get into a therapy, put on the,

25:16.950 --> 25:19.380
you know, AR or VR headset

25:19.380 --> 25:21.240
and put them into that special place.

25:21.240 --> 25:22.770
Like, I'm going out to the beach,

25:22.770 --> 25:24.360
this is gonna lower my blood pressure.

25:24.360 --> 25:26.370
And then they have a bot that's talking to them,

25:26.370 --> 25:28.680
it's like a counseling session.

25:28.680 --> 25:30.780
And they would not do that with their personal doctor,

25:30.780 --> 25:31.620
some people.

25:31.620 --> 25:33.300
And so just seeing these things I'm like,

25:33.300 --> 25:36.480
wow, this is next level for healthcare.

25:36.480 --> 25:38.463
<v ->Yeah, we'll come back to this.</v>

25:39.360 --> 25:40.680
Peter, can you give us your feeling

25:40.680 --> 25:43.020
for how Siemens is applying

25:43.020 --> 25:45.690
some of the AI tools and techniques today

25:45.690 --> 25:47.820
to your spatial computing efforts?

25:47.820 --> 25:52.200
<v ->Yeah, the AI and specifically gen AI</v>

25:52.200 --> 25:54.060
has been really a game changer.

25:54.060 --> 25:57.907
And the thing is that in industry we have,

25:57.907 --> 26:01.080
we have such an amount of data that's today not being used.

26:01.080 --> 26:02.730
80% of the data is not being used.

26:02.730 --> 26:06.090
And turns out there's 17 billion, twice as many people,

26:06.090 --> 26:07.890
smart devices out there sending data

26:07.890 --> 26:09.540
and you have to aggregate them

26:09.540 --> 26:11.070
and then you have to bring them all together

26:11.070 --> 26:14.040
in your digital twin in an immersive environment, right?

26:14.040 --> 26:16.740
And we've been struggling in collecting all this data

26:16.740 --> 26:19.260
then, of course, making it contextual

26:19.260 --> 26:20.877
so that all fits together.

26:20.877 --> 26:22.860
And AI is wonderful,

26:22.860 --> 26:24.885
because AI is the best translator

26:24.885 --> 26:26.010
that you can think of, right?

26:26.010 --> 26:27.660
So therefore we take it

26:27.660 --> 26:29.220
to solve one of the biggest challenge

26:29.220 --> 26:32.520
that we have in industry, which is called interoperability.

26:32.520 --> 26:34.620
And with AI we can teach it

26:34.620 --> 26:37.530
that you can take measurements and data formats

26:37.530 --> 26:39.090
and to convert it from one to the other

26:39.090 --> 26:41.070
and then you can make it comparable.

26:41.070 --> 26:42.960
But what we are really getting excited about

26:42.960 --> 26:45.420
is that immersive engineering

26:45.420 --> 26:48.090
where we have a headset together with Sony

26:48.090 --> 26:51.030
just launched yesterday, which is now ready for shipping.

26:51.030 --> 26:55.620
And what we see there is we have a software, CAD software,

26:55.620 --> 26:58.170
which now starts to do design for you.

26:58.170 --> 26:59.910
So in other words, you can take a piece of,

26:59.910 --> 27:03.270
you know, of a part that you wanna design,

27:03.270 --> 27:04.530
you tell the system, you know,

27:04.530 --> 27:06.330
what's the stress level and so on

27:06.330 --> 27:07.800
on that very different parts.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.750
And then you say, go and optimize it for me,

27:09.750 --> 27:12.150
and then it reduces you the weight by 80%

27:12.150 --> 27:14.820
and it comes up with completely new geometries,

27:14.820 --> 27:16.200
which one, as an engineer,

27:16.200 --> 27:18.753
and I am as from an education perspective,

27:19.590 --> 27:22.170
you would've never come up, this is amazing stuff.

27:22.170 --> 27:24.084
And it happens really, really fast.

27:24.084 --> 27:29.084
And it helps, of course, customers to drive down costs,

27:29.190 --> 27:31.410
but also improve their sustainability

27:31.410 --> 27:32.940
because these pieces are lighter rates.

27:32.940 --> 27:33.900
So that's very important

27:33.900 --> 27:35.960
in aerospace and automotive and so on.

27:35.960 --> 27:38.910
So we see that as a really big game changer

27:38.910 --> 27:41.130
where different technologies are coming together, right?

27:41.130 --> 27:42.840
So it's the question about the headset,

27:42.840 --> 27:43.673
how do you see it?

27:43.673 --> 27:45.960
But then also how do you interact with it

27:45.960 --> 27:50.400
and also how you manipulate the design in that space.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.510
And it's been huge

27:51.510 --> 27:53.940
and we have many, many customers right now

27:53.940 --> 27:56.970
coming our way saying, hey, how can I use it?

27:56.970 --> 28:00.900
<v ->Yeah. You mentioned, all of you, one way or another,</v>

28:00.900 --> 28:03.480
out of curiosity, how many went to the keynote last night

28:03.480 --> 28:04.953
with NVIDIA keynote?

28:05.970 --> 28:07.980
Okay, a large portion, but not all of you.

28:07.980 --> 28:09.390
I would highly recommend

28:09.390 --> 28:10.910
as soon as that's available that you listen to it,

28:10.910 --> 28:13.080
it was a fascinating keynote.

28:13.080 --> 28:16.060
But one of the key takeaways from the keynote was

28:17.100 --> 28:21.180
NVIDIA's observation and Jensen Huang's observation

28:21.180 --> 28:25.740
that the amount of data is replicating itself,

28:25.740 --> 28:28.620
duplicating itself so quickly

28:28.620 --> 28:33.600
that we have to use AI in order to bring it together,

28:33.600 --> 28:35.340
inference it, and serve it up.

28:35.340 --> 28:37.350
And I mean, Peter's examples is as good as any,

28:37.350 --> 28:40.890
when you build a complex digital twin factory

28:40.890 --> 28:43.920
with thousands of machines and valves and controls

28:43.920 --> 28:44.820
and everything,

28:44.820 --> 28:47.790
there's gazillions of information coming in

28:47.790 --> 28:50.520
and you've gotta manage it to optimize the factory.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.890
And what AI is really allowing us to do

28:52.890 --> 28:55.710
is to take all of this incoming data,

28:55.710 --> 28:57.510
make better sense of it,

28:57.510 --> 28:59.460
and then inference it and use it effectively.

28:59.460 --> 29:00.600
So it's just interesting.

29:00.600 --> 29:01.830
Okay, next question.

29:01.830 --> 29:03.600
I'm curious,

29:03.600 --> 29:07.230
and this may be based on what you've said, Jane,

29:07.230 --> 29:12.230
somewhat headed your way, but are you using Apple Vision Pro

29:14.490 --> 29:16.530
or any other spatial headsets

29:16.530 --> 29:19.830
in your spatial computing initiatives in yes,

29:19.830 --> 29:22.623
if yes, how important have these headsets been?

29:24.360 --> 29:26.220
<v ->The answer is yes.</v>

29:26.220 --> 29:31.220
And we probably own every headset that's been made so far.

29:32.250 --> 29:34.230
So we like to experiment,

29:34.230 --> 29:37.080
we buy a few of them and try them out.

29:37.080 --> 29:39.570
There's some that are better for different things,

29:39.570 --> 29:41.040
but Apple Vision Pro

29:41.040 --> 29:44.850
is probably one of my favorite devices, personally.

29:44.850 --> 29:48.360
And I think it's because I feel like it's the best

29:48.360 --> 29:51.510
at kind of telling the kind of stories

29:51.510 --> 29:53.850
that I was mentioning before.

29:53.850 --> 29:57.810
So the idea that, of the kind of value

29:57.810 --> 29:59.190
that we're trying to create at Honda

29:59.190 --> 30:01.440
moving forward in the second founding

30:01.440 --> 30:04.260
is, you know, in the old days the experience

30:04.260 --> 30:06.240
that we provided when you bought a car

30:06.240 --> 30:08.970
had a very strong beginning and a very strong end.

30:08.970 --> 30:10.740
So you enter the car, you drive the car,

30:10.740 --> 30:12.060
you go wherever you were gonna go,

30:12.060 --> 30:14.850
and then you leave the car and the experience ends.

30:14.850 --> 30:19.290
But now, we believe there is no beginning and no end

30:19.290 --> 30:20.940
to the vehicle experience.

30:20.940 --> 30:24.750
And so when you think about that, it's hard to imagine that.

30:24.750 --> 30:27.090
And the headsets kind of help us

30:27.090 --> 30:30.330
to be in that kind of an environment.

30:30.330 --> 30:31.920
And so, I really like it.

30:31.920 --> 30:32.970
The one thing I don't like,

30:32.970 --> 30:35.550
and we were talking about that earlier, is that,

30:35.550 --> 30:38.310
you know, every person who puts on the headset takes,

30:38.310 --> 30:40.560
I don't know, a good couple three minutes

30:40.560 --> 30:42.330
to get the settings right.

30:42.330 --> 30:43.710
And so I think that's one of the things.

30:43.710 --> 30:47.010
And in general the headsets are very heavy and bulky

30:47.010 --> 30:49.890
and you look kind of weird wearing them.

30:49.890 --> 30:52.050
So, you know, I kind of wish

30:52.050 --> 30:54.600
that my daughter was wearing the meta,

30:54.600 --> 30:56.490
you know, the glasses, the Ray-Bans,

30:56.490 --> 30:58.020
and those look a lot better

30:58.020 --> 30:59.400
'cause they look kind of like the glasses

30:59.400 --> 31:01.980
that I wear in my profile picture there.

31:01.980 --> 31:05.400
So, but yeah, I think they're gonna get smaller, but yeah.

31:05.400 --> 31:07.280
But we use them and we love them and-

31:07.280 --> 31:10.140
<v ->And I think you were an early user of Apple Vision Pro,</v>

31:10.140 --> 31:11.190
if I remember correctly.
<v ->We were.</v>

31:11.190 --> 31:14.250
Yeah. And we've gone to Apple a couple times

31:14.250 --> 31:19.170
and trying to collaborate with them on, you know, like

31:19.170 --> 31:21.330
they often ask, why don't you use them at the dealerships?

31:21.330 --> 31:23.400
I'm like, well, because we can't spend five minutes

31:23.400 --> 31:25.650
setting up the headsets for each customer

31:25.650 --> 31:27.090
that walks into the dealership.

31:27.090 --> 31:27.923
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->You know?</v>

31:27.923 --> 31:31.410
So they're aware of that, but also we're working with,

31:31.410 --> 31:33.180
you know, they're gonna help us

31:33.180 --> 31:36.930
sort of with that 360 video production.

31:36.930 --> 31:39.660
So I think that's the kind of creative output

31:39.660 --> 31:42.000
that Apple's really known for and it's,

31:42.000 --> 31:43.397
it really is spectacular.

31:43.397 --> 31:44.230
<v ->Yeah. These are exciting types.</v>

31:44.230 --> 31:45.063
<v ->Yeah. Yeah.</v>

31:45.063 --> 31:46.770
<v ->Either Harvey and or Peter,</v>

31:46.770 --> 31:48.990
any perspectives on the use

31:48.990 --> 31:50.400
of these spatial computing headsets,

31:50.400 --> 31:53.670
whether it be Apple or other and the impact that's had

31:53.670 --> 31:56.133
in spatial computing efforts that you're doing?

31:57.120 --> 31:59.850
<v ->Yeah, so I took these out on purpose.</v>

31:59.850 --> 32:01.470
These are the meta glasses.

32:01.470 --> 32:05.640
And the way I see it is the culture now is accepting this

32:05.640 --> 32:07.710
before they're like, oh those are weird.

32:07.710 --> 32:09.780
I know my wife hates it when I buy stuff like this,

32:09.780 --> 32:12.450
but the more they look real, the more she appreciates it.

32:12.450 --> 32:14.580
So now we're seeing a cultural shift

32:14.580 --> 32:16.380
as these things get better and better,

32:16.380 --> 32:18.780
it's allowing all of us to interact with this.

32:18.780 --> 32:21.270
In the near future, I have my own digital twin

32:21.270 --> 32:23.490
on my books singing, interviews is all there.

32:23.490 --> 32:25.410
I would be able to pair that to this

32:25.410 --> 32:26.490
and then have a conversation.

32:26.490 --> 32:27.570
So when you ask me a question,

32:27.570 --> 32:29.250
I can say, hey, let's ask my digital twin.

32:29.250 --> 32:30.930
And then you're interacting with it.

32:30.930 --> 32:32.490
And so that's where we are

32:32.490 --> 32:35.520
and it's only gonna get better for all of us.

32:35.520 --> 32:36.353
<v ->Funny Harvey,</v>

32:36.353 --> 32:38.420
I always thought that those were your glasses.

32:39.390 --> 32:40.223
Peter?

32:40.223 --> 32:43.140
<v ->Yeah. Maybe I build on this, this is a perfect segue is,</v>

32:43.140 --> 32:46.800
so today, if you think about spatial computing

32:46.800 --> 32:50.190
in a way that if we say XR or or VR,

32:50.190 --> 32:53.460
it's pretty much limited to engineering, right?

32:53.460 --> 32:56.070
This is where most of the time you find it.

32:56.070 --> 32:58.140
But the question is how can we democratize it?

32:58.140 --> 33:00.360
And the reason that why that's not happening is

33:00.360 --> 33:02.340
because they're too heavy, they're too big

33:02.340 --> 33:05.490
and they're just not convenient to wear the whole day.

33:05.490 --> 33:07.950
However, exactly what Harvey has shown,

33:07.950 --> 33:11.190
you don't need to have always the display, right?

33:11.190 --> 33:13.740
So, in this case, right now we are,

33:13.740 --> 33:15.900
we are exploring the idea.

33:15.900 --> 33:16.800
We launched something

33:16.800 --> 33:18.570
which is called the industrial copilot.

33:18.570 --> 33:19.840
So one of the issues is

33:20.820 --> 33:22.890
we don't find factory workers anymore.

33:22.890 --> 33:24.450
The average tenure of the factory worker

33:24.450 --> 33:26.400
has dropped from 20 years down to three years.

33:26.400 --> 33:29.970
People are not wanting to work in a factory.

33:29.970 --> 33:31.920
And the ones that have been working in the factory,

33:31.920 --> 33:33.360
they're leaving the factory.

33:33.360 --> 33:36.060
So because they're retiring. So it's a big issue.

33:36.060 --> 33:39.720
So knowledge is walking out of the door.

33:39.720 --> 33:41.460
So that's why we've been developing

33:41.460 --> 33:43.500
an industrial copilot together with Microsoft

33:43.500 --> 33:45.720
that helps you to set up machines, to rectify them,

33:45.720 --> 33:46.553
all that stuff, right?

33:46.553 --> 33:48.930
So it's a human, it's like your smart colleague

33:48.930 --> 33:52.680
that helps us people in order to get this stuff done.

33:52.680 --> 33:56.130
The question always is the last mile, the interface,

33:56.130 --> 33:58.320
what's that human machine interface there

33:58.320 --> 33:59.940
and how you gonna perceive that?

33:59.940 --> 34:01.140
Now, imagine this one

34:01.140 --> 34:04.680
because the Ray-Bans are not having a display,

34:04.680 --> 34:06.270
but they have audio.

34:06.270 --> 34:07.650
So, and they have a microphone.

34:07.650 --> 34:08.940
So, and you can stream it.

34:08.940 --> 34:10.050
So you can look at the machine

34:10.050 --> 34:13.260
and say, hey, what about this machine?

34:13.260 --> 34:15.870
Can you tell me what are the steps to rectify it?

34:15.870 --> 34:17.430
And then if you have your AI,

34:17.430 --> 34:20.250
you don't have any human in there in that loop,

34:20.250 --> 34:22.920
it just tells you acoustically of,

34:22.920 --> 34:25.260
you know, take step 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

34:25.260 --> 34:27.420
That is gonna be a game changer

34:27.420 --> 34:30.633
simply because it really solves one of the big issues

34:30.633 --> 34:33.180
that is knowledge on the factory worker space.

34:33.180 --> 34:35.160
And with that it becomes more ubiquitous,

34:35.160 --> 34:36.780
it's not just limited to engineering,

34:36.780 --> 34:40.170
but pretty much you can think of it being everywhere.

34:40.170 --> 34:41.010
<v ->Thank you.</v>

34:41.010 --> 34:42.840
Harvey, I'm gonna give you just a couple minutes.

34:42.840 --> 34:43.890
I'd ask you to be concise

34:43.890 --> 34:45.960
'cause this could be an hour discussion,

34:45.960 --> 34:47.733
but share with us past, present,

34:48.690 --> 34:50.760
past, current and future roles

34:50.760 --> 34:52.140
of spatial computing and healthcare.

34:52.140 --> 34:56.400
I know that my sister just had a surgery on her back,

34:56.400 --> 34:58.290
spinal surgery in Boston

34:58.290 --> 35:02.880
and they used VR headsets to put the screws in to her spine

35:02.880 --> 35:03.713
to make sure

35:03.713 --> 35:06.420
that they were not getting the soft bone but good bone.

35:06.420 --> 35:08.760
So I know this stuff is happening every single day

35:08.760 --> 35:11.400
and every single healthcare, you know, capability.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.680
But share with us your, where you think it's headed.

35:13.680 --> 35:17.400
<v ->Yeah, so in the past these things were huge, heavy,</v>

35:17.400 --> 35:18.360
long lag time.

35:18.360 --> 35:19.770
You would talk to it and you'd wait forever,

35:19.770 --> 35:21.600
the graphics were horrible.

35:21.600 --> 35:24.090
And so, you know, medical students was like,

35:24.090 --> 35:25.340
I don't wanna wear those.

35:26.190 --> 35:27.780
Apple Vision Pro, I'm biased.

35:27.780 --> 35:28.740
You can see through it.

35:28.740 --> 35:30.900
I can do a procedure like you were saying just now

35:30.900 --> 35:33.600
and I can go through and have the x-ray

35:33.600 --> 35:35.130
and have everything up in virtual world

35:35.130 --> 35:36.660
and tell me exactly what it is.

35:36.660 --> 35:38.940
And as I'm getting older, my eyes aren't the greatest.

35:38.940 --> 35:41.040
So now I can explore my visual feel

35:41.040 --> 35:43.890
and make it 50 times bigger and I can really get in there.

35:43.890 --> 35:46.920
And then now in the future, going back to this point,

35:46.920 --> 35:48.930
this is gonna get smaller and smaller.

35:48.930 --> 35:51.030
And for you guys you could take a picture.

35:51.030 --> 35:52.230
Like right now I could have these on

35:52.230 --> 35:54.180
and say, hey, I gotta take my meds at 12

35:54.180 --> 35:55.320
and it'll remind me tomorrow

35:55.320 --> 35:58.050
that at 12 it's time to take my meds in the near future.

35:58.050 --> 35:59.070
I mean it already has it now,

35:59.070 --> 36:01.367
I can put up some food and eat and take a picture

36:01.367 --> 36:03.030
and be like, how many calories is this?

36:03.030 --> 36:04.110
Is this good for my cholesterol?

36:04.110 --> 36:05.880
Is this good for my hypertension?

36:05.880 --> 36:07.230
And so that's where we're headed.

36:07.230 --> 36:09.450
And in the near future all of that'll be seamless

36:09.450 --> 36:10.603
and it'll be integrated with AI

36:10.603 --> 36:13.263
and it'll be in here and it'll be back and forth.

36:14.220 --> 36:15.780
<v ->Yeah, I think it would be fair to say</v>

36:15.780 --> 36:19.390
that we're really at the beginning of the medical evolution

36:20.340 --> 36:24.030
that the way doctors and do not just procedures

36:24.030 --> 36:26.970
but testing and imaging and all kinds of things

36:26.970 --> 36:29.010
is gonna be very, very different.

36:29.010 --> 36:30.270
So this is very exciting times.

36:30.270 --> 36:31.800
Thank you for sharing that with us.

36:31.800 --> 36:33.930
Okay, I want you to get your questions ready

36:33.930 --> 36:34.860
if you have questions

36:34.860 --> 36:37.110
I can't see very well from the front here,

36:37.110 --> 36:39.210
but think of some questions if you have them.

36:39.210 --> 36:40.950
And I'll, raise your hand nice and high

36:40.950 --> 36:42.510
and I'll get to you not just yet though,

36:42.510 --> 36:44.400
I just want to get my last question in

36:44.400 --> 36:46.080
and then I'm gonna open it to the audience, okay?

36:46.080 --> 36:48.750
But I see at least two of you that have braved yourselves

36:48.750 --> 36:50.550
to get ready for the question.

36:50.550 --> 36:53.020
Let me ask you guys to be a little bit

36:54.270 --> 36:56.340
in a front leadership mode.

36:56.340 --> 36:59.883
We meet here next year 2026.

37:00.900 --> 37:03.660
And in your humble observation,

37:03.660 --> 37:06.180
how do you see spatial computing

37:06.180 --> 37:08.910
playing out over the next 12 months?

37:08.910 --> 37:11.400
And Peter, if you will, I'll start with my left.

37:11.400 --> 37:13.800
<v ->Yeah, I was thinking a little bit of where this is going.</v>

37:13.800 --> 37:17.550
Number one is to make it not limited to engineering,

37:17.550 --> 37:20.220
but really to all the other departments that we wanna see.

37:20.220 --> 37:21.210
So I think we're gonna see

37:21.210 --> 37:23.760
that more use cases demonstrating real value

37:23.760 --> 37:25.800
of where you can make that work.

37:25.800 --> 37:28.380
And then also from a new development perspective,

37:28.380 --> 37:32.340
I expect these devices becoming smaller, lighter,

37:32.340 --> 37:34.623
and in particular AI powered.

37:35.739 --> 37:38.520
AI powered in many ways from generative design

37:38.520 --> 37:40.410
to as a coworker helping you

37:40.410 --> 37:42.660
to navigate all of these pieces.

37:42.660 --> 37:44.340
So you're gonna see more of blends

37:44.340 --> 37:47.190
of different technologies, right? Coming together.

37:47.190 --> 37:49.770
And actually the place where that is gonna be

37:49.770 --> 37:52.410
is always at the human machine interface

37:52.410 --> 37:54.600
and I believe that's gonna be the place.

37:54.600 --> 37:56.340
<v ->Excellent. Jane?</v>

37:56.340 --> 37:57.333
<v ->Yeah, I agree.</v>

37:58.530 --> 38:02.070
I think OpenAI celebrated their one year birthday

38:02.070 --> 38:03.120
not too long ago.

38:03.120 --> 38:06.270
So I imagine this next year is gonna be

38:06.270 --> 38:08.673
leaps and bounds moving forward,

38:09.720 --> 38:12.480
but I think yeah, there's gonna be,

38:12.480 --> 38:15.690
you know, we talk about spatial computing as kind of like

38:15.690 --> 38:17.490
the pixels are so small you can't tell the difference

38:17.490 --> 38:20.190
between being in the physical world or the virtual world.

38:20.190 --> 38:23.970
And I think in our experience and immersive experiences

38:23.970 --> 38:26.490
that we're gonna provide with our cars,

38:26.490 --> 38:28.590
I think people are gonna get more and more comfortable

38:28.590 --> 38:29.730
with that idea

38:29.730 --> 38:33.150
of kind of being in both the physical and the virtual world.

38:33.150 --> 38:34.500
<v ->I can't wait. It's so exciting.</v>

38:34.500 --> 38:35.400
<v ->Yeah, it's very exciting.</v>

38:35.400 --> 38:36.233
<v ->I have to tell you,</v>

38:36.233 --> 38:39.180
I'm an old Jaguar racer, collector

38:39.180 --> 38:42.480
and, you know, car rallies and so forth and they're,

38:42.480 --> 38:43.890
they've waited an awfully long time

38:43.890 --> 38:45.030
to get to the new generation,

38:45.030 --> 38:46.620
but it's gonna be very exciting

38:46.620 --> 38:47.849
how the whole industry moves forward.

38:47.849 --> 38:48.690
<v ->Right. And if you wanna pretend</v>

38:48.690 --> 38:51.090
that you're driving an old classic car, you can do that too.

38:51.090 --> 38:52.620
<v ->Oh, thank goodness.</v>

38:52.620 --> 38:54.400
Harvey, where are we at 12 months from now?

38:54.400 --> 38:57.600
<v ->Yeah. I see education being huge.</v>

38:57.600 --> 38:59.850
The more we educate ourselves on a healthcare,

38:59.850 --> 39:01.620
I call it their healthcare IQ will improve.

39:01.620 --> 39:03.780
And when that improves, our longevity will improve,

39:03.780 --> 39:05.130
our quality of life will improve.

39:05.130 --> 39:06.630
So I see these devices helping

39:06.630 --> 39:08.010
my case in point that I just told you

39:08.010 --> 39:10.170
about the medication reminder.

39:10.170 --> 39:12.750
The second part is this is gonna be my friend,

39:12.750 --> 39:13.800
it's gonna be AI.

39:13.800 --> 39:15.450
I can have a conversation when I'm driving.

39:15.450 --> 39:18.180
I can say, hey, my doctor said I have high cholesterol,

39:18.180 --> 39:19.140
what does that mean?

39:19.140 --> 39:20.400
And I'm just having a conversation

39:20.400 --> 39:22.110
and it's going through my glasses and it's telling me

39:22.110 --> 39:24.120
and I'm educating and I'm improving and I'm like,

39:24.120 --> 39:26.370
okay, probably should take my cholesterol medicine,

39:26.370 --> 39:27.600
I get it now.

39:27.600 --> 39:29.340
The second part is what's with the VR.

39:29.340 --> 39:32.010
Imagine if I got your x-rays CAT scan, put it on and say,

39:32.010 --> 39:33.540
hey, we're gonna go through your heart right now

39:33.540 --> 39:34.830
and I'm gonna show you your arteries.

39:34.830 --> 39:36.090
And if you're not taking your medicine,

39:36.090 --> 39:38.670
this is what's going on in your heart,

39:38.670 --> 39:40.470
are you likely to take your medicine?

39:40.470 --> 39:42.090
Probably.

39:42.090 --> 39:42.923
<v ->Good, thank you.</v>

39:42.923 --> 39:45.483
So I had two questions. I saw one up front. Yes.

39:48.660 --> 39:50.070
<v ->This question is more so directed</v>

39:50.070 --> 39:51.810
towards Jane and Dr. Harvey

39:51.810 --> 39:55.140
and that was why specifically the Vision Pro

39:55.140 --> 39:57.360
and not something like the Quest 3.

39:57.360 --> 39:58.193
And as a follow up,

39:58.193 --> 40:02.730
this question is more so directed towards you and Dr. Harvey

40:02.730 --> 40:07.380
and that with regards to AI and leveraging in your field,

40:07.380 --> 40:10.740
there is a lot of proprietary and confidential data.

40:10.740 --> 40:14.970
How do you foresee legal and privacy implications?

40:14.970 --> 40:16.710
Which regards to using it for training?

40:16.710 --> 40:18.450
<v ->Yeah, I'll be quick.</v>

40:18.450 --> 40:19.560
I like the Apple Vision Pro

40:19.560 --> 40:21.360
'cause it's a high retinal display

40:21.360 --> 40:23.130
and you can see through it and there's not lag time

40:23.130 --> 40:25.080
and I don't feel like it's there with the Meta.

40:25.080 --> 40:26.580
As far as the legal question,

40:26.580 --> 40:28.950
the way around it would be using more edge technology

40:28.950 --> 40:31.080
and creating it in your own interest server

40:31.080 --> 40:32.130
so that it's there.

40:32.130 --> 40:33.840
And then with the data, that's the big piece,

40:33.840 --> 40:35.520
who owns the data, how do you get it?

40:35.520 --> 40:37.710
But assuming that you do like federated learning

40:37.710 --> 40:40.950
and we can talk later about how you could do that legally.

40:40.950 --> 40:42.000
<v ->All right.</v>
<v ->Oh.</v>

40:42.000 --> 40:43.080
<v ->Go ahead, Jane.</v>

40:43.080 --> 40:45.960
<v ->For Apple Vision Pro, I think for me personally,</v>

40:45.960 --> 40:47.970
it is the, being able to see through it

40:47.970 --> 40:49.320
and you have better peripheral vision,

40:49.320 --> 40:51.090
so it feels more natural.

40:51.090 --> 40:54.540
But also Apple is I think the best partner

40:54.540 --> 40:57.960
when you're heading into creative endeavors.

40:57.960 --> 41:01.110
I think they always have been and they still are.

41:01.110 --> 41:04.140
<v ->Peter, any observation on the privacy,</v>

41:04.140 --> 41:07.830
you're European privacy is at a higher level of concern

41:07.830 --> 41:09.600
to most Europe, to most Europeans.

41:09.600 --> 41:13.410
I'm married to an Italian, she reminds me of that daily.

41:13.410 --> 41:16.800
But I'd be just curious the questions on everybody's mind

41:16.800 --> 41:21.179
as more data gets delivered, as more data gets inferenced

41:21.179 --> 41:25.050
and is made available and is made available with AI

41:25.050 --> 41:27.390
and there's all kinds of things you can do with the data,

41:27.390 --> 41:30.030
where does this whole privacy, where are we going?

41:30.030 --> 41:31.560
<v Peter>Well, I mean,</v>

41:31.560 --> 41:33.000
I'm not sure how much time you wanna take.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.327
<v Barton>Yeah, exactly.</v>

41:34.327 --> 41:36.180
<v ->The good news there on our end</v>

41:36.180 --> 41:37.937
is since we end in industrial world,

41:37.937 --> 41:40.179
we are not using so much privacy

41:40.179 --> 41:43.020
in terms of personal related data.

41:43.020 --> 41:45.750
So forced machine data, so that's very simple,

41:45.750 --> 41:47.130
but it becomes very complex

41:47.130 --> 41:48.930
the minute we talk about, of course, healthcare data.

41:48.930 --> 41:51.600
This is where I spend most of my career also.

41:51.600 --> 41:53.280
It's a very sensitive topic.

41:53.280 --> 41:56.700
I guess we need to have an own panel on this conversation.

41:56.700 --> 41:58.560
But to go, going back to your question

41:58.560 --> 42:01.800
exactly as Harvey also said is for one, it's edge computing,

42:01.800 --> 42:02.983
this is the way how to go about it.

42:02.983 --> 42:05.100
Reinforcement learning, this is fine.

42:05.100 --> 42:07.320
Federated learning is that's the way

42:07.320 --> 42:10.770
how we usually treat that based on a pre-trained model.

42:10.770 --> 42:13.595
And that's usually working pretty well.

42:13.595 --> 42:15.450
<v Barton>Okay. I'm taking just one more question.</v>

42:15.450 --> 42:16.283
I know there's many,

42:16.283 --> 42:17.670
you can come up to the panel afterwards.

42:17.670 --> 42:20.120
Gentlemen right here. Yes, please. Nice and loud.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.260
<v ->Question for Peter, please.</v>

42:22.260 --> 42:25.811
And your experience with digital twins for factories-

42:25.811 --> 42:26.644
<v ->Yeah.</v>

42:26.644 --> 42:30.060
<v ->And people solving problems in that virtual environment.</v>

42:30.060 --> 42:32.667
What are your top three HMI challenges,

42:32.667 --> 42:35.348
human machine interface challenges?

42:35.348 --> 42:36.330
<v ->All right.</v>

42:36.330 --> 42:38.663
Challenge number one is the devices that are out there

42:38.663 --> 42:40.650
are usually too big, too large.

42:40.650 --> 42:45.390
And if you are a factory, let's say manager,

42:45.390 --> 42:47.490
I mean they drive productivity every day.

42:47.490 --> 42:48.930
If you come there and say, you know what?

42:48.930 --> 42:51.840
Take the device for thousand $4,000, they throw you out.

42:51.840 --> 42:53.370
So that's not working, right?

42:53.370 --> 42:55.440
So therefore you have to take a few other devices

42:55.440 --> 42:58.290
that are less complicated, that are more sturdy

42:58.290 --> 43:00.060
and that actually really can be used.

43:00.060 --> 43:01.380
It's number one.

43:01.380 --> 43:05.970
Number two is, there is still a lack of education

43:05.970 --> 43:07.800
where people are a little bit reluctant

43:07.800 --> 43:09.087
about what does it really mean and,

43:09.087 --> 43:11.730
and how do do does it, do we go about it?

43:11.730 --> 43:13.160
And number three is,

43:13.160 --> 43:18.160
is very often that the way we look at the use cases,

43:18.420 --> 43:21.660
and usually that is about how we set up machines and so on,

43:21.660 --> 43:24.360
the tutorials, the data is not there yet.

43:24.360 --> 43:26.790
So that's the stuff that we have to build

43:26.790 --> 43:29.340
in order to make this useful, right?

43:29.340 --> 43:30.173
But that's coming.

43:30.173 --> 43:32.550
So, I'm sure that the 12 month question,

43:32.550 --> 43:35.490
we are very well on our way to do just that.

43:35.490 --> 43:38.010
<v ->Last year at the Siemens keynote,</v>

43:38.010 --> 43:42.240
the CEO Roland Bush said that,

43:42.240 --> 43:44.160
I don't remember the year he said it in, but he said,

43:44.160 --> 43:45.870
but within the next few years,

43:45.870 --> 43:47.970
every object will have a digital twin.

43:47.970 --> 43:49.710
I just remember that distinctly in my head.

43:49.710 --> 43:51.600
Okay, let me make a couple of references

43:51.600 --> 43:53.370
and we'll bring it to a close.

43:53.370 --> 43:54.690
Ladies and gentlemen in the back,

43:54.690 --> 43:56.760
I have no idea, my machine up front is freaking out,

43:56.760 --> 44:00.753
but I just wanna go to this slide right here if I may.

44:01.590 --> 44:03.390
That didn't seem to, there we go, okay.

44:03.390 --> 44:05.280
So I wanna just give you three references,

44:05.280 --> 44:07.920
two references that we alluded to, Tim alluded to this.

44:07.920 --> 44:12.090
This is the spatial AI and spatial resource center,

44:12.090 --> 44:15.990
greater than 300 AI and spatial computing use cases,

44:15.990 --> 44:18.420
including Siemens, including current companies

44:18.420 --> 44:19.482
and medical industries,

44:19.482 --> 44:22.950
it's a wealth of knowledge and it's free of charge.

44:22.950 --> 44:24.270
It's our work, Tim and mine,

44:24.270 --> 44:26.670
but it's many, many other scholarly people

44:26.670 --> 44:29.550
that have joined and provided information and insight.

44:29.550 --> 44:31.140
I would strongly recommend you go there,

44:31.140 --> 44:33.750
there are videos more than 150 videos.

44:33.750 --> 44:35.640
It's really a great resource center

44:35.640 --> 44:37.020
for those that might be interested.

44:37.020 --> 44:40.500
Tim and I have been doing a podcast since February, 2023.

44:40.500 --> 44:44.880
We have I think 30 or 32 episodes now, very interesting.

44:44.880 --> 44:46.470
They never last more than 25 minutes.

44:46.470 --> 44:48.510
What we do is we take a company,

44:48.510 --> 44:51.360
we go deep and we look at how they're applying

44:51.360 --> 44:53.460
some of the spatial computing technologies.

44:53.460 --> 44:54.480
If you'd like to get in touch

44:54.480 --> 44:56.250
with any of the folks on the panel,

44:56.250 --> 44:59.370
here's just a quick, they're all on LinkedIn but you,

44:59.370 --> 45:00.435
and they're not very complicated

45:00.435 --> 45:01.890
'cause their first name and last name.

45:01.890 --> 45:05.280
But take a picture and that might help you moving forward.

45:05.280 --> 45:06.840
Let me say the following,

45:06.840 --> 45:09.090
you know, I've been around for a long time

45:09.090 --> 45:10.950
and I've chaired many a panel

45:10.950 --> 45:12.650
and for that matter, a conference.

45:13.710 --> 45:17.670
Rarely do I get a panel as first of all diversified,

45:17.670 --> 45:20.670
but as distinguished as this group of executives.

45:20.670 --> 45:22.350
You know, I want to thank you folks.

45:22.350 --> 45:23.490
You are in your own right,

45:23.490 --> 45:24.973
very pleasant and enjoyable people.

45:24.973 --> 45:26.520
I've gotten to know you a little bit,

45:26.520 --> 45:27.780
we've got to know each other

45:27.780 --> 45:29.610
and that's what life is all about.

45:29.610 --> 45:30.990
But on a professional side,

45:30.990 --> 45:33.780
I just think that you bring such a wealth of knowledge

45:33.780 --> 45:37.410
and display it and discuss it

45:37.410 --> 45:39.810
in such an easy to understand manner

45:39.810 --> 45:40.980
that I just want to thank you

45:40.980 --> 45:42.870
and I'd like you to put your hands together

45:42.870 --> 45:44.470
and thank the panelists as well.

45:45.767 --> 45:47.978
(attendees applauding)

45:47.978 --> 45:50.561
(upbeat music)
