00:00.598 --> 00:05.515
(dynamic music)

2
00:10.290 --> 00:12.030
<v ->Thanks for joining us for this panel today</v>

3
00:12.030 --> 00:15.360
on software-defined vehicles.

4
00:15.360 --> 00:18.630
If you walk the show floor elsewhere in this building,

5
00:18.630 --> 00:21.870
you will see lots of examples of software-defined vehicles

6
00:21.870 --> 00:24.750
and we're gonna get into the details of what that

7
00:24.750 --> 00:26.940
actually means and what the implications are in a moment.

8
00:26.940 --> 00:30.060
But, I'd like to ask my panelists

9
00:30.060 --> 00:32.160
to introduce themselves.

10
00:32.160 --> 00:35.640
I should tell you that I'm Eric Savitz.

11
00:35.640 --> 00:39.210
I'm the editor-in-chief at General Motors.

12
00:39.210 --> 00:42.840
I've been at CES many, many years in various guise,

13
00:42.840 --> 00:45.570
as most recently as a reporter for Barron's Magazine.

14
00:45.570 --> 00:47.010
And I've done other things as well

15
00:47.010 --> 00:49.083
but, excited about this new role.

16
00:50.010 --> 00:51.840
Fern, do you want to kick us off

17
00:51.840 --> 00:54.150
and tell people who you are.

18
00:54.150 --> 00:55.500
<v ->Yep, I can do that.</v>

19
00:55.500 --> 00:56.820
So, good afternoon everyone.

20
00:56.820 --> 01:00.540
My name is Fern Yoon, and I lead an automotive systems

21
01:00.540 --> 01:03.450
engineering and marketing team at Texas Instruments,

22
01:03.450 --> 01:06.930
one of the suppliers that supply into automotive

23
01:06.930 --> 01:09.933
and SDV is a big topic for us.

24
01:13.050 --> 01:13.893
<v ->I go next?</v>

25
01:15.060 --> 01:16.023
Good afternoon.

26
01:18.420 --> 01:19.872
Oh, okay.

27
01:19.872 --> 01:21.990
(audience laughs)

28
01:21.990 --> 01:22.860
Okay.

29
01:22.860 --> 01:24.960
My name is Aruna Anand.

30
01:24.960 --> 01:26.700
I'm the president and CEO

31
01:26.700 --> 01:29.883
of Continental Automotive for North America.

32
01:31.410 --> 01:35.160
And Continental, as you might all know, many of you know,

33
01:35.160 --> 01:38.970
has been a longstanding, is a longstanding leader

34
01:38.970 --> 01:40.920
in the automotive industry,

35
01:40.920 --> 01:45.510
and we are really proud of our role

36
01:45.510 --> 01:48.360
in defining the future of mobility.

37
01:48.360 --> 01:50.460
And thank you again for this opportunity

38
01:50.460 --> 01:55.110
to present everything about SDV in the next,

39
01:55.110 --> 01:58.203
I would say, 38 minutes.

40
01:59.730 --> 02:00.691
<v ->Yeah.</v>

41
02:00.691 --> 02:01.524
Also one, welcome from my side.

42
02:01.524 --> 02:02.357
I'm Peter.

43
02:02.357 --> 02:03.450
I'm running the automotive business

44
02:03.450 --> 02:06.750
for Infinian Technology, that's a semiconductor company,

45
02:06.750 --> 02:09.240
worldwide leader, and we are known

46
02:09.240 --> 02:12.183
that we make cars clean, safe, and smart.

47
02:14.250 --> 02:15.083
<v ->Good afternoon.</v>

48
02:15.083 --> 02:16.560
My name is Magnus Oestberg.

49
02:16.560 --> 02:19.740
I'm leading the, what we call the Mercedes-Benz

50
02:19.740 --> 02:22.620
Operating System out of Stuttgart.

51
02:22.620 --> 02:24.900
And excited to be back here at CES

52
02:24.900 --> 02:27.390
and talk about software-defined vehicles.

53
02:27.390 --> 02:28.223
<v ->Okay.</v>

54
02:28.223 --> 02:31.290
So, you know, there's three big tech trends that you'll see

55
02:31.290 --> 02:33.963
as you walk around the floor in the West Hall.

56
02:35.670 --> 02:38.070
One of those is electrification, EVs.

57
02:38.070 --> 02:41.820
One of those is autonomy and assisted driving.

58
02:41.820 --> 02:44.040
But, the one that's sort of the most tricky

59
02:44.040 --> 02:46.470
to define is this one, right?

60
02:46.470 --> 02:48.660
Is software-defined vehicles.

61
02:48.660 --> 02:53.103
And it covers a lot of ground, it touches on the other two.

62
02:54.780 --> 02:57.690
And I would argue, might actually be the most interesting

63
02:57.690 --> 02:59.610
in the long run, most important long run.

64
02:59.610 --> 03:02.520
And Magnus, in preparation for this,

65
03:02.520 --> 03:04.320
we talked a little bit about

66
03:04.320 --> 03:06.663
what is actually included in that umbrella.

67
03:07.560 --> 03:11.700
Tell me, kick us off by telling me how would you define

68
03:11.700 --> 03:13.350
even what we're talking about?

69
03:13.350 --> 03:16.083
What are we including in that umbrella?

70
03:17.070 --> 03:20.970
<v ->Well, the way I normally answer that question is that</v>

71
03:20.970 --> 03:25.230
at Mercedes-Benz and also at companies

72
03:25.230 --> 03:28.860
that has been around producing these beautiful objects

73
03:28.860 --> 03:33.600
for a very long time, they were in the past static objects.

74
03:33.600 --> 03:35.820
They were objects that were beautiful,

75
03:35.820 --> 03:37.170
they were wonderful to consume,

76
03:37.170 --> 03:38.760
they were wonderful to drive in,

77
03:38.760 --> 03:40.680
but, they did not change over time

78
03:40.680 --> 03:43.740
for while you were owning the vehicle

79
03:43.740 --> 03:47.030
and while you were actually then having it

80
03:47.030 --> 03:48.690
as maybe a second vehicle.

81
03:48.690 --> 03:51.660
And what software-defined vehicle really does

82
03:51.660 --> 03:54.390
at Mercedes-Benz is that we have separated

83
03:54.390 --> 03:58.590
hardware from software, so that you can really redefine

84
03:58.590 --> 04:01.410
and change your vehicle over time

85
04:01.410 --> 04:04.020
with introducing new software, new content,

86
04:04.020 --> 04:05.487
new experience in the vehicle.

87
04:05.487 --> 04:10.140
And that involves so much more than just the vehicle itself.

88
04:10.140 --> 04:13.620
It's also the entire logistical infrastructure.

89
04:13.620 --> 04:17.310
It's also how we source components

90
04:17.310 --> 04:20.550
and how we set out the digital infrastructure to be able

91
04:20.550 --> 04:23.820
to have an ongoing data pipeline

92
04:23.820 --> 04:26.880
to the vehicles from the start of development

93
04:26.880 --> 04:29.580
through the production system lines,

94
04:29.580 --> 04:32.220
and also then in our dealers and aftercare,

95
04:32.220 --> 04:34.380
and of course, continuously with the customer.

96
04:34.380 --> 04:38.910
So, it's that major separation of hardware and software

97
04:38.910 --> 04:40.650
that for me is the major definition

98
04:40.650 --> 04:42.030
of software-defined vehicle.

99
04:42.030 --> 04:44.520
<v ->I think one of the interesting elements,</v>

100
04:44.520 --> 04:47.050
kind of ironic elements of this story is that

101
04:48.120 --> 04:50.040
if you're gonna create a software-defined vehicle,

102
04:50.040 --> 04:52.080
it starts with redefining what the hardware is

103
04:52.080 --> 04:53.190
that's in the vehicle, right?

104
04:53.190 --> 04:57.609
So Aruna, you guys have a big role to play,

105
04:57.609 --> 05:01.020
have long provided systems to OEMs

106
05:01.020 --> 05:02.490
to do various things in the car.

107
05:02.490 --> 05:05.070
But, this changes the equation

108
05:05.070 --> 05:06.810
for what you need to supply.

109
05:06.810 --> 05:10.020
Give us a little feel for how this changes your business

110
05:10.020 --> 05:11.620
and how you see the opportunity.

111
05:12.750 --> 05:17.130
<v ->I mean, let's take a step back if you don't mind,</v>

112
05:17.130 --> 05:20.820
and figure out where are we today?

113
05:20.820 --> 05:24.270
And what does software-defined vehicles do for us today?

114
05:24.270 --> 05:27.870
And then, you would see the opportunities that it presents,

115
05:27.870 --> 05:31.530
not just for us, but for the entire supply chain.

116
05:31.530 --> 05:34.920
If you look at it predominantly, the pre-SDV

117
05:34.920 --> 05:39.210
or many of the cars today, you find that hardware

118
05:39.210 --> 05:43.500
and software, like Magnus mentioned, is very coupled.

119
05:43.500 --> 05:46.803
And suppliers generally provide a bundled solution.

120
05:47.760 --> 05:50.160
And the product development follows

121
05:50.160 --> 05:53.160
a defined lifecycle, right?

122
05:53.160 --> 05:56.040
And this is generally in line

123
05:56.040 --> 05:58.953
with the OEM milestone requirements.

124
06:00.000 --> 06:03.900
Then, the hardware itself in the pre-SDV

125
06:03.900 --> 06:06.810
or current for majority of the vehicles

126
06:06.810 --> 06:09.990
are purpose-built hardware,

127
06:09.990 --> 06:11.940
where the software that goes in

128
06:11.940 --> 06:14.670
is for that particular feature.

129
06:14.670 --> 06:17.340
And the hardware is only supporting that feature

130
06:17.340 --> 06:18.663
and it's purpose built.

131
06:20.160 --> 06:22.710
And imagine you have a feature

132
06:22.710 --> 06:25.020
or a function that you want to do

133
06:25.020 --> 06:27.720
that you wanna spread across multiple,

134
06:27.720 --> 06:29.943
across multiple modules in the vehicle.

135
06:31.200 --> 06:35.520
The system that we have doesn't lend that self easily.

136
06:35.520 --> 06:38.760
It becomes really complicated, expensive,

137
06:38.760 --> 06:40.770
and sometimes impossible.

138
06:40.770 --> 06:42.870
Leads to frustration.

139
06:42.870 --> 06:45.603
Okay, that's from the technical people.

140
06:46.440 --> 06:48.450
Let us think about this

141
06:48.450 --> 06:51.150
from an end consumer perspective, right?

142
06:51.150 --> 06:52.173
What do I see?

143
06:53.730 --> 06:56.700
Average in this country, in our country,

144
06:56.700 --> 06:59.823
is people own their cars at least for 12 years.

145
07:01.380 --> 07:05.760
And if we can update with new improved features,

146
07:05.760 --> 07:08.223
functions, safety items,

147
07:09.870 --> 07:12.630
they have a feeling and it is a right one,

148
07:12.630 --> 07:14.553
that the car becomes stale.

149
07:16.170 --> 07:19.500
And how do you keep that up?

150
07:19.500 --> 07:21.060
There's no option really.

151
07:21.060 --> 07:22.770
Or the options to freshen the car

152
07:22.770 --> 07:26.823
with new and improved features, becomes untenable.

153
07:29.100 --> 07:32.970
And another area is suppliers.

154
07:32.970 --> 07:35.880
OEMs also can't put in new features

155
07:35.880 --> 07:39.420
that help them to monetize all these feature sets

156
07:39.420 --> 07:40.830
that they're coming up with.

157
07:40.830 --> 07:42.270
So, that's the status majority.

158
07:42.270 --> 07:44.100
And we are trying to then move to a state

159
07:44.100 --> 07:45.647
where these don't happen,

160
07:45.647 --> 07:46.480
<v ->Right.</v>

161
07:46.480 --> 07:47.940
So, you raise an interesting question, right?

162
07:47.940 --> 07:48.870
Which is, you know,

163
07:48.870 --> 07:52.260
historically, you drove the car off the lot,

164
07:52.260 --> 07:56.160
if you wanted to improve the car, you know,

165
07:56.160 --> 07:58.860
you'd, well, like if you were at CS 20 years ago,

166
07:58.860 --> 08:01.140
the automotive section was a lot of aftermarket

167
08:01.140 --> 08:02.580
stereo equipment, right?
<v ->Correct.</v>

168
08:02.580 --> 08:04.650
<v ->Really big speakers that you could put in the back</v>

169
08:04.650 --> 08:07.170
of your, you know, truck to have tailgate, right?

170
08:07.170 --> 08:08.820
That was like the, after,

171
08:08.820 --> 08:11.400
that was the, you know, defined vehicle

172
08:11.400 --> 08:12.762
opportunity that you had, right?

173
08:12.762 --> 08:14.610
So, you're right.

174
08:14.610 --> 08:18.990
So, the part of this opportunity is over-the-air updates.

175
08:18.990 --> 08:21.270
You can update the software over time

176
08:21.270 --> 08:23.733
for a whole bunch of different things.

177
08:24.840 --> 08:28.470
But, it's complicated by the need to have the right

178
08:28.470 --> 08:30.360
underlying infrastructure.

179
08:30.360 --> 08:32.580
So, I'd love to get the, you know,

180
08:32.580 --> 08:35.750
we have two semiconductor players on the stage,

181
08:35.750 --> 08:39.840
and they sit at the heart of this problem, right?

182
08:39.840 --> 08:41.520
Because if you think about,

183
08:41.520 --> 08:45.060
say, a 5-year-old vehicle might have, I don't know,

184
08:45.060 --> 08:47.010
50 or a hundred microcontrollers.

185
08:47.010 --> 08:48.930
Like, one to keep your seats warm,

186
08:48.930 --> 08:50.430
and one to open the windows,

187
08:50.430 --> 08:52.770
and one to move the seat back and forward,

188
08:52.770 --> 08:54.690
and one to control the wafer blades, right?

189
08:54.690 --> 08:56.430
And they don't talk to each other

190
08:56.430 --> 08:58.200
and they're impossible to upgrade.

191
08:58.200 --> 09:03.200
So, how does this new scenario change the way

192
09:03.300 --> 09:06.690
you have to approach this market?

193
09:06.690 --> 09:08.070
Fern, do you wanna take it first?

194
09:08.070 --> 09:10.083
<v ->Yeah, I'll comment on that.</v>

195
09:11.070 --> 09:13.830
We see a shift in vehicle architecture,

196
09:13.830 --> 09:16.950
that I think is needed in order to enable

197
09:16.950 --> 09:18.780
software-defined vehicle, which is the shift

198
09:18.780 --> 09:21.720
from domain to zone architecture.

199
09:21.720 --> 09:24.360
And in that sense, in that case,

200
09:24.360 --> 09:27.270
you are now, let's call it consolidating

201
09:27.270 --> 09:29.760
a lot of the capabilities that, as you said,

202
09:29.760 --> 09:32.850
were discreet implementations

203
09:32.850 --> 09:37.650
that did not talk to one another into a more intelligent

204
09:37.650 --> 09:42.240
ECU that allows you to, I think, evolve over time.

205
09:42.240 --> 09:45.150
And the semiconductors that we develop

206
09:45.150 --> 09:49.710
is really the heart of what enables that technology

207
09:49.710 --> 09:51.900
from a hardware perspective.

208
09:51.900 --> 09:55.590
And the way we look at this evolution

209
09:55.590 --> 09:59.670
is, how do we continue to build hardware capabilities

210
09:59.670 --> 10:03.750
that allow, you know, customers, Tier 1,

211
10:03.750 --> 10:06.750
to continue to extend and add features

212
10:06.750 --> 10:09.400
continuously via software updates

213
10:10.260 --> 10:13.410
without necessarily having to redevelop

214
10:13.410 --> 10:16.260
the hardware piece of it all the time.

215
10:16.260 --> 10:18.630
There's also the aspect of,

216
10:18.630 --> 10:23.340
let's call it more intelligent edge nodes,

217
10:23.340 --> 10:26.490
areas where you don't necessarily have to replace

218
10:26.490 --> 10:30.360
the entire semiconductor infrastructure within the vehicle,

219
10:30.360 --> 10:32.790
but swapping out certain intelligent edge nodes

220
10:32.790 --> 10:36.180
as the technology progresses without overhauling

221
10:36.180 --> 10:38.190
the entire vehicle itself.

222
10:38.190 --> 10:39.840
And so, that certainly changes

223
10:39.840 --> 10:44.840
also I think, how OEMs look at model years and gen-to-gen.

224
10:45.270 --> 10:46.233
<v ->Right.</v>

225
10:46.233 --> 10:47.066
Okay.

226
10:47.066 --> 10:47.899
So, put a pin in that.

227
10:47.899 --> 10:48.732
We're gonna come back to that in a second.

228
10:48.732 --> 10:50.700
But Peter, why don't you tell us a little bit

229
10:50.700 --> 10:53.430
about how Infinian thinks about this?

230
10:53.430 --> 10:56.280
<v ->Yeah, I think, I mean, to repeat what you said,</v>

231
10:56.280 --> 10:58.950
in order to make a software-defined vehicle,

232
10:58.950 --> 11:00.183
you need to kind of,

233
11:01.260 --> 11:03.810
make the software agnostic from the hardware.

234
11:03.810 --> 11:07.050
In order to do so, I fully agreed

235
11:07.050 --> 11:09.840
you need to centralize things and bring

236
11:09.840 --> 11:11.430
cluster functions together.

237
11:11.430 --> 11:15.840
But by that, you automatically increase the complexity.

238
11:15.840 --> 11:20.100
And at the end, the consumer, the buyers of the car,

239
11:20.100 --> 11:23.100
they wanna trust the electronics.

240
11:23.100 --> 11:26.640
So, if you drive on a mountain road,

241
11:26.640 --> 11:28.980
you should trust that the car is not breaking down

242
11:28.980 --> 11:30.180
and you fall off the cliff.

243
11:30.180 --> 11:33.180
So therefore, this increasing complexity

244
11:33.180 --> 11:36.000
need to go hand-in-hand with a strong safety

245
11:36.000 --> 11:37.830
and cybersecurity aspect.

246
11:37.830 --> 11:40.350
And that's why it's very much important that,

247
11:40.350 --> 11:42.450
as you said, semiconductors are very much key

248
11:42.450 --> 11:46.500
because they will build these dependable electronics needed

249
11:46.500 --> 11:49.350
that the drivers can trust in the car.

250
11:49.350 --> 11:54.350
<v ->So, you know, you mentioned like, that the average car</v>

251
11:55.500 --> 11:58.740
has a lifespan of say of 10, 12 years, right?

252
11:58.740 --> 12:00.480
And that raises an interesting question

253
12:00.480 --> 12:02.280
when you think about the car as a platform, right?

254
12:02.280 --> 12:04.110
I always think about, how do you compare,

255
12:04.110 --> 12:06.360
like the car as a platform to say PC,

256
12:06.360 --> 12:08.310
or a mobile phone as a platform?

257
12:08.310 --> 12:10.560
Well, for one thing,

258
12:10.560 --> 12:12.000
you're not gonna keep your mobile phone for--

259
12:12.000 --> 12:14.110
Anyone, have a 12-year-old mobile phone with them?

260
12:14.110 --> 12:15.930
I don't think so.

261
12:15.930 --> 12:18.570
Or a 12-year-old laptop for that matter?

262
12:18.570 --> 12:19.650
Or would think that it would be

263
12:19.650 --> 12:21.300
kind of a cool to own one, you know?

264
12:21.300 --> 12:22.500
I don't think so, right?

265
12:23.700 --> 12:28.260
But, if you're expecting the car to last a decade,

266
12:28.260 --> 12:30.030
it poses interesting questions

267
12:30.030 --> 12:32.190
about your ability to keep up with the technology.

268
12:32.190 --> 12:34.770
So Magnus, how do you guys think about this?

269
12:34.770 --> 12:38.370
Like, how do you think about provisioning the car

270
12:38.370 --> 12:41.283
in a way that you can upgrade over time,

271
12:42.270 --> 12:43.950
but knowing that,

272
12:43.950 --> 12:46.410
we don't know exactly what the standard platform

273
12:46.410 --> 12:49.050
might look like in five years or 10 years.

274
12:49.050 --> 12:52.140
<v ->So, if we look at the customer experience</v>

275
12:52.140 --> 12:54.720
and the customer advantages first,

276
12:54.720 --> 12:59.720
we just said that we are separating hardware from software.

277
12:59.820 --> 13:01.680
So, that means that the software

278
13:01.680 --> 13:05.640
can definitely evolve over time, it can change.

279
13:05.640 --> 13:08.310
And for the first customer, the first users,

280
13:08.310 --> 13:11.070
and also, for us at Mercedes-Benz,

281
13:11.070 --> 13:14.370
this gives a possibility to tailor the experience

282
13:14.370 --> 13:17.610
to various regions, to various customer segment,

283
13:17.610 --> 13:19.140
and also to individuals.

284
13:19.140 --> 13:22.487
Which is that the first customer wave,

285
13:22.487 --> 13:25.140
using our products, a huge advantage

286
13:25.140 --> 13:29.010
because we see a tremendous difference

287
13:29.010 --> 13:33.480
between customer behaviors in different regions.

288
13:33.480 --> 13:38.100
So, our customer base in the eastern world,

289
13:38.100 --> 13:40.470
especially in China, is very young.

290
13:40.470 --> 13:41.370
It's very young.

291
13:41.370 --> 13:43.950
Their first car is an S-Class, for example.

292
13:43.950 --> 13:45.120
Very beautiful first car,

293
13:45.120 --> 13:48.993
but very unusual to have as a first car in this country.

294
13:50.583 --> 13:55.500
And they have a high digital native

295
13:55.500 --> 13:59.340
expectation with the level of apps

296
13:59.340 --> 14:00.960
and the level of integration,

297
14:00.960 --> 14:03.993
and the level of communication they expect from the vehicle.

298
14:04.830 --> 14:09.830
That same hardware, this beautiful S-Class, in Germany,

299
14:10.440 --> 14:14.070
is typically owned by a slightly older population

300
14:14.070 --> 14:17.670
that have a very different expectation from that vehicle.

301
14:17.670 --> 14:19.680
And so, that gives us the possibility

302
14:19.680 --> 14:23.250
to tailor this experience to different customer groups,

303
14:23.250 --> 14:24.810
which is the first advantage.

304
14:24.810 --> 14:27.930
The second advantage is when we then see that over time,

305
14:27.930 --> 14:31.860
over life, is that we can follow that expectation

306
14:31.860 --> 14:33.510
or we can change that expectation

307
14:33.510 --> 14:36.450
and also offer new services, new products

308
14:36.450 --> 14:39.930
to maybe the second owner that the first owner did not order

309
14:39.930 --> 14:42.450
or it wasn't even available when the first owner

310
14:42.450 --> 14:45.693
had that beautiful vehicle.

311
14:46.590 --> 14:48.510
So, this is how we see it over time,

312
14:48.510 --> 14:51.390
that it really gives us this possibility

313
14:51.390 --> 14:56.040
to tailor the experience due over the regions,

314
14:56.040 --> 14:58.080
and also then over time.

315
14:58.080 --> 15:01.470
Which is for us, a fundamental difference.

316
15:01.470 --> 15:05.970
The second that maybe is not so obvious to everybody

317
15:05.970 --> 15:08.490
is that we now have the possibility

318
15:08.490 --> 15:12.180
to have a real-time interaction with all of our customers.

319
15:12.180 --> 15:14.730
So, we have right now,

320
15:14.730 --> 15:17.220
in our Mercedes-Benz intelligent cloud,

321
15:17.220 --> 15:20.070
we have over 12 million vehicles connected,

322
15:20.070 --> 15:23.220
which gives us insights into how is our product used,

323
15:23.220 --> 15:24.690
what features are being used,

324
15:24.690 --> 15:25.980
what features are not being used.

325
15:25.980 --> 15:28.260
How are they being used and what is the possibility?

326
15:28.260 --> 15:30.990
And that data is for us enormously important

327
15:30.990 --> 15:33.000
when we feed that back into,

328
15:33.000 --> 15:35.010
you know, into our continuous development.

329
15:35.010 --> 15:36.780
So, that continuous data loop

330
15:36.780 --> 15:40.710
is basically, we're shifting from an open loop system,

331
15:40.710 --> 15:42.390
where the product was put out in the market

332
15:42.390 --> 15:44.820
and it was an open-loop to a closed-loop data system

333
15:44.820 --> 15:46.230
that really feeds itself.

334
15:46.230 --> 15:49.200
And that is how we see it,

335
15:49.200 --> 15:53.940
that it gives us a possibility to really monitor

336
15:53.940 --> 15:57.810
how well our, and what way our products

337
15:57.810 --> 15:59.130
are being used in the market.

338
15:59.130 --> 16:00.254
<v ->Okay.</v>

339
16:00.254 --> 16:01.380
And well, I'm gonna get to the use cases a little bit,

340
16:01.380 --> 16:02.280
but I'd like to,

341
16:02.280 --> 16:03.362
go ahead.

342
16:03.362 --> 16:04.195
You wanna jump in, Aruna.

343
16:04.195 --> 16:08.910
<v ->I have some points because you linked the car to a phone.</v>

344
16:08.910 --> 16:12.690
And yes, SDV we all know can do a lot of good stuff

345
16:12.690 --> 16:15.693
and it's all good, but there are challenges.

346
16:16.680 --> 16:18.240
Challenges are multiple.

347
16:18.240 --> 16:21.090
And because you compared the car to a phone,

348
16:21.090 --> 16:22.923
let me also compare the same.

349
16:23.790 --> 16:25.623
So, if you look at the cell phone,

350
16:27.420 --> 16:30.540
everybody has one, we use it all the time.

351
16:30.540 --> 16:34.540
And we are all programmed if the cell phone were to fail

352
16:35.460 --> 16:37.950
roughly, the average use is what?

353
16:37.950 --> 16:39.243
Around 18 months.

354
16:40.080 --> 16:42.420
We are programmed to buy another smartphone

355
16:42.420 --> 16:43.710
for a thousand dollars.

356
16:43.710 --> 16:44.910
We don't think about it.

357
16:45.930 --> 16:47.730
That's for the upgrade of the phone.

358
16:48.840 --> 16:53.840
We are not programmed to change the hardware of our car

359
16:54.390 --> 16:56.430
for a thousand dollars every two years.

360
16:56.430 --> 16:57.263
We are not.

361
16:58.230 --> 17:00.810
And the question is, why not?

362
17:00.810 --> 17:02.490
And what would it take?

363
17:02.490 --> 17:06.120
Because you're compared to the phones.

364
17:06.120 --> 17:09.450
And when you look at the phone, where did we start?

365
17:09.450 --> 17:13.533
We started with landlines, then we went cellular.

366
17:14.520 --> 17:17.253
Then, I think we went to smartphones.

367
17:18.540 --> 17:22.560
Until 25 years ago, we've been having hardware at our home

368
17:22.560 --> 17:26.100
with a landline, where we paid monthly rates

369
17:26.100 --> 17:29.223
and we never had to change the hardware at all.

370
17:30.720 --> 17:34.470
And overall, after a while, now we are programmed

371
17:34.470 --> 17:37.740
to change the hardware every 18 months.

372
17:37.740 --> 17:39.630
The question is, it takes time.

373
17:39.630 --> 17:43.860
I think also software-defined vehicles, it takes time.

374
17:43.860 --> 17:46.740
And the key is we still have to remember

375
17:46.740 --> 17:51.740
that the car is needed go from point A to point B,

376
17:52.530 --> 17:56.730
in a safe manner, and convenient.

377
17:56.730 --> 18:00.990
And as much as possible connected to the external world.

378
18:00.990 --> 18:05.070
So, if we are providing features that further enhance

379
18:05.070 --> 18:09.000
the safety, then it is likely that,

380
18:09.000 --> 18:11.100
that we would be able,

381
18:11.100 --> 18:14.310
or people would want to embrace this fact

382
18:14.310 --> 18:16.350
to make that more upgradable.

383
18:16.350 --> 18:18.330
But, this takes time.

384
18:18.330 --> 18:22.800
And the challenge is how much hardware do we think we need?

385
18:22.800 --> 18:25.260
And how do you define how much hardware is needed

386
18:25.260 --> 18:28.320
for the amount of software that we anticipate

387
18:28.320 --> 18:30.900
needing in years to come.

388
18:30.900 --> 18:32.433
And how do you protect for it?

389
18:34.320 --> 18:35.430
And how much is enough?

390
18:35.430 --> 18:37.740
And those are the challenges I see.

391
18:37.740 --> 18:40.770
<v ->Peter, how should you be thinking about that question?</v>

392
18:40.770 --> 18:41.850
<v ->Yeah, let me also add in,</v>

393
18:41.850 --> 18:44.523
because first of all, as Magnus explained,

394
18:45.510 --> 18:49.260
I also see the maturity of upgrades and updates you do

395
18:49.260 --> 18:50.340
is in the software part.

396
18:50.340 --> 18:52.680
It's not so much in the hardware part

397
18:52.680 --> 18:55.680
even though, I would like that hardware has changed.

398
18:55.680 --> 18:57.030
So, we all would like that.

399
18:57.930 --> 19:02.220
I also don't see that it's affordable for OEMs

400
19:02.220 --> 19:06.240
to have excess hardware just for future use.

401
19:06.240 --> 19:09.330
That model, I think it was tried,

402
19:09.330 --> 19:12.480
but, it's also not a very successful model.

403
19:12.480 --> 19:15.030
But, there are things where you need to build

404
19:15.030 --> 19:17.370
some headroom for future activities.

405
19:17.370 --> 19:19.230
Think about cybersecurity.

406
19:19.230 --> 19:22.350
If you launch a car,

407
19:22.350 --> 19:24.780
you have a certain cybersecurity standard

408
19:24.780 --> 19:29.160
and mechanisms where you get attacks.

409
19:29.160 --> 19:31.680
But, that are everyday updated.

410
19:31.680 --> 19:33.690
So therefore, you need to have a flexibility

411
19:33.690 --> 19:35.370
to upgrade on the cybersecurity.

412
19:35.370 --> 19:36.360
So, there are areas.

413
19:36.360 --> 19:38.010
Safety is one.

414
19:38.010 --> 19:40.320
Cybersecurity is a second one where yes,

415
19:40.320 --> 19:45.000
there also is headroom needed in the hardware.

416
19:45.000 --> 19:47.640
But, I would agree that the majority of the updates,

417
19:47.640 --> 19:51.060
and especially, those which are on the drivers,

418
19:51.060 --> 19:53.410
the user will see is more on the software side.

419
19:54.630 --> 19:56.310
<v ->I mean, it seems,</v>

420
19:56.310 --> 19:57.143
I don't know.

421
19:57.143 --> 19:58.020
How you think about this, Magnus?

422
19:58.020 --> 20:00.450
But, you can only go so far out.

423
20:00.450 --> 20:03.630
You can't anticipate, how much DRAM am I gonna need?

424
20:03.630 --> 20:05.400
And how much memory do we need

425
20:05.400 --> 20:07.710
for the applications that we think we're gonna run

426
20:07.710 --> 20:09.603
in, you know, in 2030?

427
20:10.500 --> 20:12.450
That would seem to be not a very practical way

428
20:12.450 --> 20:13.773
to design your car.

429
20:14.640 --> 20:18.690
<v ->So, the way Mercedes-Benz looks at the hardware</v>

430
20:18.690 --> 20:21.900
is that we have classified the compute in the vehicle

431
20:21.900 --> 20:25.950
in various categories from category one to category four.

432
20:25.950 --> 20:29.760
And if you look at the microcontroller levels,

433
20:29.760 --> 20:31.710
which is typically a category three and four,

434
20:31.710 --> 20:33.390
these are very static in the car.

435
20:33.390 --> 20:34.590
These are the actuators.

436
20:34.590 --> 20:38.400
These are things that control a motor,

437
20:38.400 --> 20:40.770
or control something that's in the vehicle.

438
20:40.770 --> 20:44.580
They are typically over this time period, very static.

439
20:44.580 --> 20:48.090
Where we see the huge changes

440
20:48.090 --> 20:49.680
is definitely in the category one,

441
20:49.680 --> 20:50.850
in the microprocessor space.

442
20:50.850 --> 20:53.850
And this is where you have everything that is visual,

443
20:53.850 --> 20:56.400
that is something that the customer actually sees

444
20:56.400 --> 20:59.130
in terms of what's happening on the screen and so forth.

445
20:59.130 --> 21:02.010
And here you need to be flexible.

446
21:02.010 --> 21:05.400
You need to be able to have a flexible concept

447
21:05.400 --> 21:07.440
for how much memory is available.

448
21:07.440 --> 21:09.930
And also, have a more flexible concept

449
21:09.930 --> 21:14.010
on how to upgrade compute in this case.

450
21:14.010 --> 21:16.260
And there we come into an interesting topic

451
21:16.260 --> 21:21.260
when it comes to the disaggregation of how the applications,

452
21:21.780 --> 21:26.130
and how various various stacks or now, AI models,

453
21:26.130 --> 21:29.430
are then coupled with that compute.

454
21:29.430 --> 21:33.210
So, this becomes then into an interesting debate about,

455
21:33.210 --> 21:35.160
what is the advantages or disadvantages

456
21:35.160 --> 21:38.970
of tying yourself to a certain type of language

457
21:38.970 --> 21:40.500
or a certain type of model.

458
21:40.500 --> 21:43.500
But, it's easier to talk about this

459
21:43.500 --> 21:46.770
if you categorize the type of compute

460
21:46.770 --> 21:51.630
that you have in a vehicle in a different categories.

461
21:51.630 --> 21:56.070
<v ->Fern, are you finding that your customer's</v>

462
21:56.070 --> 21:59.083
needs or opportunities are changing?

463
21:59.083 --> 22:03.510
How does this equation shift your business?

464
22:03.510 --> 22:05.010
<v ->Yeah, that's a great question.</v>

465
22:05.010 --> 22:06.420
What we see, you know,

466
22:06.420 --> 22:08.670
from our perspective at Texas instruments

467
22:08.670 --> 22:11.430
is certainly a need for a family approach.

468
22:11.430 --> 22:16.430
So, you know, we pride ourselves in a very broad portfolio .

469
22:16.800 --> 22:20.640
And when we build devices, whether it's microprocessors

470
22:20.640 --> 22:23.460
or down to the microcontrollers or even the analog

471
22:23.460 --> 22:26.400
drivers that we have, we realize that

472
22:26.400 --> 22:28.290
you do need a family of devices.

473
22:28.290 --> 22:32.070
Ideally, something that is pin-to-pin, backwards compatible

474
22:32.070 --> 22:36.390
to enable the OEMs to build that platform.

475
22:36.390 --> 22:39.090
Certainly, something that you want to build

476
22:39.090 --> 22:40.650
from a capability perspective,

477
22:40.650 --> 22:44.850
and the highest model line, if you will,

478
22:44.850 --> 22:47.730
may not necessarily be cost efficient as Peter mentioned

479
22:47.730 --> 22:48.990
in something that's in the,

480
22:48.990 --> 22:51.540
on the more economical line if you will.

481
22:51.540 --> 22:55.530
And so, we do work very closely with our customers

482
22:55.530 --> 22:59.430
on a family-based approach that allows our customers

483
22:59.430 --> 23:02.370
to use the same platform, the same architecture,

484
23:02.370 --> 23:05.040
the same approach, algorithms

485
23:05.040 --> 23:07.320
to be able to build a scalable model

486
23:07.320 --> 23:11.040
that goes across multiple platforms.

487
23:11.040 --> 23:14.940
And in some cases, can kind of stretch that hardware life

488
23:14.940 --> 23:17.820
across, you know, iterations as we continue to learn

489
23:17.820 --> 23:20.220
more and more about what our customers want,

490
23:20.220 --> 23:22.233
what our consumers are looking for,

491
23:23.220 --> 23:26.940
the ability to go make those changes in software

492
23:26.940 --> 23:28.920
versus having to retool the entire

493
23:28.920 --> 23:31.707
hardware ecosystem within a vehicle.

494
23:31.707 --> 23:33.540
<v ->So, since we're talking about,</v>

495
23:33.540 --> 23:35.610
we're supposed to be talking about software

496
23:35.610 --> 23:37.380
to find vehicles, let's talk about software a little bit.

497
23:37.380 --> 23:42.240
So, you're my fellow OEM panelist,

498
23:42.240 --> 23:43.590
so we'll talk to you first.

499
23:43.590 --> 23:44.973
So, when you think about the opportunities,

500
23:44.973 --> 23:48.180
when we talk about the kind of software we mean here, right?

501
23:48.180 --> 23:51.300
There's really several different categories of stuff, right?

502
23:51.300 --> 23:53.910
There's stuff that's about the,

503
23:53.910 --> 23:56.460
I think the things that people think about most frequently

504
23:56.460 --> 23:58.350
is probably infotainment related, right?

505
23:58.350 --> 24:01.470
Your experience in the car, which is important,

506
24:01.470 --> 24:02.610
but there are other things too.

507
24:02.610 --> 24:06.990
So, give us a few thoughts on the categories

508
24:06.990 --> 24:09.180
of software we're actually addressing.

509
24:09.180 --> 24:12.090
<v ->Well the normal categories that the industry talks about</v>

510
24:12.090 --> 24:13.230
is of course, infotainment,

511
24:13.230 --> 24:16.230
which is what the customer normally sees and talk about,

512
24:16.230 --> 24:20.910
which is very tied today to the various digital ecosystems

513
24:20.910 --> 24:24.120
that is prevalent in your daily lives.

514
24:24.120 --> 24:29.120
So, some people are very astute

515
24:29.190 --> 24:33.180
to the Android world in the various world.

516
24:33.180 --> 24:36.540
Or around the world, there is a certain behaviors

517
24:36.540 --> 24:38.280
regarding payment and so forth

518
24:38.280 --> 24:40.020
that you typically do your shopping.

519
24:40.020 --> 24:43.710
And that basically, is tied all to that.

520
24:43.710 --> 24:46.020
But, if you look at from a vehicle domain

521
24:46.020 --> 24:49.590
and how we look at it is that we also need to tie that

522
24:49.590 --> 24:51.720
to the driving experience.

523
24:51.720 --> 24:55.350
And the driving experience for us is so important

524
24:55.350 --> 25:00.350
when it comes now to the entire electrical drive system.

525
25:00.630 --> 25:02.760
Because if you look at the electrical drive system,

526
25:02.760 --> 25:05.250
what we're talking about right now is that we need to,

527
25:05.250 --> 25:07.710
especially in this country and in Europe,

528
25:07.710 --> 25:10.140
we need to increase the actual,

529
25:10.140 --> 25:12.450
the penetration of the electrical drive.

530
25:12.450 --> 25:17.450
And we need to overcome this range anxiety that exists.

531
25:18.480 --> 25:20.100
Because penetration in this country

532
25:20.100 --> 25:22.770
about electrical drive is below 10%.

533
25:22.770 --> 25:25.290
In Europe, it's a little bit higher than 10%.

534
25:25.290 --> 25:27.950
In China, it's actually 50% right now

535
25:27.950 --> 25:30.720
of the entire population that is electric.

536
25:30.720 --> 25:32.550
So, in order to overcome that here,

537
25:32.550 --> 25:37.550
we need to marry, for example, how we monitor energy

538
25:38.010 --> 25:42.090
and how we model the energy usage.

539
25:42.090 --> 25:45.660
Because if you are using your body functions,

540
25:45.660 --> 25:49.560
which is air conditioning, or cooling, or heating,

541
25:49.560 --> 25:53.460
that consumes energy, that lowers your actually range.

542
25:53.460 --> 25:57.120
And we need to be able to make sure that we have good models

543
25:57.120 --> 26:01.110
between the body functions that is consuming energy

544
26:01.110 --> 26:03.210
with the infotainment functions,

545
26:03.210 --> 26:05.520
with the autonomous driving functions

546
26:05.520 --> 26:07.320
so that we can actually provide

547
26:07.320 --> 26:11.070
an absolute correct range to our customers,

548
26:11.070 --> 26:14.730
making sure that they have an absolute trust

549
26:14.730 --> 26:17.880
in the range you can have in a Mercedes-Benz vehicle.

550
26:17.880 --> 26:21.060
So therefore, all of these functions,

551
26:21.060 --> 26:26.060
the entertainment, the actual autonomous driving functions,

552
26:26.220 --> 26:29.700
the body functions, and the drivetrain functions

553
26:29.700 --> 26:31.350
are the four major domains.

554
26:31.350 --> 26:33.960
But for us, they are really working together.

555
26:33.960 --> 26:36.600
And that's what the Mercedes-Benz operating system is about,

556
26:36.600 --> 26:38.820
that we have a holistic view on this,

557
26:38.820 --> 26:41.610
and be able to marry that with the cloud.

558
26:41.610 --> 26:43.089
<v ->And then, do you think about</v>

559
26:43.089 --> 26:46.083
the opportunity here as one of,

560
26:47.490 --> 26:50.130
you're going to have a better experience in your car?

561
26:50.130 --> 26:51.720
Or do you think of it as,

562
26:51.720 --> 26:53.430
and these are not mutually exclusive.

563
26:53.430 --> 26:56.430
Or do you think of it as, this is an opportunity for me

564
26:56.430 --> 26:58.890
to maintain a relationship,

565
26:58.890 --> 27:02.340
a revenue generating relationship in some cases,

566
27:02.340 --> 27:05.640
ongoing with the ownership of owners of the car

567
27:05.640 --> 27:07.950
because we're gonna provide them with value added services.

568
27:07.950 --> 27:10.830
Now, you know, I say that as someone who works at GM,

569
27:10.830 --> 27:12.900
we've been doing OnStar for a really long time

570
27:12.900 --> 27:14.040
and we have like, millions of people

571
27:14.040 --> 27:15.417
who pay us to be on OnStar.

572
27:15.417 --> 27:18.060
And so that's been, that is a pretty good example

573
27:18.060 --> 27:23.060
of a software-defined service in a car.

574
27:23.310 --> 27:25.710
But, there's lots of opportunities beyond that.

575
27:25.710 --> 27:26.970
And I wonder,

576
27:26.970 --> 27:29.250
Fern, you look like you wanna say something?

577
27:29.250 --> 27:31.320
So, how do you guys think about this

578
27:31.320 --> 27:34.140
from what you need to do to set the car up

579
27:34.140 --> 27:35.550
to be able to do these things?

580
27:35.550 --> 27:39.960
<v ->Yeah, I wanted to kinda add to Magnus' comment there,</v>

581
27:39.960 --> 27:43.320
there's so much capability, I think, in our hardware

582
27:43.320 --> 27:45.660
that we probably don't even realize.

583
27:45.660 --> 27:48.450
And one of the benefits of a software-defined vehicle

584
27:48.450 --> 27:50.970
and coupled with another hot topic AI

585
27:50.970 --> 27:55.470
is the ability to collect data real time

586
27:55.470 --> 27:59.070
and have a closed feedback loop, not just from our consumers

587
27:59.070 --> 28:01.920
but from the vehicle, from the machine itself

588
28:01.920 --> 28:03.990
that we can then use to fine tune

589
28:03.990 --> 28:06.420
the performance of the vehicle to be honest, right?

590
28:06.420 --> 28:09.903
Let's talk about range anxiety that Magnus mentioned.

591
28:11.370 --> 28:13.320
How much of our systems are,

592
28:13.320 --> 28:16.170
let's call it overbuilt conservatively?

593
28:16.170 --> 28:18.150
Because we certainly don't wanna have

594
28:18.150 --> 28:20.160
any of our drivers stranded on the road

595
28:20.160 --> 28:23.910
because we told them you had another 20 kilometers

596
28:23.910 --> 28:27.180
left to go, and you didn't actually get there, right?

597
28:27.180 --> 28:30.300
But, with the data that we're able to collect,

598
28:30.300 --> 28:32.640
how can we then fine tune that

599
28:32.640 --> 28:35.730
and actually extend the range over time

600
28:35.730 --> 28:37.620
that's adding value to our customers?

601
28:37.620 --> 28:39.690
That's, I think, what software-defined vehicle

602
28:39.690 --> 28:43.830
can really bring without really needing to change

603
28:43.830 --> 28:47.040
the hardware, to be honest, you know?

604
28:47.040 --> 28:49.530
And it depends on so many variables

605
28:49.530 --> 28:52.980
that we don't have access to when we're developing this.

606
28:52.980 --> 28:55.920
So, this concept of software-defined vehicles

607
28:55.920 --> 28:58.350
really gives us another lever

608
28:58.350 --> 29:01.380
to improve our consumers experience.

609
29:01.380 --> 29:03.180
<v ->So, if I may add,</v>

610
29:03.180 --> 29:06.240
yeah, hardware is important but it's not all.

611
29:06.240 --> 29:08.760
Then, there's a lot of things one can do

612
29:08.760 --> 29:13.440
with even what is existing today by fusion.

613
29:13.440 --> 29:15.180
You have a lot of information.

614
29:15.180 --> 29:19.290
How do you work across distributed modules?

615
29:19.290 --> 29:21.480
It lends its way very easily.

616
29:21.480 --> 29:25.500
And one understands that software-defined vehicles

617
29:25.500 --> 29:28.800
is like some kind of a nebulous concept.

618
29:28.800 --> 29:31.983
And how do you now bring that concept to life?

619
29:32.970 --> 29:37.957
And for that, you also need to work on the user experience.

620
29:37.957 --> 29:39.720
The human and machine interface

621
29:39.720 --> 29:41.160
becomes absolutely necessary.

622
29:41.160 --> 29:44.130
You can have the greatest of functions,

623
29:44.130 --> 29:47.820
but if you don't have the right intuitive user defined

624
29:47.820 --> 29:50.040
functions where you're confident that you can work

625
29:50.040 --> 29:53.130
with the technology and the technology works with you,

626
29:53.130 --> 29:55.230
then nobody's gonna embrace that, right?

627
29:55.230 --> 29:56.070
So, that's where I see

628
29:56.070 --> 29:58.590
there's a lot of good things that can be done.

629
29:58.590 --> 30:03.420
And for example, this year, just to give kind of an example,

630
30:03.420 --> 30:06.240
you know that when you walk up to your car

631
30:06.240 --> 30:09.090
and have your car unlock, it's not something new.

632
30:09.090 --> 30:13.290
But, how about your car understanding your movement patterns

633
30:13.290 --> 30:15.390
as you walk toward it and it knows.

634
30:15.390 --> 30:18.510
And for example, if you are walking from the grocery store

635
30:18.510 --> 30:21.870
with your arms full of stuff from the grocery store,

636
30:21.870 --> 30:26.730
your car is proactively able to open the trunk, for example.

637
30:26.730 --> 30:30.990
And, also understanding various different things

638
30:30.990 --> 30:32.850
with cameras and motion detection

639
30:32.850 --> 30:35.430
and artificial intelligence, that you can do to today.

640
30:35.430 --> 30:39.750
And this is the concept we are exhibiting at CES

641
30:39.750 --> 30:42.540
in terms of intelligent vehicle experience.

642
30:42.540 --> 30:45.450
And there's other fusion technologies that you can do

643
30:45.450 --> 30:48.540
because you have advanced ADA systems.

644
30:48.540 --> 30:52.590
and we are able, we are software today

645
30:52.590 --> 30:55.860
to be able to park and steer and control it.

646
30:55.860 --> 30:59.220
If you have equipped garages and parking spaces,

647
30:59.220 --> 31:01.920
are you able to do the car self-park itself?

648
31:01.920 --> 31:03.660
And if that could be a software feature

649
31:03.660 --> 31:05.370
that you could download because the hardware

650
31:05.370 --> 31:06.720
is are essentially there.

651
31:06.720 --> 31:10.620
So, these are some things that lends its way very easily

652
31:10.620 --> 31:13.500
because of SDVs.

653
31:13.500 --> 31:15.018
<v ->So, I wanna come back to what other,</v>

654
31:15.018 --> 31:18.510
to come back to my PC and phone analogy

655
31:18.510 --> 31:21.210
'cause I see one other sort of risk here, right?

656
31:21.210 --> 31:22.260
So, if you think about the history

657
31:22.260 --> 31:23.970
of the personal computer business, right?

658
31:23.970 --> 31:26.400
Personal computer manufacturers,

659
31:26.400 --> 31:28.980
as much as I love HP and Dell and Lenovo,

660
31:28.980 --> 31:31.800
like, their products are very similar, right?

661
31:31.800 --> 31:34.248
So, they run software from a third party.

662
31:34.248 --> 31:36.900
They're based on processors from another third party.

663
31:36.900 --> 31:39.477
They run applications from other third parties, right?

664
31:39.477 --> 31:42.180
And so, the challenge that they've had in some ways

665
31:42.180 --> 31:44.430
over time is how did you distinguish your,

666
31:44.430 --> 31:47.730
how do you distinguish yourself from the competition?

667
31:47.730 --> 31:48.960
In the automotive business systems,

668
31:48.960 --> 31:50.430
historically, been a problem.

669
31:50.430 --> 31:51.393
But if you turn,

670
31:52.230 --> 31:54.990
as the business becomes more software-driven

671
31:54.990 --> 31:57.900
and driven by third party applications,

672
31:57.900 --> 32:00.840
I wonder whether there's a certain amount of risk.

673
32:00.840 --> 32:04.020
And so, Magnus, I wonder how you think about the ability

674
32:04.020 --> 32:09.020
to maintain a distinctive Mercedes experience

675
32:10.410 --> 32:13.200
that's not, say a CarPlay experience

676
32:13.200 --> 32:15.960
or you know, an Android experience,

677
32:15.960 --> 32:19.710
or of, you know, a Spotify experience when you're in the car

678
32:19.710 --> 32:22.440
that then makes it a little less special

679
32:22.440 --> 32:23.763
to be in a Mercedes.

680
32:24.900 --> 32:27.420
<v ->So, that's a very excellent question.</v>

681
32:27.420 --> 32:30.330
And that's why we have concentrated

682
32:30.330 --> 32:33.030
when we are defining what we mean

683
32:33.030 --> 32:35.310
with a software-defined vehicle

684
32:35.310 --> 32:37.860
and Mercedes-Benz operating system,

685
32:37.860 --> 32:41.670
that its code have to be the holistic experience.

686
32:41.670 --> 32:44.820
When you get into a Mercedes-Benz,

687
32:44.820 --> 32:47.190
you feel it by, when you close the door.

688
32:47.190 --> 32:49.230
You hear, you sound it's a Mercedes-Benz.

689
32:49.230 --> 32:51.090
When you then look at the screen,

690
32:51.090 --> 32:53.310
it needs to be a Mercedes-Benz.

691
32:53.310 --> 32:57.570
Yes, you need to find the ecosystem digital interfaces

692
32:57.570 --> 33:01.926
that you are used to and the apps and so forth,

693
33:01.926 --> 33:05.730
but it needs to be in a high-quality manner.

694
33:05.730 --> 33:08.970
And the way we're doing that is through leveraging

695
33:08.970 --> 33:12.660
a series of technologies.

696
33:12.660 --> 33:15.570
One of them that we got a lot of credit for

697
33:15.570 --> 33:18.000
is that last year we were the first one

698
33:18.000 --> 33:22.020
to integrate large language models into our beta program

699
33:22.020 --> 33:26.190
to be able to really elevate the user experience

700
33:26.190 --> 33:28.920
when it speaks to hey Mercedes in a different manner.

701
33:28.920 --> 33:30.960
And just before the Christmas now,

702
33:30.960 --> 33:33.150
we've been able to launch that live

703
33:33.150 --> 33:35.790
to two and a half million vehicles out there

704
33:35.790 --> 33:39.570
that is already sold and been able to be produced.

705
33:39.570 --> 33:44.490
And these customers now in Europe and in USA

706
33:44.490 --> 33:47.910
are now having this experience live in their system.

707
33:47.910 --> 33:52.590
So, by working with partners but keeping control

708
33:52.590 --> 33:54.870
over this user interface, and basically look at

709
33:54.870 --> 33:58.080
how can we make sure that we live up

710
33:58.080 --> 34:00.330
to our safety promise as Mercedes-Benz.

711
34:00.330 --> 34:03.630
So privacy, data security, and so forth,

712
34:03.630 --> 34:08.280
making sure that we can enable these kind of experiences

713
34:08.280 --> 34:12.090
in a high-quality and especially in a safe manner.

714
34:12.090 --> 34:13.830
That is the brand promise

715
34:13.830 --> 34:16.740
and this is what we're focusing on.

716
34:16.740 --> 34:19.350
Then, we're leveraging a lot of partners underneath

717
34:19.350 --> 34:22.470
so that we are leveraging standards,

718
34:22.470 --> 34:25.686
we're leveraging the tech players

719
34:25.686 --> 34:28.020
to enable this service for us.

720
34:28.020 --> 34:31.110
But, it's got to be a customer relationship

721
34:31.110 --> 34:36.110
that is resonating with the customer itself.

722
34:36.292 --> 34:38.790
You mentioned CarPlay.

723
34:38.790 --> 34:42.123
We have deliberately chosen to keep CarPlay in there,

724
34:43.127 --> 34:47.670
and we are measuring everyday what is the percentage

725
34:47.670 --> 34:49.530
of our vehicles where the customer

726
34:49.530 --> 34:52.950
is actually choosing actively to go to CarPlay.

727
34:52.950 --> 34:55.370
And we have been able to bring that down now,

728
34:55.370 --> 34:59.580
in our all of our new generations to single digit numbers.

729
34:59.580 --> 35:02.160
So, we see that they actively are choosing our system

730
35:02.160 --> 35:03.763
because they find all of the apps

731
35:03.763 --> 35:05.490
and all of the functionality

732
35:05.490 --> 35:10.020
that they like in our system.

733
35:10.020 --> 35:12.510
And when there is something missing,

734
35:12.510 --> 35:17.510
this is exactly the real-time, open-closed loop situation

735
35:17.610 --> 35:20.940
that enables us to find out why are they then

736
35:20.940 --> 35:23.640
going to a foreign system.

737
35:23.640 --> 35:24.720
What is it in our system

738
35:24.720 --> 35:27.150
that is missing that we need to close on?

739
35:27.150 --> 35:28.770
<v Eric>From a component point of view,</v>

740
35:28.770 --> 35:30.900
like Peter, is there something you could do

741
35:30.900 --> 35:33.810
to help your OEM customers

742
35:33.810 --> 35:36.390
distinguish what they're offering

743
35:36.390 --> 35:38.290
from what the competition is offering?

744
35:39.990 --> 35:43.770
<v ->I mean, as Magnus said, there is certain areas</v>

745
35:43.770 --> 35:46.620
where the OEMS need to do in order to differentiate

746
35:46.620 --> 35:49.500
and have the specific brand recognition.

747
35:49.500 --> 35:53.070
And as you also mentioned about standards,

748
35:53.070 --> 35:55.020
there's a lot of functions which are in common

749
35:55.020 --> 35:57.030
and where there's no real differentiation.

750
35:57.030 --> 35:59.640
And here, especially when we go in more complex systems

751
35:59.640 --> 36:02.400
like in the SDV cars,

752
36:02.400 --> 36:05.255
I think the industry and the supply chain

753
36:05.255 --> 36:08.130
has much more room for cooperating on topics

754
36:08.130 --> 36:09.690
which are not really differentiating.

755
36:09.690 --> 36:11.610
And here on the component side,

756
36:11.610 --> 36:15.630
we can support also, on the system side, we can support.

757
36:15.630 --> 36:18.750
So, making sure that we cooperate there

758
36:18.750 --> 36:20.580
where there's no real differentiation

759
36:20.580 --> 36:22.440
in order to get the energy and the bandwidth

760
36:22.440 --> 36:25.830
free from the engineers to do the real stuff

761
36:25.830 --> 36:29.310
which is differentiating towards the consumer space

762
36:29.310 --> 36:32.490
and is increasing safety and security.

763
36:32.490 --> 36:34.560
<v ->Fern, how do you feel about that?</v>

764
36:34.560 --> 36:36.610
Is there an opportunity there for you?

765
36:37.590 --> 36:40.680
<v ->You know, I agree with Peter on the collaboration piece.</v>

766
36:40.680 --> 36:45.680
I think it's also looking at ways that we can help drive

767
36:46.020 --> 36:48.870
the capabilities for additional technologies,

768
36:48.870 --> 36:51.269
new innovations, something that,

769
36:51.269 --> 36:54.120
that may not be thought off in the past.

770
36:54.120 --> 36:55.410
It's a why not?

771
36:55.410 --> 36:58.710
And how do we deliver that at the right cost point?

772
36:58.710 --> 37:02.910
Because certainly, there's going to be a lot of capabilities

773
37:02.910 --> 37:05.640
that we can build, but if our consumer's

774
37:05.640 --> 37:08.400
not gonna pay for it, then is it really valuable, right?

775
37:08.400 --> 37:12.210
So, I think from our perspective it's really understanding

776
37:12.210 --> 37:15.600
the direction that our consumers want,

777
37:15.600 --> 37:17.593
the direction that our OEMs wanna go to,

778
37:17.593 --> 37:20.070
and how do we deliver the right technology

779
37:20.070 --> 37:21.390
at the right cost point?

780
37:21.390 --> 37:22.223
<v ->Right.</v>

781
37:22.223 --> 37:23.490
Aruna, how do you think about it?

782
37:25.653 --> 37:29.211
<v ->From a supplier point of view, we are ready to do either.</v>

783
37:29.211 --> 37:30.044
(Eric chuckles lightly)

784
37:30.044 --> 37:34.410
It doesn't matter, honestly, because if you take your,

785
37:34.410 --> 37:36.960
you either have the iPhone or you have

786
37:36.960 --> 37:38.700
an Android based phone.

787
37:38.700 --> 37:42.330
And you are using your phone 24/7 literally.

788
37:42.330 --> 37:46.230
And your car, you use on an average an hour per day.

789
37:46.230 --> 37:47.880
And you use it predominantly

790
37:47.880 --> 37:50.760
because you need to go to point A to point B.

791
37:50.760 --> 37:54.480
And while these technologies seem too far,

792
37:54.480 --> 37:56.700
actually there's a synergy,

793
37:56.700 --> 38:00.150
because the interfaces and so on are very common.

794
38:00.150 --> 38:03.690
And the idea to use these in car is to make it

795
38:03.690 --> 38:06.840
as seamless as possible in your vehicle.

796
38:06.840 --> 38:09.040
So, you don't have to do any special

797
38:11.520 --> 38:15.420
user added experiment to get this all to work.

798
38:15.420 --> 38:20.130
The idea is to make your journey from point A to point B

799
38:20.130 --> 38:24.000
very, very safe, comfortable, and convenient,

800
38:24.000 --> 38:27.534
whether it be one or the other technology.

801
38:27.534 --> 38:28.367
<v Eric>Right.</v>

802
38:28.367 --> 38:32.790
<v ->And software-defined vehicles lends its way to that.</v>

803
38:32.790 --> 38:35.820
I see these as not contradicting technologies,

804
38:35.820 --> 38:39.310
mainly as more complimentary to what we wanna do.

805
38:39.310 --> 38:40.143
<v Eric>Right.</v>

806
38:40.143 --> 38:42.600
<v ->The key is also being,</v>

807
38:42.600 --> 38:46.020
also to understand, all of these technologies

808
38:46.020 --> 38:48.210
and the apps that you use can be integrated

809
38:48.210 --> 38:49.650
in a seamless manner.

810
38:49.650 --> 38:51.540
But, one need to understand that there are

811
38:51.540 --> 38:54.510
safety technologies including ADAS functions in the car

812
38:54.510 --> 38:56.850
that can be transported to a phone.

813
38:56.850 --> 38:58.110
There's a limit to that.

814
38:58.110 --> 39:00.120
<v ->So, we have only about a minute left,</v>

815
39:00.120 --> 39:02.830
but, I wanted to talk to one other thing

816
39:03.780 --> 39:05.280
with you, which is,

817
39:05.280 --> 39:07.500
you guys have been a little bit ahead

818
39:07.500 --> 39:10.920
of the pack on level three autonomy.

819
39:10.920 --> 39:13.290
And as you get into level three,

820
39:13.290 --> 39:14.940
so you know, level three is,

821
39:14.940 --> 39:15.990
most of the audience will know, right?

822
39:15.990 --> 39:17.370
It's like hands off, eyes off.

823
39:17.370 --> 39:19.290
So, you can actually take your eyes off the road

824
39:19.290 --> 39:20.670
under certain conditions.

825
39:20.670 --> 39:22.050
And as you get to level four,

826
39:22.050 --> 39:23.973
where it's like more true autonomy,

827
39:25.470 --> 39:27.240
you do something magical in the car, right?

828
39:27.240 --> 39:29.580
Which is you give people back time.

829
39:29.580 --> 39:31.972
And that provides, it would seem to me

830
39:31.972 --> 39:34.770
a really interesting moment

831
39:34.770 --> 39:36.930
to provide new services in the car,

832
39:36.930 --> 39:38.100
particularly in entertainment.

833
39:38.100 --> 39:40.200
I'm curious how you think about that.

834
39:40.200 --> 39:44.190
<v ->Yes, we of course, pride ourself with the safety</v>

835
39:44.190 --> 39:46.500
and the security of our customers.

836
39:46.500 --> 39:51.500
That has been the center of Mercedes-Benz for 130 years.

837
39:52.620 --> 39:57.330
So with that, the pioneering spirit of the best of nothing,

838
39:57.330 --> 40:02.310
really, it leads to the fact that if we can free up the time

839
40:02.310 --> 40:06.630
that the customer has in spending in the time,

840
40:06.630 --> 40:08.520
this is the ultimate luxury, right?

841
40:08.520 --> 40:10.980
The ultimate luxury is to free up the mind

842
40:10.980 --> 40:12.390
and that's what level three is about.

843
40:12.390 --> 40:14.250
You actually free up your mind so that

844
40:14.250 --> 40:16.750
you don't need to look at the road all the time

845
40:18.420 --> 40:22.380
because if you only are freeing up your hands,

846
40:22.380 --> 40:25.140
still, your mind needs to be monitoring what is out there.

847
40:25.140 --> 40:28.800
And having level three right now here in Nevada,

848
40:28.800 --> 40:33.330
having it right now in San Francisco, and in Germany.

849
40:33.330 --> 40:37.590
By the way, we just released that we can legally be approved

850
40:37.590 --> 40:39.990
to drive up to 95 kilometers an hour

851
40:39.990 --> 40:41.910
in Germany on level three.

852
40:41.910 --> 40:45.120
Which, really, is many, many hours on the road

853
40:45.120 --> 40:48.150
that you can then actually watch a movie.

854
40:48.150 --> 40:52.620
You can do emails, you can work with your devices

855
40:52.620 --> 40:54.900
that you have in your hands, take a coffee, whatever,

856
40:54.900 --> 40:57.720
that is true luxury in our opinion.

857
40:57.720 --> 41:01.770
And providing that luxury in a safe manner,

858
41:01.770 --> 41:04.080
that is what Mercedes brand form about.

859
41:04.080 --> 41:07.470
So, that is why we believe that level three

860
41:07.470 --> 41:10.530
is a true benefit to a customer

861
41:10.530 --> 41:12.510
where we can drive that we'll continue

862
41:12.510 --> 41:15.960
to push the boundaries on how fast we can drive

863
41:15.960 --> 41:18.630
using the service.

864
41:18.630 --> 41:21.120
It's raw physics, so it's about the sensor set

865
41:21.120 --> 41:24.270
and it's about the, how we compute that.

866
41:24.270 --> 41:26.790
But, we believe this is the true luxury.

867
41:26.790 --> 41:31.790
Of course, we have the luxury, also, to have the customers

868
41:31.950 --> 41:35.310
in our premium segments that can do that.

869
41:35.310 --> 41:38.340
But, this is the pioneering spirit about Mercedes-Benz

870
41:38.340 --> 41:41.550
where, you know, when you bring a new technology in,

871
41:41.550 --> 41:44.580
you bring it in to that top-end segment

872
41:44.580 --> 41:46.860
and then you basically democratize it

873
41:46.860 --> 41:48.810
by having the costs go down,

874
41:48.810 --> 41:51.960
and giving that to a larger population.

875
41:51.960 --> 41:54.210
That is how we have seen happening

876
41:54.210 --> 41:56.210
with the basic ADAS functions,

877
41:56.210 --> 41:58.200
and this is how it's going to go

878
41:58.200 --> 41:59.820
with this technology as well.

879
41:59.820 --> 42:00.653
<v ->Great.</v>

880
42:00.653 --> 42:02.310
Well, we are over time.

881
42:02.310 --> 42:04.260
Thank you all for sticking around

882
42:04.260 --> 42:07.290
and for listening so attentively to our panel.

883
42:07.290 --> 42:09.090
Please give them all a round of applause.

884
42:09.090 --> 42:10.287
Thank you.

885
42:10.287 --> 42:11.406
(audience clapping)

886
42:11.406 --> 42:14.739
(light music)
