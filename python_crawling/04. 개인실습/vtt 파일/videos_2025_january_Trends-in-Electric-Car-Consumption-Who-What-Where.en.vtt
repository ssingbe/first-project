00:00.836 --> 00:03.419
(upbeat music)

2
00:10.320 --> 00:14.010
<v ->Thank you for joining us here for our session today.</v>

3
00:14.010 --> 00:15.687
Today we're gonna be talking about EV trends

4
00:15.687 --> 00:17.850
and the outlook for 2025.

5
00:17.850 --> 00:19.350
My name is Martine Paris,

6
00:19.350 --> 00:22.560
and I am a Features Correspondent for the BBC,

7
00:22.560 --> 00:25.860
and I also write a column for Forbes on AI.

8
00:25.860 --> 00:28.200
And joining me here on stage today

9
00:28.200 --> 00:31.680
is Tina Jeffress of Panasonic,

10
00:31.680 --> 00:35.880
Dr. Sabrina Rathgeber of Bosch,

11
00:35.880 --> 00:39.840
and Sujay Sharma of BP Pulse.

12
00:39.840 --> 00:43.320
And so before we begin, I just would like you guys

13
00:43.320 --> 00:45.030
to tell us a little bit about yourselves

14
00:45.030 --> 00:48.930
and the role that you are playing in the EV ecosystem.

15
00:48.930 --> 00:50.430
Tina, let's begin with you.

16
00:50.430 --> 00:51.516
<v ->Sure.</v>

17
00:51.516 --> 00:52.349
Hi, Tina Jeffress.

18
00:52.349 --> 00:54.570
I lead Energy and Sustainability Policy

19
00:54.570 --> 00:55.980
for Panasonic North America

20
00:55.980 --> 00:58.080
and Panasonic Energy North America.

21
00:58.080 --> 01:01.770
So Panasonic Energy is one of the world's largest producers

22
01:01.770 --> 01:05.280
of lithium ion battery cells for EV applications.

23
01:05.280 --> 01:07.710
We make cylindrical cells in Reno, Nevada,

24
01:07.710 --> 01:10.170
and we're excited to soon open our new plant

25
01:10.170 --> 01:11.250
in De Soto, Kansas.

26
01:11.250 --> 01:14.130
So excited to talk about where we sit in the ecosystem

27
01:14.130 --> 01:16.110
and all of the growth we're seeing domestically here

28
01:16.110 --> 01:16.943
in the US.

29
01:17.910 --> 01:18.990
<v ->So, hi, everyone.</v>

30
01:18.990 --> 01:21.390
My name is Sabrina Rathgeber.

31
01:21.390 --> 01:23.760
I'm working for Bosch Manufacturing Solutions.

32
01:23.760 --> 01:25.980
So we are the turnkey provider

33
01:25.980 --> 01:28.140
for manufacturing equipment from Bosch.

34
01:28.140 --> 01:29.820
And within that area,

35
01:29.820 --> 01:31.920
I'm responsible globally for the battery business.

36
01:31.920 --> 01:34.530
So everything around manufacturing of battery,

37
01:34.530 --> 01:36.960
but also for sure new technologies

38
01:36.960 --> 01:39.993
which are evolving in the upcoming next years.

39
01:41.370 --> 01:42.203
<v ->Hi, everyone.</v>

40
01:42.203 --> 01:43.036
I'm Sujay Sharma.

41
01:43.036 --> 01:44.550
I run BP Pulse,

42
01:44.550 --> 01:46.350
and if you're asking what is BP Pulse,

43
01:46.350 --> 01:51.350
it is the EV charging brand of the energy major BP.

44
01:52.440 --> 01:55.560
We operate in 12 different countries worldwide

45
01:55.560 --> 01:57.960
with over 40,000 charge points.

46
01:57.960 --> 02:00.300
And we are just getting in the process

47
02:00.300 --> 02:04.260
of scaling up our EV charging presence

48
02:04.260 --> 02:05.640
across the United States.

49
02:05.640 --> 02:07.050
So I run that business.

50
02:07.050 --> 02:08.040
<v ->Thank you.</v>

51
02:08.040 --> 02:09.990
All right, so as we all know,

52
02:09.990 --> 02:13.113
EV adoption has been lagging in the US.

53
02:15.360 --> 02:18.390
It's behind nations like Norway and China.

54
02:18.390 --> 02:21.660
Why is this, Tina?

55
02:21.660 --> 02:23.100
<v ->Yeah, I'd like to first say</v>

56
02:23.100 --> 02:24.450
that I think we're still seeing

57
02:24.450 --> 02:26.970
very consistent growth in the industry.

58
02:26.970 --> 02:30.000
So Panasonic currently makes 66 batteries a second

59
02:30.000 --> 02:33.420
in Reno, Nevada, about billions of cells a year.

60
02:33.420 --> 02:35.550
And so we have been really happy

61
02:35.550 --> 02:38.490
to be a part of mass adoption of EVs in the US.

62
02:38.490 --> 02:42.000
We were a part of bringing the first affordable EVs

63
02:42.000 --> 02:44.010
that were still high performance online.

64
02:44.010 --> 02:46.740
And so I think we're continuing to see that progress,

65
02:46.740 --> 02:48.060
and I anticipate in the next year

66
02:48.060 --> 02:49.980
we're going to see so much of the work

67
02:49.980 --> 02:52.800
that's gone into date, really come to life.

68
02:52.800 --> 02:55.650
Just earlier this week, we announced our,

69
02:55.650 --> 02:57.270
a new partnership with Lucid Motors

70
02:57.270 --> 03:01.950
to provide cells to their new SUV, the Gravity.

71
03:01.950 --> 03:05.940
And already there we're gonna see 450 miles of range,

72
03:05.940 --> 03:08.970
and that will also be with the mass adoption,

73
03:08.970 --> 03:10.680
bringing down costs over time.

74
03:10.680 --> 03:12.930
So I think many of the concerns that we hear about,

75
03:12.930 --> 03:14.310
and we'll talk about today,

76
03:14.310 --> 03:16.290
we're already making great progress on.

77
03:16.290 --> 03:18.120
<v ->I just wanna ask you,</v>

78
03:18.120 --> 03:22.320
I mean Panasonic also supplies the batteries to Tesla,

79
03:22.320 --> 03:26.880
is that correct, and other car makers, is that right?

80
03:26.880 --> 03:27.713
Here in the US?

81
03:27.713 --> 03:29.190
<v ->We provide multiple OEMs, yes.</v>

82
03:29.190 --> 03:30.630
<v ->Okay, thank you.</v>

83
03:30.630 --> 03:31.463
That's okay.

84
03:31.463 --> 03:33.510
<v ->Yeah, so Tina, I can totally agree on what you say.</v>

85
03:33.510 --> 03:38.130
So generally, we from Bosch also still see that until 2030,

86
03:38.130 --> 03:42.960
we expect EV range from 30 to 40% globally.

87
03:42.960 --> 03:45.390
So we still see that the market is growing,

88
03:45.390 --> 03:47.610
even though the growth has slowed down,

89
03:47.610 --> 03:50.733
to the predicted growth rates we saw a couple of years ago.

90
03:51.840 --> 03:53.940
So however, coming back to your question,

91
03:53.940 --> 03:58.260
if I can give some insights on what they did in Norway,

92
03:58.260 --> 04:02.510
they, from the government, supported really the sales of EV.

93
04:02.510 --> 04:04.170
So how did they do that?

94
04:04.170 --> 04:08.040
There is no tax if you purchase a new EV car in Norway.

95
04:08.040 --> 04:09.300
And in addition to that,

96
04:09.300 --> 04:11.970
there are other amenities like special lanes

97
04:11.970 --> 04:13.410
where you can drive with your EV,

98
04:13.410 --> 04:15.450
free parking in the cities.

99
04:15.450 --> 04:18.453
And also because they wanted to push that business further,

100
04:19.410 --> 04:22.410
they build up lots of charging stations on their own

101
04:22.410 --> 04:24.090
from the governmental side.

102
04:24.090 --> 04:27.300
So by doing so, they achieved the fantastic results.

103
04:27.300 --> 04:30.930
So last year, sorry, last year already, 2024,

104
04:30.930 --> 04:34.500
the overall market share of EV in new cars

105
04:34.500 --> 04:38.580
was 89% for just pure electric cars.

106
04:38.580 --> 04:39.930
And for this year,

107
04:39.930 --> 04:43.890
Norway is already targeting 100% as their own target.

108
04:43.890 --> 04:47.280
So they will just, they target to only,

109
04:47.280 --> 04:49.233
yeah, get new cars sold as an EV.

110
04:51.180 --> 04:53.725
<v ->Yeah, I mean I used to run our China business</v>

111
04:53.725 --> 04:55.110
in EV charging before this.

112
04:55.110 --> 05:00.110
And you know, what it comes down to is choice and economics

113
05:00.240 --> 05:02.670
on the electric vehicle side of things.

114
05:02.670 --> 05:07.670
Choice wise, we have a growing number of models and cars

115
05:08.100 --> 05:11.550
coming in at different price points in the US,

116
05:11.550 --> 05:14.010
but admittedly, you know,

117
05:14.010 --> 05:16.680
they've mostly been Teslas up until recently,

118
05:16.680 --> 05:19.410
but that trend is now starting to change.

119
05:19.410 --> 05:21.210
So as there's more choice,

120
05:21.210 --> 05:24.000
I think that will lead to more adoption.

121
05:24.000 --> 05:26.190
The other point that's really important in all of this

122
05:26.190 --> 05:29.850
is economics, making cars, nice cars

123
05:29.850 --> 05:32.700
that people want to drive that are economically friendly.

124
05:34.110 --> 05:37.080
And there's an industry component to this

125
05:37.080 --> 05:38.430
that the industry can facilitate

126
05:38.430 --> 05:41.100
by making cars that are more economical, and that's coming.

127
05:41.100 --> 05:42.915
And there's another part of this,

128
05:42.915 --> 05:45.360
which colleagues here have spoken about,

129
05:45.360 --> 05:48.900
which is incentive, subsidies, what have you,

130
05:48.900 --> 05:52.800
and that encourages adoption as well.

131
05:52.800 --> 05:56.820
And I would not say that, I mean the US is today at 10%.

132
05:56.820 --> 06:00.030
I think as of last year, 2024,

133
06:00.030 --> 06:03.093
10% of new car sales were EVs.

134
06:04.020 --> 06:06.780
Just way back in 2019, it was 2%.

135
06:06.780 --> 06:10.230
So we've gone from 2% to 10% in five years.

136
06:10.230 --> 06:13.200
It's good progression, and it'll continue to grow.

137
06:13.200 --> 06:16.200
<v ->And I think California penetration is above 25%,</v>

138
06:16.200 --> 06:19.890
but that's because California has had a lot of incentives,

139
06:19.890 --> 06:21.360
many of which are now gone.

140
06:21.360 --> 06:25.050
But incentives do seem to play a role.

141
06:25.050 --> 06:26.853
Price is a big issue.

142
06:28.860 --> 06:31.710
We, seems I've been told,

143
06:31.710 --> 06:36.660
the magic number is to try to get a car under $30,000

144
06:36.660 --> 06:40.470
for over 300 mile range.

145
06:40.470 --> 06:42.690
So I think the Chevy Equinox has come out.

146
06:42.690 --> 06:44.130
Have you, what are your thoughts

147
06:44.130 --> 06:49.130
on other American made car makers being able to do the same,

148
06:51.300 --> 06:54.240
offer the same type of affordability?

149
06:54.240 --> 06:57.390
<v ->Yeah, I think we are getting closer to price parity</v>

150
06:57.390 --> 07:00.540
on EVs and ICE vehicles across all segments.

151
07:00.540 --> 07:02.880
It's going to take time, but we're getting there.

152
07:02.880 --> 07:05.070
Already, if you purchase a vehicle

153
07:05.070 --> 07:08.730
that is around the same price point, ICE, EV,

154
07:08.730 --> 07:11.460
research from the Zero Energy Transportation Association

155
07:11.460 --> 07:12.293
in DC

156
07:12.293 --> 07:13.980
shows that you can expect anywhere

157
07:13.980 --> 07:17.520
between eight and 12 grand in lifecycle savings on the EV.

158
07:17.520 --> 07:19.230
So we do need to really,

159
07:19.230 --> 07:21.330
there's definitely an education component here

160
07:21.330 --> 07:24.570
on showing people that it's not just sticker price,

161
07:24.570 --> 07:26.820
it's also about the reduced maintenance,

162
07:26.820 --> 07:30.390
not buying fuel, and all of the other efficiencies

163
07:30.390 --> 07:33.690
that you get from a cost perspective when you own an EV.

164
07:33.690 --> 07:37.770
And of course on the sticker price point,

165
07:37.770 --> 07:40.500
incentives like the 30D tax credit,

166
07:40.500 --> 07:44.430
as well as those credits that support the manufacturers

167
07:44.430 --> 07:45.990
and the materials providers

168
07:45.990 --> 07:48.150
are really helping to bring down costs

169
07:48.150 --> 07:51.120
and make these vehicles more accessible for everyone.

170
07:51.120 --> 07:52.440
<v ->Yeah, I totally agree.</v>

171
07:52.440 --> 07:55.410
I mean, if you look on the price point

172
07:55.410 --> 07:57.390
from an electric vehicle,

173
07:57.390 --> 08:00.780
the biggest portion is coming from the battery.

174
08:00.780 --> 08:04.560
And although from the battery point of view,

175
08:04.560 --> 08:06.960
the material is also still a big portion,

176
08:06.960 --> 08:09.810
but there's also a lots of cost,

177
08:09.810 --> 08:12.150
yeah, which is coming from the production.

178
08:12.150 --> 08:15.540
And in terms of production efficiency,

179
08:15.540 --> 08:18.360
a lot of things develop the recent years.

180
08:18.360 --> 08:20.700
I mean many of us have heard

181
08:20.700 --> 08:25.080
that especially the cell manufacturing are suffering

182
08:25.080 --> 08:26.130
and having output,

183
08:26.130 --> 08:30.600
but we also see same things about the module manufacturing.

184
08:30.600 --> 08:32.610
So especially here within Bosch,

185
08:32.610 --> 08:36.030
we have great technology to ensure a more stable production

186
08:36.030 --> 08:37.290
and to increase the output.

187
08:37.290 --> 08:41.010
And if we have an increased efficiency in the production,

188
08:41.010 --> 08:44.223
this will then also lower in the price of the total battery.

189
08:45.960 --> 08:47.332
<v ->Yeah, I think just building on that,</v>

190
08:47.332 --> 08:49.470
and my colleagues here will know this better.

191
08:49.470 --> 08:52.500
I mean, battery pack prices are hovering around

192
08:52.500 --> 08:55.860
that 100, magical $100 per kilowatt hour number.

193
08:55.860 --> 08:57.390
I mean I think just in the last year,

194
08:57.390 --> 09:00.210
I was reading they've dropped about 15 or 20%

195
09:00.210 --> 09:01.620
from the year before.

196
09:01.620 --> 09:04.710
So pack prices are getting cheaper,

197
09:04.710 --> 09:06.930
economies of scale are growing,

198
09:06.930 --> 09:10.500
and we've got I think 40 or $50 billion now

199
09:10.500 --> 09:13.680
that's going into EV manufacturing

200
09:13.680 --> 09:17.620
or EV supporting sort of industries in the US

201
09:18.660 --> 09:21.960
and will be going live in the next couple of years.

202
09:21.960 --> 09:24.570
So, and a lot more models coming out with that as well.

203
09:24.570 --> 09:26.670
So I think those economies are coming in.

204
09:26.670 --> 09:27.750
And I think the other thing is,

205
09:27.750 --> 09:29.010
as you look at the other markets,

206
09:29.010 --> 09:31.410
you look at Europe for example,

207
09:31.410 --> 09:35.010
and you look at the trend of pricing of vehicles in Europe

208
09:35.010 --> 09:37.170
over the last four or five years,

209
09:37.170 --> 09:38.670
if you had looked at it four or five years ago,

210
09:38.670 --> 09:40.710
the average price was about 60,000 euros

211
09:40.710 --> 09:42.540
or somewhere in that range.

212
09:42.540 --> 09:45.060
Today, that price is trending downwards

213
09:45.060 --> 09:47.910
more into the 30 to 40,000 euro range.

214
09:47.910 --> 09:50.100
We'll see the same sort of thing happen here in the US.

215
09:50.100 --> 09:51.330
So it's coming,

216
09:51.330 --> 09:53.130
and it's probably coming in the next couple of years

217
09:53.130 --> 09:54.210
if it's,

218
09:54.210 --> 09:56.040
and then everything that Tina spoke about

219
09:56.040 --> 09:58.560
in terms of the efficiency of operating the vehicle

220
09:58.560 --> 10:00.900
will just make it that much more beneficial.

221
10:00.900 --> 10:05.580
<v ->Let's talk about ubiquity of charging stations</v>

222
10:05.580 --> 10:07.500
or charging options.

223
10:07.500 --> 10:08.910
Maybe, Sujay, you can take this,

224
10:08.910 --> 10:11.550
but what can we look forward to in this year

225
10:11.550 --> 10:14.310
in terms of hot trends in charging,

226
10:14.310 --> 10:17.940
whether it's in-home or new venues

227
10:17.940 --> 10:19.590
that we could start to see?

228
10:19.590 --> 10:23.610
Is there any, are there any initiatives

229
10:23.610 --> 10:27.720
behind helping existing gas stations adopt

230
10:29.010 --> 10:34.010
or add charging stations to their space?

231
10:37.020 --> 10:40.470
<v ->Yeah, so especially on highways for example,</v>

232
10:40.470 --> 10:43.140
there is NEVI funding,

233
10:43.140 --> 10:45.090
at least that exists currently,

234
10:45.090 --> 10:48.000
which is available to put in charging

235
10:48.000 --> 10:49.830
along highway corridors.

236
10:49.830 --> 10:51.990
And that's incentivized a lot of companies

237
10:51.990 --> 10:55.260
to put in charging at those locations where it's needed,

238
10:55.260 --> 10:59.490
at 50 to 100 miles sort of intervals.

239
10:59.490 --> 11:01.320
And with that incentive,

240
11:01.320 --> 11:03.390
there are requirements around uptime,

241
11:03.390 --> 11:05.940
which is an area that we are quite focused on,

242
11:05.940 --> 11:08.220
is having a good customer experience.

243
11:08.220 --> 11:09.750
It comes back to customer experience.

244
11:09.750 --> 11:11.730
Customer choice, customer experience,

245
11:11.730 --> 11:13.320
you know, that's sort of the theme.

246
11:13.320 --> 11:15.750
And having good reliability,

247
11:15.750 --> 11:20.750
having good uptime, having good conveniences.

248
11:20.910 --> 11:24.030
So BP operates eight and a half thousand

249
11:24.030 --> 11:27.270
BP branded or Amoco branded,

250
11:27.270 --> 11:30.120
Thorntons branded, TravelCenters of America branded,

251
11:30.120 --> 11:32.310
these are all BP brands,

252
11:32.310 --> 11:36.840
stores across the United States with us by ourselves,

253
11:36.840 --> 11:38.100
or with our partners.

254
11:38.100 --> 11:41.130
And all of these create choice for the consumer.

255
11:41.130 --> 11:43.770
You know, when they are waiting for the car to charge,

256
11:43.770 --> 11:47.340
they can go in, have a meal, do whatever they need to.

257
11:47.340 --> 11:49.680
So those conveniences are important,

258
11:49.680 --> 11:53.380
and we see that our consumers who are in the EV space

259
11:54.420 --> 11:57.120
do like that way of charging,

260
11:57.120 --> 11:59.760
of going to the traditional sort of gas station.

261
11:59.760 --> 12:01.470
But in addition to that,

262
12:01.470 --> 12:04.110
consumers are also consuming their charging differently.

263
12:04.110 --> 12:06.330
So for example, a few months back,

264
12:06.330 --> 12:09.750
we announced a collaboration with Simon Properties,

265
12:09.750 --> 12:13.290
and at malls and destination locations as well.

266
12:13.290 --> 12:15.510
Fast charging, not just slow charging,

267
12:15.510 --> 12:18.120
not level two charging, but fast charging

268
12:18.120 --> 12:22.800
is becoming more ubiquitous and penetrating more deeply.

269
12:22.800 --> 12:25.770
And so these kinds of collaborations

270
12:25.770 --> 12:28.440
will become more important as well to give consumers choice.

271
12:28.440 --> 12:33.440
<v ->Is BP happy with the rate of change this past year?</v>

272
12:33.570 --> 12:36.780
Because with all the NEVI funding

273
12:36.780 --> 12:40.443
and funding from the Infrastructure Act and so forth,

274
12:41.370 --> 12:43.290
there has been criticism

275
12:43.290 --> 12:48.213
that not enough of the charging network has been expanded.

276
12:49.980 --> 12:51.024
<v ->Yeah.</v>

277
12:51.024 --> 12:51.857
<v ->What are your thoughts on that?</v>

278
12:51.857 --> 12:53.940
<v ->I think, so this is a, it's a very good question.</v>

279
12:53.940 --> 12:56.460
So really, there are a couple of things

280
12:56.460 --> 12:58.620
that are important for charging, three things.

281
12:58.620 --> 13:01.860
We call place, power and permitting, right?

282
13:01.860 --> 13:04.710
And the problem, so place is real estate.

283
13:04.710 --> 13:06.330
We don't have that problem.

284
13:06.330 --> 13:09.600
As I just spoke about, the 8,000 plus locations.

285
13:09.600 --> 13:12.420
Power is a big challenge, right?

286
13:12.420 --> 13:14.190
Power remains a continuous challenge,

287
13:14.190 --> 13:16.590
and that's something we continue to work with,

288
13:16.590 --> 13:19.200
and I think other industry players as well

289
13:19.200 --> 13:23.190
continue to work with the authorities on that.

290
13:23.190 --> 13:24.930
And then permitting is another big one.

291
13:24.930 --> 13:26.040
I mean, I'll give you a data point,

292
13:26.040 --> 13:29.130
in China to build a site end to end,

293
13:29.130 --> 13:30.870
from where you identify the real estate,

294
13:30.870 --> 13:33.600
negotiate the lease, to getting it online,

295
13:33.600 --> 13:36.180
a high voltage site is 90 days.

296
13:36.180 --> 13:37.380
90 days, yeah.

297
13:37.380 --> 13:40.410
Here, it'll take us anywhere between,

298
13:40.410 --> 13:42.810
you know, 18 months to an eternity,

299
13:42.810 --> 13:45.450
depending on which jurisdiction you're in.

300
13:45.450 --> 13:50.450
So I think we have to learn from other geographies,

301
13:51.060 --> 13:52.530
we have to look at other geographies,

302
13:52.530 --> 13:56.836
and we've gotta then fine tune our approach to that.

303
13:56.836 --> 13:58.620
And I think that still exists as an opportunity

304
13:58.620 --> 14:00.270
for us in the US.

305
14:00.270 --> 14:01.410
<v ->That's eyeopener.</v>

306
14:01.410 --> 14:03.780
Okay, I think there's somebody

307
14:03.780 --> 14:07.140
in charge of the Office of Efficiency coming on board

308
14:07.140 --> 14:09.483
that might expedite things.

309
14:12.000 --> 14:15.630
Okay, let's talk top trends for 2025.

310
14:15.630 --> 14:19.110
Americans have an obsession,

311
14:19.110 --> 14:21.060
there is a belief that Americans have an obsession

312
14:21.060 --> 14:23.640
with the need to escape the zombie apocalypse,

313
14:23.640 --> 14:26.970
to have a car that has enough range

314
14:26.970 --> 14:29.970
that in the case of an emergency,

315
14:29.970 --> 14:31.800
and we have a lot of natural disasters,

316
14:31.800 --> 14:33.180
one going on right now,

317
14:33.180 --> 14:35.310
where we feel like we need to get in our car and go.

318
14:35.310 --> 14:38.610
We wanna go far, we have a country that's what, 3,000 miles,

319
14:38.610 --> 14:40.560
and I'm sure that's the actual range

320
14:40.560 --> 14:42.420
everybody would feel most comfortable with.

321
14:42.420 --> 14:45.990
Even though we only use the car about, what, 50 miles a day.

322
14:45.990 --> 14:48.000
So the question is,

323
14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
for 2025, do you see Americans adopting plug-in hybrids

324
14:53.460 --> 14:56.070
at a faster clip than maybe EVs

325
14:56.070 --> 15:00.000
while we work out the situation of less expensive cars

326
15:00.000 --> 15:03.750
and better charging options?

327
15:03.750 --> 15:06.690
Because some of the plug-in hybrids right now are, what,

328
15:06.690 --> 15:09.930
getting like 600 miles, or better, 750.

329
15:09.930 --> 15:11.760
What are your thoughts on that?

330
15:11.760 --> 15:13.710
<v ->Yeah, happy to start on this one.</v>

331
15:13.710 --> 15:16.860
First off, I think plug-in hybrids are a bridge.

332
15:16.860 --> 15:21.030
They are a way to get people addicted to driving electric.

333
15:21.030 --> 15:24.510
Personally, my husband was not willing to buy an EV.

334
15:24.510 --> 15:26.550
I had been an evangelist for years,

335
15:26.550 --> 15:28.140
started working for Panasonic.

336
15:28.140 --> 15:30.450
I was desperate to get an EV for our family.

337
15:30.450 --> 15:33.420
He was not interested, we got a plug-in hybrid.

338
15:33.420 --> 15:34.410
Two months in,

339
15:34.410 --> 15:37.050
he said, I'm in, let's get on the list for a Rivian.

340
15:37.050 --> 15:38.040
And he was ready.

341
15:38.040 --> 15:40.680
And our range was only 20 miles.

342
15:40.680 --> 15:43.140
And with 20 miles of an electric range a day,

343
15:43.140 --> 15:46.140
he was like, oh, this is easy, this is no problem.

344
15:46.140 --> 15:47.820
So now we are an EV family.

345
15:47.820 --> 15:49.560
And so I do think when people

346
15:49.560 --> 15:52.800
are uncomfortable with the idea of driving electric,

347
15:52.800 --> 15:54.900
it can be a super powerful tool.

348
15:54.900 --> 15:56.790
But from a resource perspective,

349
15:56.790 --> 15:59.580
from a lifecycle emissions perspective,

350
15:59.580 --> 16:02.700
it does not give us the benefits of a full EV.

351
16:02.700 --> 16:04.710
So I think it's a great tool,

352
16:04.710 --> 16:05.850
but I would not want that

353
16:05.850 --> 16:09.480
to replace the trend toward electrification.

354
16:09.480 --> 16:12.090
<v ->Yeah, so maybe from a European perspective,</v>

355
16:12.090 --> 16:13.200
the story is a bit different,

356
16:13.200 --> 16:17.464
because gas prices are really, really high.

357
16:17.464 --> 16:19.710
And so if you use an hybrid,

358
16:19.710 --> 16:22.710
it doesn't even matter if it's a plug-in hybrid

359
16:22.710 --> 16:24.780
or just a mild hybrid.

360
16:24.780 --> 16:26.790
The hybrids are really common in Europe

361
16:26.790 --> 16:28.530
because they just help you

362
16:28.530 --> 16:31.710
to reduce the fuel consumption that much.

363
16:31.710 --> 16:33.390
So even if you then have

364
16:33.390 --> 16:37.320
like the electric drive and the ICE both in your car,

365
16:37.320 --> 16:41.400
it's still so helpful to drop the consumption down.

366
16:41.400 --> 16:45.270
So this is an addition topic, at least for Europe,

367
16:45.270 --> 16:47.940
why hybrids are really a huge interest

368
16:47.940 --> 16:49.323
for the end customers.

369
16:50.460 --> 16:52.080
<v ->Yeah, I think the only thing I'd go back to</v>

370
16:52.080 --> 16:53.940
what I said earlier about economics and choice,

371
16:53.940 --> 16:56.790
it's, you know, consumer choice.

372
16:56.790 --> 16:59.640
What we've seen more of is, you know,

373
16:59.640 --> 17:02.910
in the past decade, it was more about gas and diesel.

374
17:02.910 --> 17:04.170
There was not that much choice.

375
17:04.170 --> 17:06.240
And now, and you see this in the advertising

376
17:06.240 --> 17:08.790
of many of the OEMs, they talk about choice.

377
17:08.790 --> 17:10.350
You can get a gas power train,

378
17:10.350 --> 17:14.520
you can get an electric power train, you can, you know?

379
17:14.520 --> 17:17.520
And so I think where consumers are going with this

380
17:17.520 --> 17:19.710
is that they want to have the choice,

381
17:19.710 --> 17:21.990
and then depending on what suits

382
17:21.990 --> 17:25.230
their lifestyle or their needs, they will pick and choose.

383
17:25.230 --> 17:27.060
You know, for, I know a lot of folks

384
17:27.060 --> 17:31.890
who don't maybe have the comfort of, you know,

385
17:31.890 --> 17:33.390
are not comfortable with EVs,

386
17:33.390 --> 17:35.310
and so their primary car is a gas car,

387
17:35.310 --> 17:37.020
but their secondary car is an EV car.

388
17:37.020 --> 17:38.237
I mean we have, you know, what,

389
17:38.237 --> 17:41.460
2.5 vehicles on average per household or whatever in the US.

390
17:41.460 --> 17:43.830
So there's plenty of love to go around I think

391
17:43.830 --> 17:46.440
for all power trains.

392
17:46.440 --> 17:47.273
<v ->Yeah.</v>

393
17:47.273 --> 17:51.630
Okay, another hot topic for 2025, power.

394
17:51.630 --> 17:55.050
Not just nuclear power, all types of power.

395
17:55.050 --> 18:00.050
AI is eating the world, and EVs, and AVs along with it,

396
18:00.750 --> 18:05.750
impacting grids, EVs may even help power grids.

397
18:05.850 --> 18:07.983
What are your thoughts on power?

398
18:09.540 --> 18:12.330
<v ->I think as we transition to a fully electrified world,</v>

399
18:12.330 --> 18:15.420
power is front of mind for everyone.

400
18:15.420 --> 18:17.430
There is definitely a misnomer

401
18:17.430 --> 18:21.000
that until we fully transition our energy system,

402
18:21.000 --> 18:23.160
that it doesn't make sense to drive an EV.

403
18:23.160 --> 18:24.510
So first things first,

404
18:24.510 --> 18:27.030
anywhere you drive an EV in the US,

405
18:27.030 --> 18:29.250
regardless of whether that's a coal-dominant grid

406
18:29.250 --> 18:30.570
or fully renewable,

407
18:30.570 --> 18:34.050
you're seeing lower lifecycle emissions over time.

408
18:34.050 --> 18:36.360
So the environmental benefits are really clear.

409
18:36.360 --> 18:37.800
What we have to figure out now

410
18:37.800 --> 18:41.130
is how EVs can be an asset for the grid,

411
18:41.130 --> 18:44.010
and not further exacerbate the power shortages

412
18:44.010 --> 18:45.660
we're seeing throughout the country.

413
18:45.660 --> 18:48.180
Panasonic actually has a business

414
18:48.180 --> 18:49.890
that's working on this issue,

415
18:49.890 --> 18:52.200
figuring out how to electrify fleets,

416
18:52.200 --> 18:55.410
and how to manage the charging on these fleets

417
18:55.410 --> 18:57.150
that have predictable routes

418
18:57.150 --> 18:58.500
so that you can do it at a time

419
18:58.500 --> 19:00.420
when maybe power might be curtailed,

420
19:00.420 --> 19:03.090
because there's excess solar in California,

421
19:03.090 --> 19:06.270
and not charge those fleets at a time

422
19:06.270 --> 19:08.250
when there's a huge demand for power.

423
19:08.250 --> 19:11.340
One of my pet interests, because I have young children,

424
19:11.340 --> 19:13.260
is electrified school buses.

425
19:13.260 --> 19:16.470
And they could be an amazing asset for the grid,

426
19:16.470 --> 19:20.280
because they can be, they don't have to be charged

427
19:20.280 --> 19:24.180
and ready to operate when power demand is at their highest.

428
19:24.180 --> 19:27.330
So at seven o'clock, you don't need to plug in

429
19:27.330 --> 19:28.260
an electric bus,

430
19:28.260 --> 19:31.530
it can charge overnight when everyone else is sleeping.

431
19:31.530 --> 19:34.890
So there are definitely use cases where the grid,

432
19:34.890 --> 19:37.080
where the vehicles can be an asset for the grid

433
19:37.080 --> 19:39.210
beyond just the V2X applications

434
19:39.210 --> 19:40.500
that we all love to talk about.

435
19:40.500 --> 19:43.500
So I think that EVs are a part of the solution here.

436
19:43.500 --> 19:45.660
<v ->Is Panasonic working on solutions</v>

437
19:45.660 --> 19:48.030
for bidirectional powering,

438
19:48.030 --> 19:51.120
meaning power going back to the grid from the EV.

439
19:51.120 --> 19:52.350
<v ->It's definitely of interest,</v>

440
19:52.350 --> 19:55.380
but it's not an area that I've particularly focused on.

441
19:55.380 --> 19:56.213
<v Martine>Sabrina?</v>

442
19:56.213 --> 19:58.950
<v ->But so seems that we're perfectly on the same page</v>

443
19:58.950 --> 19:59.783
all the time, Tina,

444
19:59.783 --> 20:02.820
because I only can agree again to just what you said.

445
20:02.820 --> 20:07.820
Like in Europe, we saw last year,

446
20:09.120 --> 20:10.680
or especially in Germany even,

447
20:10.680 --> 20:14.970
63% of the energy we were using was renewable.

448
20:14.970 --> 20:17.310
Even though the weather was not so good,

449
20:17.310 --> 20:18.150
we had lots of rain,

450
20:18.150 --> 20:22.650
but still with all the well tanks and wind, we got like 63%.

451
20:22.650 --> 20:25.470
But again, we also see here challenges

452
20:25.470 --> 20:26.970
about how we can balance it.

453
20:26.970 --> 20:29.100
And this is also something Bosch is working on,

454
20:29.100 --> 20:30.750
because for sure then we need

455
20:30.750 --> 20:32.610
a different battery management system.

456
20:32.610 --> 20:35.400
We need to see how we can use the batteries in the car

457
20:35.400 --> 20:36.780
to balance the grid.

458
20:36.780 --> 20:38.400
But this is something we have to do.

459
20:38.400 --> 20:42.000
And again, looking to the success story of Norway,

460
20:42.000 --> 20:44.700
we really need to have a clear commitment

461
20:44.700 --> 20:45.810
also from the government,

462
20:45.810 --> 20:48.120
because in the end, also the infrastructure

463
20:48.120 --> 20:50.460
needs to be able to cover that.

464
20:50.460 --> 20:53.670
But if everybody's pulling in the same direction,

465
20:53.670 --> 20:58.200
we for sure can easily realize that also EVs are just,

466
20:58.200 --> 21:01.410
yeah, energized with 100% electric energy.

467
21:01.410 --> 21:06.410
<v ->How far away is the US from transitioning</v>

468
21:07.050 --> 21:12.050
from coal and other carbon disastrous sources for the grid

469
21:17.910 --> 21:19.080
to renewables?

470
21:19.080 --> 21:20.373
How far away are we?

471
21:21.300 --> 21:23.160
<v ->Yeah, happy to start there.</v>

472
21:23.160 --> 21:25.830
So we operate our, we're building our facility

473
21:25.830 --> 21:28.590
in De Soto, Kansas, which has a good amount of wind energy,

474
21:28.590 --> 21:31.110
and it's really close to the national average of renewables,

475
21:31.110 --> 21:33.360
so around 30%.

476
21:33.360 --> 21:34.890
We are, across the country,

477
21:34.890 --> 21:37.920
continuing to see coal plant retirements.

478
21:37.920 --> 21:39.900
And even where we're not seeing retirements,

479
21:39.900 --> 21:42.210
we're seeing those plants run less

480
21:42.210 --> 21:45.270
because they are not as efficient, they don't make sense.

481
21:45.270 --> 21:46.680
One of my favorite anecdotes

482
21:46.680 --> 21:49.710
is that during one of the really disastrous winter storms

483
21:49.710 --> 21:51.180
last year,

484
21:51.180 --> 21:53.550
I think everyone thinks that in the extreme scenarios,

485
21:53.550 --> 21:54.960
you need fossil fuels.

486
21:54.960 --> 21:58.920
In this particular storm, the solar outperformed,

487
21:58.920 --> 22:01.080
the wind energy outperformed,

488
22:01.080 --> 22:02.880
and the coal stacks were frozen.

489
22:02.880 --> 22:06.840
And so the utility was having to blow dry the coal stacks

490
22:06.840 --> 22:08.700
in order to run their plants.

491
22:08.700 --> 22:10.680
So the economics are there.

492
22:10.680 --> 22:13.380
We may not see price parity every single day,

493
22:13.380 --> 22:16.590
but the levelized cost of renewable energy is going down,

494
22:16.590 --> 22:18.900
and now it's just about getting things online.

495
22:18.900 --> 22:20.730
So it gets back to permitting,

496
22:20.730 --> 22:24.390
which is I think what we could tie everything to here,

497
22:24.390 --> 22:27.870
but getting permitting in place, getting more transmission.

498
22:27.870 --> 22:30.210
We have the technology now

499
22:30.210 --> 22:31.773
<v ->What about ethanol?</v>

500
22:32.730 --> 22:35.970
That the crops, you know, being transitioned

501
22:35.970 --> 22:38.730
to renewable fuel.

502
22:38.730 --> 22:40.800
I mean, are you guys looking at that at all?

503
22:40.800 --> 22:42.900
I know that came up during our panel call.

504
22:44.400 --> 22:46.260
<v ->Yeah, maybe I can say something.</v>

505
22:46.260 --> 22:49.050
So from a Bosch perspective for sure, we also work on that.

506
22:49.050 --> 22:51.870
Yeah, that we kind of would be able

507
22:51.870 --> 22:53.520
to fire this kind of fuel.

508
22:53.520 --> 22:56.250
But just from a general overall

509
22:56.250 --> 22:58.650
energy calculation point of view,

510
22:58.650 --> 23:00.000
it just doesn't make sense,

511
23:00.000 --> 23:02.190
because the energy output you get

512
23:02.190 --> 23:06.960
of this kind of energy storage like ethanol,

513
23:06.960 --> 23:09.360
it's actually not attractive at all.

514
23:09.360 --> 23:11.490
<v ->Yeah, and then I know we're talking about EVs,</v>

515
23:11.490 --> 23:15.540
but the hydrogen also is always comes up.

516
23:15.540 --> 23:17.010
Is that ever gonna happen?

517
23:17.010 --> 23:19.710
I mean there's no hydrogen stations.

518
23:19.710 --> 23:21.813
What are your thoughts on hydrogen?

519
23:24.090 --> 23:25.890
<v ->Okay, so my thoughts on hydrogen,</v>

520
23:25.890 --> 23:28.380
I mean, again, like in Bosch strategy,

521
23:28.380 --> 23:31.383
we still believe that hydrogen will be a big thing,

522
23:32.220 --> 23:36.000
because we don't see that electric trucks

523
23:36.000 --> 23:38.880
will really bridge the huge distances.

524
23:38.880 --> 23:40.320
And from our perspective,

525
23:40.320 --> 23:43.920
the only good solution to follow that up is by hydrogen.

526
23:43.920 --> 23:47.910
And also maybe we use hydrogen for storage of energy.

527
23:47.910 --> 23:50.250
I mean we still have to think about

528
23:50.250 --> 23:53.640
how we can create energy all over the globe,

529
23:53.640 --> 23:57.003
and how can we store and transport it.

530
23:58.050 --> 24:00.690
With hydrogen, we have a solution in our hand,

531
24:00.690 --> 24:03.720
which is already working really well at the moment,

532
24:03.720 --> 24:06.870
but still we see the market is hesitating.

533
24:06.870 --> 24:08.820
So we don't know how long it will take

534
24:08.820 --> 24:12.810
till this topic is really starting to outperform,

535
24:12.810 --> 24:14.340
but it will happen.

536
24:14.340 --> 24:16.230
<v ->And we've been talking about hydrogen for, what,</v>

537
24:16.230 --> 24:17.320
25 years I think.

538
24:17.320 --> 24:20.160
<v ->Yeah, I mean electrolyzer technology is, I don't know,</v>

539
24:20.160 --> 24:21.750
probably older than that, right?

540
24:21.750 --> 24:22.583
So it's not new.

541
24:22.583 --> 24:27.583
I think the question is, you know, use of hydrogen

542
24:27.930 --> 24:31.740
and industrial use versus transportation,

543
24:31.740 --> 24:33.870
which is kind of what you're talking about.

544
24:33.870 --> 24:37.170
And I think the use for industrial use cases

545
24:37.170 --> 24:38.910
is a little bit easier,

546
24:38.910 --> 24:41.490
and to make the economics network is a little bit easier.

547
24:41.490 --> 24:44.430
And we can probably see that come to fruition.

548
24:44.430 --> 24:48.390
And BP has a number of projects we've announced globally,

549
24:48.390 --> 24:51.270
one in Europe, one in Australia

550
24:51.270 --> 24:52.800
that we are pursuing in that space.

551
24:52.800 --> 24:55.710
But transportation is, to your point,

552
24:55.710 --> 24:57.750
a little bit of a different animal,

553
24:57.750 --> 25:00.510
because you've got to, you know,

554
25:00.510 --> 25:04.770
compress it, decompress it, move it, it's explosive,

555
25:04.770 --> 25:07.170
it's under pressure, it's difficult.

556
25:07.170 --> 25:09.840
It's difficult and it's economically challenging.

557
25:09.840 --> 25:13.650
And there's a lot of very smart folks, in Bosch, I'm sure,

558
25:13.650 --> 25:16.620
and other companies that have, BP, that are working on it.

559
25:16.620 --> 25:20.670
But that probably will take a little bit of more time

560
25:20.670 --> 25:22.350
for the transportation use case, I think.

561
25:22.350 --> 25:25.920
<v ->Is BP looking at nuclear power for powering?</v>

562
25:25.920 --> 25:28.140
<v ->We're not currently in the nuclear power business.</v>

563
25:28.140 --> 25:29.613
That's what I'll say.

564
25:29.613 --> 25:31.500
<v ->I had to ask.</v>

565
25:31.500 --> 25:33.840
Okay, autonomy.

566
25:33.840 --> 25:38.370
Is the future of EVs autonomous?

567
25:38.370 --> 25:42.273
<v ->I think the short answer is yes, and but.</v>

568
25:43.350 --> 25:44.850
I think it'll take us a while,

569
25:44.850 --> 25:47.130
a little bit of time to get there.

570
25:47.130 --> 25:50.250
I think the US is gonna take the lead in that space,

571
25:50.250 --> 25:52.080
because from a regulatory perspective,

572
25:52.080 --> 25:55.110
again, back to maybe permitting in a way,

573
25:55.110 --> 25:59.130
the US has been a little bit more open-minded about it,

574
25:59.130 --> 26:02.160
and or has been more advanced rather than open-minded.

575
26:02.160 --> 26:03.750
Open-minded is perhaps not the right term,

576
26:03.750 --> 26:08.160
but more advanced in terms of what some of the companies

577
26:08.160 --> 26:09.960
that are even presenting here are doing.

578
26:09.960 --> 26:13.320
We've had some that have succeeded, some that are trying,

579
26:13.320 --> 26:15.210
some that have failed.

580
26:15.210 --> 26:17.310
I think it'll definitely be a hot topic

581
26:17.310 --> 26:19.170
over the next five years.

582
26:19.170 --> 26:24.170
How quickly it scales is a different question.

583
26:24.360 --> 26:27.870
And does it scale uniformly across the entire US,

584
26:27.870 --> 26:30.690
and when does it transfer to other geographies like Europe?

585
26:30.690 --> 26:33.060
Those, there's probably smarter people

586
26:33.060 --> 26:34.650
that can answer that question.

587
26:34.650 --> 26:39.650
<v ->What are your thoughts on autonomy driving EV adoption?</v>

588
26:41.160 --> 26:44.010
<v ->Definite, I mean, we can see autonomy</v>

589
26:44.010 --> 26:48.840
has a very good use case for transportation,

590
26:48.840 --> 26:52.830
for goods delivery, for mobility in general.

591
26:52.830 --> 26:55.410
So it is definitely,

592
26:55.410 --> 26:59.793
if you can get to the maturity on the technology,

593
27:00.930 --> 27:02.490
it's going to scale.

594
27:02.490 --> 27:05.220
It's the question of how and when do you get

595
27:05.220 --> 27:07.200
to the maturity on the technology?

596
27:07.200 --> 27:09.780
And I think also from an EV charging perspective,

597
27:09.780 --> 27:12.810
then the charging solutions that you need maybe today

598
27:12.810 --> 27:16.500
where there's an individual driving the vehicle,

599
27:16.500 --> 27:19.080
versus tomorrow where it's autonomous, you don't, you know,

600
27:19.080 --> 27:22.380
you can bring it back to a base to charge,

601
27:22.380 --> 27:23.213
which doesn't have to

602
27:23.213 --> 27:25.620
maybe be in an urban center, et cetera.

603
27:25.620 --> 27:30.510
So as we look at how we design our networks

604
27:30.510 --> 27:32.520
for charging for the future,

605
27:32.520 --> 27:35.430
these are some of the things that we consider

606
27:35.430 --> 27:39.150
and our thinking about as well as we go into the future.

607
27:39.150 --> 27:40.290
<v ->Sabrina?</v>

608
27:40.290 --> 27:42.690
<v ->So actually I hope that autonomy</v>

609
27:42.690 --> 27:45.270
is not driving the EV business,

610
27:45.270 --> 27:46.890
because I hope that the EV business

611
27:46.890 --> 27:48.603
is much faster than autonomy.

612
27:49.650 --> 27:52.350
At least if I look from a European perspective,

613
27:52.350 --> 27:53.430
I mean, totally agree.

614
27:53.430 --> 27:55.980
Regulations is a big thing, especially in Europe,

615
27:55.980 --> 27:57.840
and what you just said earlier, Sujay,

616
27:57.840 --> 27:59.910
about customer's choice.

617
27:59.910 --> 28:02.910
So at the moment, we see that the customers in Europe

618
28:02.910 --> 28:07.710
are a bit more hesitant about having more autonomy level

619
28:07.710 --> 28:09.930
or higher autonomy level in the car.

620
28:09.930 --> 28:11.460
But on the long run, for sure.

621
28:11.460 --> 28:13.230
It's just a point of efficiency

622
28:13.230 --> 28:17.610
that if you run many, many cars autonomous,

623
28:17.610 --> 28:19.290
it's just much more efficient

624
28:19.290 --> 28:21.300
rather than everyone just driving on its own,

625
28:21.300 --> 28:24.870
and so can keep the battery in a much better working point.

626
28:24.870 --> 28:26.670
And in addition, also when it comes to charging,

627
28:26.670 --> 28:29.580
you can much better balance the demand of energy

628
28:29.580 --> 28:30.630
you need in the grid.

629
28:32.668 --> 28:34.590
<v Martine>Any last thoughts?</v>

630
28:34.590 --> 28:36.300
<v ->I think just in this coming year,</v>

631
28:36.300 --> 28:38.670
I'm so excited to see the realization

632
28:38.670 --> 28:40.620
of the domestic EV economy.

633
28:40.620 --> 28:43.920
Between all of the companies, including Panasonic,

634
28:43.920 --> 28:46.470
bringing hundreds of thousands of jobs to the US,

635
28:46.470 --> 28:48.870
the billions in investment that you cited.

636
28:48.870 --> 28:51.960
I think we're gonna see a lot of change in this next year,

637
28:51.960 --> 28:53.790
and we're excited to be a part of it.

638
28:53.790 --> 28:57.810
<v ->So I'm gonna go to a lightning round with the speakers,</v>

639
28:57.810 --> 29:00.330
and then I'm gonna turn the questions to the audience

640
29:00.330 --> 29:03.540
'cause I know a lot of you came specifically for this panel.

641
29:03.540 --> 29:05.940
And so I don't know if there's somebody here with a mic,

642
29:05.940 --> 29:09.090
or if it's just okay to stand up

643
29:09.090 --> 29:10.320
and then we'll repeat the questions

644
29:10.320 --> 29:11.850
so it gets on the recording.

645
29:11.850 --> 29:16.413
But lightning round, what are your predictions for 2025?

646
29:17.580 --> 29:19.260
<v ->I think I already gave mine,</v>

647
29:19.260 --> 29:22.170
but I'm excited to see all these factories come online

648
29:22.170 --> 29:25.230
and see how that influences adoption over time.

649
29:25.230 --> 29:27.720
I think that when people are really a part

650
29:27.720 --> 29:31.590
of making batteries here in the US, making EVs in the US,

651
29:31.590 --> 29:34.920
it's going to be so much more normalized to buy an EV.

652
29:34.920 --> 29:37.800
When your neighbor works for an electric OEM,

653
29:37.800 --> 29:39.390
when your neighbor buys an EV,

654
29:39.390 --> 29:41.730
it's so much easier to do so yourself.

655
29:41.730 --> 29:43.200
<v Martine>Interesting.</v>

656
29:43.200 --> 29:44.760
<v ->Yeah, again, I would say,</v>

657
29:44.760 --> 29:46.230
especially looking on a battery,

658
29:46.230 --> 29:48.750
the efficiency is like the key topic.

659
29:48.750 --> 29:51.960
So this comes for sure out of the production,

660
29:51.960 --> 29:53.670
making the production more efficient,

661
29:53.670 --> 29:56.520
but also, I mean we see so many new trends,

662
29:56.520 --> 29:58.320
new type of cell chemistry,

663
29:58.320 --> 30:01.020
then we see already at the horizon,

664
30:01.020 --> 30:02.910
all solid state batteries coming up.

665
30:02.910 --> 30:04.890
And I'm really curious what will happen

666
30:04.890 --> 30:06.960
and how the development in this segment is going on

667
30:06.960 --> 30:10.833
because this can be for sure a boost on EV sales.

668
30:12.210 --> 30:13.810
<v ->I think for me, I have to say,</v>

669
30:15.450 --> 30:19.800
making fast charging more reliable and ubiquitous.

670
30:19.800 --> 30:21.480
I struggle with saying that word, by the way,

671
30:21.480 --> 30:23.250
if I said it wrong.

672
30:23.250 --> 30:28.110
Is it's because, you know, the experience has been

673
30:28.110 --> 30:30.240
quite variable in the US, I would say,

674
30:30.240 --> 30:31.890
over the past few years.

675
30:31.890 --> 30:35.040
But the major players like ourselves and others

676
30:35.040 --> 30:39.240
are really making a concerted effort and investment

677
30:39.240 --> 30:42.330
into creating that opportunity

678
30:42.330 --> 30:45.930
and a great experience for the consumer.

679
30:45.930 --> 30:47.700
And so I'm looking forward

680
30:47.700 --> 30:49.740
to being a part of that revolution

681
30:49.740 --> 30:51.123
and enabling that revolution

682
30:51.123 --> 30:55.290
with our partners and my teammates, so.

683
30:55.290 --> 30:57.660
<v ->We were supposed to have X paying on the panel.</v>

684
30:57.660 --> 30:59.670
And so the last question would've been,

685
30:59.670 --> 31:03.990
is the future of cars or the future of EVs, flight?

686
31:03.990 --> 31:05.340
But I'm gonna leave that for the audience

687
31:05.340 --> 31:07.260
to make their own conclusions,

688
31:07.260 --> 31:10.350
and turn the questions over to the audience.

689
31:10.350 --> 31:11.350
This gentleman here.

690
31:14.130 --> 31:16.890
<v Speaker 1>One of the top three questions I get asked,</v>

691
31:16.890 --> 31:21.720
and I want to hear a professional's answer is battery life.

692
31:21.720 --> 31:26.720
<v ->Okay, what are the technology advances for battery life?</v>

693
31:29.460 --> 31:31.770
<v ->Yeah, I think I'd love to hear your perspective</v>

694
31:31.770 --> 31:33.750
from the tech and R&amp;D side,

695
31:33.750 --> 31:34.920
but I think what we're seeing

696
31:34.920 --> 31:37.740
is that battery life is already far exceeding

697
31:37.740 --> 31:41.520
what we hope to see at this stage in EV adoption.

698
31:41.520 --> 31:44.430
I'm really excited about recycling of battery materials.

699
31:44.430 --> 31:46.710
We've been challenged in that space thus far

700
31:46.710 --> 31:49.890
because there just aren't enough batteries retiring.

701
31:49.890 --> 31:54.120
So Panasonic makes premium cells that are longer lifed,

702
31:54.120 --> 31:55.980
and are really staying on the road

703
31:55.980 --> 31:57.750
longer than anyone anticipated.

704
31:57.750 --> 32:00.720
So personally that's not one of my huge concerns.

705
32:00.720 --> 32:02.820
<v ->Yeah, I can again agree,</v>

706
32:02.820 --> 32:07.820
because what we see from batteries returning from the field,

707
32:08.220 --> 32:09.690
there's state of health

708
32:09.690 --> 32:13.140
is much higher than we would've been expected, yeah?

709
32:13.140 --> 32:16.650
So many of these batteries, as of now already,

710
32:16.650 --> 32:20.910
are now used in energy storage devices and their SOH,

711
32:20.910 --> 32:23.610
so state of health is among 80%.

712
32:23.610 --> 32:28.260
So even after like 10, 12 years being run in an EV,

713
32:28.260 --> 32:30.360
so still the battery is quite good,

714
32:30.360 --> 32:32.880
especially if you don't have this high peaks

715
32:32.880 --> 32:35.160
which of energy consumption.

716
32:35.160 --> 32:37.080
So this is why you can just easily put them

717
32:37.080 --> 32:38.790
into energy storage.

718
32:38.790 --> 32:41.910
And in addition, recycling will be point in EU,

719
32:41.910 --> 32:44.370
there are regulations already,

720
32:44.370 --> 32:47.760
which amount of, yeah, recycled mass

721
32:47.760 --> 32:49.980
you have to insert into your battery cells,

722
32:49.980 --> 32:51.300
which you newly manufacture

723
32:51.300 --> 32:54.180
and the value will increase the next years.

724
32:54.180 --> 32:55.380
<v ->Any thoughts, Sujay?</v>

725
32:55.380 --> 32:56.820
<v ->No, I have nothing to add to the experts.</v>

726
32:56.820 --> 32:58.560
<v ->I'd like to ask the audience,</v>

727
32:58.560 --> 33:01.263
how many of you have bought a used EV?

728
33:02.940 --> 33:03.773
Not many.

729
33:03.773 --> 33:05.190
A gentleman over here.

730
33:05.190 --> 33:07.560
My understanding, and a a couple of people in the audience,

731
33:07.560 --> 33:10.890
my understanding is that they're seeing the fear

732
33:10.890 --> 33:14.070
of buying a used EV is that the battery might die,

733
33:14.070 --> 33:15.960
that's the end of the car, they're so expensive.

734
33:15.960 --> 33:18.750
But I guess Tesla had released a study saying,

735
33:18.750 --> 33:21.840
actually the battery is built for the life of the vehicle

736
33:21.840 --> 33:24.090
and is going beyond 10 years, 20 years,

737
33:24.090 --> 33:25.290
you know, I mean it's been around.

738
33:25.290 --> 33:27.210
There is a very high expectation

739
33:27.210 --> 33:28.860
for battery life these days.

740
33:28.860 --> 33:33.513
So, and actually I wrote an article for the BBC on used EVs.

741
33:34.950 --> 33:37.110
If I see you after, I can send you the link.

742
33:37.110 --> 33:38.733
Okay, another question please.

743
33:39.750 --> 33:41.873
Yes, this gentleman here in the second row.

744
33:42.990 --> 33:44.010
If you could stand up maybe.

745
33:44.010 --> 33:45.090
Yes, we can hear.

746
33:45.090 --> 33:47.433
<v ->Guys previously have like 100 car companies.</v>

747
33:51.287 --> 33:54.510
So I was wondering based on your domain knowledge,

748
33:54.510 --> 33:57.633
who gonna be the big picture or who gonna survive

749
33:57.633 --> 33:59.050
in this industry?

750
34:01.090 --> 34:02.340
<v ->Who's gonna survive?</v>

751
34:02.340 --> 34:04.650
Well, I don't know, that's really.

752
34:04.650 --> 34:05.483
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard.</v>

753
34:05.483 --> 34:06.610
<v ->Sujay, can you repeat the question?</v>

754
34:06.610 --> 34:08.970
<v ->Yeah, the question was sort of</v>

755
34:08.970 --> 34:13.320
who's gonna survive in the EV race, I guess.

756
34:13.320 --> 34:14.153
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, like previous,</v>

757
34:14.153 --> 34:15.750
so many car companies are all gone, you know?

758
34:15.750 --> 34:17.760
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

759
34:17.760 --> 34:19.048
I mean, there are,

760
34:19.048 --> 34:20.880
so there are both sides of the story, right?

761
34:20.880 --> 34:22.860
There are success stories,

762
34:22.860 --> 34:25.650
and there are not so success stories.

763
34:25.650 --> 34:28.530
I mean if I look, I'll use the, you know,

764
34:28.530 --> 34:30.090
a China experience for example.

765
34:30.090 --> 34:33.390
There's a lot of startup companies,

766
34:33.390 --> 34:36.240
or that used to be considered startup companies

767
34:36.240 --> 34:39.300
who have been quite successful actually.

768
34:39.300 --> 34:40.980
They're not, they didn't have a pedigree

769
34:40.980 --> 34:43.170
of maybe ICE vehicles,

770
34:43.170 --> 34:45.930
but they've been very successful on the EV side of things.

771
34:45.930 --> 34:47.580
And even here in the US,

772
34:47.580 --> 34:50.850
you've had that same sort of example of course with Tesla,

773
34:50.850 --> 34:53.040
and perhaps you're seeing it with Rivian as well.

774
34:53.040 --> 34:55.710
So who survives, who doesn't survive,

775
34:55.710 --> 34:57.210
very sort of hard to say.

776
34:57.210 --> 35:00.420
I think the reality is that the technology is there,

777
35:00.420 --> 35:01.290
it's evolving.

778
35:01.290 --> 35:04.413
The battery pack technology is evolving fast enough,

779
35:05.400 --> 35:08.073
and so I think there will be enough.

780
35:09.510 --> 35:11.400
What we can say is there will be enough choices

781
35:11.400 --> 35:14.490
and enough models and vehicles in the market.

782
35:14.490 --> 35:16.200
Who those players are, how they run their business

783
35:16.200 --> 35:18.662
is very hard to comment on.

784
35:18.662 --> 35:19.710
<v ->We have time for two more questions.</v>

785
35:19.710 --> 35:22.716
I see a hand there, back there.

786
35:22.716 --> 35:23.549
Oh three more.

787
35:28.590 --> 35:31.350
The question was mass adoption of solid state batteries.

788
35:31.350 --> 35:33.870
<v ->Thanks for looking in my direction, Tina.</v>

789
35:33.870 --> 35:36.220
I think you're coming from the battery company.

790
35:37.410 --> 35:38.520
Oh, it's hard to predict.

791
35:38.520 --> 35:42.600
I mean if you look, and almost the majority of the studies

792
35:42.600 --> 35:45.090
giving forecast when this kind of technology

793
35:45.090 --> 35:47.010
will start evolving.

794
35:47.010 --> 35:49.413
They usually talk about the 2030s.

795
35:50.250 --> 35:52.950
On the other side, we already know that last year,

796
35:52.950 --> 35:54.960
CATL announced that they already have

797
35:54.960 --> 35:57.123
the first all solid state battery ready.

798
35:58.920 --> 35:59.970
So we need to see,

799
35:59.970 --> 36:02.670
but at the moment, if I look,

800
36:02.670 --> 36:05.910
it's not even clear which technology will win the race.

801
36:05.910 --> 36:08.190
Yeah, there are either the oxide layer,

802
36:08.190 --> 36:10.530
the sulfide layers or the polymer ones.

803
36:10.530 --> 36:12.630
So even that decision isn't made yet.

804
36:12.630 --> 36:17.630
So I personally would still stick with the 2030s

805
36:17.790 --> 36:21.450
where I would expect that we have a clear decision

806
36:21.450 --> 36:24.315
what kind of type of all solid state batteries

807
36:24.315 --> 36:26.220
will win the race

808
36:26.220 --> 36:28.113
and will come into mass production.

809
36:28.980 --> 36:29.813
<v ->I'll weigh in as well</v>

810
36:29.813 --> 36:32.160
since I did throw you under the bus on that one.

811
36:32.160 --> 36:33.600
I think that there will be

812
36:33.600 --> 36:36.180
many different battery technologies that succeed.

813
36:36.180 --> 36:39.480
It will not be solid state, that's the be all end all.

814
36:39.480 --> 36:41.490
We're going to have different battery technologies

815
36:41.490 --> 36:42.810
for different use cases.

816
36:42.810 --> 36:46.830
Of course, we're focused on scaling up as quickly as we can

817
36:46.830 --> 36:50.670
and making as many cylindrical lithium ion cells as we can.

818
36:50.670 --> 36:53.460
And we're focused on those continuous improvement tweaks

819
36:53.460 --> 36:56.670
rather than changing the chemistry over time.

820
36:56.670 --> 36:58.290
Already we're enabling vehicles

821
36:58.290 --> 37:01.860
to go 450 miles at a reasonable price point.

822
37:01.860 --> 37:05.610
So that continuous improvement is a big deal as well.

823
37:05.610 --> 37:08.430
But that said, we want all battery chemistries to succeed

824
37:08.430 --> 37:10.770
because there will be different use cases,

825
37:10.770 --> 37:14.400
particularly on the industrial and heavy duty side.

826
37:14.400 --> 37:16.050
<v ->There's a hands up in the back.</v>

827
37:17.100 --> 37:18.990
<v Speaker 3>Biggest question I get all the time is,</v>

828
37:18.990 --> 37:20.730
what is the effect of the new administration

829
37:20.730 --> 37:23.103
gonna have on the adoption and public?

830
37:26.700 --> 37:28.110
<v ->We'll have to ask Donald Trump</v>

831
37:28.110 --> 37:29.510
the answer to that question.

832
37:30.730 --> 37:32.130
Is that the answer you give?

833
37:33.570 --> 37:38.040
I think, look, it's really hard to say, honestly.

834
37:38.040 --> 37:42.960
That's, I mean, I'll welcome inputs from the others as well.

835
37:42.960 --> 37:46.170
The way we look at it as BP is, you know, what is,

836
37:46.170 --> 37:48.150
we look at long-term trends.

837
37:48.150 --> 37:50.808
We look at trends out to 2050.

838
37:50.808 --> 37:53.010
We don't look at four year trends.

839
37:53.010 --> 37:56.050
So the trend out to 2030 and 2050

840
37:56.050 --> 37:59.400
is EV adoption is gonna continue to grow.

841
37:59.400 --> 38:02.790
You know, the US market from our perspective

842
38:02.790 --> 38:06.840
is gonna be somewhere between 25 to 30 million EVs,

843
38:06.840 --> 38:08.670
we think in 2030.

844
38:08.670 --> 38:11.520
And it's gonna continue to grow from there.

845
38:11.520 --> 38:16.410
So all of those EVs need EV charging, right?

846
38:16.410 --> 38:18.720
Today we are at, I think on average,

847
38:18.720 --> 38:21.540
for every fast charging stall,

848
38:21.540 --> 38:26.310
it's one fast charging stall, 200 EVs in the US.

849
38:26.310 --> 38:29.220
In Europe, in Germany, I think it's about 130.

850
38:29.220 --> 38:31.650
In China it's sub 50.

851
38:31.650 --> 38:33.030
And in China, I would tell you

852
38:33.030 --> 38:36.390
that charging is really freely available.

853
38:36.390 --> 38:40.410
So there's a lot of, well, at least in certain markets,

854
38:40.410 --> 38:41.760
it's really freely available.

855
38:41.760 --> 38:46.760
So where do we, we have a long way to go directionally

856
38:47.520 --> 38:49.050
in terms of EV growth.

857
38:49.050 --> 38:53.220
We have a long way to grow in terms of EV charging growth

858
38:53.220 --> 38:55.530
and reliable EV charging growth.

859
38:55.530 --> 38:58.740
What happens in the next four years in the longer scheme,

860
38:58.740 --> 39:01.890
larger scheme of things will probably be a blip either ways.

861
39:01.890 --> 39:04.860
Whether it goes up substantially or goes down substantially,

862
39:04.860 --> 39:07.110
or maybe just stays on par.

863
39:07.110 --> 39:10.350
But we don't kind of make decisions based on that

864
39:10.350 --> 39:11.400
from our perspective.

865
39:11.400 --> 39:14.460
I don't know if you guys have anything to add.

866
39:14.460 --> 39:16.500
<v ->But there were a couple more questions on this side.</v>

867
39:16.500 --> 39:17.913
I think there's a hands up in the back.

868
39:17.913 --> 39:18.783
Yes, yes.

869
39:47.790 --> 39:51.763
<v ->Sorry, was your question on,</v>

870
39:52.890 --> 39:56.070
will we still need charging if battery efficiency increases?

871
39:56.070 --> 39:57.273
Is that the gist?

872
40:18.600 --> 40:19.950
Do you have a view on that?

873
40:21.300 --> 40:22.560
<v ->Yeah, I think your point,</v>

874
40:22.560 --> 40:24.960
it's poignant in that it is self-reinforcing.

875
40:24.960 --> 40:27.120
Obviously as we see continuous improvement

876
40:27.120 --> 40:29.400
in charging and battery efficiency,

877
40:29.400 --> 40:31.800
we'll all benefit from those gains.

878
40:31.800 --> 40:33.360
So I think what I take from your question

879
40:33.360 --> 40:35.880
is that we need a little bit of all of it,

880
40:35.880 --> 40:38.820
but no one needs to reach this holy grail

881
40:38.820 --> 40:40.110
of a thousand miles,

882
40:40.110 --> 40:42.390
or charging a full battery in five minutes.

883
40:42.390 --> 40:44.280
The continuous improvement on all fronts

884
40:44.280 --> 40:46.740
will just vastly improve the experience.

885
40:46.740 --> 40:49.620
<v ->I need the thousand mile range.</v>

886
40:49.620 --> 40:50.670
I wanna thank you all.

887
40:50.670 --> 40:51.750
Oh yes, please.

888
40:51.750 --> 40:53.190
<v ->I was just gonna say, I think the reality,</v>

889
40:53.190 --> 40:54.900
I mean even today, if you look at it,

890
40:54.900 --> 40:56.280
at least the data we look at,

891
40:56.280 --> 40:58.890
is most of the charging happens at home, right?

892
40:58.890 --> 41:00.810
70% or what have you.

893
41:00.810 --> 41:04.710
So, but you still need charging outside of that

894
41:04.710 --> 41:06.120
when you are moving around.

895
41:06.120 --> 41:09.870
So I think even if the robustness of batteries

896
41:09.870 --> 41:10.950
or battery range increases,

897
41:10.950 --> 41:12.960
there will be a need for a component

898
41:12.960 --> 41:14.250
of charging outside the home.

899
41:14.250 --> 41:15.259
Okay, over to you.

900
41:15.259 --> 41:16.092
I took away your--

901
41:16.092 --> 41:16.925
<v ->I'm so sorry, we're at time.</v>

902
41:16.925 --> 41:18.510
I wanna thank this very full audience.

903
41:18.510 --> 41:20.010
Thank you so much for joining us here

904
41:20.010 --> 41:22.500
on a late Thursday afternoon at CES.

905
41:22.500 --> 41:26.220
Please enjoy the show, and come and meet our speakers.

906
41:26.220 --> 41:27.136
Thank you.

907
41:27.136 --> 41:28.965
(audience applauding)

908
41:28.965 --> 41:31.548
(upbeat music)
