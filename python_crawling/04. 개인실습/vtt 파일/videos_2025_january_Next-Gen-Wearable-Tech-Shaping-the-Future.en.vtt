1
00:00.468 --> 00:03.051
(upbeat music)

2
00:10.740 --> 00:11.640
<v ->I guess, I wanna start</v>

3
00:11.640 --> 00:15.630
with how many of you out there have a wearable?

4
00:15.630 --> 00:17.100
Are wearing a wearable right now?

5
00:17.100 --> 00:18.690
Could you raise your hands?

6
00:18.690 --> 00:19.863
That's to be expected.

7
00:21.060 --> 00:22.710
I think what we're seeing is that wearables

8
00:22.710 --> 00:24.840
are an increasingly important part

9
00:24.840 --> 00:26.440
of the digital health landscape.

10
00:27.720 --> 00:29.400
And being at CES,

11
00:29.400 --> 00:30.750
we're talking about consumer health,

12
00:30.750 --> 00:33.990
specifically consumer-focused wearables.

13
00:33.990 --> 00:35.730
But where I come from

14
00:35.730 --> 00:37.593
and I work for health leaders,

15
00:39.060 --> 00:43.080
sorry, I look for that connection

16
00:43.080 --> 00:44.970
between the consumer

17
00:44.970 --> 00:47.277
and the healthcare provider, the health system,

18
00:47.277 --> 00:48.660
and the hospital executive,

19
00:48.660 --> 00:50.040
and the doctor and the nurse.

20
00:50.040 --> 00:51.510
So the conversation here today

21
00:51.510 --> 00:54.810
is going to kind of branch into that territory.

22
00:54.810 --> 00:55.643
We're gonna start,

23
00:55.643 --> 00:58.650
and I'm gonna allow my wonderful panelists

24
00:58.650 --> 00:59.970
here to introduce themselves

25
00:59.970 --> 01:03.270
and talk a little bit about the wearables

26
01:03.270 --> 01:04.320
that they have.

27
01:04.320 --> 01:06.930
And then we're gonna talk about perhaps

28
01:06.930 --> 01:10.560
how this area of digital health,

29
01:10.560 --> 01:13.020
how these wearables might be introduced

30
01:13.020 --> 01:14.400
in remote patient monitoring

31
01:14.400 --> 01:15.960
or hospital home or some of the other

32
01:15.960 --> 01:19.110
programs that we're seeing as healthcare

33
01:19.110 --> 01:20.190
moves out of the hospital

34
01:20.190 --> 01:22.260
and the doctor's office and more into the home.

35
01:22.260 --> 01:24.363
So what I want to do is just start,

36
01:25.440 --> 01:27.120
my first question is gonna be to allow

37
01:27.120 --> 01:28.800
yourselves to talk a little bit

38
01:28.800 --> 01:29.910
about your company's

39
01:29.910 --> 01:31.020
and your wearables,

40
01:31.020 --> 01:32.160
and tell me a little bit about

41
01:32.160 --> 01:35.763
how you see the wearable market evolving.

42
01:37.410 --> 01:38.760
So let's start on this end.

43
01:39.930 --> 01:41.010
<v ->Good morning, everyone.</v>

44
01:41.010 --> 01:43.800
First of all, thanks to folks here at CES

45
01:43.800 --> 01:45.300
for organizing a digital health track.

46
01:45.300 --> 01:46.890
I was excited to see the digital health track

47
01:46.890 --> 01:48.420
and all the great conversations

48
01:48.420 --> 01:49.680
that have been going on.

49
01:49.680 --> 01:51.240
My name is Praveen Raja.

50
01:51.240 --> 01:53.340
I lead digital health R&amp;D

51
01:53.340 --> 01:55.743
at Samsung Research Center in the U.S.

52
01:56.850 --> 01:59.190
Our company, as you know, manufacturers

53
01:59.190 --> 02:01.530
and delivers a whole bunch of wearables

54
02:01.530 --> 02:03.090
and services associated with them.

55
02:03.090 --> 02:06.540
Smart rings, we have obviously our phones,

56
02:06.540 --> 02:08.610
we have our smart watches

57
02:08.610 --> 02:11.040
and a whole bunch of devices at home

58
02:11.040 --> 02:13.950
that you don't think of as health devices.

59
02:13.950 --> 02:15.480
But these are very important things,

60
02:15.480 --> 02:17.070
like even our refrigerator

61
02:17.070 --> 02:19.530
and our TVs are increasingly health devices

62
02:19.530 --> 02:21.510
and they provide a lot in terms

63
02:21.510 --> 02:23.220
of helping people stay healthy

64
02:23.220 --> 02:25.890
and eat the right foods, exercise,

65
02:25.890 --> 02:29.520
and live a stress-free life with wellbeing.

66
02:29.520 --> 02:32.280
So our team develops all the features

67
02:32.280 --> 02:35.373
and devices for Samsung products.

68
02:36.630 --> 02:38.010
<v ->Hi, I am Alexi Coffey.</v>

69
02:38.010 --> 02:39.510
I'm the VP of product at WHOOP.

70
02:39.510 --> 02:41.670
We are the human performance

71
02:41.670 --> 02:44.910
and health company that has a wearable

72
02:44.910 --> 02:46.440
health and fitness coach that helps people

73
02:46.440 --> 02:48.150
reach their goals.

74
02:48.150 --> 02:49.890
Super excited to be in this conversation today.

75
02:49.890 --> 02:50.723
Thank you so much.

76
02:50.723 --> 02:52.080
I think it's a really exciting time

77
02:52.080 --> 02:54.750
to be talking about wearables and health.

78
02:54.750 --> 02:57.270
At WHOOP, I lead our product innovation

79
02:57.270 --> 03:00.720
and have brought features like stress monitor,

80
03:00.720 --> 03:02.400
pregnancy insights, our AI coach

81
03:02.400 --> 03:03.810
into the forefront.

82
03:03.810 --> 03:06.000
And I think there's this amazing shift

83
03:06.000 --> 03:07.650
that's happening in consumer health today

84
03:07.650 --> 03:09.090
where people really wanna understand

85
03:09.090 --> 03:11.460
their bodies, they really value this daily

86
03:11.460 --> 03:14.940
relationship, this daily data loop that they get.

87
03:14.940 --> 03:17.430
And I think that we're seeing this moment

88
03:17.430 --> 03:19.080
where there's an increased conversation

89
03:19.080 --> 03:21.120
of how can we collaborate across wearables,

90
03:21.120 --> 03:23.130
across healthcare to ultimately

91
03:23.130 --> 03:25.260
deliver better health outcomes

92
03:25.260 --> 03:26.880
for the consumer, for the member.

93
03:26.880 --> 03:28.830
And so it's just an exciting time

94
03:28.830 --> 03:31.230
and grateful to be in conversation with you all.

95
03:32.910 --> 03:33.743
<v ->Good morning, everyone.</v>

96
03:33.743 --> 03:36.150
My name is Scott Burgett, I'm from Garmin.

97
03:36.150 --> 03:38.610
I lead our Garmin health engineering team

98
03:38.610 --> 03:43.410
as well as drive our biosensor roadmap worldwide.

99
03:43.410 --> 03:45.990
So if it's on the bottom of the watch

100
03:45.990 --> 03:48.240
as a biosensor, that's a roadmap that I manage.

101
03:48.240 --> 03:51.420
So I'm very, very in great depth

102
03:51.420 --> 03:53.490
involved in not only the sensors,

103
03:53.490 --> 03:55.500
but the applications of all the biosensor

104
03:55.500 --> 03:57.120
data and the watches.

105
03:57.120 --> 03:58.620
I'm sure you're familiar with Garmin.

106
03:58.620 --> 04:02.280
We make wearable devices that go from

107
04:02.280 --> 04:05.100
low-cost to very expensive,

108
04:05.100 --> 04:08.430
and we are really passionate about making

109
04:08.430 --> 04:10.170
a wearable that people wanna wear,

110
04:10.170 --> 04:13.410
it's essential and provides the best data.

111
04:13.410 --> 04:15.630
And I agree this is a great time

112
04:15.630 --> 04:17.048
for digital health,

113
04:17.048 --> 04:19.500
we are really at the point

114
04:19.500 --> 04:21.420
where the adoption is going to go up

115
04:21.420 --> 04:24.840
and we really see a lot of opportunity

116
04:24.840 --> 04:28.260
in the use of wearable data in many ways,

117
04:28.260 --> 04:30.750
many applications, certainly in terms

118
04:30.750 --> 04:33.420
of remote patient monitoring,

119
04:33.420 --> 04:35.490
population health, things like that.

120
04:35.490 --> 04:38.130
So I'm really excited to be here

121
04:38.130 --> 04:39.990
and thank you for having me

122
04:39.990 --> 04:41.590
and looking forward to chatting.

123
04:42.510 --> 04:43.814
<v ->Thank you.</v>

124
04:43.814 --> 04:45.330
So I'm Olivier, Olivier Ropars.

125
04:45.330 --> 04:47.070
I lead a consumer

126
04:47.070 --> 04:49.830
bio wearable division for Abbot.

127
04:49.830 --> 04:51.240
And so this is a new division

128
04:51.240 --> 04:53.250
that Abbot created a few years ago.

129
04:53.250 --> 04:56.370
And the whole idea was to bring medical grade

130
04:56.370 --> 04:59.100
technology invented within Abbot

131
04:59.100 --> 05:00.210
to the consumer space

132
05:00.210 --> 05:01.470
and putting this technology straight

133
05:01.470 --> 05:03.180
into the hands of consumers.

134
05:03.180 --> 05:05.850
And the strong belief here is the technology,

135
05:05.850 --> 05:06.810
especially with AI,

136
05:06.810 --> 05:09.030
and we'll talk about AI in a minute,

137
05:09.030 --> 05:11.790
is ready to help people

138
05:11.790 --> 05:13.260
really take care of their health

139
05:13.260 --> 05:14.460
and be much more proactive

140
05:14.460 --> 05:16.200
on how they manage their health.

141
05:16.200 --> 05:19.080
So we launched our first product last year

142
05:19.080 --> 05:21.360
in 2024 in the UK and the U.S.,

143
05:21.360 --> 05:23.910
it's a continuous glucose monitor

144
05:23.910 --> 05:25.350
dedicated to the consumer.

145
05:25.350 --> 05:26.850
Consumers can buy it anywhere,

146
05:26.850 --> 05:28.650
no need for a prescription.

147
05:28.650 --> 05:31.710
And we focus on glucose as a first product

148
05:31.710 --> 05:33.690
for us because glucose is probably

149
05:33.690 --> 05:37.500
the most important biomarker of metabolic health

150
05:37.500 --> 05:40.440
and also poor glucose control has been associated

151
05:40.440 --> 05:43.680
to the prominence of most chronic diseases.

152
05:43.680 --> 05:44.700
So we believe that putting

153
05:44.700 --> 05:46.980
this tool in people's hands,

154
05:46.980 --> 05:48.630
they can improve their glucose management

155
05:48.630 --> 05:51.090
and avoid chronic disease, which is really

156
05:51.090 --> 05:52.080
what we're all about here,

157
05:52.080 --> 05:53.980
is keeping people healthy much longer.

158
05:55.350 --> 05:56.902
<v ->Thank you.</v>

159
05:56.902 --> 05:59.700
Okay, we talk a lot about patient

160
05:59.700 --> 06:04.080
care management, the empowered consumer,

161
06:04.080 --> 06:07.110
the idea that these devices, these wearables

162
06:07.110 --> 06:09.873
are used by consumers to manage their own health.

163
06:10.730 --> 06:12.180
Now we had settled on some questions

164
06:12.180 --> 06:13.350
ahead of time, I'm gonna jump

165
06:13.350 --> 06:15.660
around a little bit just to kind

166
06:15.660 --> 06:17.730
of spice things up a little bit,

167
06:17.730 --> 06:21.090
but I do want to get into the idea

168
06:21.090 --> 06:23.460
that as you had mentioned,

169
06:23.460 --> 06:26.400
collaboration between care providers

170
06:26.400 --> 06:29.730
and consumers on using these types of devices

171
06:29.730 --> 06:30.563
on their health.

172
06:30.563 --> 06:32.550
So I'm gonna go down to you Olivier with this one

173
06:32.550 --> 06:34.500
and just kind of continue the conversation

174
06:34.500 --> 06:35.970
or what you had just said.

175
06:35.970 --> 06:40.290
How do you get healthcare providers

176
06:40.290 --> 06:42.240
to pay more attention to wearables,

177
06:42.240 --> 06:44.557
to become interested or to want to use

178
06:44.557 --> 06:47.730
wearables in remote patient monitoring

179
06:47.730 --> 06:51.690
programs or other clinical programs?

180
06:51.690 --> 06:53.400
<v ->Yeah, so I mean, first,</v>

181
06:53.400 --> 06:55.380
I always say like most of our customers

182
06:55.380 --> 06:57.180
have bought the product directly

183
06:57.180 --> 06:58.860
and are using it on their own.

184
06:58.860 --> 07:00.270
The whole design of the product

185
07:00.270 --> 07:01.440
made it very easy for people

186
07:01.440 --> 07:03.540
to understand the data, the insights,

187
07:03.540 --> 07:04.710
and take actions on it.

188
07:04.710 --> 07:06.870
So this is a self-contained product

189
07:06.870 --> 07:08.400
dedicated for the user only.

190
07:08.400 --> 07:12.120
However, while working with also primary care

191
07:12.120 --> 07:14.730
physicians and nutritionists in the UK

192
07:14.730 --> 07:15.840
and in the U.S. as well,

193
07:15.840 --> 07:18.240
and we see a lot of value in this

194
07:18.240 --> 07:19.590
and they see a lot of benefits in working

195
07:19.590 --> 07:20.550
with a sensor.

196
07:20.550 --> 07:22.470
So I'll give you two examples.

197
07:22.470 --> 07:25.353
So on the physician side, what we see is,

198
07:26.190 --> 07:28.290
it saves them a lot of time

199
07:28.290 --> 07:29.790
and improve the quality of care.

200
07:29.790 --> 07:33.150
So number one, for patients who have any

201
07:33.150 --> 07:35.520
kind of anxieties or concerns

202
07:35.520 --> 07:37.290
about their glucose level,

203
07:37.290 --> 07:40.020
weight management, incidents of diabetes

204
07:40.020 --> 07:41.460
or pre-diabetes in their family,

205
07:41.460 --> 07:42.840
and they're concerned about, you know,

206
07:42.840 --> 07:44.670
maybe it could happen to them as well.

207
07:44.670 --> 07:47.910
The doctor will direct them to a lingo center.

208
07:47.910 --> 07:49.350
And what it does is already

209
07:49.350 --> 07:52.350
all the concerns about meal planning,

210
07:52.350 --> 07:53.910
nutrition, what should I eat,

211
07:53.910 --> 07:55.473
what is good nutrition for me,

212
07:56.451 --> 07:57.600
what I should do differently in the evening

213
07:57.600 --> 07:58.800
versus the morning and so forth.

214
07:58.800 --> 08:00.630
All of this is taken care by the application.

215
08:00.630 --> 08:02.520
So it simplifies

216
08:02.520 --> 08:05.010
the interaction with a physician.

217
08:05.010 --> 08:08.460
On top of that, now the main interaction

218
08:08.460 --> 08:09.870
you have with the physician is only

219
08:09.870 --> 08:11.850
for critical medical matters.

220
08:11.850 --> 08:12.780
So it saves time

221
08:12.780 --> 08:14.250
and in 15 minutes, physicians

222
08:14.250 --> 08:15.630
don't have time to answer this question.

223
08:15.630 --> 08:18.480
So it's a time-saving for the physicians.

224
08:18.480 --> 08:19.770
For nutritionist,

225
08:19.770 --> 08:21.450
what we've seen is they've embedded

226
08:21.450 --> 08:24.090
a sensor in their treatment plan.

227
08:24.090 --> 08:26.670
So they use a sensor to establish a baseline,

228
08:26.670 --> 08:28.650
a data-driven baseline,

229
08:28.650 --> 08:30.960
and then they also use a data

230
08:30.960 --> 08:32.220
to demonstrate the value

231
08:32.220 --> 08:34.380
of their recommendations, which drive

232
08:34.380 --> 08:36.630
therefore adherence to the plan

233
08:36.630 --> 08:39.030
and better patient outcome ultimately.

234
08:39.030 --> 08:41.070
So both population, nutritionists

235
08:41.070 --> 08:42.930
and physicians, I've seen a better patient

236
08:42.930 --> 08:45.390
outcome by working with a sensor

237
08:45.390 --> 08:47.820
like a glucose monitor that we have.

238
08:47.820 --> 08:49.500
So we didn't really know

239
08:49.500 --> 08:51.780
how the healthcare professional will react

240
08:51.780 --> 08:53.550
when we put this product straight

241
08:53.550 --> 08:54.900
into the hand of the consumers,

242
08:54.900 --> 08:56.370
but in fact, they've embraced it

243
08:56.370 --> 08:57.450
and we see them promoting it

244
08:57.450 --> 09:00.277
to their patients quite frequently, in fact.

245
09:00.277 --> 09:02.100
<v Eric>Okay.</v>

246
09:02.100 --> 09:02.933
<v ->I just wanna jump in</v>

247
09:02.933 --> 09:04.260
and add just a little bit to what you said,

248
09:04.260 --> 09:06.480
Olivier, I feel like we are thinking

249
09:06.480 --> 09:08.700
about the world in two different ways.

250
09:08.700 --> 09:09.990
We're saying there's a healthcare segment

251
09:09.990 --> 09:11.250
and a consumer segment.
<v Olivier>Yes.</v>

252
09:11.250 --> 09:12.600
<v ->I'm not sure there's such a distinction</v>

253
09:12.600 --> 09:14.340
and I think the distinction is eroding

254
09:14.340 --> 09:15.630
and I think Abbott Lingo is an example

255
09:15.630 --> 09:17.460
of that, as you're saying.

256
09:17.460 --> 09:19.610
I think we demonstrated here, you know,

257
09:19.610 --> 09:20.970
in our booths, there are two booths here,

258
09:20.970 --> 09:23.143
Samsung main booth and a booth with an ARP,

259
09:23.143 --> 09:25.140
a concept that we call, CareHub,

260
09:25.140 --> 09:26.130
where we're showing how these

261
09:26.130 --> 09:28.020
two worlds are coming together.

262
09:28.020 --> 09:30.600
So for example, as a consumer,

263
09:30.600 --> 09:32.670
you don't have two different worlds.

264
09:32.670 --> 09:34.380
You're only trying to manage your health

265
09:34.380 --> 09:36.390
and your wellbeing and meet your health goals.

266
09:36.390 --> 09:37.920
Sometimes, you do that on your own,

267
09:37.920 --> 09:39.720
sometimes, you do that with your doctor

268
09:39.720 --> 09:41.910
and usually both these worlds are together,

269
09:41.910 --> 09:44.040
right, so that's what we are enabling.

270
09:44.040 --> 09:46.500
So increasingly, there's a trend

271
09:46.500 --> 09:48.390
for these two worlds to combine,

272
09:48.390 --> 09:51.150
for example, the data that you see

273
09:51.150 --> 09:53.010
within wearable data that you see

274
09:53.010 --> 09:55.530
on your smartphones from your wearables

275
09:55.530 --> 09:57.270
can now easily go to your doctor.

276
09:57.270 --> 09:58.770
And the other way around as well,

277
09:58.770 --> 10:00.390
we launched a few months ago,

278
10:00.390 --> 10:02.580
a way in which you can get your medical records

279
10:02.580 --> 10:04.590
from your doctor, all your health records

280
10:04.590 --> 10:06.195
directly into Samsung Health.

281
10:06.195 --> 10:07.530
So you can see in one place

282
10:07.530 --> 10:09.270
both your Samsung Health data

283
10:09.270 --> 10:11.460
as well as, your data from your doctor.

284
10:11.460 --> 10:12.990
It's not just seeing data either,

285
10:12.990 --> 10:14.700
it's really about getting better.

286
10:14.700 --> 10:16.447
So for example, if a doctor said,

287
10:16.447 --> 10:18.120
"Hey, I want you to take this medication

288
10:18.120 --> 10:21.300
three times a day for six weeks

289
10:21.300 --> 10:23.490
or eight weeks or a year,"

290
10:23.490 --> 10:25.230
you need some way to manage that.

291
10:25.230 --> 10:27.600
Your doctor's not with you all the time.

292
10:27.600 --> 10:29.227
So we have tools now to say,

293
10:29.227 --> 10:32.310
"Okay, here's what your doctor wanted you to do,

294
10:32.310 --> 10:34.290
you can list those medications in one place

295
10:34.290 --> 10:35.640
from your medical records,

296
10:35.640 --> 10:37.530
we know what your medications are,

297
10:37.530 --> 10:39.030
we know when you need to take them.

298
10:39.030 --> 10:40.440
We will help you stay on track

299
10:40.440 --> 10:41.370
and get better."

300
10:41.370 --> 10:43.050
So that's how the two worlds,

301
10:43.050 --> 10:44.310
I think are coming together.

302
10:44.310 --> 10:46.590
And in the CareHub concept we talked about,

303
10:46.590 --> 10:47.700
if there's a flag,

304
10:47.700 --> 10:49.500
if there's some risks that we detect,

305
10:49.500 --> 10:50.580
let's say, we detect a risk

306
10:50.580 --> 10:52.430
for sleep apnea from our wearables,

307
10:52.430 --> 10:54.810
or we notice the irregular heart rhythm,

308
10:54.810 --> 10:56.730
you can simply click a button,

309
10:56.730 --> 10:59.670
connect to a caregiver, your healthcare provider

310
10:59.670 --> 11:00.750
or some other healthcare provider

311
11:00.750 --> 11:02.400
and say, "Hey, what's going on with me?

312
11:02.400 --> 11:03.480
Can you help me?"

313
11:03.480 --> 11:05.130
So we are seeing these two worlds coming

314
11:05.130 --> 11:06.120
together in that way in terms

315
11:06.120 --> 11:07.800
of a whole suite of services,

316
11:07.800 --> 11:09.240
integration of data,

317
11:09.240 --> 11:10.560
understanding what may be happening

318
11:10.560 --> 11:13.110
with you, following your doctor's recommendations,

319
11:13.110 --> 11:14.280
getting help when you need it.

320
11:14.280 --> 11:16.290
I think it's a exciting period.

321
11:16.290 --> 11:17.123
<v ->Yeah.</v>

322
11:17.123 --> 11:18.303
Now Scott and Alexi,

323
11:19.470 --> 11:20.550
a lot of these devices,

324
11:20.550 --> 11:22.290
a lot of these wearables are focused

325
11:22.290 --> 11:25.334
on the health and the fitness industry,

326
11:25.334 --> 11:26.167
the health and fitness uses,

327
11:26.167 --> 11:27.180
health and wellness.

328
11:27.180 --> 11:29.560
How do you move from or how do you

329
11:30.870 --> 11:32.250
pitch these types of wearables

330
11:32.250 --> 11:33.360
to clinicians who are looking

331
11:33.360 --> 11:35.373
for clinical outcomes?

332
11:36.540 --> 11:37.590
<v ->Go ahead.</v>

333
11:37.590 --> 11:39.450
<v ->Well, I think what we're finding, right,</v>

334
11:39.450 --> 11:41.310
is that so much of health comes

335
11:41.310 --> 11:42.930
from the daily choices we make every day.

336
11:42.930 --> 11:44.640
And so you can't look at health

337
11:44.640 --> 11:46.170
and healthcare if you're not looking at sleep,

338
11:46.170 --> 11:47.520
if you're not looking at fitness,

339
11:47.520 --> 11:49.350
if you're not looking at managing stress

340
11:49.350 --> 11:51.000
and understanding, you know, the daily choices,

341
11:51.000 --> 11:52.530
how much alcohol you're consuming, et cetera,

342
11:52.530 --> 11:53.363
impact your wellbeing.

343
11:53.363 --> 11:55.590
And so I think people are realizing

344
11:55.590 --> 11:56.730
that when we are looking at driving

345
11:56.730 --> 11:58.620
behavior change, which is something

346
11:58.620 --> 12:00.330
that we haven't really figured out yet,

347
12:00.330 --> 12:02.700
50% of premature deaths are coming

348
12:02.700 --> 12:04.410
or linked to modifiable behaviors

349
12:04.410 --> 12:05.310
like improved sleep,

350
12:05.310 --> 12:07.080
improved exercise, reduced stress.

351
12:07.080 --> 12:10.080
And so I think wearables with this daily loop,

352
12:10.080 --> 12:12.030
this relationship we have with our members,

353
12:12.030 --> 12:13.650
people that wear WHOOP, they wake up

354
12:13.650 --> 12:15.030
with WHOOP, they go to sleep with WHOOP.

355
12:15.030 --> 12:15.863
And we're playing this really

356
12:15.863 --> 12:17.250
important role in their lives to help them

357
12:17.250 --> 12:18.870
stay accountable because it's really hard

358
12:18.870 --> 12:20.730
to drive behavior change.

359
12:20.730 --> 12:22.650
Like we might be motivated humans,

360
12:22.650 --> 12:24.450
but we have a lot of things we're trying to do.

361
12:24.450 --> 12:26.640
And so it's hard to keep health top of mind.

362
12:26.640 --> 12:28.260
And so you might have people that are,

363
12:28.260 --> 12:30.180
for example, going to their doctor's office

364
12:30.180 --> 12:31.320
and they're finding out that they

365
12:31.320 --> 12:32.370
have high cholesterol

366
12:32.370 --> 12:35.400
or they have some other concerning result

367
12:35.400 --> 12:36.233
and they're being told,

368
12:36.233 --> 12:38.460
"Hey, go improve these things."

369
12:38.460 --> 12:40.200
Well, the moment they leave,

370
12:40.200 --> 12:41.670
where are they going for support?

371
12:41.670 --> 12:43.410
And so I think what we're finding

372
12:43.410 --> 12:44.790
is that people are using WHOOP

373
12:44.790 --> 12:46.800
and other wearables to drive that behavior

374
12:46.800 --> 12:47.790
change and then they're going back

375
12:47.790 --> 12:48.997
to their doctor and they're saying,

376
12:48.997 --> 12:49.860
"Wow, you've made a

377
12:49.860 --> 12:50.693
lot of progress in this time."

378
12:50.693 --> 12:52.260
And so I think in the future,

379
12:52.260 --> 12:53.670
we need to see a lot more collaboration

380
12:53.670 --> 12:55.410
so that that's such a seamless experience

381
12:55.410 --> 12:56.460
for the end consumer.

382
12:57.330 --> 13:00.600
<v ->Yeah, Alexi, I totally agree with that.</v>

383
13:00.600 --> 13:02.760
It's really interesting because

384
13:02.760 --> 13:05.640
I believe traditional medicine was episodic.

385
13:05.640 --> 13:06.600
You went to the doctor,

386
13:06.600 --> 13:08.127
you got your blood pressure,

387
13:08.127 --> 13:09.030
you know, you had a blood draw

388
13:09.030 --> 13:11.460
and you got, you know, a lipid profile.

389
13:11.460 --> 13:14.244
Wearables create mountains of data

390
13:14.244 --> 13:16.800
all day, every day.

391
13:16.800 --> 13:18.840
Now what do you do with that?

392
13:18.840 --> 13:23.430
So, you know, we create lots of metrics,

393
13:23.430 --> 13:26.400
body battery, stress, we measure your sleep

394
13:26.400 --> 13:29.550
that you can use yourself to, you know,

395
13:29.550 --> 13:30.780
keep track of your behavior

396
13:30.780 --> 13:32.550
and your wellness state.

397
13:32.550 --> 13:34.140
But I think the challenge

398
13:34.140 --> 13:36.330
that we're at right now is what does

399
13:36.330 --> 13:38.460
the clinician do with this mountain of data?

400
13:38.460 --> 13:41.070
You show up at your doctor's office

401
13:41.070 --> 13:43.020
and say, "Here's the last six months

402
13:43.020 --> 13:45.600
of my stress data."

403
13:45.600 --> 13:47.670
They don't know what to do with that, right?

404
13:47.670 --> 13:52.670
So the intersection of the wearable data

405
13:52.920 --> 13:55.320
and the clinician is still evolving

406
13:55.320 --> 13:57.930
right now because I've seen it both ways.

407
13:57.930 --> 13:59.767
I've talked to doctors who are like,

408
13:59.767 --> 14:01.020
"I don't care what that says,

409
14:01.020 --> 14:02.670
it's not a medical device, you know,

410
14:02.670 --> 14:04.440
it doesn't have a 510(k)."

411
14:04.440 --> 14:06.840
And I've gone to doctors

412
14:06.840 --> 14:08.670
and showed them an ECG strip

413
14:08.670 --> 14:10.020
from a Garmin wearable,

414
14:10.020 --> 14:11.760
and they immediately read it

415
14:11.760 --> 14:13.680
and said, "Yep, this is premature atrial

416
14:13.680 --> 14:15.450
contractions, this is AFib."

417
14:15.450 --> 14:17.280
I've seen both sides.

418
14:17.280 --> 14:20.493
And so I think the challenge here is,

419
14:22.170 --> 14:25.290
you know, Alexi mentioned that people adhere,

420
14:25.290 --> 14:26.400
they wear these devices

421
14:26.400 --> 14:28.413
because they see such great benefit,

422
14:29.640 --> 14:31.470
so they're modifying their own behavior,

423
14:31.470 --> 14:34.080
but when they get to the doctor,

424
14:34.080 --> 14:35.520
I think there's still something that needs

425
14:35.520 --> 14:38.370
to be done to process this data,

426
14:38.370 --> 14:40.860
create something that's easily digestible

427
14:40.860 --> 14:42.270
for a clinician to look at

428
14:42.270 --> 14:46.320
and give them give you insights about,

429
14:46.320 --> 14:48.930
okay, here's some ideas about how to improve.

430
14:48.930 --> 14:52.260
So it's really an interesting thing

431
14:52.260 --> 14:54.600
and as Praveen said, giving that data

432
14:54.600 --> 14:56.970
to the doctor is happening

433
14:56.970 --> 14:58.350
and then getting your doctor to pay

434
14:58.350 --> 15:01.440
attention to it, that's another challenge.

435
15:01.440 --> 15:02.880
<v ->If I can add a little bit more, I think,</v>

436
15:02.880 --> 15:04.080
you know, one of the things that I find

437
15:04.080 --> 15:05.190
really encouraging is we hear all

438
15:05.190 --> 15:07.680
these stories from members, things like,

439
15:07.680 --> 15:10.170
you know, "I understood what my regular data

440
15:10.170 --> 15:12.570
looks like, I noticed this unusual pattern,

441
15:12.570 --> 15:14.550
I took action and I got some medical help,

442
15:14.550 --> 15:15.810
and my cardiologist said that,

443
15:15.810 --> 15:17.642
WHOOP saved my life."

444
15:17.642 --> 15:20.141
And so I think when we start to have people,

445
15:20.141 --> 15:20.974
you know, that are going

446
15:20.974 --> 15:21.937
to the healthcare system saying,

447
15:21.937 --> 15:23.280
"Hey, like there's something in my data,

448
15:23.280 --> 15:24.113
please look at it."

449
15:24.113 --> 15:25.920
And they have these amazing experiences

450
15:25.920 --> 15:26.753
and they find out

451
15:26.753 --> 15:27.586
they're about to have a heart attack

452
15:27.586 --> 15:28.860
and they can get the care they need.

453
15:28.860 --> 15:32.040
That starts really like creating this shift

454
15:32.040 --> 15:32.873
where we start to say,

455
15:32.873 --> 15:34.440
"Okay, this is really important,

456
15:34.440 --> 15:36.060
we need to collaborate better."

457
15:36.060 --> 15:37.920
But we know that there's other people

458
15:37.920 --> 15:38.753
that go there

459
15:38.753 --> 15:40.200
and they don't get that enriched conversation,

460
15:40.200 --> 15:42.270
their wearable data is not fully understood.

461
15:42.270 --> 15:43.680
And even for wearables

462
15:43.680 --> 15:45.810
that have medically cleared features,

463
15:45.810 --> 15:47.790
we know that sometimes that is taking people

464
15:47.790 --> 15:49.620
that wouldn't have been screened before,

465
15:49.620 --> 15:51.870
sending them to the healthcare

466
15:51.870 --> 15:53.490
to try to get a consultation.

467
15:53.490 --> 15:55.200
And we're just overburdening

468
15:55.200 --> 15:56.880
an already overburdened system.

469
15:56.880 --> 15:58.080
And so I think we have to really figure

470
15:58.080 --> 16:00.180
that out because ultimately,

471
16:00.180 --> 16:01.200
the consumer needs a better

472
16:01.200 --> 16:03.150
experience and can't feel lost there.

473
16:03.150 --> 16:04.410
<v ->Yeah.</v>

474
16:04.410 --> 16:05.880
Here, we've talked about a lot of the benefits

475
16:05.880 --> 16:07.050
of wearables, let's talk a little bit

476
16:07.050 --> 16:10.140
about why doctors right now are not

477
16:10.140 --> 16:13.410
using wearables or they're not collaborating.

478
16:13.410 --> 16:14.760
What are the barriers right now

479
16:14.760 --> 16:18.423
to clinical acceptance?

480
16:20.580 --> 16:22.263
<v ->Let me take that real quick.</v>

481
16:23.220 --> 16:26.550
I feel like a doctor's not always paid

482
16:26.550 --> 16:28.350
to read wearable data, okay.

483
16:28.350 --> 16:30.300
So there's a payer

484
16:30.300 --> 16:32.520
or there is a reimbursement issue, okay.

485
16:32.520 --> 16:34.860
So a doctor's not gonna take their time

486
16:34.860 --> 16:35.693
to look at your wearable data,

487
16:35.693 --> 16:37.890
if they're not gonna be reimbursed for that.

488
16:40.991 --> 16:42.150
So one of the things that's happening right now

489
16:42.150 --> 16:43.920
is we're in the evidence gathering phase

490
16:43.920 --> 16:46.170
for wearables where we are gathering evidence

491
16:46.170 --> 16:47.760
to show that use of a wearable

492
16:47.760 --> 16:51.081
improves an outcome, saves money.

493
16:51.081 --> 16:52.860
Somebody who has diabetes,

494
16:52.860 --> 16:54.390
they have way less care costs

495
16:54.390 --> 16:55.470
because they use a wearable.

496
16:55.470 --> 16:58.110
So we're in that evidence gathering phase.

497
16:58.110 --> 17:00.480
The next step is for the payers of the world

498
17:00.480 --> 17:02.580
to say, "Yeah, this works.

499
17:02.580 --> 17:03.660
This is gonna be a treatment

500
17:03.660 --> 17:05.130
we're gonna be reimbursed for."

501
17:05.130 --> 17:06.277
And then the doctor can say,

502
17:06.277 --> 17:07.980
"Yeah, bring it on.

503
17:07.980 --> 17:09.570
I'll read your data,

504
17:09.570 --> 17:12.780
I'll prescribe a wearable digital therapy,"

505
17:12.780 --> 17:14.190
and they'll be reimbursed for it.

506
17:14.190 --> 17:16.350
So that's where we are now

507
17:16.350 --> 17:18.450
and we're going to get there.

508
17:18.450 --> 17:19.890
The data is really indisputable.

509
17:19.890 --> 17:22.350
I think it's just a matter of getting it done.

510
17:22.350 --> 17:24.060
<v ->I am a lot more optimistic about this.</v>

511
17:24.060 --> 17:26.880
I see them using wearable, I mean,

512
17:26.880 --> 17:28.140
every doctor we've talked to,

513
17:28.140 --> 17:30.180
every nutritionist as I mentioned earlier,

514
17:30.180 --> 17:31.710
they embrace the wearable.

515
17:31.710 --> 17:33.090
What the doctors don't have

516
17:33.090 --> 17:36.046
is a lot of time per patient, right?

517
17:36.046 --> 17:39.030
There is a epidemic of chronic diseases

518
17:39.030 --> 17:41.400
in this country, in every developed economy,

519
17:41.400 --> 17:43.950
90% of healthcare expenditures is dedicated

520
17:43.950 --> 17:46.680
to chronic disease management.

521
17:46.680 --> 17:48.690
Doctors have 15 minutes per patient,

522
17:48.690 --> 17:50.340
it gets very hard to get a doctor.

523
17:50.340 --> 17:52.290
I moved to the Bay area six months ago.

524
17:52.290 --> 17:53.580
I'm still looking for that doctor

525
17:53.580 --> 17:56.100
that will accept new patients, right?

526
17:56.100 --> 17:58.710
So they want to save time.

527
17:58.710 --> 18:00.990
And so they see a lot of value in the sensors,

528
18:00.990 --> 18:03.900
but we have a responsibility as industry players

529
18:03.900 --> 18:06.120
to make sure that we're not creating anxiety

530
18:06.120 --> 18:08.760
with the user and that we're integrating

531
18:08.760 --> 18:10.560
our knowledge with their knowledge

532
18:10.560 --> 18:11.520
of the patients.

533
18:11.520 --> 18:12.870
So what Praveen was talking about,

534
18:12.870 --> 18:13.830
like this is very much,

535
18:13.830 --> 18:15.600
wearable needs to be an extension

536
18:15.600 --> 18:17.040
of healthcare providers.

537
18:17.040 --> 18:18.660
So all the minor issues,

538
18:18.660 --> 18:20.580
all the minor concerns can be taken care

539
18:20.580 --> 18:23.400
by the wearable, the app and so forth.

540
18:23.400 --> 18:25.530
And then you save time for the practitioners

541
18:25.530 --> 18:27.930
to focus on exactly what matters the most.

542
18:27.930 --> 18:29.640
So I'm very optimistic about it.

543
18:29.640 --> 18:31.290
I've been very pleased to see the reaction

544
18:31.290 --> 18:32.850
of doctors and practitioners.

545
18:32.850 --> 18:34.353
So I think this is, well,

546
18:34.353 --> 18:35.430
definitely the right direction.

547
18:35.430 --> 18:37.860
<v ->Just if I could add just a tiny bit.</v>

548
18:37.860 --> 18:39.000
When I was at J&amp;J,

549
18:39.000 --> 18:40.987
we did a study with physicians to say,

550
18:40.987 --> 18:43.470
"How can they consume digital health easily?"

551
18:43.470 --> 18:44.970
What we found is that when you sit

552
18:44.970 --> 18:46.440
and you watch a physician

553
18:46.440 --> 18:49.470
and a patient visit, it's only a 15 minute visit,

554
18:49.470 --> 18:51.630
as Olivier said, but the first five,

555
18:51.630 --> 18:53.070
seven minutes sometimes is taken up

556
18:53.070 --> 18:55.087
by asking people how they're doing at home.

557
18:55.087 --> 18:56.400
"Hey, how are you sleeping?

558
18:56.400 --> 18:57.750
How are you eating?

559
18:57.750 --> 18:59.610
Are you exercising, right?

560
18:59.610 --> 19:00.660
Is there stress in your life?"

561
19:00.660 --> 19:02.910
Because those four things I mentioned

562
19:02.910 --> 19:04.200
that we internally at Samsung call,

563
19:04.200 --> 19:06.090
four pillars affect almost

564
19:06.090 --> 19:07.050
every chronic condition,

565
19:07.050 --> 19:08.700
makes every chronic condition worse.

566
19:08.700 --> 19:10.080
And as a physician, you wanna understand

567
19:10.080 --> 19:11.910
that beyond that, you wanna understand

568
19:11.910 --> 19:13.320
other questions that doctor ask

569
19:13.320 --> 19:14.617
in those few minutes is,

570
19:14.617 --> 19:16.230
"Are you taking your medications?

571
19:16.230 --> 19:17.160
Is it helping?

572
19:17.160 --> 19:18.240
Are your symptoms better?

573
19:18.240 --> 19:20.130
Are you having side effects?"

574
19:20.130 --> 19:22.440
So we can answer all those questions

575
19:22.440 --> 19:24.570
for physicians because we know

576
19:24.570 --> 19:26.340
how patients have done at home

577
19:26.340 --> 19:29.430
for the 90 days on average between visits.

578
19:29.430 --> 19:31.230
So it's our job to summarize that

579
19:31.230 --> 19:32.760
for the doctor quickly.

580
19:32.760 --> 19:34.680
So if they have 30 seconds,

581
19:34.680 --> 19:36.390
15 seconds to see a record

582
19:36.390 --> 19:37.920
before they walk into a patient,

583
19:37.920 --> 19:39.870
we need to be able as a industry

584
19:39.870 --> 19:40.957
to summarize that and say,

585
19:40.957 --> 19:42.630
"Hey, this is what's happened at home

586
19:42.630 --> 19:43.770
for the last 90 days.

587
19:43.770 --> 19:45.960
Medication taking is at 75%.

588
19:45.960 --> 19:48.030
These medications have these side effects.

589
19:48.030 --> 19:49.440
Patient is not sleeping well."

590
19:49.440 --> 19:52.200
Summarize, and then they will then find value

591
19:52.200 --> 19:53.460
in that because you've just saved them

592
19:53.460 --> 19:54.930
the first five or seven minutes.

593
19:54.930 --> 19:56.160
That's the path forward.

594
19:56.160 --> 19:57.750
And that, I think, the kind

595
19:57.750 --> 19:59.970
of tools that we're trying to build.

596
19:59.970 --> 20:02.400
<v ->Yeah, you mentioned a reimbursement,</v>

597
20:02.400 --> 20:03.930
it's a huge issue because

598
20:03.930 --> 20:07.590
we talk about wearables, the worried well.

599
20:07.590 --> 20:10.170
The ones that are tracking their health data

600
20:10.170 --> 20:13.440
and talking to their doctor about that data,

601
20:13.440 --> 20:15.690
they're not the ones we need to worry about.

602
20:15.690 --> 20:18.480
The larger population out there

603
20:18.480 --> 20:20.217
are not tracking their health data

604
20:20.217 --> 20:22.530
and they're not worried about their health data,

605
20:22.530 --> 20:23.680
they should be worried.

606
20:25.890 --> 20:28.620
They are part of a much larger population

607
20:28.620 --> 20:31.130
that really would benefit from wearables,

608
20:31.130 --> 20:33.470
if they were introduced to wearables

609
20:33.470 --> 20:35.770
or if they were convinced to use the wearables

610
20:37.323 --> 20:40.140
and really, that's the Medicare population.

611
20:40.140 --> 20:43.650
And unless CMS, which is notoriously slow

612
20:43.650 --> 20:46.290
in reimbursing new technology,

613
20:46.290 --> 20:49.350
starts supporting wearables,

614
20:49.350 --> 20:52.080
it's gonna be a challenge to really

615
20:52.080 --> 20:54.210
move the needle on chronic care

616
20:54.210 --> 20:56.340
management and others.

617
20:56.340 --> 21:00.657
And you know, are there different methods

618
21:00.657 --> 21:04.113
for engaging with that type of population?

619
21:06.780 --> 21:10.620
<v ->Well, I think that the way you do it is,</v>

620
21:10.620 --> 21:13.020
you just make a wearable that people wanna wear.

621
21:14.550 --> 21:16.350
We were talking in the speaker's lounge,

622
21:16.350 --> 21:17.490
I was talking with Alexi,

623
21:17.490 --> 21:19.110
once people put on their wearable,

624
21:19.110 --> 21:20.880
their Garmin, their WHOOP, or whatever,

625
21:20.880 --> 21:22.890
a lot of them, they get hooked on it,

626
21:22.890 --> 21:24.000
they never take it off.

627
21:24.000 --> 21:24.833
They look at their data

628
21:24.833 --> 21:27.060
every morning after they sleep.

629
21:27.060 --> 21:30.360
And so if we can just get people, you know,

630
21:30.360 --> 21:33.480
introduced to it, we find that they keep wearing

631
21:33.480 --> 21:36.090
it and it changes behavior.

632
21:36.090 --> 21:38.430
And so how do we reach all of those people?

633
21:38.430 --> 21:40.530
I don't know, better advertising,

634
21:40.530 --> 21:42.150
better marketing, but it starts

635
21:42.150 --> 21:43.830
with a really good wearable experience.

636
21:43.830 --> 21:45.270
It has to have good sensors,

637
21:45.270 --> 21:47.040
has to have a really good app

638
21:47.040 --> 21:48.810
and it has to engage people.

639
21:48.810 --> 21:49.980
And you know, one of the things

640
21:49.980 --> 21:52.950
that we have found in the use of Garmin devices

641
21:52.950 --> 21:55.260
and like clinical research

642
21:55.260 --> 21:57.360
is that adherence is good.

643
21:57.360 --> 21:58.710
People start wearing it

644
21:58.710 --> 22:00.630
and they finish the study wearing it.

645
22:00.630 --> 22:01.920
They don't fall out.

646
22:01.920 --> 22:04.260
And I think that's really strong evidence

647
22:04.260 --> 22:06.180
that people find value in it.

648
22:06.180 --> 22:08.640
And that if we could get more people to wear it,

649
22:08.640 --> 22:10.953
we would see, you know, improved outcomes.

650
22:12.480 --> 22:14.220
<v ->I totally agree that, you know,</v>

651
22:14.220 --> 22:16.230
it all goes back to the consumer experience.

652
22:16.230 --> 22:19.110
Is this something that you want to wear 24/7,

653
22:19.110 --> 22:20.940
what else do you wear 24/7?

654
22:20.940 --> 22:21.900
Maybe, a wedding ring,

655
22:21.900 --> 22:24.030
but it's such a high bar.

656
22:24.030 --> 22:26.490
And so I think you have to create this seamless,

657
22:26.490 --> 22:29.340
enjoyable experience that feels really rewarding.

658
22:29.340 --> 22:31.680
And at the same time, I think, you know,

659
22:31.680 --> 22:33.030
we're in this evolution where wearables

660
22:33.030 --> 22:34.080
were once worn by people

661
22:34.080 --> 22:35.100
that were into biohacking

662
22:35.100 --> 22:36.300
or had very specific conditions

663
22:36.300 --> 22:38.190
or we're seeing just this proliferation

664
22:38.190 --> 22:40.290
of people figure out that's a really

665
22:40.290 --> 22:41.340
important part of their life

666
22:41.340 --> 22:42.930
and they like that empowerment.

667
22:42.930 --> 22:45.300
And I think this is also aligned with,

668
22:45.300 --> 22:46.170
we need to continue

669
22:46.170 --> 22:47.520
to make wearables more accessible.

670
22:47.520 --> 22:49.680
So for WHOOP, we have a 30-day free trial.

671
22:49.680 --> 22:51.120
And I think if you've never worn a wearable

672
22:51.120 --> 22:53.220
before or if you've always wondered

673
22:53.220 --> 22:55.410
what it's like to wear something like WHOOP,

674
22:55.410 --> 22:57.360
it's way easier to just try it,

675
22:57.360 --> 22:58.193
to understand, you know,

676
22:58.193 --> 22:59.280
how well do you actually sleep?

677
22:59.280 --> 23:00.360
Do you get as much exercise

678
23:00.360 --> 23:01.680
as you think you do, you know,

679
23:01.680 --> 23:04.290
how do you feel when you're starting your day?

680
23:04.290 --> 23:05.430
And so I think continuous

681
23:05.430 --> 23:06.990
business model innovation's really important

682
23:06.990 --> 23:09.180
to make this accessible to more people.

683
23:09.180 --> 23:10.680
And so that it's not just something

684
23:10.680 --> 23:12.330
that pro athletes wear.

685
23:12.330 --> 23:14.010
And we've really been on this journey

686
23:14.010 --> 23:16.140
where it's like the best athletes in the world

687
23:16.140 --> 23:17.880
wear WHOOP, but also people that just wanna

688
23:17.880 --> 23:19.620
be a better leader, a better parent,

689
23:19.620 --> 23:22.350
a better human, they wanna feel good for longer.

690
23:22.350 --> 23:23.490
And you know,

691
23:23.490 --> 23:24.750
we need to bring that to more people.

692
23:24.750 --> 23:26.640
I fully agree, there's an accessibility

693
23:26.640 --> 23:28.140
thing that's really important.

694
23:29.040 --> 23:30.000
<v ->Scott, I just wanted to add,</v>

695
23:30.000 --> 23:31.979
'cause you talked about, you know,

696
23:31.979 --> 23:33.780
what's the incentive for physicians, et cetera.

697
23:33.780 --> 23:35.280
I know, we talked about there being a lack

698
23:35.280 --> 23:37.620
of reimbursement, but there is some reimbursement

699
23:37.620 --> 23:38.730
and we should recognize that, right?

700
23:38.730 --> 23:41.040
There's remote patient monitoring codes

701
23:41.040 --> 23:42.810
and certain guidelines for monitoring

702
23:42.810 --> 23:44.250
patients remotely using wearables

703
23:44.250 --> 23:45.960
and there's reimbursement.

704
23:45.960 --> 23:47.250
It's just that it's not always

705
23:47.250 --> 23:48.930
well known in the physician population.

706
23:48.930 --> 23:52.350
And they're not well-equipped in a clinic setting

707
23:52.350 --> 23:55.170
to provide all the requirements

708
23:55.170 --> 23:56.190
or to meet all the requirements

709
23:56.190 --> 23:57.210
for remote patient monitoring

710
23:57.210 --> 23:58.890
and therefore, there's a bit of friction,

711
23:58.890 --> 24:00.690
but there are some reimbursement pathways.

712
24:00.690 --> 24:01.523
<v ->There is, yes.</v>

713
24:01.523 --> 24:03.270
Remote physiological monitoring,

714
24:03.270 --> 24:04.830
I think is what CMS describes

715
24:04.830 --> 24:08.490
it as a therapeutic monitoring as well.

716
24:08.490 --> 24:10.620
Sometimes, the hoops you have to jump through

717
24:10.620 --> 24:12.690
to get those reimbursements is a little bit

718
24:12.690 --> 24:14.440
too daunting as well.
<v Praveen>Yes.</v>

719
24:14.440 --> 24:16.350
<v ->We're getting down to 15 minutes left</v>

720
24:16.350 --> 24:17.910
and I knew this was gonna happen.

721
24:17.910 --> 24:20.403
I mean, I've given up on the questions, totally.

722
24:21.510 --> 24:24.213
We can continue this conversation all day long.

723
24:25.290 --> 24:28.740
I want to talk a little bit about AI

724
24:28.740 --> 24:32.862
and about how wearables are going to evolve.

725
24:32.862 --> 24:37.020
Where do you see this platform

726
24:37.020 --> 24:38.103
expanding or you know,

727
24:38.103 --> 24:40.770
what other wearables are we gonna see

728
24:40.770 --> 24:42.000
out there in the new future?

729
24:42.000 --> 24:44.790
And how is AI, which is everywhere,

730
24:44.790 --> 24:48.150
which is in every single conversation here,

731
24:48.150 --> 24:49.410
how is that going

732
24:49.410 --> 24:52.620
to affect the wearables industry?

733
24:52.620 --> 24:54.960
<v ->So I'm very bullish about wearable,</v>

734
24:54.960 --> 24:58.530
obviously, as the four of us, I suspect.

735
24:58.530 --> 25:01.080
We already know wearables can drive

736
25:01.080 --> 25:03.780
behavioral change toward healthier habits.

737
25:03.780 --> 25:05.580
I remember my dad 20 years ago,

738
25:05.580 --> 25:07.800
at the beginning of the step trackers

739
25:07.800 --> 25:09.360
will go for a walk after dinner.

740
25:09.360 --> 25:11.220
I was making fun of him.

741
25:11.220 --> 25:13.380
He wanted to close his 10,000 steps.

742
25:13.380 --> 25:14.460
Now I do the same,

743
25:14.460 --> 25:17.010
which is a healthy habit as well, right?

744
25:17.010 --> 25:19.290
We see with glucose monitoring for the consumer,

745
25:19.290 --> 25:21.000
not just for people with diabetes,

746
25:21.000 --> 25:23.040
they change the way they eat.

747
25:23.040 --> 25:24.180
You know, they stop the carbs

748
25:24.180 --> 25:26.490
that don't suit them, they focus on proteins,

749
25:26.490 --> 25:27.660
leafy greens and so forth.

750
25:27.660 --> 25:29.400
We see it because they can see the impact

751
25:29.400 --> 25:31.620
right away in real time on their watch.

752
25:31.620 --> 25:32.730
So it's already happening,

753
25:32.730 --> 25:34.500
it's already changing behaviorals.

754
25:34.500 --> 25:35.970
I think the power of AI

755
25:35.970 --> 25:37.200
and I think this is the right time

756
25:37.200 --> 25:39.510
to go hard on wearable.

757
25:39.510 --> 25:41.460
The power of AI is twofold.

758
25:41.460 --> 25:44.550
One, it has a power of simplifying the complex.

759
25:44.550 --> 25:46.800
So it thrives on big data.

760
25:46.800 --> 25:47.850
Trying to understand,

761
25:47.850 --> 25:49.470
like for us is a glucose graph,

762
25:49.470 --> 25:50.340
like what does that mean?

763
25:50.340 --> 25:52.920
Your glucose going up and down all the time.

764
25:52.920 --> 25:55.260
Most of it is nothing to worry about.

765
25:55.260 --> 25:56.940
Some of them is something you should focus

766
25:56.940 --> 25:58.410
and try to change your behavior around it.

767
25:58.410 --> 26:00.420
So being able to identify the part

768
26:00.420 --> 26:01.980
of your glucose volatility that matters

769
26:01.980 --> 26:04.680
versus not is part of AI right there.

770
26:04.680 --> 26:05.940
Another part of AI is,

771
26:05.940 --> 26:08.220
it brings the whole medical expertise

772
26:08.220 --> 26:10.680
of the world literally into your pocket.

773
26:10.680 --> 26:13.380
So you're working basically with a physician

774
26:13.380 --> 26:14.820
and the behavioral psychologist

775
26:14.820 --> 26:16.230
right in your pocket,

776
26:16.230 --> 26:18.780
trying to help you to develop better habits.

777
26:18.780 --> 26:20.820
So that's very unique.

778
26:20.820 --> 26:22.740
And while we're trying to do it already now

779
26:22.740 --> 26:24.540
without AI is clunky, right?

780
26:24.540 --> 26:26.670
So with AI, it becomes much more personalized,

781
26:26.670 --> 26:28.500
much smoother and so forth.

782
26:28.500 --> 26:30.750
So I'm very, very excited about this,

783
26:30.750 --> 26:33.060
primarily for behavioral change

784
26:33.060 --> 26:35.936
because I mean, I think you mentioned Alexi,

785
26:35.936 --> 26:38.460
like 50% causes of death is avoidable.

786
26:38.460 --> 26:40.710
I think 80% of chronic diseases

787
26:40.710 --> 26:41.820
are caused by lifestyle,

788
26:41.820 --> 26:43.590
not DNA, lifestyle, not DNA.

789
26:43.590 --> 26:45.810
So everything is avoidable

790
26:45.810 --> 26:47.910
and it's much easier to change behavior

791
26:47.910 --> 26:49.680
early on in life than later on.

792
26:49.680 --> 26:51.300
Like I prefer to, you know,

793
26:51.300 --> 26:53.850
optimize by 10% in my 20s if I knew

794
26:53.850 --> 26:56.262
that rather than waiting in my 50s

795
26:56.262 --> 26:58.140
and now I need to do a 180 degree

796
26:58.140 --> 27:00.300
change in my way of living, right?

797
27:00.300 --> 27:04.080
So the more we can drive behavioral change,

798
27:04.080 --> 27:06.630
the more we can lower chronic diseases,

799
27:06.630 --> 27:09.210
the more we can free up capacity in hospitals

800
27:09.210 --> 27:11.670
and so forth and the more impact

801
27:11.670 --> 27:13.410
we can have on the associated basis.

802
27:13.410 --> 27:14.910
So I think AI is the right time

803
27:14.910 --> 27:16.080
to bring it into it.

804
27:16.080 --> 27:17.790
Now, we have a huge challenge

805
27:17.790 --> 27:19.650
as industry players going forward

806
27:19.650 --> 27:23.220
because what the future of wearable is not

807
27:23.220 --> 27:25.830
is 13 sensors in your body

808
27:25.830 --> 27:29.370
is 13 notifications every 10 minutes

809
27:29.370 --> 27:31.980
with different recommendations

810
27:31.980 --> 27:33.450
on what you need to do

811
27:33.450 --> 27:35.010
that will drive more anxiety,

812
27:35.010 --> 27:36.510
more cost to the healthcare system

813
27:36.510 --> 27:37.343
and so forth.

814
27:37.343 --> 27:39.750
So our responsibilities is to simplify

815
27:39.750 --> 27:41.610
all this, to integrate

816
27:41.610 --> 27:43.590
not only amongst ourselves to create like,

817
27:43.590 --> 27:45.570
you know, a source of truth for your health

818
27:45.570 --> 27:48.060
because your health is not just one metric

819
27:48.060 --> 27:49.440
or the other, it's a sum of all those

820
27:49.440 --> 27:51.450
metrics put together, then integrate

821
27:51.450 --> 27:53.670
with the healthcare system to have a continuum.

822
27:53.670 --> 27:55.440
So one is the extension of the user,

823
27:55.440 --> 27:56.730
the two should work very well together

824
27:56.730 --> 27:58.110
like Praveen was mentioning.

825
27:58.110 --> 27:59.130
So I think this is on us

826
27:59.130 --> 28:01.080
to make it very, very easy for users

827
28:01.080 --> 28:02.790
to engage with those wearable

828
28:02.790 --> 28:04.890
and connect with their physicians as well.

829
28:06.570 --> 28:07.403
<v ->I agree with so much</v>

830
28:07.403 --> 28:09.120
of what you just said, Olivier.

831
28:09.120 --> 28:10.713
I think, you know, there's a couple of things

832
28:10.713 --> 28:12.900
that we're gonna see as wearables

833
28:12.900 --> 28:14.790
really cemented themselves

834
28:14.790 --> 28:16.410
into people's daily lives.

835
28:16.410 --> 28:17.243
We just wanna make

836
28:17.243 --> 28:18.930
that as frictionless as possible, right?

837
28:18.930 --> 28:22.110
So continuous improvements in battery life,

838
28:22.110 --> 28:25.140
simplicity in form factor,

839
28:25.140 --> 28:26.580
the ability to make it your own

840
28:26.580 --> 28:27.990
so WHOOP, you can change your band,

841
28:27.990 --> 28:29.220
you can wear WHOOP on your body

842
28:29.220 --> 28:30.660
and your bra, in your underwear,

843
28:30.660 --> 28:31.830
on your bicep.

844
28:31.830 --> 28:33.960
And just this ability to integrate

845
28:33.960 --> 28:35.850
into people's lives because people understand

846
28:35.850 --> 28:38.040
the value of measuring every heartbeat.

847
28:38.040 --> 28:39.450
With AI, I think we're gonna continue

848
28:39.450 --> 28:41.430
to see this hyper-personalization.

849
28:41.430 --> 28:43.350
So what is your best next move

850
28:43.350 --> 28:46.500
based on your data today in this moment?

851
28:46.500 --> 28:48.360
And it's gonna have to simplify

852
28:48.360 --> 28:49.860
'cause it's not just about what you track,

853
28:49.860 --> 28:51.360
like that's table stakes, but it's about

854
28:51.360 --> 28:53.130
what can you make this person do?

855
28:53.130 --> 28:53.963
How can you help

856
28:53.963 --> 28:55.470
them unlock their full potential?

857
28:55.470 --> 28:56.850
How can you help them take action

858
28:56.850 --> 28:58.350
earlier so that time is on their side

859
28:58.350 --> 28:59.280
when it comes to health?

860
28:59.280 --> 29:00.450
And I think we're gonna continue

861
29:00.450 --> 29:02.160
to see some really exciting trends

862
29:02.160 --> 29:03.160
in those directions.

863
29:04.650 --> 29:05.730
<v ->I think first of all,</v>

864
29:05.730 --> 29:06.563
you asked about two things.

865
29:06.563 --> 29:08.460
The technology trends, I agree

866
29:08.460 --> 29:09.690
are getting more personal, right?

867
29:09.690 --> 29:10.523
Wearables are not

868
29:10.523 --> 29:11.850
what they were when I started my career,

869
29:11.850 --> 29:14.050
like there are patches and things like that.

870
29:15.360 --> 29:17.340
Wearables now are fitting into people's life,

871
29:17.340 --> 29:19.680
right, ring for example, we launched our ring,

872
29:19.680 --> 29:20.513
I wear it all the time,

873
29:20.513 --> 29:21.660
I don't even know it's there,

874
29:21.660 --> 29:23.340
it's just part of my body.

875
29:23.340 --> 29:24.930
So we're making it easier like that.

876
29:24.930 --> 29:26.430
I think of other form factors

877
29:26.430 --> 29:29.280
that are coming as you know are like AR glasses

878
29:29.280 --> 29:30.780
and they're textile kind of variables.

879
29:30.780 --> 29:32.310
So I think as an industry,

880
29:32.310 --> 29:33.840
we are developing things that are fitting

881
29:33.840 --> 29:35.190
into people's life versus something

882
29:35.190 --> 29:36.660
that's so artificial

883
29:36.660 --> 29:37.770
and add on to people's life.

884
29:37.770 --> 29:40.260
I think that's one kind of trend.

885
29:40.260 --> 29:43.230
With regard to AI, there are two places

886
29:43.230 --> 29:45.060
where I think AI is really making a difference

887
29:45.060 --> 29:48.330
and both have to do with putting the consumer,

888
29:48.330 --> 29:50.250
our users at the center.

889
29:50.250 --> 29:51.840
So it's not like previously where

890
29:51.840 --> 29:53.730
you're thinking, "Hey, I have all this data,

891
29:53.730 --> 29:55.500
now how do I generate insights from that

892
29:55.500 --> 29:57.180
and how do I feed that to people?"

893
29:57.180 --> 29:58.560
It's the other way around.

894
29:58.560 --> 30:02.070
Start with you're a user, what are your goals?

895
30:02.070 --> 30:03.180
What are your preferences?

896
30:03.180 --> 30:04.170
What are you trying to achieve

897
30:04.170 --> 30:05.880
in your life in terms of your health?

898
30:05.880 --> 30:09.240
And then AI, knowing your data,

899
30:09.240 --> 30:11.790
knowing what you want, knowing your goals,

900
30:11.790 --> 30:13.140
knowing what's happened with your doctor,

901
30:13.140 --> 30:15.660
bringing all that together from all your devices,

902
30:15.660 --> 30:18.157
including home devices and saying,

903
30:18.157 --> 30:20.250
"Hey, here's what's happening

904
30:20.250 --> 30:21.210
with you the last week,

905
30:21.210 --> 30:23.040
you're not sleeping well, right?

906
30:23.040 --> 30:24.780
And it may be because your stress

907
30:24.780 --> 30:26.589
is high the last few days,

908
30:26.589 --> 30:29.370
how about trying these three things?"

909
30:29.370 --> 30:30.540
So it's that personal

910
30:30.540 --> 30:32.070
and it's real time.

911
30:32.070 --> 30:34.590
I think that personalization that Alexi,

912
30:34.590 --> 30:36.690
you talked about is the most important thing.

913
30:36.690 --> 30:38.400
I think it's not a mass manufactured

914
30:38.400 --> 30:39.990
thing anymore, it's really understanding

915
30:39.990 --> 30:41.400
each person's life, their context,

916
30:41.400 --> 30:43.140
their questions, and guiding them

917
30:43.140 --> 30:44.520
in real time based on their data

918
30:44.520 --> 30:45.690
to help them achieve their goals

919
30:45.690 --> 30:49.500
with little nudges and insights along the way.

920
30:49.500 --> 30:51.000
I think there's one more AI trend

921
30:51.000 --> 30:52.800
that's happening that I want to call out,

922
30:52.800 --> 30:54.900
which is we can't give people

923
30:54.900 --> 30:55.950
a whole string of numbers.

924
30:55.950 --> 30:57.390
So if you just think about Samsung,

925
30:57.390 --> 30:58.980
we got so much data from our wearables,

926
30:58.980 --> 31:01.080
our smart watches, our rings,

927
31:01.080 --> 31:03.720
data coming from doctors, et cetera, right?

928
31:03.720 --> 31:05.790
And home devices as well.

929
31:05.790 --> 31:06.750
That's a lot of data

930
31:06.750 --> 31:08.940
that we just can't give them a string of data.

931
31:08.940 --> 31:11.970
So we have to create a more personalized way

932
31:11.970 --> 31:13.020
of engaging with it.

933
31:13.020 --> 31:15.360
So with the advent of generative AI

934
31:15.360 --> 31:17.040
and large language models

935
31:17.040 --> 31:20.160
and health assistant type of interfaces,

936
31:20.160 --> 31:21.750
we're hoping to allow users to ask

937
31:21.750 --> 31:23.400
their own questions of the data,

938
31:23.400 --> 31:24.570
what they want to know,

939
31:24.570 --> 31:27.480
and then give them the insights

940
31:27.480 --> 31:28.650
and coaching and guidance that they

941
31:28.650 --> 31:30.930
need to get to where they want to get to.

942
31:30.930 --> 31:32.160
But even in terms of numbers,

943
31:32.160 --> 31:33.330
there's another approach we are taking,

944
31:33.330 --> 31:36.120
which is, how can we give people just one number?

945
31:36.120 --> 31:37.140
So if you don't have time

946
31:37.140 --> 31:38.840
and you just wanna know one number

947
31:39.960 --> 31:41.070
in terms of how you're doing

948
31:41.070 --> 31:42.810
and whether you're ready to take on the day,

949
31:42.810 --> 31:44.670
we have something called, an energy score.

950
31:44.670 --> 31:45.780
Just look at that one number

951
31:45.780 --> 31:47.827
on your phones and you can say,

952
31:47.827 --> 31:49.530
"Okay, my score tells me

953
31:49.530 --> 31:51.210
that I didn't sleep well last night,

954
31:51.210 --> 31:52.290
I'm a bit tired.

955
31:52.290 --> 31:53.610
Maybe I even have something coming

956
31:53.610 --> 31:55.290
on like a flu or something.

957
31:55.290 --> 31:56.580
I better take it easy today."

958
31:56.580 --> 31:57.900
Or, "My energy is very high,

959
31:57.900 --> 31:58.950
I'm ready to take on the day.

960
31:58.950 --> 32:00.090
Maybe I can do more things,

961
32:00.090 --> 32:02.040
maybe even work out today, et cetera."

962
32:02.040 --> 32:04.650
So that energy score, that one number

963
32:04.650 --> 32:06.210
can be a very good guide

964
32:06.210 --> 32:07.893
to how to manage your day.

965
32:09.669 --> 32:12.930
<v ->I agree with my co-panelists.</v>

966
32:12.930 --> 32:15.360
Wearables are about personalized medicine,

967
32:15.360 --> 32:17.070
it's personalization.

968
32:17.070 --> 32:18.720
You have an enormous amount of data

969
32:18.720 --> 32:21.570
about yourself, so much of medicine

970
32:21.570 --> 32:22.680
is you take a measurement

971
32:22.680 --> 32:24.660
and you look at this point cloud of data

972
32:24.660 --> 32:27.630
and you fit yourself to some linear model

973
32:27.630 --> 32:29.910
and it's not a good fit for you.

974
32:29.910 --> 32:31.410
With wearable data,

975
32:31.410 --> 32:34.320
it's so personal and it's exactly right,

976
32:34.320 --> 32:36.390
it's like how do we take this mountain of data

977
32:36.390 --> 32:38.460
that's being collected, every heartbeat,

978
32:38.460 --> 32:39.720
all the stress, all the sleep,

979
32:39.720 --> 32:42.420
and how do we provide really personalized

980
32:42.420 --> 32:45.810
input to the user so they can do something

981
32:45.810 --> 32:48.000
to improve their health state.

982
32:48.000 --> 32:50.370
It's a big opportunity.

983
32:50.370 --> 32:52.110
You know, there's a lot of talk about AI,

984
32:52.110 --> 32:55.440
but it's not just a large language model,

985
32:55.440 --> 32:58.470
it's a really difficult problem

986
32:58.470 --> 33:00.060
and we'll be working on it for a long time,

987
33:00.060 --> 33:02.550
but the opportunity is enormous, I think

988
33:02.550 --> 33:04.380
because of just all the data

989
33:04.380 --> 33:06.480
that we can input into these sorts of models

990
33:06.480 --> 33:09.090
and what we can provide to the user.

991
33:09.090 --> 33:10.620
<v ->Yeah, we talked about providing data</v>

992
33:10.620 --> 33:12.900
to the user, but also sorting

993
33:12.900 --> 33:14.970
and managing that data for the provider,

994
33:14.970 --> 33:17.550
for the doctor so that the doctor as we've said

995
33:17.550 --> 33:20.370
before, is not overwhelmed by the data coming in.

996
33:20.370 --> 33:21.333
<v ->You know, Praveen said something</v>

997
33:21.333 --> 33:22.740
that I thought was really good.

998
33:22.740 --> 33:24.000
It's like the first five minutes

999
33:24.000 --> 33:25.650
of the visit is, how well are you sleeping?

1000
33:25.650 --> 33:27.150
How active are you?

1001
33:27.150 --> 33:28.470
That's right there.

1002
33:28.470 --> 33:30.150
That should take 30 seconds.

1003
33:30.150 --> 33:33.270
It's all in your data record from your wearable.

1004
33:33.270 --> 33:35.730
We know how much activity you had.

1005
33:35.730 --> 33:37.050
We know how much running you did,

1006
33:37.050 --> 33:39.090
we know how well you slept,

1007
33:39.090 --> 33:40.650
that could be right there for the doctor.

1008
33:40.650 --> 33:42.300
And that could start that conversation

1009
33:42.300 --> 33:44.760
five minutes farther along, right?

1010
33:44.760 --> 33:46.350
And you could have a way more high value

1011
33:46.350 --> 33:49.200
visit with your clinician that way.

1012
33:49.200 --> 33:52.380
So it's an excellent point.

1013
33:52.380 --> 33:55.170
It's like we have to do more

1014
33:55.170 --> 33:57.240
with all of this data to really

1015
33:57.240 --> 33:59.460
set up an improved experience

1016
33:59.460 --> 34:01.590
up and down the healthcare chain.

1017
34:01.590 --> 34:02.940
<v ->Now, in the amount of time we have left,</v>

1018
34:02.940 --> 34:04.773
which is five minutes,

1019
34:07.860 --> 34:09.420
we talk about the using the data

1020
34:09.420 --> 34:11.343
in the doctor's office visit,

1021
34:13.260 --> 34:14.310
the consumer comes to the doctor's

1022
34:14.310 --> 34:15.600
office, hospital, whatever.

1023
34:15.600 --> 34:17.310
How about in-between?

1024
34:17.310 --> 34:20.310
You know, how do you see wearables

1025
34:20.310 --> 34:21.990
allowing that collaboration

1026
34:21.990 --> 34:23.580
outside of the hospital,

1027
34:23.580 --> 34:25.200
outside of the doctor's office

1028
34:25.200 --> 34:28.170
when the data shows that a consumer

1029
34:28.170 --> 34:30.789
is trending in the wrong direction

1030
34:30.789 --> 34:33.120
with some chronic condition such as,

1031
34:33.120 --> 34:35.160
diabetes or heart failure?

1032
34:35.160 --> 34:37.090
You know, how do you see wearables

1033
34:37.980 --> 34:41.190
affecting that relationship or enabling,

1034
34:41.190 --> 34:43.260
empowering providers

1035
34:43.260 --> 34:45.630
to intervene when it's most needed?

1036
34:45.630 --> 34:48.090
<v ->Right, that what happens with your car, right?</v>

1037
34:48.090 --> 34:50.310
When you get a call from the mechanic

1038
34:50.310 --> 34:51.143
telling you that your car

1039
34:51.143 --> 34:53.760
needs a revision or something, right?

1040
34:53.760 --> 34:55.773
So I mean, look,

1041
34:57.508 --> 35:00.060
as you know, Abbot has been the number one

1042
35:00.060 --> 35:02.370
in diabetes glucose sensors

1043
35:02.370 --> 35:03.930
for the diabetes population.

1044
35:03.930 --> 35:06.150
So we already have that interaction

1045
35:06.150 --> 35:08.010
with the doctor or the doctor has all access

1046
35:08.010 --> 35:09.930
to all the information from the patient

1047
35:09.930 --> 35:11.310
and can reach out to that patient

1048
35:11.310 --> 35:12.450
when they see something abnormal

1049
35:12.450 --> 35:13.628
and so forth.

1050
35:13.628 --> 35:14.490
So this is already existing

1051
35:14.490 --> 35:16.530
for a lot of our sensors.

1052
35:16.530 --> 35:18.900
In the consumer space,

1053
35:18.900 --> 35:21.126
what we're trying to do here is

1054
35:21.126 --> 35:24.930
to help the users take care of their health

1055
35:24.930 --> 35:27.660
outside of the doctor's visit, right?

1056
35:27.660 --> 35:31.500
So trying to reduce cost

1057
35:31.500 --> 35:32.910
to the healthcare system basically

1058
35:32.910 --> 35:33.810
by giving them the tools

1059
35:33.810 --> 35:36.360
to manage their health themselves.

1060
35:36.360 --> 35:38.250
But we do work with, as I mentioned,

1061
35:38.250 --> 35:39.660
nutritionists and doctors

1062
35:39.660 --> 35:42.300
to also feed into the product requirements.

1063
35:42.300 --> 35:44.220
So I think that's one interesting point

1064
35:44.220 --> 35:46.530
is how do you get the product more accepted

1065
35:46.530 --> 35:50.850
by physicians and medical professionals is

1066
35:50.850 --> 35:52.440
by designing the product for both,

1067
35:52.440 --> 35:54.060
for the hand users, the consumers,

1068
35:54.060 --> 35:55.710
and the doctors as well, right?

1069
35:55.710 --> 35:57.300
Because there are two users here

1070
35:57.300 --> 36:00.060
and some of the doctors focus

1071
36:00.060 --> 36:01.800
is more on the data, how do we get the data,

1072
36:01.800 --> 36:03.570
but also how do we simplify

1073
36:03.570 --> 36:04.530
the data for the doctor?

1074
36:04.530 --> 36:07.770
Again, they have very little time to look into it

1075
36:07.770 --> 36:09.720
and how do we make the experience particularly

1076
36:09.720 --> 36:12.450
easy for the end users, but also,

1077
36:12.450 --> 36:14.700
always, sorry, in the objective

1078
36:14.700 --> 36:16.350
of driving behavioral change.

1079
36:16.350 --> 36:19.500
Like the way we talk about it within Lingo

1080
36:19.500 --> 36:20.940
is we are not a data company,

1081
36:20.940 --> 36:22.860
we're not a glucose monitoring company.

1082
36:22.860 --> 36:25.290
We are a behavioral change company

1083
36:25.290 --> 36:26.370
'cause that's what matters at the end.

1084
36:26.370 --> 36:27.900
If you don't change behaviors,

1085
36:27.900 --> 36:29.550
it's a lot of money for not much.

1086
36:30.741 --> 36:31.574
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v Alexi>Go ahead.</v>

1087
36:31.574 --> 36:34.320
<v ->Sorry, I think that one of the things is that,</v>

1088
36:34.320 --> 36:35.670
as I mentioned earlier, I think

1089
36:35.670 --> 36:37.410
we need to save time for doctors obviously,

1090
36:37.410 --> 36:40.440
but we have something that with wearables,

1091
36:40.440 --> 36:42.270
we have something that's a different kind

1092
36:42.270 --> 36:44.070
of data because it's real time

1093
36:44.070 --> 36:45.450
and it's continuous, right?

1094
36:45.450 --> 36:47.400
Compared to all other health data, which is,

1095
36:47.400 --> 36:48.900
I get a blood test every 90 days

1096
36:48.900 --> 36:50.340
or a couple of times a year.

1097
36:50.340 --> 36:52.320
This is continuous, which means

1098
36:52.320 --> 36:54.210
that we can monitor at home

1099
36:54.210 --> 36:56.190
with people are at risk for something.

1100
36:56.190 --> 36:58.230
If I'm monitoring their sleep all the time,

1101
36:58.230 --> 36:59.130
I can see there's

1102
36:59.130 --> 37:00.660
something wrong with their sleep.

1103
37:00.660 --> 37:02.280
So for example, we got FDA approval

1104
37:02.280 --> 37:03.870
and we launched a few months ago,

1105
37:03.870 --> 37:05.647
a way in which our wearables can say,

1106
37:05.647 --> 37:07.590
"You are at risk for sleep apnea,"

1107
37:07.590 --> 37:09.000
which is a condition that affects millions

1108
37:09.000 --> 37:10.080
and millions of people,

1109
37:10.080 --> 37:12.240
but we can identify risk for that.

1110
37:12.240 --> 37:14.610
So you don't have to give every data

1111
37:14.610 --> 37:16.740
to the doctor, but when there's these flags,

1112
37:16.740 --> 37:18.480
you have a risk of sleep apnea

1113
37:18.480 --> 37:19.530
that can go to the doctor.

1114
37:19.530 --> 37:21.030
Now they have something to go by

1115
37:21.030 --> 37:22.200
and they can do something about it.

1116
37:22.200 --> 37:23.820
So we call those triggers.

1117
37:23.820 --> 37:26.070
So within the data that we are seeing

1118
37:26.070 --> 37:28.440
and watching, if there's a trigger, a flag

1119
37:28.440 --> 37:31.800
that something is wrong, that's a higher reason

1120
37:31.800 --> 37:33.090
to send something to the doctor.

1121
37:33.090 --> 37:35.880
Similarly, we have a lot of heart types

1122
37:35.880 --> 37:37.410
of function and monitoring.

1123
37:37.410 --> 37:40.320
So we can do ECGs on our watches.

1124
37:40.320 --> 37:42.510
We can monitor irregular heart rhythms.

1125
37:42.510 --> 37:44.160
So if there's something wrong

1126
37:44.160 --> 37:45.750
where you see a irregular heart rhythm

1127
37:45.750 --> 37:47.700
or you see signs of atrial fibrillation

1128
37:48.864 --> 37:51.150
for which we have FDA approval,

1129
37:51.150 --> 37:52.780
we can flag that to the doctor

1130
37:54.144 --> 37:54.977
or bring that

1131
37:54.977 --> 37:56.370
to the notice of a healthcare provider.

1132
37:56.370 --> 37:59.670
So the idea of us monitoring continuously,

1133
37:59.670 --> 38:01.230
identifying risk factors,

1134
38:01.230 --> 38:02.790
flagging that at the right time

1135
38:02.790 --> 38:03.870
and getting people the help they

1136
38:03.870 --> 38:05.670
need with integration to services such as,

1137
38:05.670 --> 38:07.890
telehealth is the full suite of things

1138
38:07.890 --> 38:10.297
that we're trying to do to address this.

1139
38:11.280 --> 38:13.320
<v ->I think that, you know,</v>

1140
38:13.320 --> 38:15.630
this interpretation is so important both

1141
38:15.630 --> 38:17.400
for the consumer and for healthcare, right?

1142
38:17.400 --> 38:19.140
So how do you simplify?

1143
38:19.140 --> 38:20.970
It's not just about having enough data,

1144
38:20.970 --> 38:22.710
if we don't know how to understand that

1145
38:22.710 --> 38:24.710
and digest it, it's sort of meaningless.

1146
38:25.587 --> 38:26.460
And so I think that's really important.

1147
38:26.460 --> 38:28.500
It's exciting that healthcare is seeing

1148
38:28.500 --> 38:31.140
the value of this continuous monitoring.

1149
38:31.140 --> 38:33.150
And so I think that relationship

1150
38:33.150 --> 38:35.100
is important to continue to have.

1151
38:35.100 --> 38:37.650
And today, we already have instances

1152
38:37.650 --> 38:38.483
where doctors are saying,

1153
38:38.483 --> 38:39.316
"Hey, I really want you

1154
38:39.316 --> 38:40.830
to wear a WHOOP or another wearable

1155
38:40.830 --> 38:41.910
because I wanna understand

1156
38:41.910 --> 38:42.870
and help you monitor

1157
38:42.870 --> 38:44.280
your autoimmune condition, right?"

1158
38:44.280 --> 38:46.560
And so when you have longitudinal data

1159
38:46.560 --> 38:48.060
and you understand your own baseline

1160
38:48.060 --> 38:49.800
and then you see deviations of that,

1161
38:49.800 --> 38:51.480
it allows you to get that prompt medical

1162
38:51.480 --> 38:52.530
attention that you might not have

1163
38:52.530 --> 38:55.020
otherwise gotten if you didn't have a wearable.

1164
38:55.020 --> 38:58.590
We're also seeing people manage conditions like,

1165
38:58.590 --> 38:59.880
you know, improving their mental health,

1166
38:59.880 --> 39:01.680
which is so deeply related to sleep.

1167
39:01.680 --> 39:03.480
And so you can see when you have

1168
39:03.480 --> 39:04.440
somebody wearing a wearable,

1169
39:04.440 --> 39:06.390
if their sleep patterns are getting erratic,

1170
39:06.390 --> 39:07.620
you know, there's real wisdom there.

1171
39:07.620 --> 39:09.420
And so they're able to have richer conversations

1172
39:09.420 --> 39:10.530
with their healthcare providers.

1173
39:10.530 --> 39:11.370
And so I think whilst

1174
39:11.370 --> 39:12.810
it's not always formal relationships,

1175
39:12.810 --> 39:14.310
this pattern's already happening

1176
39:14.310 --> 39:15.393
and will continue.

1177
39:18.300 --> 39:23.300
<v ->I have conversations with doctors</v>

1178
39:23.430 --> 39:25.170
about, you know, you're talking about

1179
39:25.170 --> 39:26.820
in-between being in the clinic

1180
39:26.820 --> 39:30.390
and being at home, one thing that I see is

1181
39:30.390 --> 39:33.990
for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy

1182
39:33.990 --> 39:36.360
or you know, a stem cell transplant

1183
39:36.360 --> 39:37.533
or something like that.

1184
39:38.490 --> 39:39.870
I talk to doctors who recognize

1185
39:39.870 --> 39:41.490
that if they can monitor you

1186
39:41.490 --> 39:43.140
after they discharge you,

1187
39:43.140 --> 39:45.540
they can intervene more quickly, right?

1188
39:45.540 --> 39:48.150
They can see the signs of you're declining

1189
39:48.150 --> 39:50.190
or sepsis, things like that,

1190
39:50.190 --> 39:52.620
and they can get you in back to their office

1191
39:52.620 --> 39:55.020
and they can intervene before you wind up

1192
39:55.020 --> 39:56.460
showing up in the emergency room,

1193
39:56.460 --> 39:58.620
which is extremely expensive for them

1194
39:58.620 --> 40:01.442
because they don't want to see you readmitted.

1195
40:01.442 --> 40:03.450
I've talked to doctors

1196
40:03.450 --> 40:05.610
who want to use it for that purpose, right?

1197
40:05.610 --> 40:06.840
They see the value there.

1198
40:06.840 --> 40:09.870
So it's the remote patient monitoring,

1199
40:09.870 --> 40:11.970
but it's like post discharge to make sure

1200
40:11.970 --> 40:14.400
that someone's had a hip transplant,

1201
40:14.400 --> 40:15.630
it's getting their activity,

1202
40:15.630 --> 40:17.070
they're not declining.

1203
40:17.070 --> 40:18.830
I think that's gonna be a very common use

1204
40:18.830 --> 40:20.340
of wearables in the future.

1205
40:20.340 --> 40:21.303
I see that coming.

1206
40:22.140 --> 40:22.973
<v Eric>Definitely.</v>

1207
40:22.973 --> 40:24.960
Okay, Scott, Alexi, Praveen,

1208
40:24.960 --> 40:26.370
Olivier, thank you very much.

1209
40:26.370 --> 40:27.870
It's been a wonderful conversation.

1210
40:27.870 --> 40:29.520
We certainly could go a lot longer,

1211
40:29.520 --> 40:30.930
but we got the red light going on

1212
40:30.930 --> 40:32.190
and the next group's

1213
40:32.190 --> 40:35.190
gonna want to storm the stage.
(audience applauding)

1214
40:35.190 --> 40:36.323
<v Olivier>Thank you.</v>
<v Alexi>Thank you.</v>

1215
40:37.332 --> 40:40.082
