1
00:00.000 --> 00:02.583
(upbeat music)

2
00:11.280 --> 00:12.270
<v ->Thank you for being here.</v>

3
00:12.270 --> 00:14.910
Final session in this room of this day.

4
00:14.910 --> 00:16.953
So you guys are the survivors.

5
00:17.820 --> 00:19.170
So we're talking about AI

6
00:19.170 --> 00:21.420
in the context of Hollywood.

7
00:21.420 --> 00:22.740
My name is Lesley Silverman.

8
00:22.740 --> 00:24.150
I'm the head of New Technology

9
00:24.150 --> 00:27.090
at United Talent Agency in Los Angeles.

10
00:27.090 --> 00:30.540
We're a leading global talent and entertainment company.

11
00:30.540 --> 00:32.670
And first, before we dive in,

12
00:32.670 --> 00:33.720
I just wanna acknowledge

13
00:33.720 --> 00:36.000
that most of us on this panel

14
00:36.000 --> 00:37.950
live in Los Angeles

15
00:37.950 --> 00:40.770
and our thoughts and our hearts

16
00:40.770 --> 00:43.170
are with our family and friends

17
00:43.170 --> 00:44.970
and those people that we know

18
00:44.970 --> 00:46.380
who've actually lost their homes.

19
00:46.380 --> 00:50.430
And luckily we're all safe for now,

20
00:50.430 --> 00:52.530
but I just wanna acknowledge

21
00:52.530 --> 00:53.820
that there's a lot going on.

22
00:53.820 --> 00:56.040
So if any of us seem a little distracted,

23
00:56.040 --> 00:57.840
I think that's why.

24
00:57.840 --> 00:59.400
But we're here to talk about AI

25
00:59.400 --> 01:00.870
in the context of Hollywood,

26
01:00.870 --> 01:03.480
and I'm very excited to be joined

27
01:03.480 --> 01:05.130
by experts on this topic

28
01:05.130 --> 01:07.200
and to learn from each of you this afternoon.

29
01:07.200 --> 01:08.820
So I'm really looking forward to that.

30
01:08.820 --> 01:10.380
So let's dive in.

31
01:10.380 --> 01:13.020
First, I just wanna do some brief intros.

32
01:13.020 --> 01:14.400
So I'll start with you, Duncan,

33
01:14.400 --> 01:15.840
maybe you could introduce yourself

34
01:15.840 --> 01:18.360
and tell us how many times

35
01:18.360 --> 01:20.697
you've come to CES in the past.

36
01:20.697 --> 01:22.350
<v ->(laughing) Thanks, Lesley.</v>

37
01:22.350 --> 01:23.700
My name's Duncan Crabtree-Ireland.

38
01:23.700 --> 01:25.020
I'm the national executive director

39
01:25.020 --> 01:26.520
and chief negotiator of SAG-AFTRA,

40
01:26.520 --> 01:29.460
which is the union that represents professional performers,

41
01:29.460 --> 01:31.400
broadcast journalists, recording artists.

42
01:31.400 --> 01:34.350
We say basically anybody who works in front of a camera

43
01:34.350 --> 01:35.730
or behind a microphone,

44
01:35.730 --> 01:36.720
that's who we represent.

45
01:36.720 --> 01:39.390
We have about 160,000 members in the US

46
01:39.390 --> 01:40.470
and actually around the world.

47
01:40.470 --> 01:45.210
And this, I believe, is my 21st CES, (laughing)

48
01:45.210 --> 01:46.340
so.
<v ->Anyone in this room</v>

49
01:46.340 --> 01:48.780
been here more than 21 times?

50
01:48.780 --> 01:50.700
Okay, nobody, all right, you win, Duncan.

51
01:50.700 --> 01:52.980
All right, Momo, you're next.

52
01:52.980 --> 01:54.330
<v ->Hi, this is Momo Wang.</v>

53
01:54.330 --> 01:55.620
I'm an animation director.

54
01:55.620 --> 01:58.830
I used to work as at Illumination Entertainment,

55
01:58.830 --> 02:01.590
directing the short film and the animation content

56
02:01.590 --> 02:03.540
for "Minions," "Despicable Me."

57
02:03.540 --> 02:05.215
And my film, "Penglai",

58
02:05.215 --> 02:07.590
was shortlist for Oscar 2023,

59
02:07.590 --> 02:09.180
Best Anime Short.

60
02:09.180 --> 02:10.980
Also, in the past two years on,

61
02:10.980 --> 02:12.900
I was engaged with AI filmmaking,

62
02:12.900 --> 02:15.000
and my AI film, "Until We Meet Again,"

63
02:15.000 --> 02:18.360
was selected by China National Film Museum.

64
02:18.360 --> 02:19.860
<v ->Incredible, thank you.</v>

65
02:19.860 --> 02:20.850
Nik.

66
02:20.850 --> 02:22.230
<v ->Hey, I'm Nik Kleverov,</v>

67
02:22.230 --> 02:24.330
chief creative officer of Native Foreign,

68
02:24.330 --> 02:27.210
a creative agency that's doing a lot with AI.

69
02:27.210 --> 02:29.100
We had the fortune of actually working

70
02:29.100 --> 02:31.440
on the Delta keynote here at CES

71
02:31.440 --> 02:32.820
a couple days ago.

72
02:32.820 --> 02:35.700
And we're very excited about what AI tools

73
02:35.700 --> 02:38.820
mean for boutique startup agencies like ours

74
02:38.820 --> 02:42.300
to create on a top level.

75
02:42.300 --> 02:43.320
<v ->Fantastic.</v>

76
02:43.320 --> 02:44.280
Walter.

77
02:44.280 --> 02:46.560
<v ->My name's Walter Woodman.</v>

78
02:46.560 --> 02:49.020
I work with a production company

79
02:49.020 --> 02:52.053
and creative collective called Shy Kids.

80
02:52.980 --> 02:55.710
And we are probably best known this year

81
02:55.710 --> 02:58.800
for making a film called "Air Head,"

82
02:58.800 --> 03:01.800
which was the first kind of short film

83
03:01.800 --> 03:06.480
made with OpenAI's Sora video model.

84
03:06.480 --> 03:07.920
<v ->Fantastic.</v>

85
03:07.920 --> 03:10.290
One other fun fact before we dive in

86
03:10.290 --> 03:12.930
is that two of our panelists

87
03:12.930 --> 03:14.790
have produced video content

88
03:14.790 --> 03:16.920
for the Sphere here in Las Vegas.

89
03:16.920 --> 03:18.750
That would be Momo and Nik.

90
03:18.750 --> 03:20.340
So both of them have been in there

91
03:20.340 --> 03:23.370
and have worked on projects in the Sphere.

92
03:23.370 --> 03:24.203
Pretty cool.

93
03:24.203 --> 03:28.560
Okay, so before we jump into conversation,

94
03:28.560 --> 03:30.870
we're actually, because it's a Hollywood panel,

95
03:30.870 --> 03:32.250
we're gonna show a few videos.

96
03:32.250 --> 03:33.663
So let's do that first.

97
03:35.699 --> 03:38.366
(dynamic music)

98
04:13.530 --> 04:14.700
Fantastic.

99
04:14.700 --> 04:17.250
Round of applause for that.
(audience clapping)

100
04:17.250 --> 04:19.700
Okay, we're gonna roll right into the next video.

101
04:20.797 --> 04:21.900
(bell ringing)

102
04:21.900 --> 04:24.120
<v Teacher>Florp, can you come to the front of the class</v>

103
04:24.120 --> 04:24.990
and tell us what you learned

104
04:24.990 --> 04:26.523
on your solar vacation?

105
04:27.810 --> 04:28.730
<v Florp>My name is Florp</v>

106
04:28.730 --> 04:32.220
and this is the solar vacation video I made

107
04:32.220 --> 04:35.760
for my trip to Planet 3582,

108
04:35.760 --> 04:40.353
colloquially, colloquially known as Earth.

109
04:42.150 --> 04:46.470
Earth is home to over three trillion living entities.

110
04:46.470 --> 04:47.910
Some of my favorites

111
04:47.910 --> 04:52.623
are the praying mantis, jellyfish and axolotls.

112
04:54.540 --> 04:56.610
Of all the creatures on this planet,

113
04:56.610 --> 04:59.763
the most peculiar is one called the human.

114
05:01.740 --> 05:04.380
On my trip, my parents informed me

115
05:04.380 --> 05:07.470
that they had visited these creatures before.

116
05:07.470 --> 05:09.930
Mom and Dad visited Area 51

117
05:09.930 --> 05:10.763
on their honeymoon.

118
05:10.763 --> 05:11.910
(projector clacking)

119
05:11.910 --> 05:15.060
Mom warned me never to get close to the humans

120
05:15.060 --> 05:17.010
because they're dangerous

121
05:17.010 --> 05:19.200
and because they are scared.

122
05:19.200 --> 05:21.960
But I was fascinated with their world,

123
05:21.960 --> 05:24.210
I wanted to experience it.

124
05:24.210 --> 05:25.680
The carnivals,

125
05:25.680 --> 05:29.250
eating uncooked water species on grain,

126
05:29.250 --> 05:33.696
art, discoteques, Black Friday.

127
05:33.696 --> 05:35.130
<v ->Ah.</v>
<v ->I saw they made</v>

128
05:35.130 --> 05:36.840
a lot of mistakes,

129
05:36.840 --> 05:38.910
or what they called, "Oopsies,"

130
05:38.910 --> 05:41.040
like when they burned down that big library

131
05:41.040 --> 05:44.040
that had all the knowledge that we gave them,

132
05:44.040 --> 05:45.780
or when that Austrian duke

133
05:45.780 --> 05:49.230
went on vacation to Bosnia.
(gun firing)

134
05:49.230 --> 05:51.663
I wondered if they were always like this,

135
05:52.590 --> 05:54.150
always so scared of things

136
05:54.150 --> 05:57.600
that they couldn't understand.

137
05:57.600 --> 05:58.560
What I learned from them

138
05:58.560 --> 06:00.723
is that even though they do oopsies,

139
06:01.710 --> 06:03.900
like lots of oopsies,

140
06:03.900 --> 06:06.060
they keep trying,

141
06:06.060 --> 06:07.893
and sometimes they get it right.

142
06:09.270 --> 06:11.910
That's how they made contact with us.

143
06:11.910 --> 06:15.960
Even if they were the 3582nd planet to do so,

144
06:15.960 --> 06:17.163
it's still pretty cool.

145
06:18.090 --> 06:21.180
This was my time with the humans on Earth.

146
06:21.180 --> 06:22.013
Thank you.

147
06:23.571 --> 06:26.171
(upbeat music)

148
06:26.171 --> 06:29.640
(audience clapping)

149
06:29.640 --> 06:31.840
<v Lesley>All right, third and final video.</v>

150
06:33.930 --> 06:34.763
Uncooked water species

151
06:34.763 --> 06:37.050
is great.
<v ->This is Native Foreign.</v>

152
06:37.050 --> 06:39.570
We are a women-owned hybrid creative agency

153
06:39.570 --> 06:41.550
and production company,

154
06:41.550 --> 06:43.530
telling your story

155
06:43.530 --> 06:45.180
elevated by design.

156
06:45.180 --> 06:47.640
We have many any-grade stock creatives

157
06:47.640 --> 06:50.670
and are immersed in all the latest technology,

158
06:50.670 --> 06:52.710
including, yes, AI.

159
06:52.710 --> 06:54.720
We were birthed from a changing industry

160
06:54.720 --> 06:57.840
and accept that change is the only constant.

161
06:57.840 --> 06:59.356
<v ->Toys R Us has just.</v>

162
06:59.356 --> 07:01.027
<v ->A minute-long promo film</v>

163
07:01.027 --> 07:03.157
created almost entirely with AI.

164
07:03.157 --> 07:05.610
<v Reporter>Toys R Us studios and Native Foreign</v>

165
07:05.610 --> 07:08.231
created the first text-to-video branded AI film.

166
07:08.231 --> 07:10.357
1.4 billion impressions and counting,

167
07:10.357 --> 07:12.947
our viral piece reached the entire globe

168
07:12.947 --> 07:16.440
and started conversations about the future of marketing.

169
07:16.440 --> 07:17.730
<v Representative>Native foreign exists</v>

170
07:17.730 --> 07:19.620
to get you high-end creative

171
07:19.620 --> 07:21.300
anchored in strategy.

172
07:21.300 --> 07:24.240
Located centrally in Los Angeles, California,

173
07:24.240 --> 07:26.850
we have a variety of storytelling tools and techniques

174
07:26.850 --> 07:27.787
at our fingertips.

175
07:27.787 --> 07:29.310
(upbeat music)

176
07:29.310 --> 07:32.493
Native foreign is your story elevated.

177
07:34.500 --> 07:36.885
<v ->Awesome, okay, thanks, thanks for that.</v>

178
07:36.885 --> 07:38.250
(audience clapping)

179
07:38.250 --> 07:40.080
Really amazing.

180
07:40.080 --> 07:42.630
So Momo, Walter and Nik,

181
07:42.630 --> 07:45.660
all videos that you shared.

182
07:45.660 --> 07:47.770
So I'd love to hear from each of you

183
07:49.410 --> 07:53.580
what contributions to these videos were human

184
07:53.580 --> 07:55.383
and what was AI?

185
07:57.060 --> 07:58.860
Momo, I'll start with you.

186
07:58.860 --> 08:00.240
<v ->Yeah, I think my video</v>

187
08:00.240 --> 08:02.040
missed the beginning part. (laughing)

188
08:02.040 --> 08:06.060
So there was a opening shot, stop motion style,

189
08:06.060 --> 08:09.330
actually that was shot in stop motion.

190
08:09.330 --> 08:14.330
And actually the the key frame was made 15 years ago.

191
08:14.670 --> 08:18.180
I built a puppet 15 years ago.

192
08:18.180 --> 08:22.020
But thanks to all the reduced workflow with AI,

193
08:22.020 --> 08:24.060
now I can easily animate it.

194
08:24.060 --> 08:27.630
And also the piece close to the end,

195
08:27.630 --> 08:30.480
the "Until We Meet Again" animation,

196
08:30.480 --> 08:32.550
that's a collaboration with Kling,

197
08:32.550 --> 08:33.720
and also, the same time,

198
08:33.720 --> 08:36.660
does a combination with the AI generate visual

199
08:36.660 --> 08:38.400
and special effects.

200
08:38.400 --> 08:40.290
<v ->Amazing.</v>
<v ->And also,</v>

201
08:40.290 --> 08:41.640
in the end, the last frame,

202
08:41.640 --> 08:44.310
that's the sugar cookie,

203
08:44.310 --> 08:45.960
the funny dog on the sugar cookie,

204
08:45.960 --> 08:47.010
that was a hand drawing,

205
08:47.010 --> 08:49.650
but all the rest, that's Midjourney.

206
08:49.650 --> 08:50.520
<v ->Really incredible.</v>

207
08:50.520 --> 08:52.890
And obviously, your taste and your direction?

208
08:52.890 --> 08:55.500
<v ->Yeah, so my idea, all the idea, creative idea.</v>

209
08:55.500 --> 08:57.060
<v ->Fantastic.</v>

210
08:57.060 --> 08:58.920
Nik, do you wanna maybe talk about,

211
08:58.920 --> 09:00.060
I don't know, any of the pieces

212
09:00.060 --> 09:01.830
in that reel, yeah?
<v ->Sure, yeah,</v>

213
09:01.830 --> 09:03.090
I'll just say, to Momo's point,

214
09:03.090 --> 09:04.530
like one of the interesting things

215
09:04.530 --> 09:06.600
is that what the AI tools do,

216
09:06.600 --> 09:07.800
let us creatives do,

217
09:07.800 --> 09:11.070
is explore ideas that have been locked in a vault

218
09:11.070 --> 09:13.350
or just not able to be made,

219
09:13.350 --> 09:15.720
especially with shoestring budgets.

220
09:15.720 --> 09:17.220
And I think that's pretty exciting

221
09:17.220 --> 09:19.230
'cause I've also just delved into ideas

222
09:19.230 --> 09:20.340
I've had for a long time,

223
09:20.340 --> 09:22.020
and starting to bring them to life

224
09:22.020 --> 09:23.490
is really exciting.

225
09:23.490 --> 09:24.870
One of the pieces in there

226
09:24.870 --> 09:26.970
is a film called "Critters" that we made.

227
09:26.970 --> 09:29.720
And it was really early AI, GenAI,

228
09:29.720 --> 09:31.560
it was like almost two years ago,

229
09:31.560 --> 09:33.300
but we used Dolly

230
09:33.300 --> 09:34.860
to generate these images

231
09:34.860 --> 09:35.970
of these like forest critters,

232
09:35.970 --> 09:36.990
and then we brought 'em to life.

233
09:36.990 --> 09:40.920
And I think the fun thing about that is,

234
09:40.920 --> 09:44.880
it was a lot of humans making the thing

235
09:44.880 --> 09:47.400
and using the tools to bring a vision to life,

236
09:47.400 --> 09:50.400
and again, kind of to what I said earlier,

237
09:50.400 --> 09:52.830
that just got nominated for a PGA Innovation Award,

238
09:52.830 --> 09:55.410
which like for upstart like ours,

239
09:55.410 --> 09:57.480
we're up against Marvel and ILM

240
09:57.480 --> 09:59.610
with a piece that we made with like a dozen people.

241
09:59.610 --> 10:01.140
So it's really cool

242
10:01.140 --> 10:03.360
to be able to kind of create on that level.

243
10:03.360 --> 10:05.160
And I see the future

244
10:05.160 --> 10:09.150
as like a very hybrid approach of using the tools

245
10:09.150 --> 10:12.150
and our human creativity together.

246
10:12.150 --> 10:12.983
<v ->Awesome.</v>

247
10:12.983 --> 10:13.890
Walter, how about you?

248
10:13.890 --> 10:15.480
What about "Florp?"

249
10:15.480 --> 10:17.424
<v ->Well, I'm the voice of Florp.</v>

250
10:17.424 --> 10:18.750
(Lesley laughing)

251
10:18.750 --> 10:21.480
So I just basically talked like this,

252
10:21.480 --> 10:23.913
and then we pitched my voice up a little bit.

253
10:24.750 --> 10:29.520
But the script was obviously handwritten by us,

254
10:29.520 --> 10:30.630
and the voice,

255
10:30.630 --> 10:32.400
and then the music

256
10:32.400 --> 10:34.323
is also a song that we made.

257
10:36.240 --> 10:38.100
I think a great thing about AI

258
10:38.100 --> 10:40.710
is it breathes life into old things,

259
10:40.710 --> 10:44.190
and it was this demo of a song that lays around

260
10:44.190 --> 10:45.480
and you kind of lay it in there

261
10:45.480 --> 10:49.440
and it's the perfect marriage between these things.

262
10:49.440 --> 10:53.160
So yeah, there's tons of human fingerprints throughout it,

263
10:53.160 --> 10:55.140
as well as just editing it all together,

264
10:55.140 --> 10:56.640
but yeah.

265
10:56.640 --> 10:59.220
<v ->I love that, and it's so good to be able to show</v>

266
10:59.220 --> 11:02.160
rather than talk about what might happen with these tools.

267
11:02.160 --> 11:07.160
So thank you for sharing those pieces with all of us.

268
11:07.380 --> 11:09.480
Okay, so our topic is the good,

269
11:09.480 --> 11:11.520
the bad, the unknown.

270
11:11.520 --> 11:15.720
So let's start with maybe the bad and the unknown, okay?

271
11:15.720 --> 11:17.250
I'd say there's a lot of fear

272
11:17.250 --> 11:19.650
and uncertainty out there.

273
11:19.650 --> 11:22.260
Whether it's displacement of jobs

274
11:22.260 --> 11:23.460
or IP rights

275
11:23.460 --> 11:25.890
and potential infringements,

276
11:25.890 --> 11:27.720
there's a lot that we don't know

277
11:27.720 --> 11:29.970
about this new suite of tools

278
11:29.970 --> 11:31.620
or seemingly new suite of tools.

279
11:31.620 --> 11:35.250
So as a professional working in this field,

280
11:35.250 --> 11:36.900
what are your perspectives?

281
11:36.900 --> 11:38.643
So I'll start with you, Duncan.

282
11:39.600 --> 11:41.610
<v ->Sure, I mean, I think the good, bad and unknown</v>

283
11:41.610 --> 11:42.900
is a great way to describe

284
11:42.900 --> 11:45.450
sort of how (laughing) we have to look at

285
11:45.450 --> 11:46.950
a lot of AI tools now.

286
11:46.950 --> 11:49.140
And we also have to recognize when we say AI,

287
11:49.140 --> 11:50.610
we're talking very, very broadly,

288
11:50.610 --> 11:54.000
because there's a lot of different aspects of AI

289
11:54.000 --> 11:56.370
and tools that are using AI

290
11:56.370 --> 11:57.960
that have different implications

291
11:57.960 --> 11:59.490
for creative talent.

292
11:59.490 --> 12:02.490
Obviously our members have been very concerned

293
12:02.490 --> 12:04.800
about what the impact of these tools

294
12:04.800 --> 12:07.860
is going to be on human creativity,

295
12:07.860 --> 12:08.970
the participation of humans

296
12:08.970 --> 12:12.060
in the creative process and the outputs,

297
12:12.060 --> 12:14.550
and uniquely, I think, or perhaps not uniquely,

298
12:14.550 --> 12:16.590
but especially for our members,

299
12:16.590 --> 12:19.740
what that means when people are using their image,

300
12:19.740 --> 12:21.900
their voice, their performance,

301
12:21.900 --> 12:24.420
and then using tools to morph it,

302
12:24.420 --> 12:27.030
change it, recreate it, reuse it,

303
12:27.030 --> 12:30.420
and under what circumstances that can happen.

304
12:30.420 --> 12:33.150
And so I think we've sort of looked at this

305
12:33.150 --> 12:35.310
as two major areas of concern.

306
12:35.310 --> 12:37.020
One is the area of concern

307
12:37.020 --> 12:39.090
relating to what we call digital replication.

308
12:39.090 --> 12:40.860
So that is using someone's image,

309
12:40.860 --> 12:43.050
voice, likeness, past performance,

310
12:43.050 --> 12:43.980
for something new,

311
12:43.980 --> 12:47.790
and establishing some rules of the road for that,

312
12:47.790 --> 12:49.320
so that it's not the Wild West,

313
12:49.320 --> 12:51.030
so that people can have confidence

314
12:51.030 --> 12:53.940
that when they show up to work as a performer,

315
12:53.940 --> 12:56.760
that they're not essentially in one job

316
12:56.760 --> 12:58.740
giving away the future of their career,

317
12:58.740 --> 13:00.330
nor are they letting someone

318
13:00.330 --> 13:02.160
decide what words to put in their mouth.

319
13:02.160 --> 13:05.460
I mean, obviously this industry's built on contracts

320
13:05.460 --> 13:06.540
and things like that,

321
13:06.540 --> 13:09.663
but there's always been in the real world,

322
13:10.590 --> 13:12.450
everyone had a veto power

323
13:12.450 --> 13:14.430
over what they would say or what they would do,

324
13:14.430 --> 13:17.400
because they obviously would have to actually say it

325
13:17.400 --> 13:19.530
or do it in order for it to happen.

326
13:19.530 --> 13:21.660
That's not necessarily true anymore.

327
13:21.660 --> 13:23.700
And so that creates a great deal of anxiety.

328
13:23.700 --> 13:26.310
And so I think it's important that we've established,

329
13:26.310 --> 13:28.230
and we have established in collective bargaining

330
13:28.230 --> 13:29.430
with the studios, the streamers,

331
13:29.430 --> 13:30.510
the major record labels,

332
13:30.510 --> 13:31.500
we're trying to establish

333
13:31.500 --> 13:32.973
with the video game companies right now,

334
13:32.973 --> 13:34.650
been on strike for more than six months,

335
13:34.650 --> 13:36.540
or about six months with them,

336
13:36.540 --> 13:38.610
the concept basically of informed consent,

337
13:38.610 --> 13:42.300
saying when someone's voice, image, likeness, performance,

338
13:42.300 --> 13:43.890
is gonna be altered,

339
13:43.890 --> 13:46.470
used in a way that they didn't specifically approve of,

340
13:46.470 --> 13:49.260
they have a right to say yes or no to that,

341
13:49.260 --> 13:51.240
and they also have a right to be fairly compensated

342
13:51.240 --> 13:52.073
for that use.

343
13:52.073 --> 13:54.960
Now, I think that is a consensus

344
13:54.960 --> 13:56.310
that has developed a lot

345
13:56.310 --> 13:58.620
since our strike of a year and a half ago.

346
13:58.620 --> 13:59.790
And I think that clearly

347
13:59.790 --> 14:02.970
is where we're all gonna end up sooner or later,

348
14:02.970 --> 14:04.290
once we get the video game companies

349
14:04.290 --> 14:07.530
and some other stragglers corralled.

350
14:07.530 --> 14:09.570
The other part is what happens with generative AI

351
14:09.570 --> 14:11.910
and the creation of fully synthetic performances

352
14:11.910 --> 14:13.890
that aren't replicating somebody?

353
14:13.890 --> 14:15.710
Does that take humans out of the process?

354
14:15.710 --> 14:17.460
And I mean, it's so great to see

355
14:17.460 --> 14:19.230
the three examples that we have here,

356
14:19.230 --> 14:22.890
because in none of those examples does that happen,

357
14:22.890 --> 14:24.330
but it is something that is happening.

358
14:24.330 --> 14:25.560
And if you doubt me,

359
14:25.560 --> 14:27.480
I mean, it's happening more in voice right now

360
14:27.480 --> 14:29.160
than it is in audiovisual,

361
14:29.160 --> 14:29.993
but if you doubt me,

362
14:29.993 --> 14:32.730
just go to ElevenLabs website as one example.

363
14:32.730 --> 14:34.320
Not only them, there's so many.

364
14:34.320 --> 14:36.120
But there are people out there

365
14:36.120 --> 14:39.720
who really want to replace human participation

366
14:39.720 --> 14:40.830
in the creative process

367
14:40.830 --> 14:44.370
with synthetic AI-generated outputs.

368
14:44.370 --> 14:46.650
And there are very serious issues with this

369
14:46.650 --> 14:48.660
about where the training data came from

370
14:48.660 --> 14:50.730
to create those models,

371
14:50.730 --> 14:52.500
what kind of impact

372
14:52.500 --> 14:53.940
that's gonna have on the creative process.

373
14:53.940 --> 14:55.470
Thankfully, there's very serious

374
14:55.470 --> 14:56.730
copyright problems with that.

375
14:56.730 --> 14:58.980
So that's helpful actually

376
14:58.980 --> 15:01.470
to kind of keep this moving along in a fair way.

377
15:01.470 --> 15:04.320
But I'll end this rather lengthy point

378
15:04.320 --> 15:07.680
by just saying the reality is,

379
15:07.680 --> 15:08.820
the digital replication part,

380
15:08.820 --> 15:10.980
that is happening now,

381
15:10.980 --> 15:12.210
has happened already

382
15:12.210 --> 15:14.310
and is growing rapidly.

383
15:14.310 --> 15:16.050
The synthetic performance part,

384
15:16.050 --> 15:18.240
other than in voice,

385
15:18.240 --> 15:19.890
it's moving more slowly,

386
15:19.890 --> 15:22.140
and I think it's gonna give us a little bit of time,

387
15:22.140 --> 15:23.940
so this is maybe the unknown part,

388
15:23.940 --> 15:24.900
a little bit of time

389
15:24.900 --> 15:28.470
to try to come up with a more substantial consensus

390
15:28.470 --> 15:29.303
in the industry

391
15:29.303 --> 15:32.340
about how to deal with issues like that.

392
15:32.340 --> 15:33.420
<v ->Yeah, fantastic.</v>

393
15:33.420 --> 15:36.540
And I think, the fact, one of the things that struck me

394
15:36.540 --> 15:40.110
when we spoke prior to this panel is,

395
15:40.110 --> 15:43.890
the way that you're able to see around corners

396
15:43.890 --> 15:45.960
to anticipate, for example,

397
15:45.960 --> 15:47.820
that digital replica is coming

398
15:47.820 --> 15:48.870
and it's gonna be an issue

399
15:48.870 --> 15:51.030
and we're gonna need to have a position on it,

400
15:51.030 --> 15:54.210
is because you come to conferences like this one

401
15:54.210 --> 15:55.680
and you hear people talk

402
15:55.680 --> 15:57.300
and you kind of anticipate that.

403
15:57.300 --> 15:59.460
So I loved hearing that.

404
15:59.460 --> 16:00.293
For the three of you,

405
16:00.293 --> 16:03.630
maybe just like a slight shift on that question then,

406
16:03.630 --> 16:07.710
if we're scared, if we think these tools

407
16:07.710 --> 16:10.590
are gonna replace our jobs, for example,

408
16:10.590 --> 16:11.910
what are some things,

409
16:11.910 --> 16:12.870
because the three of you

410
16:12.870 --> 16:14.610
sort of have like picked up these tools

411
16:14.610 --> 16:16.590
and really started experimenting with them

412
16:16.590 --> 16:18.390
until they break.

413
16:18.390 --> 16:19.860
So can you talk a little bit about

414
16:19.860 --> 16:22.980
how we should be, if we're afraid,

415
16:22.980 --> 16:26.910
how we should maybe shift our perspective,

416
16:26.910 --> 16:29.610
or what you guys did to tackle that?

417
16:29.610 --> 16:31.560
Momo, maybe I'll start with you.

418
16:31.560 --> 16:34.650
<v ->Yeah, I don't think we need to scale off AI</v>

419
16:34.650 --> 16:36.660
because in the past two years

420
16:36.660 --> 16:38.850
it's been like so many filmmakers,

421
16:38.850 --> 16:43.560
like somehow that's like a frustrating situation

422
16:43.560 --> 16:45.840
that so many top filmmakers,

423
16:45.840 --> 16:48.450
they graduate from the top school, like USCFI,

424
16:48.450 --> 16:50.613
and then now they are working on,

425
16:50.613 --> 16:52.200
like the whole casting,

426
16:52.200 --> 16:54.000
whole like film setup team,

427
16:54.000 --> 16:58.200
they are working on shooting the short-form content,

428
16:58.200 --> 17:00.600
which is for like something like a reel short or something,

429
17:00.600 --> 17:04.260
and like they show like 80-pages script in a week

430
17:04.260 --> 17:06.840
and also with all logical stories.

431
17:06.840 --> 17:09.420
So yeah, that's their only job

432
17:09.420 --> 17:11.070
we can find in the past two years.

433
17:11.070 --> 17:12.750
I mean, before the rise of AI,

434
17:12.750 --> 17:15.150
it's already the shifting

435
17:15.150 --> 17:17.940
of a viewing and watching hobby of a new generation,

436
17:17.940 --> 17:19.170
and the audience,

437
17:19.170 --> 17:21.600
they already changed the whole industry.

438
17:21.600 --> 17:22.800
I feel like, yeah, I mean,

439
17:22.800 --> 17:25.710
AI actually that's a really good tool

440
17:25.710 --> 17:29.310
for like help the filmmakers have another voice,

441
17:29.310 --> 17:31.080
especially the personal voice,

442
17:31.080 --> 17:32.970
to still use their talent.

443
17:32.970 --> 17:35.504
I feel that's one point of view.

444
17:35.504 --> 17:36.972
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->And yeah.</v>

445
17:36.972 --> 17:37.830
<v ->Great.</v>

446
17:37.830 --> 17:39.330
<v ->Yeah, I would say, for us,</v>

447
17:39.330 --> 17:41.700
the AI hasn't really changed

448
17:41.700 --> 17:43.890
the way that we do projects.

449
17:43.890 --> 17:46.050
We still have projects kind of set up

450
17:46.050 --> 17:48.240
with the same types of structure.

451
17:48.240 --> 17:50.160
I look at a lot of the AI things we do

452
17:50.160 --> 17:51.480
as like a main title sequence,

453
17:51.480 --> 17:53.730
and that is something, in my past,

454
17:53.730 --> 17:56.259
I did a lot of titles for shows.

455
17:56.259 --> 17:58.110
The most notable one is "Narcos."

456
17:58.110 --> 18:00.240
And in that process, we have a creative director,

457
18:00.240 --> 18:03.090
art director, designers, animators, editors,

458
18:03.090 --> 18:05.160
and like we still have all those people

459
18:05.160 --> 18:06.960
doing all those things.

460
18:06.960 --> 18:09.960
So, for us, it's really just a tool we're using

461
18:09.960 --> 18:12.210
to kind of actually do more projects,

462
18:12.210 --> 18:13.230
which is exciting.

463
18:13.230 --> 18:14.760
We've (laughing) actually been creating more jobs

464
18:14.760 --> 18:16.560
because we're hiring more people

465
18:16.560 --> 18:17.970
and doing more things.

466
18:17.970 --> 18:19.230
And I'm a big believer

467
18:19.230 --> 18:21.360
in shooting things in person still.

468
18:21.360 --> 18:23.850
I love filming, I love working with actors.

469
18:23.850 --> 18:25.770
And I do think a hybrid way

470
18:25.770 --> 18:29.400
where we get to still showcase the talents of actors,

471
18:29.400 --> 18:32.070
but then maybe get to tell bigger stories

472
18:32.070 --> 18:33.330
in more efficient ways.

473
18:33.330 --> 18:36.450
We're not doing like these crazy insane VFX sequences,

474
18:36.450 --> 18:38.070
maybe we can use AI

475
18:38.070 --> 18:39.570
to kind of achieve some of that.

476
18:39.570 --> 18:41.490
It echoes what Cord Jefferson said

477
18:41.490 --> 18:42.937
at the Oscars the other year,

478
18:42.937 --> 18:45.660
"Instead of like the one $200 million movie,

479
18:45.660 --> 18:48.990
let's look at making 40 $5 million movies," or whatever.

480
18:48.990 --> 18:50.670
So I'm excited about it.

481
18:50.670 --> 18:54.450
And yes, I think, as technology grows and changes,

482
18:54.450 --> 18:57.480
of course there are going to be positions and jobs

483
18:57.480 --> 18:58.920
that are going to be displaced.

484
18:58.920 --> 19:01.500
Like do we have matte painters anymore in film?

485
19:01.500 --> 19:04.740
Probably not, but there's always gonna be a degree of that.

486
19:04.740 --> 19:07.020
But I think staying ahead of it is exciting

487
19:07.020 --> 19:09.420
and making sure that everyone can prosper

488
19:09.420 --> 19:13.770
while the technology inevitably keeps moving forward.

489
19:13.770 --> 19:15.030
<v ->Walter, I'm gonna see if I can,</v>

490
19:15.030 --> 19:16.290
through mental telepathy,

491
19:16.290 --> 19:17.460
get you to tell me the thing

492
19:17.460 --> 19:18.960
that you told me on the prep call

493
19:18.960 --> 19:21.420
about the experience of working

494
19:21.420 --> 19:24.450
both with AI and actors,

495
19:24.450 --> 19:27.633
and how that has changed your process as a director.

496
19:28.770 --> 19:30.630
<v ->Yeah, well, I mean,</v>

497
19:30.630 --> 19:35.130
it's so good to have real actors and real performances.

498
19:35.130 --> 19:37.380
And there's like a real magic to that.

499
19:37.380 --> 19:41.190
And I think that constantly on a film set

500
19:41.190 --> 19:43.680
what you're trying to do is fight the clock.

501
19:43.680 --> 19:44.880
You're burning daylight,

502
19:44.880 --> 19:45.990
you're fighting daylight.

503
19:45.990 --> 19:48.540
And for us, what we found

504
19:48.540 --> 19:49.860
when we were working with AI

505
19:49.860 --> 19:53.130
was it actually opened up more collaborations

506
19:53.130 --> 19:57.030
where the actors and everybody on the creative team

507
19:57.030 --> 19:59.790
was like more open to sharing ideas,

508
19:59.790 --> 20:02.760
because normally, as the director,

509
20:02.760 --> 20:04.800
you just tell everyone what to do.

510
20:04.800 --> 20:08.850
And now people can try stuff,

511
20:08.850 --> 20:10.410
they can attempt something

512
20:10.410 --> 20:11.460
and they can show everyone

513
20:11.460 --> 20:13.410
and they could go, "Well, what about this?"

514
20:13.410 --> 20:15.067
And instead of that being like,

515
20:15.067 --> 20:17.070
"Oh, no, we'll never have enough time

516
20:17.070 --> 20:18.510
and space to do that,"

517
20:18.510 --> 20:21.270
I think sometimes this opens up some time and space

518
20:21.270 --> 20:22.140
to do things.

519
20:22.140 --> 20:24.360
And that's what, for me,

520
20:24.360 --> 20:25.800
is really exciting,

521
20:25.800 --> 20:29.970
And it's allowed for, on our team,

522
20:29.970 --> 20:31.920
our producer is an actor,

523
20:31.920 --> 20:36.570
and so she feels far more invested in the process

524
20:36.570 --> 20:37.950
than normally she would be,

525
20:37.950 --> 20:39.900
'cause it was sort of like, "Stay in your lane,"

526
20:39.900 --> 20:41.737
and now it's a little bit more like,

527
20:41.737 --> 20:42.690
"Oh, what do you think?

528
20:42.690 --> 20:44.790
Let's all kind of talk about it."

529
20:44.790 --> 20:45.870
<v ->Those are great messages.</v>

530
20:45.870 --> 20:47.164
Yeah, Momo.
<v ->I share</v>

531
20:47.164 --> 20:49.320
(laughing) a quick plug in that.

532
20:49.320 --> 20:51.330
For creator side, I would like to share

533
20:51.330 --> 20:54.003
that something feeling really like downside for it.

534
20:54.900 --> 20:57.060
I mean, I feel so many people,

535
20:57.060 --> 20:58.800
they are like mistaken

536
20:58.800 --> 21:02.040
believing that AI is a shortcut to creativity,

537
21:02.040 --> 21:04.650
and then became that's so many people,

538
21:04.650 --> 21:05.760
they are thinking, "Oh,

539
21:05.760 --> 21:10.620
so when they can quickly mastering AI tools

540
21:10.620 --> 21:11.790
in the short period,

541
21:11.790 --> 21:14.670
and then immediately they can create excellent work."

542
21:14.670 --> 21:17.010
But actually for all the great work

543
21:17.010 --> 21:20.400
is driven by creative original idea content

544
21:20.400 --> 21:23.100
and also professional expertise.

545
21:23.100 --> 21:25.290
Those are request much longer term

546
21:25.290 --> 21:27.120
to train and study.

547
21:27.120 --> 21:31.500
And there was so many filmmakers, like creators,

548
21:31.500 --> 21:35.280
especially like right now, after the rise of AI,

549
21:35.280 --> 21:36.900
it's creating a illusion,

550
21:36.900 --> 21:40.260
make people believing they can do this shortcut,

551
21:40.260 --> 21:45.260
but actually that's not really gonna help the creators.

552
21:45.330 --> 21:48.840
<v ->Yeah, it's like, everyone has a phone in their pocket</v>

553
21:48.840 --> 21:49.770
that has a camera,

554
21:49.770 --> 21:52.080
it doesn't make everyone a photographer.

555
21:52.080 --> 21:56.940
And I think that if it looks easy,

556
21:56.940 --> 21:58.890
then it's probably the years

557
21:58.890 --> 22:01.050
that it took to get there,

558
22:01.050 --> 22:03.000
not just the press of a button.

559
22:03.000 --> 22:05.640
And when you were talking about, "What's the negative?"

560
22:05.640 --> 22:07.560
I think, as you were kind of mentioning, Duncan,

561
22:07.560 --> 22:09.840
that AI is this blanket term,

562
22:09.840 --> 22:12.153
I mean, go downstairs at CES.

563
22:12.153 --> 22:14.130
(Lesley laughing)

564
22:14.130 --> 22:15.720
If spellcheck came out today,

565
22:15.720 --> 22:18.180
they would say, "AI spelling tool,"

566
22:18.180 --> 22:22.260
And I think that AI can be this kind of coverall term

567
22:22.260 --> 22:23.700
that can mean so many things,

568
22:23.700 --> 22:27.090
but I think that they're actually just tools

569
22:27.090 --> 22:30.090
that really require someone in the driver's seat

570
22:30.090 --> 22:32.970
who is conscientiously making decisions

571
22:32.970 --> 22:34.020
in order for them to work.

572
22:34.020 --> 22:36.390
It's not just, "Here you go."

573
22:36.390 --> 22:38.220
And for me, that's been a negative

574
22:38.220 --> 22:39.787
of people just being like,

575
22:39.787 --> 22:42.330
"Well, just use your AI and fix it."

576
22:42.330 --> 22:43.931
It's like, (laughing)

577
22:43.931 --> 22:44.940
"What do you mean?"
<v ->Oh my gosh.</v>

578
22:44.940 --> 22:47.760
From a like client education perspective,

579
22:47.760 --> 22:49.680
'cause obviously we're doing originals,

580
22:49.680 --> 22:51.480
but also a lot of client stuff,

581
22:51.480 --> 22:53.797
I do constantly deal with like,

582
22:53.797 --> 22:56.250
"Oh, well, can't the AI just make this like tomorrow?

583
22:56.250 --> 22:57.083
I saw on LinkedIn

584
22:57.083 --> 22:58.950
that someone made like a short film in an hour

585
22:58.950 --> 22:59.970
and it's a masterpiece,"

586
22:59.970 --> 23:02.432
but there's always more to it than that.

587
23:02.432 --> 23:03.397
<v ->That's right.</v>

588
23:03.397 --> 23:04.589
Suddenly everyone's an expert.

589
23:04.589 --> 23:06.810
<v ->Well, and I think that's part of the point</v>

590
23:06.810 --> 23:07.850
that needs to be made,

591
23:07.850 --> 23:12.850
and I mean, really, the problem is not creative talent

592
23:12.870 --> 23:16.050
in the form of directors, producers, writers,

593
23:16.050 --> 23:18.540
who are using AI tools

594
23:18.540 --> 23:21.450
to help advance their creative efforts

595
23:21.450 --> 23:22.283
and their storytelling.

596
23:22.283 --> 23:24.300
The problem is companies

597
23:24.300 --> 23:27.870
that are so focused on cost-cutting

598
23:27.870 --> 23:30.510
that they want to try and force the use of these tools

599
23:30.510 --> 23:32.310
in ways that don't actually advance

600
23:32.310 --> 23:33.810
the creative process.

601
23:33.810 --> 23:37.680
And the case that we at SAG-AFTRA are making to them is,

602
23:37.680 --> 23:40.410
if you're in the entertainment business,

603
23:40.410 --> 23:41.520
what makes you unique,

604
23:41.520 --> 23:42.600
what makes you special

605
23:42.600 --> 23:43.830
and what makes your company

606
23:43.830 --> 23:45.420
and what you create valuable

607
23:45.420 --> 23:47.610
is the human creativity

608
23:47.610 --> 23:49.860
that contributes to that result,

609
23:49.860 --> 23:51.720
to that incredible piece of art.

610
23:51.720 --> 23:53.280
And if you eliminate that

611
23:53.280 --> 23:56.820
and what you do is focus entirely on using these AI tools

612
23:56.820 --> 24:01.230
to streamline processes and to cost-cut,

613
24:01.230 --> 24:02.100
then what you're doing

614
24:02.100 --> 24:05.610
is giving up the special advantage that you have.

615
24:05.610 --> 24:09.060
And now, if that's what you train the consumer to want,

616
24:09.060 --> 24:10.590
every AI company out there

617
24:10.590 --> 24:12.450
can do the exact same thing that you can do,

618
24:12.450 --> 24:14.400
and they can probably do it cheaper,

619
24:14.400 --> 24:16.230
and your competitive advantage

620
24:16.230 --> 24:18.720
and what makes your business successful is gone.

621
24:18.720 --> 24:21.630
So you have to cultivate and value

622
24:21.630 --> 24:23.910
the human creativity and those relationships,

623
24:23.910 --> 24:26.520
which are what make your companies unique and special.

624
24:26.520 --> 24:27.870
And I think that message

625
24:27.870 --> 24:30.347
is starting to resonate a bit.

626
24:30.347 --> 24:31.890
<v ->That's a perfect segue,</v>

627
24:31.890 --> 24:34.020
because I wanted to ask you guys,

628
24:34.020 --> 24:39.020
what legacy media companies have done interesting work,

629
24:39.720 --> 24:41.310
have used these tools effectively?

630
24:41.310 --> 24:46.310
Or alternatively, whose knee-jerk reaction

631
24:46.530 --> 24:51.243
kind of in retrospect doesn't look so innovative?

632
24:52.440 --> 24:53.283
Walter, yeah.

633
24:54.540 --> 24:56.280
<v ->Well, they can reach out to me.</v>

634
24:56.280 --> 24:58.050
The Disneys and all of them,

635
24:58.050 --> 25:00.060
we're open for business.
(Lesley laughing)

636
25:00.060 --> 25:03.870
But I think that there's still like an apprehension,

637
25:03.870 --> 25:05.610
and I think like rightfully so

638
25:05.610 --> 25:06.990
that there's an apprehension,

639
25:06.990 --> 25:10.080
'cause it's kind of like a black box

640
25:10.080 --> 25:13.413
where no one really knows exactly what it means.

641
25:14.640 --> 25:16.950
What I will say that was like a fascinating thing

642
25:16.950 --> 25:19.590
after "Air Head" was released was on Twitter,

643
25:19.590 --> 25:21.420
as you can imagine, the vitriol,

644
25:21.420 --> 25:22.620
we had all these people,

645
25:22.620 --> 25:25.080
like I think I counted 40 people

646
25:25.080 --> 25:26.310
told me to kill myself,

647
25:26.310 --> 25:28.083
which is like pretty crazy.

648
25:29.010 --> 25:32.250
But a lot of it was coming from the VFX community,

649
25:32.250 --> 25:34.710
which is like our community,

650
25:34.710 --> 25:36.900
which is the place where we were raised.

651
25:36.900 --> 25:41.610
And it just strikes me as,

652
25:41.610 --> 25:43.890
I was watching this ILM documentary

653
25:43.890 --> 25:45.720
about the making of ILM,

654
25:45.720 --> 25:48.960
and it was the exact same conversation

655
25:48.960 --> 25:53.010
when they moved from puppets and small VFX

656
25:53.010 --> 25:54.840
into digital VFX,

657
25:54.840 --> 25:57.690
and now we've created this whole new industry.

658
25:57.690 --> 26:00.480
It's the same thing as if I told you 20 years ago

659
26:00.480 --> 26:02.850
that the number-one job that kids would want

660
26:02.850 --> 26:04.740
is to be a influencer,

661
26:04.740 --> 26:07.050
you would be like, "What are you talking about?"

662
26:07.050 --> 26:09.480
And I think that there's just this general thing

663
26:09.480 --> 26:12.210
that it either has to be this or that.

664
26:12.210 --> 26:15.270
And I think that there's actually something new

665
26:15.270 --> 26:16.103
that it could be.

666
26:16.103 --> 26:18.000
It doesn't need to be this or that,

667
26:18.000 --> 26:19.560
it could be a little bit of this.

668
26:19.560 --> 26:22.050
And I think that we also have a bunch to learn

669
26:22.050 --> 26:23.070
from those companies,

670
26:23.070 --> 26:25.050
as much as they have to learn from us.

671
26:25.050 --> 26:27.060
<v ->So maybe some of the examples, good or bad,</v>

672
26:27.060 --> 26:28.110
we don't even know

673
26:28.110 --> 26:30.933
that they're leveraging this technology, right.

674
26:31.980 --> 26:34.065
Any other takes on this one?

675
26:34.065 --> 26:36.477
Good ahead, yeah.
<v ->Well,</v>

676
26:36.477 --> 26:38.683
I'll shock you and give you a good example,

677
26:38.683 --> 26:40.633
(laughing) as opposed to a bad example,

678
26:42.420 --> 26:44.910
which actually goes back to Disney and to Lucasfilm,

679
26:44.910 --> 26:47.340
and like "The Book of Boba Fett,"

680
26:47.340 --> 26:48.510
some of the projects they've done

681
26:48.510 --> 26:50.910
where they've used Respeecher

682
26:50.910 --> 26:55.770
to replicate voices of original characters.

683
26:55.770 --> 26:58.320
But they are doing that with consent,

684
26:58.320 --> 26:59.940
with compensation,

685
26:59.940 --> 27:03.630
and in fact, are actually using actors

686
27:03.630 --> 27:04.860
who do the voice work now

687
27:04.860 --> 27:07.350
whose voices are then modified

688
27:07.350 --> 27:09.000
using their AI tools

689
27:09.000 --> 27:11.460
to resemble or to replicate the voices

690
27:11.460 --> 27:13.170
of the original actors,

691
27:13.170 --> 27:15.150
such as James Earl Jones, for example,

692
27:15.150 --> 27:16.200
but others as well.

693
27:16.200 --> 27:17.280
And they're also doing that

694
27:17.280 --> 27:19.740
with on-camera performance as well.

695
27:19.740 --> 27:21.660
And I think, from our point of view,

696
27:21.660 --> 27:24.420
we're not here saying that AI should be banned.

697
27:24.420 --> 27:25.530
Some of our members feel that way,

698
27:25.530 --> 27:27.420
that's not the position that we're taking.

699
27:27.420 --> 27:28.253
What we're saying is

700
27:28.253 --> 27:30.210
that if you're gonna use these kinds of tools,

701
27:30.210 --> 27:32.790
it has to be done in a respectful, ethical way.

702
27:32.790 --> 27:34.530
And if you've got consent,

703
27:34.530 --> 27:36.360
you're fairly compensating people,

704
27:36.360 --> 27:37.800
that's the pathway

705
27:37.800 --> 27:41.250
to an appropriate, human-centered,

706
27:41.250 --> 27:43.350
like augmentative use of AI,

707
27:43.350 --> 27:45.390
and something that I think the creative community

708
27:45.390 --> 27:46.920
can appreciate and get behind,

709
27:46.920 --> 27:49.600
and also helps you create something really special

710
27:50.468 --> 27:51.510
in the content that you're creating.

711
27:51.510 --> 27:54.780
So I think that's one good example.

712
27:54.780 --> 27:57.060
<v ->I'm not shocked that it was a good example,</v>

713
27:57.060 --> 27:58.440
but thank you, that was a great one.

714
27:58.440 --> 27:59.610
Momo.

715
27:59.610 --> 28:01.170
<v ->Yeah, so last year,</v>

716
28:01.170 --> 28:02.370
one of my favorite film,

717
28:02.370 --> 28:05.100
that "Furiosa," and Warner Brother.

718
28:05.100 --> 28:06.870
So the child actress,

719
28:06.870 --> 28:10.230
the face look exactly like Anya Taylor.

720
28:10.230 --> 28:11.880
I mean, because they were using AI

721
28:11.880 --> 28:13.740
to mix the face together.

722
28:13.740 --> 28:15.750
And yeah, it's a good example,

723
28:15.750 --> 28:17.640
but on the same time,

724
28:17.640 --> 28:18.630
last year, in China,

725
28:18.630 --> 28:20.700
there was a film called "The Traveler,"

726
28:20.700 --> 28:23.250
which is top director and casting,

727
28:23.250 --> 28:26.940
and that's a feature live-action film,

728
28:26.940 --> 28:31.890
and including a 20-minute flashback process with AI.

729
28:31.890 --> 28:33.540
So it was double the fusion.

730
28:33.540 --> 28:36.150
But it is because the final resort,

731
28:36.150 --> 28:37.710
the quality wasn't very good.

732
28:37.710 --> 28:41.280
So negative comments kind of killed the box office.

733
28:41.280 --> 28:45.273
So there's a feeling that if,

734
28:46.230 --> 28:48.330
I think the application of AI,

735
28:48.330 --> 28:50.430
ideal application of AI using,

736
28:50.430 --> 28:55.430
it's a high level, high degree of realism and completeness.

737
28:58.980 --> 29:02.760
So they will be more acceptable for audience,

738
29:02.760 --> 29:05.190
and then it's gonna make more sense

739
29:05.190 --> 29:10.190
and help people to wildly adopt AI technology in industry.

740
29:11.100 --> 29:12.990
<v ->Excellent, okay, I'm gonna move us on.</v>

741
29:12.990 --> 29:15.930
What is a way that AI

742
29:15.930 --> 29:19.380
could be used in the context of Hollywood,

743
29:19.380 --> 29:21.210
you decide where,

744
29:21.210 --> 29:22.560
that we're not thinking about,

745
29:22.560 --> 29:23.670
that we haven't thought about

746
29:23.670 --> 29:26.184
and that we should be thinking about?

747
29:26.184 --> 29:27.134
Who wants to start?

748
29:28.710 --> 29:32.730
<v ->Yeah, I think, for me,</v>

749
29:32.730 --> 29:34.140
what is really interesting

750
29:34.140 --> 29:36.570
is I think there's a lot of films

751
29:36.570 --> 29:39.810
that we go and see in the theater

752
29:39.810 --> 29:41.700
'cause they're a spectacle,

753
29:41.700 --> 29:45.300
and I think that there is a sort of limited amount of people

754
29:45.300 --> 29:49.080
who have the access to make those spectacle films.

755
29:49.080 --> 29:51.570
And what I'm really excited about seeing

756
29:51.570 --> 29:54.960
is like new film communities pop up.

757
29:54.960 --> 29:58.530
Like I don't know if anyone watches Nollywood films,

758
29:58.530 --> 30:02.250
it's like Nigerian action movies

759
30:02.250 --> 30:03.810
that are--
<v ->Any hands, any hands?</v>

760
30:03.810 --> 30:05.430
No.
<v ->Any Nollywood fans?</v>

761
30:05.430 --> 30:09.120
Anyways, there are these like amazing films made in Nigeria

762
30:09.120 --> 30:14.070
that are like super-crazy, low-budget like wild films.

763
30:14.070 --> 30:15.300
And like my question is,

764
30:15.300 --> 30:19.020
when they have access to making their effects

765
30:19.020 --> 30:19.860
look a lot better

766
30:19.860 --> 30:21.090
and making things look better,

767
30:21.090 --> 30:23.910
where do those communities kind of pop up?

768
30:23.910 --> 30:25.110
So I think what you're gonna see

769
30:25.110 --> 30:29.430
is a lot of new hotbeds for cinema

770
30:29.430 --> 30:32.130
that have not had the ability

771
30:32.130 --> 30:34.380
to like play with the big boys, so to speak,

772
30:34.380 --> 30:36.510
that I think would be really interesting.

773
30:36.510 --> 30:39.240
Where's that next place gonna be?

774
30:39.240 --> 30:41.520
<v ->It's gonna come from the bottom up, I think.</v>

775
30:41.520 --> 30:43.530
And I think what's exciting is,

776
30:43.530 --> 30:46.470
we're gonna get to see all of these new stories

777
30:46.470 --> 30:49.650
from all edges of the world be told,

778
30:49.650 --> 30:52.380
and we're gonna find some incredible films

779
30:52.380 --> 30:54.690
being made by people we've never heard of.

780
30:54.690 --> 30:56.310
I think it's gonna be an interesting mix

781
30:56.310 --> 30:59.160
of the people in top Hollywood,

782
30:59.160 --> 31:01.440
but also just complete upstarts,

783
31:01.440 --> 31:03.390
and to Walter's point,

784
31:03.390 --> 31:07.080
being able to actually get to a result quicker.

785
31:07.080 --> 31:10.320
And then once those effects, let's say,

786
31:10.320 --> 31:13.230
and that level of, let's say, quality is ubiquitous,

787
31:13.230 --> 31:15.090
then what sets your film apart?

788
31:15.090 --> 31:16.050
And then I think we do

789
31:16.050 --> 31:19.260
have just this really strong emphasis on story

790
31:19.260 --> 31:22.110
and what your unique point of view is

791
31:22.110 --> 31:23.760
and what story you wanna tell

792
31:23.760 --> 31:26.250
about life and anything.

793
31:26.250 --> 31:27.750
<v ->Right.</v>

794
31:27.750 --> 31:29.190
<v ->Well, and now I'll add something different,</v>

795
31:29.190 --> 31:31.530
which is not exactly creative,

796
31:31.530 --> 31:33.360
but I think is true.

797
31:33.360 --> 31:35.700
AI can also be used in a totally different way

798
31:35.700 --> 31:39.120
to help enforce rights obligations,

799
31:39.120 --> 31:42.660
to better track and reduce the friction

800
31:42.660 --> 31:44.910
of the transactional part of the industry.

801
31:44.910 --> 31:47.220
And to the extent that it's used for that,

802
31:47.220 --> 31:48.150
I think that will be great,

803
31:48.150 --> 31:50.400
because I think it'll be great for creative talent

804
31:50.400 --> 31:53.160
to receive their appropriate contractual payments

805
31:53.160 --> 31:55.200
in a more timely and consistent manner.

806
31:55.200 --> 31:57.660
And I think it would be great to know

807
31:57.660 --> 32:02.660
that there's a way to make that process happen

808
32:04.794 --> 32:07.050
with less sort of weight on it,

809
32:07.050 --> 32:08.700
so that it's not taking up

810
32:08.700 --> 32:12.660
so much of the resources of the industry to do it,

811
32:12.660 --> 32:13.493
to carry it out.

812
32:13.493 --> 32:15.390
And so then perhaps more of those resources

813
32:15.390 --> 32:17.280
can be devoted to the creative process.

814
32:17.280 --> 32:19.650
So I'd love to see AI used in that direction.

815
32:19.650 --> 32:21.210
<v ->Working at a talent agency,</v>

816
32:21.210 --> 32:22.380
plus one to that,

817
32:22.380 --> 32:24.240
like couldn't agree with you more.

818
32:24.240 --> 32:25.560
We want our clients to be paid

819
32:25.560 --> 32:28.350
and we want them to be paid quickly.

820
32:28.350 --> 32:30.000
Okay, I'm gonna move us on.

821
32:30.000 --> 32:31.380
Duncan, I'm coming over to you.

822
32:31.380 --> 32:33.930
So you mentioned Respeecher,

823
32:33.930 --> 32:37.380
what AI companies does SAG-AFTRA

824
32:37.380 --> 32:41.250
think are going about this kind of season of AI

825
32:41.250 --> 32:42.083
the right way?

826
32:42.083 --> 32:43.590
And are there companies

827
32:43.590 --> 32:44.910
who you wish would reach out,

828
32:44.910 --> 32:47.220
maybe a postcard from the stage

829
32:47.220 --> 32:48.641
to those companies? (laughing)

830
32:48.641 --> 32:50.460
<v ->(laughing) Well, first of all,</v>

831
32:50.460 --> 32:52.980
let me just say, we don't endorse any companies,

832
32:52.980 --> 32:55.710
because obviously companies, like people, are complicated.

833
32:55.710 --> 32:57.480
Having said that, there are a few

834
32:57.480 --> 32:59.010
that I can mention specifically

835
32:59.010 --> 33:01.740
that we think have adopted a good approach here.

836
33:01.740 --> 33:03.300
One that we've been talking about for a long time

837
33:03.300 --> 33:04.440
is Flawless AI,

838
33:04.440 --> 33:09.330
which is focused on using GenAI technology to modify,

839
33:09.330 --> 33:10.163
among other things,

840
33:10.163 --> 33:12.900
facial movements of performers,

841
33:12.900 --> 33:14.610
for a variety of purposes,

842
33:14.610 --> 33:16.170
but one of those purposes, for example,

843
33:16.170 --> 33:18.180
is to improve dubbing.

844
33:18.180 --> 33:19.890
So that instead of the dubbing script

845
33:19.890 --> 33:21.990
having to be changed to match the mouth movements

846
33:21.990 --> 33:23.280
in the original language,

847
33:23.280 --> 33:25.650
you can actually directly translate the script

848
33:25.650 --> 33:26.910
and adjust the mouth movements

849
33:26.910 --> 33:29.220
to match the human dubbing performance

850
33:29.220 --> 33:30.270
that goes with that.

851
33:30.270 --> 33:32.160
And I think that's a great example

852
33:32.160 --> 33:35.670
of improving the result of dubbing

853
33:35.670 --> 33:38.970
without taking away the human creative element.

854
33:38.970 --> 33:41.310
Another great example is a company called Ethovox

855
33:41.310 --> 33:43.650
we've just signed an agreement with recently,

856
33:43.650 --> 33:45.180
which is looking to create

857
33:45.180 --> 33:48.900
a fully ethically sourced foundational model

858
33:48.900 --> 33:51.720
for digital voice replicas for use,

859
33:51.720 --> 33:53.340
among other things, in video games.

860
33:53.340 --> 33:56.790
And so one of the real challenges we all face

861
33:56.790 --> 33:58.440
with AI foundational models

862
33:58.440 --> 34:00.840
is there are almost none of them

863
34:00.840 --> 34:03.060
that have actually been sourced

864
34:03.060 --> 34:06.360
with fully consented content.

865
34:06.360 --> 34:07.410
And this is a huge battle,

866
34:07.410 --> 34:09.390
there's all kinds of litigation going on.

867
34:09.390 --> 34:11.310
I certainly hope and SAG-AFTRA hopes

868
34:11.310 --> 34:12.480
that the result of that

869
34:12.480 --> 34:14.730
is a clear decision by the courts

870
34:14.730 --> 34:17.220
that that is wrong to just take people's content

871
34:17.220 --> 34:19.020
and use it to train foundational models

872
34:19.020 --> 34:20.970
without consent or compensation.

873
34:20.970 --> 34:22.500
But regardless of the outcomes of that,

874
34:22.500 --> 34:23.407
this company has said,

875
34:23.407 --> 34:25.920
"We're building a model from the ground up

876
34:25.920 --> 34:27.630
where all of the data,

877
34:27.630 --> 34:30.240
all the training data is fully consented,

878
34:30.240 --> 34:32.940
ethically sourced, and we can prove it."

879
34:32.940 --> 34:34.590
And so I think that's really great.

880
34:34.590 --> 34:36.120
So unlike most of our contracts,

881
34:36.120 --> 34:36.953
this is not a company

882
34:36.953 --> 34:39.930
that's looking to create the end product, the output.

883
34:39.930 --> 34:42.120
This is a company that's looking to create

884
34:42.120 --> 34:44.550
the foundational model to then be made available

885
34:44.550 --> 34:46.680
to video game companies and others

886
34:46.680 --> 34:48.990
for digital voice replication.

887
34:48.990 --> 34:50.700
Those are just a couple of the examples.

888
34:50.700 --> 34:52.830
There are many others, Replica Studios,

889
34:52.830 --> 34:54.540
Replika Media is another example

890
34:54.540 --> 34:56.970
of a company that's doing something like that.

891
34:56.970 --> 34:59.940
And we even have an advertising-related platform

892
34:59.940 --> 35:01.890
called Narrative that we've done an agreement with,

893
35:01.890 --> 35:05.520
that has agreed to apply these full protections

894
35:05.520 --> 35:09.390
and let performers sort of dip their toe in,

895
35:09.390 --> 35:10.740
letting their digital replicas

896
35:10.740 --> 35:13.740
perform audio commercials for digital use,

897
35:13.740 --> 35:15.630
but also, if they decide that's not for them,

898
35:15.630 --> 35:17.280
to then stop that

899
35:17.280 --> 35:20.370
and not have their face voice, et cetera,

900
35:20.370 --> 35:23.130
used in perpetuity in these digital models

901
35:23.130 --> 35:23.963
that have been created.

902
35:23.963 --> 35:25.740
So I think there's a lot of companies

903
35:25.740 --> 35:27.150
and people who wanna do the right thing,

904
35:27.150 --> 35:28.800
and we certainly wanna lift them up.

905
35:28.800 --> 35:32.040
And I think there's a lot that have some way to go.

906
35:32.040 --> 35:33.810
And I guess if I had to call out any one group,

907
35:33.810 --> 35:36.300
I would say the major video game companies

908
35:36.300 --> 35:38.880
that we're still locked in this strike against.

909
35:38.880 --> 35:40.740
I mean, this strike is all about AI

910
35:40.740 --> 35:43.065
and it's about informed consent and fair compensation,

911
35:43.065 --> 35:45.480
and I feel like that's a concept

912
35:45.480 --> 35:47.130
that we should all already be on board with.

913
35:47.130 --> 35:48.990
This shouldn't have to be so difficult.

914
35:48.990 --> 35:50.340
And I really wish those companies

915
35:50.340 --> 35:53.557
would come back to the table with a mindset of,

916
35:53.557 --> 35:55.620
"Yes, let's give all performers

917
35:55.620 --> 35:56.880
who work in video games

918
35:56.880 --> 35:59.220
appropriate consent rights and fair compensation

919
35:59.220 --> 36:01.410
when we're creating replicas of their performance."

920
36:01.410 --> 36:03.390
<v ->Yeah, thank you for that.</v>

921
36:03.390 --> 36:05.400
I'm just gonna stay with you for one more moment,

922
36:05.400 --> 36:08.190
because I asked you to invite companies

923
36:08.190 --> 36:09.303
to come to the table.

924
36:10.530 --> 36:13.350
I had this experience working on a deal actually

925
36:13.350 --> 36:15.630
where we insisted, "Don't come to us,

926
36:15.630 --> 36:18.390
go to SAG-AFTRA first, have a discussion,

927
36:18.390 --> 36:20.100
this is about performers,

928
36:20.100 --> 36:21.840
have a discussion and come back to us."

929
36:21.840 --> 36:25.080
And I just wanna say, I think that process,

930
36:25.080 --> 36:26.940
if a company's feeling shy

931
36:26.940 --> 36:29.370
about wanting to work in this area

932
36:29.370 --> 36:30.630
and not knowing what to do,

933
36:30.630 --> 36:32.430
that you can be a great ally,

934
36:32.430 --> 36:35.850
and also not halt the process.

935
36:35.850 --> 36:38.100
It was like a week-and-a-half-long process,

936
36:38.100 --> 36:39.210
it was really incredible.

937
36:39.210 --> 36:41.490
You can say more about it if you'd like to.

938
36:41.490 --> 36:42.540
<v ->Yeah, I mean, first of all,</v>

939
36:42.540 --> 36:43.770
I really appreciate you saying that,

940
36:43.770 --> 36:46.620
because I know that when you're like in a company

941
36:46.620 --> 36:49.620
and you don't deal with this sort of thing all the time,

942
36:49.620 --> 36:51.870
and you've seen the strikes

943
36:51.870 --> 36:55.620
got a lot of press attention in 2023 and all of that,

944
36:55.620 --> 36:57.420
I know that can seem scary.

945
36:57.420 --> 37:00.990
But in actuality, I gave you some examples,

946
37:00.990 --> 37:02.310
we've got a long list of companies

947
37:02.310 --> 37:04.110
we've been able to work out deals with,

948
37:04.110 --> 37:06.090
it doesn't necessarily take a long time.

949
37:06.090 --> 37:07.110
The example you're talking about

950
37:07.110 --> 37:09.000
is a very big company

951
37:09.000 --> 37:11.760
that really needed a very specific use case,

952
37:11.760 --> 37:13.620
and we were able in a matter of a couple of weeks

953
37:13.620 --> 37:16.110
to work out an agreement with that company

954
37:16.110 --> 37:17.880
that let them do what they wanted to do,

955
37:17.880 --> 37:20.910
but also ensured that those performers

956
37:20.910 --> 37:22.470
had their basic rights

957
37:22.470 --> 37:24.990
of informed consent and fair compensation upheld.

958
37:24.990 --> 37:29.220
So I absolutely encourage and welcome companies

959
37:29.220 --> 37:30.053
to reach out to us.

960
37:30.053 --> 37:31.623
We reach out to companies as well.

961
37:32.580 --> 37:33.510
It doesn't have to be

962
37:33.510 --> 37:35.490
and isn't an adversarial process,

963
37:35.490 --> 37:37.620
it's a process of trying to work together

964
37:37.620 --> 37:39.540
to just make sure those basic respects

965
37:39.540 --> 37:40.500
and ethics are upheld.

966
37:40.500 --> 37:42.360
And with that framework,

967
37:42.360 --> 37:43.620
there's a lot we can do together.

968
37:43.620 --> 37:44.730
<v ->Amazing, okay.</v>

969
37:44.730 --> 37:46.980
In our last few minutes here,

970
37:46.980 --> 37:50.310
what are we talking about on this stage next year?

971
37:50.310 --> 37:53.040
If you could kind of look in your crystal ball.

972
37:53.040 --> 37:54.930
And I'll start down at the end with Walter,

973
37:54.930 --> 37:57.180
and then make our way back.

974
37:57.180 --> 37:58.013
<v ->Oh man.</v>

975
37:59.940 --> 38:01.537
I was at the massage chair booth.

976
38:01.537 --> 38:02.400
(Duncan laughing)
So some sort of

977
38:02.400 --> 38:04.890
massage chair future.

978
38:04.890 --> 38:09.890
No, I think what will be really interesting is,

979
38:10.050 --> 38:13.560
when we start to see the small companies come up

980
38:13.560 --> 38:16.020
and we start to see those companies get legitimized

981
38:16.020 --> 38:18.690
with the awards and Oscars

982
38:18.690 --> 38:19.523
and those types of things--

983
38:19.523 --> 38:22.020
<v ->One of those companies being Shy Kids?</v>

984
38:22.020 --> 38:24.360
<v ->Of course, we're gonna find our funder tonight,</v>

985
38:24.360 --> 38:29.100
and we're gonna be talking about this very moment,

986
38:29.100 --> 38:30.330
they're gonna play this clip,

987
38:30.330 --> 38:32.610
and it's gonna be very cool.

988
38:32.610 --> 38:34.180
But I think another thing

989
38:35.034 --> 38:36.330
that I've been thinking a lot about

990
38:36.330 --> 38:39.420
is like the indivisualization of stories

991
38:39.420 --> 38:40.590
I think will be really cool,

992
38:40.590 --> 38:43.800
of what happens when you can add your kid

993
38:43.800 --> 38:46.170
into an episode of "Bluey" or something like that?

994
38:46.170 --> 38:48.000
I think that there's a,

995
38:48.000 --> 38:49.907
I don't know, I see that being something.

996
38:49.907 --> 38:51.120
<v ->I love that prediction.</v>

997
38:51.120 --> 38:52.110
Nik.

998
38:52.110 --> 38:54.120
<v ->Yeah, obviously the big takeaway</v>

999
38:54.120 --> 38:55.890
is that there's no magic button,

1000
38:55.890 --> 38:57.090
you need creatives,

1001
38:57.090 --> 39:00.720
and great storytelling will ultimately win.

1002
39:00.720 --> 39:02.970
I'm actually as curious as you are

1003
39:02.970 --> 39:05.343
to see what happens by next year.

1004
39:06.510 --> 39:09.900
<v ->Yeah, I feel no matter is the film or other industry,</v>

1005
39:09.900 --> 39:12.180
the keyword's still the talent,

1006
39:12.180 --> 39:15.240
I'm looking forward to see more like filmmakers,

1007
39:15.240 --> 39:16.740
they can learn this new tool

1008
39:16.740 --> 39:18.630
and create more amazing films,

1009
39:18.630 --> 39:20.310
including the feature films,

1010
39:20.310 --> 39:21.960
this year, also the coming years.

1011
39:23.460 --> 39:25.260
<v ->And I guess I'll make two predictions.</v>

1012
39:25.260 --> 39:27.630
One is I think we'll see more technology

1013
39:27.630 --> 39:29.850
that integrates the process

1014
39:29.850 --> 39:33.090
of securing consent from performers

1015
39:33.090 --> 39:37.110
and maybe even from other people into a workflow

1016
39:37.110 --> 39:39.360
for people who are doing production,

1017
39:39.360 --> 39:43.410
so that it is less of like an exceptional thing

1018
39:43.410 --> 39:45.300
that seems so complicated

1019
39:45.300 --> 39:47.490
and more of a, "Here's this, click the button."

1020
39:47.490 --> 39:49.080
We've already seen this starting to happen

1021
39:49.080 --> 39:50.640
with the company Flawless I mentioned,

1022
39:50.640 --> 39:53.790
and integrations into Avid and Pro Tools

1023
39:53.790 --> 39:55.290
and things like that.

1024
39:55.290 --> 39:56.670
The other prediction I'll make is,

1025
39:56.670 --> 39:58.360
we're gonna see more technology

1026
40:00.450 --> 40:03.720
that's gonna integrate the GenAI synthetic creation

1027
40:03.720 --> 40:05.820
of video and audio together,

1028
40:05.820 --> 40:08.160
because we've been seeing that as sort of split out,

1029
40:08.160 --> 40:09.540
not as much together.

1030
40:09.540 --> 40:12.510
And that's gonna be positioned for consumer use.

1031
40:12.510 --> 40:15.150
But what's going to actually answer that question

1032
40:15.150 --> 40:15.990
is what Walter said,

1033
40:15.990 --> 40:18.030
which is the fact that you have a camera in your pocket

1034
40:18.030 --> 40:19.650
doesn't make you a photographer,

1035
40:19.650 --> 40:24.000
and the fact that there will be broader public access

1036
40:24.000 --> 40:27.810
to those tools won't mean that anyone in the general public

1037
40:27.810 --> 40:29.850
is going to be able to really create

1038
40:29.850 --> 40:31.860
compelling content from that.

1039
40:31.860 --> 40:33.450
I think that that will have its moment,

1040
40:33.450 --> 40:38.173
and then that moment will rapidly fail

1041
40:40.140 --> 40:43.170
to find a foothold with a broader audience.

1042
40:43.170 --> 40:45.120
<v ->Well, great predictions from all of you.</v>

1043
40:45.120 --> 40:47.647
Let's give a huge round of applause to

1044
40:47.647 --> 40:49.500
our speakers this afternoon.
(audience clapping)

1045
40:49.500 --> 40:50.790
Thank you.

1046
40:50.790 --> 40:52.920
And thank you all for being such a great audience

1047
40:52.920 --> 40:54.360
at the end of the day on Thursday.

1048
40:54.360 --> 40:55.290
I know you're all tired,

1049
40:55.290 --> 40:56.610
so thank you for being with us.

1050
40:56.610 --> 40:59.009
And enjoy the rest of your week at CES.

1051
40:59.009 --> 41:01.592
(upbeat music)
