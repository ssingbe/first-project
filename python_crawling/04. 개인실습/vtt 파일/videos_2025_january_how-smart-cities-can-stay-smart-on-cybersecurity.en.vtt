00:00.080 --> 00:02.663
(bright music)

00:10.650 --> 00:12.210
<v ->All right. Hi everyone.</v>

00:12.210 --> 00:14.013
We're so glad you could join us.

00:14.880 --> 00:16.830
And good afternoon, CES.

00:16.830 --> 00:20.520
It's really great to have all of you here with us today.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.650
So we're gonna have a great panel discussion today

00:22.650 --> 00:25.473
on smart cities and cybersecurity.

00:27.690 --> 00:30.090
We're going to address how smart cities can stay smart

00:30.090 --> 00:32.430
when it comes to cybersecurity.

00:32.430 --> 00:35.250
As our cities become more connected and intelligent,

00:35.250 --> 00:37.200
safeguarding the flow of information

00:37.200 --> 00:40.170
and protecting critical infrastructure is paramount.

00:40.170 --> 00:42.420
I think we all can agree to that.

00:42.420 --> 00:45.090
So today we're gonna explore some of the challenges

00:45.090 --> 00:48.390
and the opportunities of securing smart cities.

00:48.390 --> 00:50.370
Also discussing innovative strategies

00:50.370 --> 00:53.880
to ensure safety, privacy, and resilience

00:53.880 --> 00:57.180
of these rapidly evolving urban environments.

00:57.180 --> 00:59.335
So before we get started, I'd like to intro-

00:59.335 --> 01:01.502
(silence)

01:07.320 --> 01:10.773
Standards programs at the Consumer Technology Association.

01:11.640 --> 01:13.230
I'm also the president

01:13.230 --> 01:16.140
of the US National Committee of the IEC.

01:16.140 --> 01:20.370
And in that role, we're focused on global standardization

01:20.370 --> 01:22.050
and conformity assessment.

01:22.050 --> 01:23.370
So bringing a lot of the work

01:23.370 --> 01:26.583
that I do in American National Standards internationally.

01:27.570 --> 01:29.850
I'm also the first woman to hold that position,

01:29.850 --> 01:31.647
which I'm really proud of.

01:31.647 --> 01:35.010
The IEC got it start in 1906.

01:35.010 --> 01:37.860
So imagine all the way through 2024,

01:37.860 --> 01:40.110
it took that long to get a woman elected.

01:40.110 --> 01:41.913
So very proud to hold that role.

01:42.810 --> 01:46.020
And being a member of that group,

01:46.020 --> 01:47.970
I'm also a member of the IEC Board,

01:47.970 --> 01:49.500
their business advisory committee,

01:49.500 --> 01:52.710
which looks at how we might globally influence

01:52.710 --> 01:55.050
standardization among some of the big three.

01:55.050 --> 01:57.420
I'm also on the American National Standards

01:57.420 --> 01:58.830
Institute Board of Directors.

01:58.830 --> 02:02.910
So standards are something I hold very dear to my heart.

02:02.910 --> 02:04.590
I'm also a US Army veteran

02:04.590 --> 02:06.450
because it seems like I really like

02:06.450 --> 02:08.700
to take on a lot of jobs. (laughs)

02:08.700 --> 02:11.580
So I'm really thrilled to have our panel of experts

02:11.580 --> 02:12.810
here with us today.

02:12.810 --> 02:14.850
They'll bring some diverse perspectives

02:14.850 --> 02:16.890
to what we're talking about

02:16.890 --> 02:18.780
when it comes to smart cities and cybersecurity.

02:18.780 --> 02:21.570
So I'm gonna let each of them introduce themselves.

02:21.570 --> 02:23.370
So Michelle, we'll start with you.

02:23.370 --> 02:24.270
<v ->So nice to be here.</v>

02:24.270 --> 02:26.340
It's my first time speaking at the CES,

02:26.340 --> 02:27.600
so I'm pretty excited.

02:27.600 --> 02:28.800
My name is Michelle Sahar.

02:28.800 --> 02:31.680
I'm the Cybersecurity Director of OpenPolicy.

02:31.680 --> 02:35.280
OpenPolicy, it's the first AI powered platform

02:35.280 --> 02:38.470
that democratize access to startups and innovators

02:39.420 --> 02:43.770
engaged in regulatory engagement, not only hold visibility,

02:43.770 --> 02:46.170
but also have the proactive knowledge

02:46.170 --> 02:49.860
and participate in this great landscape.

02:49.860 --> 02:52.980
So in my job, I advise clients not only

02:52.980 --> 02:56.910
on how to address all this information of regulation,

02:56.910 --> 02:59.400
but also how they can engage in helping info sharing

02:59.400 --> 03:01.860
with amazing government agencies.

03:01.860 --> 03:05.310
So my specialties are in IOT, which is very interesting

03:05.310 --> 03:09.900
about what we're gonna talk about today, AI, iCloud,

03:09.900 --> 03:12.900
and yeah, and I'm very excited for this, yeah.

03:12.900 --> 03:14.280
<v Veronica>Glad to have you here.</v>

03:14.280 --> 03:16.950
<v ->Matthew Straeb, I'm with Global Security Systems.</v>

03:16.950 --> 03:19.050
Our brand is ALERT FM,

03:19.050 --> 03:23.550
and we've been delivering communication systems

03:23.550 --> 03:27.000
that work when cell and other systems fail

03:27.000 --> 03:28.410
or you lose power or internet.

03:28.410 --> 03:32.130
So we kind of came in this from a different point of view

03:32.130 --> 03:35.760
because what we found out is that we work mostly

03:35.760 --> 03:38.130
in state and local communities,

03:38.130 --> 03:40.680
and they're all obviously have a very strong interest

03:40.680 --> 03:42.783
in alerting their citizenry.

03:43.710 --> 03:45.850
And a lot of these disasters

03:48.569 --> 03:51.510
can get into a situation where they fail very quickly.

03:51.510 --> 03:53.490
The power, internet and cell can all just fail

03:53.490 --> 03:54.840
right in five to 10 minutes,

03:54.840 --> 03:56.340
depending on what the disaster is.

03:56.340 --> 03:58.860
And we found that cybersecurity,

03:58.860 --> 04:01.923
cyber communications is the same profile.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.330
There's, you know, two types of cyber communication issues.

04:06.330 --> 04:08.970
One is ransomware, I'll just get in.

04:08.970 --> 04:10.590
And then the other one is, you know,

04:10.590 --> 04:11.520
they're gonna go after something

04:11.520 --> 04:12.570
that's gonna be important to you

04:12.570 --> 04:14.580
and that's gonna be typically communications.

04:14.580 --> 04:16.230
So we fill that gap.

04:16.230 --> 04:19.860
And we developed, I'm a co-founder, we developed a system

04:19.860 --> 04:23.760
where we basically use existing FM radio infrastructure.

04:23.760 --> 04:24.900
So you know how you get your song

04:24.900 --> 04:26.700
and title information on your car radio,

04:26.700 --> 04:29.190
we turn that into a alert system.

04:29.190 --> 04:32.220
And what's unique about it, it's independent because,

04:32.220 --> 04:34.320
and we deliver all of our data

04:34.320 --> 04:36.120
to the radio stations by satellite.

04:36.120 --> 04:38.940
So the only way you would be able to hack the system

04:38.940 --> 04:41.430
would be able to physically, you'd have to break into the,

04:41.430 --> 04:43.530
to knock at the satellite uplink.

04:43.530 --> 04:44.580
So we fill that gap.

04:44.580 --> 04:48.753
So when everything goes to, you know, goes south,

04:49.620 --> 04:51.030
our system would continue to work.

04:51.030 --> 04:53.007
So thank you.
<v ->Thank you.</v>

04:53.007 --> 04:54.390
<v ->And good afternoon everyone.</v>

04:54.390 --> 04:56.910
Great to see you all again here at CES.

04:56.910 --> 04:59.310
My name is Billy Bob Brown Jr.

04:59.310 --> 05:00.810
I'm the executive assistant director

05:00.810 --> 05:02.700
for Emergency Communications

05:02.700 --> 05:06.660
at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

05:06.660 --> 05:09.240
We spend most of our time talking about the idea

05:09.240 --> 05:13.290
of how do we improve cyber safety across the nation,

05:13.290 --> 05:16.380
and how do we encourage partners across the world

05:16.380 --> 05:19.980
to think about creating a world that's secure

05:19.980 --> 05:23.610
for all of our internet connected devices.

05:23.610 --> 05:25.500
<v ->Great. So glad to have all three of you with us.</v>

05:25.500 --> 05:28.440
And I have so many questions, some of which I've shared,

05:28.440 --> 05:31.830
but I love the mindset that we have here.

05:31.830 --> 05:33.030
I think we've got lots to talk about.

05:33.030 --> 05:36.840
So why don't we start with the biggest question maybe.

05:36.840 --> 05:39.480
What are the biggest cybersecurity challenges

05:39.480 --> 05:41.910
that you think smart cities face today?

05:41.910 --> 05:43.830
Maybe from each of your perspectives.

05:43.830 --> 05:48.390
<v ->So, smart cities, with the great technology comes,</v>

05:48.390 --> 05:50.550
there's like multiple layer vulnerabilities.

05:50.550 --> 05:53.550
And when we're talking about interconnected systems,

05:53.550 --> 05:56.820
basically, right, Smart cities wants to help us

05:56.820 --> 06:00.510
and help our lives to get better by interconnecting systems.

06:00.510 --> 06:05.220
So one of the vulnerabilities is IoT product, right?

06:05.220 --> 06:08.160
This interconnectivity can lead to vulnerabilities

06:08.160 --> 06:09.960
that we need to know how to mitigate

06:09.960 --> 06:12.180
from the outgoing, from the starts, right,

06:12.180 --> 06:14.250
from the development of the product itself

06:14.250 --> 06:16.080
before it's even connected.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.540
And the attack surface management now that we see

06:18.540 --> 06:21.810
if smart cities get expanded exponentially, right?

06:21.810 --> 06:24.030
There are so many small items,

06:24.030 --> 06:26.400
products, AI powered platform,

06:26.400 --> 06:28.410
we're not even mentioning the amount of data

06:28.410 --> 06:31.920
that flows through all the critical infrastructures.

06:31.920 --> 06:35.400
So all of this attack surface, someone needs to manage

06:35.400 --> 06:37.740
and needs to manage it in real time.

06:37.740 --> 06:40.800
And to be able not only to predict what can be,

06:40.800 --> 06:44.610
what can happen or which threat we can encounter,

06:44.610 --> 06:47.070
but also which kind of security measurements,

06:47.070 --> 06:49.590
which can cybersecurity protocols we need to do

06:49.590 --> 06:51.690
to also remediate and be resilient

06:51.690 --> 06:53.010
to the ever evolving threats.

06:53.010 --> 06:56.610
So I think how smart cities are built, it's great,

06:56.610 --> 06:59.310
but they're unfolding so many small pieces

06:59.310 --> 07:01.980
that we need to have some kind of a security baseline

07:01.980 --> 07:04.320
to know how we are addressing them.

07:04.320 --> 07:05.153
<v ->Yeah, I love that.</v>

07:05.153 --> 07:06.780
Security baselines, I think, are quite important,

07:06.780 --> 07:08.130
especially in standardization.

07:08.130 --> 07:09.180
We talk about that a lot.

07:09.180 --> 07:10.860
So do you envision, I think,

07:10.860 --> 07:12.600
maybe in your view of smart cities is,

07:12.600 --> 07:15.960
I agree we have so many products, IoT products,

07:15.960 --> 07:18.060
and we're bringing all that data together.

07:18.060 --> 07:19.800
Do you almost envision that there needs to be

07:19.800 --> 07:23.433
sort of like maybe a city management sort of a,

07:24.330 --> 07:25.890
you know, overview of?
<v ->One centralized?</v>

07:25.890 --> 07:27.750
Yeah, or do you think it needs to be more,

07:27.750 --> 07:29.460
I mean, 'cause I know we definitely want to see

07:29.460 --> 07:31.260
more of the customers being proactive

07:31.260 --> 07:34.707
and in being cyber smart,- but knowing that

07:34.707 --> 07:37.830
<v ->The IoT Cyber Trust Mark, right?</v>

07:37.830 --> 07:39.450
I am a great fan of that initiative

07:39.450 --> 07:42.060
and I think it's forming beautifully

07:42.060 --> 07:43.650
with the idea of smart cities, right?

07:43.650 --> 07:46.710
Because if someone is not aware,

07:46.710 --> 07:49.590
the US Cyber Trust Mark is a great initiative

07:49.590 --> 07:52.650
to trying to not only raise awareness of customers, right,

07:52.650 --> 07:55.110
and to understand if the consumer,

07:55.110 --> 07:57.840
if my mom wants pay the extra 10 bucks

07:57.840 --> 08:01.080
to have a better, more secure IoT product.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.330
But also, how we are forming

08:03.330 --> 08:05.700
this security baseline for IoT product?

08:05.700 --> 08:09.450
What is like the basic threshold of security standards?

08:09.450 --> 08:11.163
And I think that this initiative,

08:12.483 --> 08:14.670
it's exactly what you just mentioned.

08:14.670 --> 08:16.740
And I think that smart cities and local government

08:16.740 --> 08:21.570
can use that and emphasize the importance of this initiative

08:21.570 --> 08:24.510
and try to see if the consumer, how we can raise awareness,

08:24.510 --> 08:27.240
which is crucial for security for smart cities.

08:27.240 --> 08:31.260
And also to protect the basic lines of IoT products,

08:31.260 --> 08:35.580
which are the basic foundation of smart cities, right?

08:35.580 --> 08:37.080
<v ->Absolutely. Absolutely.</v>

08:37.080 --> 08:38.790
So Matthew, what do you think?

08:38.790 --> 08:40.290
<v ->Well, there's, there's two sides to it.</v>

08:40.290 --> 08:43.410
One is, you know, we wanna be able to use these devices.

08:43.410 --> 08:45.330
We don't want burden people.

08:45.330 --> 08:47.880
But at the same time we have privacy issues

08:47.880 --> 08:49.230
and people don't even realize

08:49.230 --> 08:51.090
that there could be a entry point too

08:51.090 --> 08:55.560
for a cybersecurity breach or attack, particularly if,

08:55.560 --> 08:57.720
and we deal mostly with government, you know,

08:57.720 --> 09:00.150
government employees, law enforcement,

09:00.150 --> 09:02.760
emergency management, those types of folks.

09:02.760 --> 09:05.880
And, you know, a lot of times we'll walk in and we'll say,

09:05.880 --> 09:09.750
you know, so that's on the IOT side or the device side.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.790
Now on the infrastructure side,

09:11.790 --> 09:14.553
the challenge is they've got so many disparate systems,

09:15.750 --> 09:19.110
you know, some are, I would say non-cyber security,

09:19.110 --> 09:22.920
you know, protectable because they're old

09:22.920 --> 09:24.397
and no one's even thinking about it.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.530
<v ->That's true.</v>
<v ->So they either have</v>

09:25.530 --> 09:26.520
to throw the system out,

09:26.520 --> 09:30.120
spend the money to do the X, Y, Z to replace,

09:30.120 --> 09:31.620
and they're not willing to do that.

09:31.620 --> 09:33.630
And a lot of the governance, we found,

09:33.630 --> 09:36.210
is a lot of the governance that goes into the cybersecurity,

09:36.210 --> 09:41.040
you know, laws, protection, regulations is on a state level,

09:41.040 --> 09:43.800
every state's different, every locality's different,

09:43.800 --> 09:45.690
every budget's different.

09:45.690 --> 09:47.760
And so, you know, a lot of times

09:47.760 --> 09:49.230
we'll walk into a sheriff's office

09:49.230 --> 09:51.240
and we'll say, "Cybersecurity."

09:51.240 --> 09:53.340
And they'll say, "What's that?" You know?

09:53.340 --> 09:54.687
I mean, unfortunately.
<v ->That's true.</v>

09:54.687 --> 09:58.560
<v ->And so we have to educate them, but it's a serious thing.</v>

09:58.560 --> 10:00.270
And you know, as an example,

10:00.270 --> 10:05.270
I was in a media headquarters, a large media headquarters,

10:07.050 --> 10:10.590
and, you know, there's a thousand employees working there

10:10.590 --> 10:12.757
and they gave me a tour and they said,

10:12.757 --> 10:14.550
"That's the operation center.

10:14.550 --> 10:16.830
Only three people are allowed to go in there."

10:16.830 --> 10:18.810
So, you know, people are locking down.

10:18.810 --> 10:20.710
It's not just, it's physical security,

10:22.402 --> 10:23.973
it's other layers of security.

10:25.680 --> 10:30.210
So I think the challenge is that,

10:30.210 --> 10:32.110
and I think CISA is doing a great job.

10:33.135 --> 10:35.940
They had a billion dollar grant program

10:35.940 --> 10:38.373
and we were at this Q&amp;A.

10:39.240 --> 10:41.850
And, you know, basically it's just there for them

10:41.850 --> 10:45.270
to write a cybersecurity plan, not even implement it.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.180
So we still have a long ways to go.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.422
<v Veronica>Yeah, right. I'd agree.</v>

10:48.422 --> 10:49.920
What do you think about that?

10:49.920 --> 10:52.020
<v ->Yeah, so I'm gonna be a little bit contrarian</v>

10:52.020 --> 10:55.320
and I'm hoping for a little dialogue this afternoon.

10:55.320 --> 11:00.030
So I think about the vulnerability in smart cities

11:00.030 --> 11:03.120
from the perspective of the greatest challenges,

11:03.120 --> 11:04.410
the people, you know?

11:04.410 --> 11:05.730
So we're in the people business.

11:05.730 --> 11:07.980
We're trying to create partnerships

11:07.980 --> 11:11.310
across government spaces, across industry spaces,

11:11.310 --> 11:14.700
across nonprofit spaces, across academia,

11:14.700 --> 11:17.400
'cause we recognize in order to secure

11:17.400 --> 11:19.470
the nation to improve resilience,

11:19.470 --> 11:22.290
it takes all of us actually working together.

11:22.290 --> 11:24.540
So some of the people problem

11:24.540 --> 11:29.140
relates to a way of thinking about products

11:31.620 --> 11:36.030
in a former style, which was, if it had that,

11:36.030 --> 11:37.290
and I don't want to call anyone out,

11:37.290 --> 11:40.500
but if it had that seal of approval, then it's good.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.630
So set it and forget it.

11:42.630 --> 11:44.310
You know, I'm only gonna buy the product

11:44.310 --> 11:47.283
that has the seal on it so I can set it and forget it.

11:48.120 --> 11:50.610
And which meant that you never looked at it

11:50.610 --> 11:54.000
and you never thought that there could be a vulnerability

11:54.000 --> 11:55.560
discovered last night,

11:55.560 --> 11:58.410
somebody in the basement somewhere spent up all night

11:58.410 --> 12:02.580
and they figured out a way to exploit a vulnerability.

12:02.580 --> 12:04.230
And now that they have that exploit,

12:04.230 --> 12:06.150
they're gonna use that in order to try

12:06.150 --> 12:10.290
and compromise your system for some purpose.

12:10.290 --> 12:12.870
And you might not actually be the target,

12:12.870 --> 12:15.600
you may be the avenue of approach

12:15.600 --> 12:18.120
to get to a target that they're trying to get to.

12:18.120 --> 12:21.450
You know, so the set it and forget it kind of mindset

12:21.450 --> 12:24.330
is what we really need to overcome.

12:24.330 --> 12:28.050
You know, how do we create a movement of people

12:28.050 --> 12:30.630
that are thinking about how do we secure our world?

12:30.630 --> 12:35.460
You know, how do we think of those basic security principles

12:35.460 --> 12:37.950
as being a responsibility that all of us,

12:37.950 --> 12:42.360
even at the individual consumer, should be thinking about.

12:42.360 --> 12:47.160
And then we should be demanding that from the producers of,

12:47.160 --> 12:50.160
so as, you know, as we talk about secure by design,

12:50.160 --> 12:53.880
secure by default, you know, it comes from consumers

12:53.880 --> 12:57.690
also requiring a higher threshold of security

12:57.690 --> 13:01.140
in those all internet connected devices

13:01.140 --> 13:03.750
as they're developed in the future,

13:03.750 --> 13:05.040
as they're created in the future,

13:05.040 --> 13:06.900
even applications, you know?

13:06.900 --> 13:08.220
So it really is a mindset.

13:08.220 --> 13:09.840
And but I wanna say, you know,

13:09.840 --> 13:12.120
in some ways it's like a mindset

13:12.120 --> 13:14.647
that we had before, but we forgot about it.

13:14.647 --> 13:17.940
<v ->You know, so you buy a horse and you think, yeah,</v>

13:17.940 --> 13:21.840
this horse is gonna gonna get me from point A to point B.

13:21.840 --> 13:24.930
You know, but that horse had to be fed every day.

13:24.930 --> 13:27.360
That horse had to be groomed every day.

13:27.360 --> 13:30.090
That horse had to be actually taken care of every day.

13:30.090 --> 13:32.130
We had to do something to make sure

13:32.130 --> 13:35.220
that that was going to successfully perform the function.

13:35.220 --> 13:37.077
But somehow we got away from that

13:37.077 --> 13:39.510
and the idea that, oh yeah, we can buy a product.

13:39.510 --> 13:41.910
It had that seal so I don't need to do anything.

13:41.910 --> 13:43.440
I don't even need to think about it

13:43.440 --> 13:46.530
that that number one doesn't really make sense.

13:46.530 --> 13:50.460
And today, as we see certainly cyber crime,

13:50.460 --> 13:54.000
cyber crime for hire as a problem and a challenge,

13:54.000 --> 13:58.440
that we all need to be more cyber smart

13:58.440 --> 14:00.150
to ensure cyber safety.

14:00.150 --> 14:01.560
<v ->Yeah, I really love that,</v>

14:01.560 --> 14:05.100
'cause I think if we think about it now,

14:05.100 --> 14:08.310
for me, I always use this example with, to your point

14:08.310 --> 14:10.560
about when you have a seal of approval on something,

14:10.560 --> 14:12.990
you do tend to have that set it and forget it mindset.

14:12.990 --> 14:16.050
So if you have a hair dryer, you know,

14:16.050 --> 14:18.510
maybe had a little hair dryer this morning,

14:18.510 --> 14:21.360
or a pot of coffee, you just plug it in

14:21.360 --> 14:25.050
and you don't check to see if it was certified in testing

14:25.050 --> 14:28.590
and it's met all the electronic standardization

14:28.590 --> 14:31.080
that it needs and has been tested appropriately,

14:31.080 --> 14:32.760
and you're not gonna catch on fire

14:32.760 --> 14:34.260
or blow the building up, right?

14:34.260 --> 14:37.530
But I agree when it comes to cybersecurity,

14:37.530 --> 14:39.900
because it's moving so quickly

14:39.900 --> 14:42.030
and there are so many devices,

14:42.030 --> 14:44.370
there are all these different entry points into there.

14:44.370 --> 14:48.270
So I think we do have to ask people come together.

14:48.270 --> 14:49.620
What do you think?

14:49.620 --> 14:51.960
What's your view for how we might make that work?

14:51.960 --> 14:54.180
I mean, 'cause that's a huge task, right?

14:54.180 --> 14:56.790
<v ->Yeah, and I definitely would like to hear</v>

14:56.790 --> 14:58.530
kind of what some of the other thoughts are.

14:58.530 --> 15:02.640
But, so I've been on a quest for a couple years now

15:02.640 --> 15:05.400
trying to sort out how do we create a movement.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.750
So one of the things that the,

15:06.750 --> 15:09.510
as I've been going around the world

15:09.510 --> 15:10.950
talking a little bit about,

15:10.950 --> 15:12.330
certainly emergency communications,

15:12.330 --> 15:16.140
that's where really my primary focus and expertise is,

15:16.140 --> 15:19.380
you know, but as we think about communications capabilities,

15:19.380 --> 15:21.270
you know, it is the same challenges.

15:21.270 --> 15:24.180
You know, some of the legacy way

15:24.180 --> 15:26.850
that we moved information by voice,

15:26.850 --> 15:28.830
you used an analog capability,

15:28.830 --> 15:30.780
that is going by the wayside.

15:30.780 --> 15:32.670
And more and more and more

15:32.670 --> 15:36.570
of that voice communications capability is all IP

15:36.570 --> 15:40.770
and it's using technologies that are internet connected.

15:40.770 --> 15:42.210
You know, some are behind firewalls,

15:42.210 --> 15:45.120
some of them are, you know, have some walled garden,

15:45.120 --> 15:49.020
but there are still opportunities for remote accessing.

15:49.020 --> 15:51.450
And I actually had a conversation with someone

15:51.450 --> 15:53.947
a couple years ago and they were telling me,

15:53.947 --> 15:56.520
"Oh yeah, no, no, this is closed off."

15:56.520 --> 15:58.620
And then I watched them reach into their pocket,

15:58.620 --> 16:00.690
they pulled out their smart device

16:00.690 --> 16:04.080
and they did something and they put their smart device away.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.970
And, you know, a few minutes later

16:05.970 --> 16:08.910
they leaned over and said, "Yeah, I've got this ability,

16:08.910 --> 16:10.920
I can remotely, you know, tune this thing in up

16:10.920 --> 16:13.020
and I just got something so I fixed it.

16:13.020 --> 16:15.930
And so I waited about an hour and then I asked,

16:15.930 --> 16:18.900
I was like, "Oh, you know, that remote access that you use,

16:18.900 --> 16:22.750
that's a internet vulnerability that you just opened."

16:22.750 --> 16:23.583
(all laughing)

16:23.583 --> 16:25.440
They said, "What?" (chuckles)

16:25.440 --> 16:26.490
They didn't even realize, you know,

16:26.490 --> 16:28.680
but it's the idea of how do we, you know,

16:28.680 --> 16:30.330
as I'm talking to governments around the world,

16:30.330 --> 16:32.040
all of us have the same challenge

16:32.040 --> 16:34.890
of moving emergency information to protect citizens.

16:34.890 --> 16:37.500
We should all be very cognizant of the fact

16:37.500 --> 16:40.830
that the all interconnected IP environment

16:40.830 --> 16:43.290
requires all of us to be thinking

16:43.290 --> 16:46.230
and to be partnering, you know, across our organizations

16:46.230 --> 16:48.420
with the information security specialists.

16:48.420 --> 16:49.253
<v Veronica>Yeah.</v>

16:49.253 --> 16:52.650
<v ->I would say, I know education and awareness is, right?</v>

16:52.650 --> 16:54.750
And then where does the responsibility fall?

16:54.750 --> 16:58.200
Is it with the manufacturer or with the user?

16:58.200 --> 17:01.560
I think that's gonna be become more and more of an issue.

17:01.560 --> 17:02.940
And I think people are willing to pay for that.

17:02.940 --> 17:05.880
You know, from a consumer electronics point of view,

17:05.880 --> 17:07.710
I wanna know that I have a secure system

17:07.710 --> 17:08.730
and I don't wanna worry about it

17:08.730 --> 17:10.200
and I'll pay you for that, you know?

17:10.200 --> 17:11.033
<v Veronica>Right. Yeah.</v>

17:11.033 --> 17:13.230
<v ->And I think that's a real opportunity</v>

17:13.230 --> 17:16.293
for a lot of manufacturers to take advantage of that.

17:17.266 --> 17:19.920
'Cause if anyone's ever been a victim of identity theft

17:19.920 --> 17:22.620
or any of that kind of stuff, I mean, it's a real pain.

17:22.620 --> 17:24.087
<v ->Yes. Yes.</v>
<v ->So, you know,</v>

17:24.087 --> 17:25.650
and it costs time and money

17:25.650 --> 17:27.810
and I think people, there's a value to it.

17:27.810 --> 17:29.130
And if we can avoid that,

17:29.130 --> 17:30.480
then I think that's gonna be something

17:30.480 --> 17:32.940
that manufacturers are gonna start promoting

17:32.940 --> 17:34.290
that their system is closed.

17:34.290 --> 17:36.330
And there's a few that I come to mind

17:36.330 --> 17:38.350
that are kind of in that camp

17:39.300 --> 17:41.520
that have been pretty successful so.

17:41.520 --> 17:42.720
<v ->Yeah, that's very interesting.</v>

17:42.720 --> 17:44.430
Especially I do agree,

17:44.430 --> 17:47.670
I think that there's a good opportunity for manufacturers

17:47.670 --> 17:49.170
to help educate consumers.

17:49.170 --> 17:50.340
And I think the more,

17:50.340 --> 17:52.050
especially me being in the standards business,

17:52.050 --> 17:55.080
I feel like the more manufacturers that are involved

17:55.080 --> 17:59.550
in talking about these cybersecurity vulnerabilities

17:59.550 --> 18:01.740
and how we might be able to work together

18:01.740 --> 18:04.140
to create awareness without dipping

18:04.140 --> 18:05.760
into the secret networks, right?

18:05.760 --> 18:07.770
But if we can work together

18:07.770 --> 18:10.140
and create standards that help make a stronger system,

18:10.140 --> 18:11.340
it's definitely a better way.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.650
Plus we can definitely get that out to the consumers

18:13.650 --> 18:15.780
that these manufacturers follow these standards.

18:15.780 --> 18:18.102
So I think that's a very important way.

18:18.102 --> 18:19.230
<v ->I think it's gonna be a feature.</v>

18:19.230 --> 18:21.437
It'll become a feature that people are wanna pay for.

18:21.437 --> 18:23.970
<v ->But at some level too, like all of us though,</v>

18:23.970 --> 18:25.200
have a responsibility.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.150
Even at the consumer end,

18:27.150 --> 18:31.350
all of us have a responsibility to be looking at it daily.

18:31.350 --> 18:34.470
You know, so for anyone that's got a smart device right now,

18:34.470 --> 18:37.890
I don't think anyone in the room has any problem

18:37.890 --> 18:40.260
with the idea of checking, you know, the application store

18:40.260 --> 18:43.590
and seeing that there's been an update to an application

18:43.590 --> 18:45.423
for, you know, if you've got, you know,

18:45.423 --> 18:47.790
it's I wanna call out names here but.

18:47.790 --> 18:51.330
So if you've got an app for getting a ride somewhere,

18:51.330 --> 18:54.630
you know, you don't think anything of updating that app,

18:54.630 --> 18:57.120
you know, 'cause some new features have been, you know?

18:57.120 --> 19:00.030
But also, some security flaws have been updated, you know?

19:00.030 --> 19:03.180
So there's a responsibility on the consumer side

19:03.180 --> 19:04.740
to do something, you know?

19:04.740 --> 19:07.710
On the application developer side or the manufacturer side,

19:07.710 --> 19:08.640
they did something,

19:08.640 --> 19:11.340
but it also requires the consumer to do something.

19:11.340 --> 19:12.930
And part of that, I believe,

19:12.930 --> 19:15.390
is consumers also having the mindset,

19:15.390 --> 19:18.450
I should be demanding good security, right?

19:18.450 --> 19:21.360
So somebody should be doing something when they find out

19:21.360 --> 19:23.250
that there's an exploit in the wild,

19:23.250 --> 19:24.990
doing something to close that

19:24.990 --> 19:27.030
to make this application more safe for me.

19:27.030 --> 19:28.950
<v ->Yeah, I agree wholeheartedly.</v>

19:28.950 --> 19:32.100
So when we're thinking about technical strategic approaches,

19:32.100 --> 19:34.230
what role do you think emerging technologies

19:34.230 --> 19:36.180
like AI and blockchain will play

19:36.180 --> 19:38.280
in securing smart city infrastructures?

19:38.280 --> 19:41.910
<v ->Wow, the full potential of AI in smart city</v>

19:41.910 --> 19:45.270
can unleash new capabilities and new things

19:45.270 --> 19:49.440
from real time detections and predictive analytics.

19:49.440 --> 19:50.460
It can be everything.

19:50.460 --> 19:53.070
It can be even helping just detect

19:53.070 --> 19:54.500
the vulnerabilities we just spoke about

19:54.500 --> 19:58.320
of IoT product basically, and isolate them from the system

19:58.320 --> 20:00.630
and basically mitigate the threats.

20:00.630 --> 20:05.630
But we are all talking about the other side of AI

20:05.760 --> 20:08.280
and what is happening if we are integrating

20:08.280 --> 20:10.200
AI full potential in smart cities.

20:10.200 --> 20:14.790
And I think that when it can introduce great stuff,

20:14.790 --> 20:17.040
also we need to look about the AI risk

20:17.040 --> 20:20.760
as an holistic perspective about what we just spoke about,

20:20.760 --> 20:23.280
about data security, cybersecurity,

20:23.280 --> 20:24.663
critical infrastructures.

20:25.816 --> 20:28.830
How we can manage and mitigate all the risks

20:28.830 --> 20:31.800
that involve through that specific connection

20:31.800 --> 20:35.760
because of the fragile elements of smart cities,

20:35.760 --> 20:37.298
which is everything is interconnected.

20:37.298 --> 20:38.131
<v Veronica>Right. Right.</v>

20:38.131 --> 20:42.060
<v ->And if we are not looking at as an holistic thing,</v>

20:42.060 --> 20:42.960
we are missing out.

20:42.960 --> 20:46.260
And it can be a very hard aftermath

20:46.260 --> 20:48.600
that we need to think about it from the start.

20:48.600 --> 20:49.473
<v ->Yeah, for sure.</v>

20:51.000 --> 20:51.900
What do you think?

20:53.545 --> 20:56.070
<v ->You know, to managing all, you know, this data,</v>

20:56.070 --> 20:57.600
we have unbelievable amounts of data.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.385
We don't know what to do with

20:59.385 --> 21:01.920
We have no idea this falling on the floor all the time

21:01.920 --> 21:03.750
and nobody knows what to do with it,

21:03.750 --> 21:06.120
whether it's coming from a jet engine or whatever.

21:06.120 --> 21:07.950
And, you know, cybersecurity

21:07.950 --> 21:09.180
is just gonna be another application

21:09.180 --> 21:11.193
that goes inside of the AI world.

21:13.050 --> 21:14.070
So it's gonna be a while,

21:14.070 --> 21:17.793
but I think definitely that has lots of potential.

21:19.020 --> 21:20.820
On the blockchain side. I mean, that's gonna be,

21:20.820 --> 21:23.040
you know, help us a lot with privacy.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.150
You know, that's gonna be the answer.

21:24.150 --> 21:27.090
So it's, you know, I think as we have these things

21:27.090 --> 21:28.560
that really come into up, you know,

21:28.560 --> 21:30.443
cybersecurity has become more of an issue,

21:31.569 --> 21:33.930
we've got responses to it, so the technology.

21:33.930 --> 21:34.980
So that's a good thing.

21:34.980 --> 21:36.930
<v ->Yeah, and I think to your point about privacy,</v>

21:36.930 --> 21:41.760
I feel like most concerns tend to be based around privacy.

21:41.760 --> 21:44.550
When you talk to consumers, it's not, you know,

21:44.550 --> 21:47.550
not so much their understanding of the,

21:47.550 --> 21:51.000
about their data is going to be out there so.

21:51.000 --> 21:51.970
<v ->I just wanna get in my app.</v>

21:51.970 --> 21:53.550
I've been working on three weeks to get in this app

21:53.550 --> 21:55.710
and you can help me, please help me,

21:55.710 --> 21:57.790
because it's so, you know what I mean.

21:58.670 --> 22:03.450
<v ->Yeah, for sure. What do you think about the power of AI</v>

22:03.450 --> 22:05.070
and the future potential there?

22:05.070 --> 22:09.210
<v ->Yeah, I'm super excited about emerging technology</v>

22:09.210 --> 22:13.590
and the ability to help citizens to bring safety

22:13.590 --> 22:16.897
and responders to support citizens in everyday life, right?

22:16.897 --> 22:19.650
You know, so Matt mentioned a little bit earlier

22:19.650 --> 22:22.110
about the idea of, you know, a disaster happens

22:22.110 --> 22:24.390
and we sort out how to help people.

22:24.390 --> 22:26.460
I'm from Washington, DC,

22:26.460 --> 22:28.230
we got like three inches of snow on the ground,

22:28.230 --> 22:29.850
that's a disaster for us.

22:29.850 --> 22:30.750
<v ->Yeah, it's a disaster.</v>
<v ->Yeah, you know,</v>

22:30.750 --> 22:32.850
so they're going through that right now,

22:32.850 --> 22:34.110
trying to sort that out.

22:34.110 --> 22:35.970
But, you know, in the everyday situation,

22:35.970 --> 22:38.070
you know, we have people that are in trouble.

22:38.070 --> 22:39.930
Something happens, they need help.

22:39.930 --> 22:44.460
They need to do a request for assistance using 911,

22:44.460 --> 22:46.920
you know, next generation of 911 is coming out,

22:46.920 --> 22:50.910
which will in only increase the IP connectedness

22:50.910 --> 22:55.910
of those call, those public safety answering points

22:56.010 --> 22:58.890
and the ability to do distributed calls

22:58.890 --> 23:02.280
and some sort of collective support

23:02.280 --> 23:04.830
across regional environments.

23:04.830 --> 23:07.200
But it also brings a cybersecurity concern.

23:07.200 --> 23:10.980
But as we were talking a little bit before the panel today,

23:10.980 --> 23:12.720
you know, the thing I think about all the time

23:12.720 --> 23:15.270
is the large scale challenge at scale.

23:15.270 --> 23:17.640
You know, so I think about an earthquake.

23:17.640 --> 23:18.960
In the center of the country,

23:18.960 --> 23:21.630
there's a fault line called New Madrid.

23:21.630 --> 23:26.630
The New Madrid earthquake is prime for 100 year challenge,

23:28.920 --> 23:30.780
and there's gonna be tens of millions of people

23:30.780 --> 23:32.130
impacted by that.

23:32.130 --> 23:35.160
Artificial intelligence gives us the opportunity

23:35.160 --> 23:38.280
to try at scale to understand where people are

23:38.280 --> 23:40.410
in order to better manage the ability

23:40.410 --> 23:43.740
to get responders to help those citizens

23:43.740 --> 23:45.960
as those responder organizations are marshaled.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.630
You know, so and in terms of blockchain, you know,

23:48.630 --> 23:51.060
I'm super excited personally about blockchain.

23:51.060 --> 23:54.810
I just think that there's unlimited potential

23:54.810 --> 23:57.150
that has not really been thought about,

23:57.150 --> 24:00.000
about how we can actually validate.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.280
And that's where I see blockchain helping out,

24:02.280 --> 24:07.280
validate, you know, who is trying to send information.

24:07.656 --> 24:09.510
You know, so I'm super excited.

24:09.510 --> 24:10.710
<v ->I'm really excited about too.</v>

24:10.710 --> 24:14.098
It's kind of great to have fellow tech nerdy up here.

24:14.098 --> 24:17.100
(laughs) So I think that we've gotten a little bit

24:17.100 --> 24:20.013
into future focus.

24:20.940 --> 24:22.440
What do you think about when we're thinking

24:22.440 --> 24:24.750
about more of these advanced technologies,

24:24.750 --> 24:27.390
ow should our cybersecurity strategies evolve

24:27.390 --> 24:28.890
to address new threats?

24:28.890 --> 24:30.810
And that's always, that's the big question, right?

24:30.810 --> 24:33.060
Like how do we stay ahead of the new threats?

24:35.250 --> 24:37.350
<v ->Yeah, so I'll just sort of jump right in</v>

24:37.350 --> 24:41.160
and, you know, at some level it cannot only be government

24:41.160 --> 24:42.950
that's trying to figure that out, you know?

24:42.950 --> 24:46.470
So and again, as it is a mantra of our organization

24:46.470 --> 24:48.240
that we are partnering, you know,

24:48.240 --> 24:49.890
we want everybody to come to the table.

24:49.890 --> 24:52.920
You know, industry has gotta be a part of the equation.

24:52.920 --> 24:55.320
Nonprofits have gotta be a part of the equation.

24:55.320 --> 24:57.600
Academia has gotta be a part of the equation.

24:57.600 --> 25:01.410
You know, we believe cybersecurity really has no borders.

25:01.410 --> 25:03.450
You know, someone from across the world

25:03.450 --> 25:06.930
could be making a cyber intrusion into a device.

25:06.930 --> 25:09.900
And, you know, therefore every good government on the planet

25:09.900 --> 25:12.510
should be working together to try to figure out

25:12.510 --> 25:15.480
how are we creating a cybersecurity framework

25:15.480 --> 25:18.720
that allows all of us to secure information

25:18.720 --> 25:21.960
so that it can perform the actual work

25:21.960 --> 25:23.640
that it's intended to perform

25:23.640 --> 25:25.800
in that application or the device.

25:25.800 --> 25:26.880
You know, but it takes all of us

25:26.880 --> 25:30.270
bringing ideas to the table to actually create a solution

25:30.270 --> 25:34.290
even as the emerging technology comes into play.

25:34.290 --> 25:36.840
So like I'm a huge proponent for Quantum.

25:36.840 --> 25:38.460
You know, I've been talking to my team

25:38.460 --> 25:40.350
and, you know, nobody agrees with me.

25:40.350 --> 25:42.187
So if everybody in the room wants to say,

25:42.187 --> 25:44.730
"I don't agree with you either," join the club.

25:44.730 --> 25:45.870
Nobody agrees with me.

25:45.870 --> 25:49.500
But I believe Quantum is going to radically transform

25:49.500 --> 25:51.413
the way we move information in the future.

25:51.413 --> 25:52.724
<v Veronica>Yeah, I agree.</v>

25:52.724 --> 25:53.557
I agree with you.
<v ->Can I also?</v>

25:53.557 --> 25:54.480
<v ->Go ahead.</v>
<v ->I would add</v>

25:54.480 --> 25:57.060
from the innovator perspective,

25:57.060 --> 25:58.290
I totally agree with you.

25:58.290 --> 26:02.160
And also info sharing, information sharing is so critical

26:02.160 --> 26:03.990
to help not only the regulator,

26:03.990 --> 26:06.663
but also to have some kind of a resilient framework

26:06.663 --> 26:09.240
that is updating constantly, right?

26:09.240 --> 26:11.490
As we are very pushing on updating apps,

26:11.490 --> 26:14.130
we need to update frameworks of cybersecurity

26:14.130 --> 26:17.010
and understanding that cybersecurity is a great pillar

26:17.010 --> 26:19.890
of the security of smart cities, for example.

26:19.890 --> 26:21.330
But how we make it update?

26:21.330 --> 26:23.880
By talking with the people on the ground,

26:23.880 --> 26:25.530
by talking to researchers,

26:25.530 --> 26:28.140
by seeing which kind of vulnerabilities and threats.

26:28.140 --> 26:31.650
For example, the clients of the kinds that work with us

26:31.650 --> 26:33.930
have so many information and white papers

26:33.930 --> 26:35.850
about things that they see.

26:35.850 --> 26:37.950
And this information is critical

26:37.950 --> 26:41.040
not only just to map what's going to be the next threat,

26:41.040 --> 26:43.410
but also like which kind of solution,

26:43.410 --> 26:46.260
technical solution we can bring to the table.

26:46.260 --> 26:50.130
And basically, yeah, help raising this resilient aspect.

26:50.130 --> 26:51.990
<v ->Yeah, and that's a lot of data.</v>

26:51.990 --> 26:53.820
And to your point, we don't want it to fall on the floor,

26:53.820 --> 26:55.950
maybe as a good opportunity for AI

26:55.950 --> 26:57.360
to train against all that data

26:57.360 --> 26:59.433
and share that in a secure way of course.

26:59.433 --> 27:01.020
<v ->In quantum we'll just..</v>
<v ->In quantum.</v>

27:01.020 --> 27:01.853
Right. Exactly.
<v ->Just sweep.</v>

27:01.853 --> 27:02.686
<v ->There you-</v>
<v ->It just takes out</v>

27:02.686 --> 27:03.519
a whole layer.
<v ->You got more believers.</v>

27:03.519 --> 27:04.507
<v ->It just takes out a whole layer.</v>

27:04.507 --> 27:06.845
It just takes out a whole layer processing that,

27:06.845 --> 27:09.450
you know, is going to exponentially

27:09.450 --> 27:10.800
provide more solutions so.

27:10.800 --> 27:12.390
<v ->Yeah, that's excellent.</v>

27:12.390 --> 27:15.840
So I think maybe going back to disaster management,

27:15.840 --> 27:17.730
thinking about the snowstorm (laughs)

27:17.730 --> 27:19.200
and being very happy to be here

27:19.200 --> 27:21.750
and not shoveling snow back in DC,

27:21.750 --> 27:24.540
how do you think we can, in smart cities, I mean,

27:24.540 --> 27:26.730
leverage some of that technology we talked about

27:26.730 --> 27:31.230
for certainly improving first response in 911,

27:31.230 --> 27:33.240
but how can we work on that overall

27:33.240 --> 27:35.130
with disaster management strategies?

27:35.130 --> 27:37.290
You spoke about the potential for the earthquake,

27:37.290 --> 27:39.210
and I think back to when we had

27:39.210 --> 27:42.570
a very tiny earthquake in the DC area,

27:42.570 --> 27:44.490
but you would've thought it was the largest

27:44.490 --> 27:45.990
like we were in California or something,

27:45.990 --> 27:47.460
but it was very tiny.

27:47.460 --> 27:50.040
Having grown up in California was hardly worth mentioning.

27:50.040 --> 27:51.210
But it's still important

27:51.210 --> 27:54.090
to have disaster resilience strategies

27:54.090 --> 27:55.500
to address all of that.

27:55.500 --> 27:59.490
What are your thoughts on what smart cities could be doing?

27:59.490 --> 28:02.040
<v ->Well, I mean, they have to protect their networks,</v>

28:02.040 --> 28:04.830
first of all, so that they can operate.

28:04.830 --> 28:09.830
And then on the edge, like, you know, I was going to this,

28:10.950 --> 28:14.073
where is my, there's only two ways to alert people.

28:15.270 --> 28:17.250
I lost my phone.
(Michelle and Veronica laughs)

28:17.250 --> 28:18.300
There's two ways to alert people.

28:18.300 --> 28:19.530
One is the cell phone

28:19.530 --> 28:23.160
and the other is another device that we make actually.

28:23.160 --> 28:23.993
<v Veronica>Oh, there you go.</v>

28:23.993 --> 28:25.440
<v ->And this is the device</v>

28:25.440 --> 28:29.940
that actually is a geo-targeted device

28:29.940 --> 28:33.000
that will receive earthquake alerts, weather alerts,

28:33.000 --> 28:36.810
and it's works even when the internet and the power fail

28:36.810 --> 28:38.700
'cause it has a battery in it,

28:38.700 --> 28:39.810
and the cell network fails

28:39.810 --> 28:42.420
because it's on a totally independent network.

28:42.420 --> 28:45.540
<v ->So the thing that people underestimate</v>

28:45.540 --> 28:50.400
is how quickly we can lose all of our communication tools

28:50.400 --> 28:52.980
and people are then basically stuck

28:52.980 --> 28:55.443
and that's where people get upset.

28:56.670 --> 28:59.160
So that's the gap that we're filling.

28:59.160 --> 29:01.170
And it goes back to analog.

29:01.170 --> 29:02.670
I mean at the end of the day, I mean,

29:02.670 --> 29:04.290
I don't care what kind of AI you got

29:04.290 --> 29:08.580
or, you know, how big your television is or whatever.

29:08.580 --> 29:12.000
It's that FM, it's a radio infrastructure

29:12.000 --> 29:13.710
that's gonna save lives

29:13.710 --> 29:15.760
in those disasters that you talked about.

29:16.620 --> 29:18.990
Cell is great until we get to that point,

29:18.990 --> 29:20.880
but those networks are not built.

29:20.880 --> 29:22.290
A lot of this stuff is not built

29:22.290 --> 29:24.630
because we didn't think about all of this

29:24.630 --> 29:27.630
for all these other disasters and cybersecurity

29:27.630 --> 29:29.760
and all this things, pop, came up.

29:29.760 --> 29:32.460
So, you know, we have all the infrastructure now.

29:32.460 --> 29:34.200
It's just educating people.

29:34.200 --> 29:36.840
The way that disaster management works though in the US

29:36.840 --> 29:38.220
is that each state decides

29:38.220 --> 29:40.380
how they wanna manage their disasters.

29:40.380 --> 29:42.900
So you're basically dealing with 50 plus countries,

29:42.900 --> 29:44.550
you know, in essence.
<v ->Yes.</v>

29:44.550 --> 29:46.440
<v ->So trying to get them all to agree,</v>

29:46.440 --> 29:49.800
I mean, forget about the international space.

29:49.800 --> 29:51.090
And everyone's got a different idea.

29:51.090 --> 29:52.500
Everyone's got a different experience.

29:52.500 --> 29:53.760
Some come from law enforcement,

29:53.760 --> 29:55.980
some come from fire, it's all different.

29:55.980 --> 29:58.140
So that's the challenge is bringing all of those together

29:58.140 --> 30:01.950
and then educating them so that they can protect their,

30:01.950 --> 30:03.648
you know, protect their citizens.

30:03.648 --> 30:05.500
<v Veronica>Yeah, I agree.</v>

30:05.500 --> 30:07.830
<v ->And I believe, as you were saying,</v>

30:07.830 --> 30:09.810
the idea of, you know, educating

30:09.810 --> 30:12.960
even those that may have differing perspectives, right?

30:12.960 --> 30:16.770
You know, state of California, state of Missouri,

30:16.770 --> 30:18.960
they think differently, they have a different population,

30:18.960 --> 30:20.880
they have different geography.

30:20.880 --> 30:24.900
You know, certainly in terms of scale and size,

30:24.900 --> 30:28.050
the opportunity in their tax base to do things

30:28.050 --> 30:29.102
are different.

30:29.102 --> 30:31.680
You know, so they think about how they're gonna manage

30:31.680 --> 30:34.770
to the resources that they have differently.

30:34.770 --> 30:37.290
And, you know, I believe that's totally okay.

30:37.290 --> 30:38.640
There's no problem with that.

30:38.640 --> 30:40.860
And, you know, but there should be some way

30:40.860 --> 30:45.240
that we think about saving the life of a citizen

30:45.240 --> 30:47.010
as being universal, right?

30:47.010 --> 30:49.170
So it doesn't matter what state you're from,

30:49.170 --> 30:50.853
it doesn't matter what country you're from, you know,

30:50.853 --> 30:54.540
that we all think about saving of a life

30:54.540 --> 30:55.950
from the same perspective.

30:55.950 --> 30:58.830
And I think smart cities are going to help with that

30:58.830 --> 31:01.890
because we're bringing more and more and more connectivity.

31:01.890 --> 31:03.870
And, you know, in the standards arena, you know,

31:03.870 --> 31:05.310
there's something they were talking about pro,

31:05.310 --> 31:09.360
say, side link, you know, way for mesh to make mesh.

31:09.360 --> 31:12.600
Really capable, even for those cellular devices

31:12.600 --> 31:14.400
to be able to move signals one device

31:14.400 --> 31:16.830
to another device in order to move,

31:16.830 --> 31:19.440
whether it's request for assistance information

31:19.440 --> 31:21.390
or alerting information.

31:21.390 --> 31:22.920
You know, I think that technology

31:22.920 --> 31:25.320
is moving farther forward that that'll help us

31:25.320 --> 31:26.880
with that disaster management thing.

31:26.880 --> 31:29.430
<v ->And what that infers is a federal solution,</v>

31:29.430 --> 31:31.039
which we all are afraid of.

31:31.039 --> 31:32.070
(Veronica laughs)

31:32.070 --> 31:32.903
<v ->I'm not afraid of it.</v>

31:32.903 --> 31:34.560
I love federal solutions.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.853
<v ->That's Billy Bob. (laughs)</v>

31:37.710 --> 31:39.420
But maybe even cybersecurity,

31:39.420 --> 31:41.430
'cause it is a national threat.

31:41.430 --> 31:43.240
So I'm not suggest, I'm just-
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

31:43.240 --> 31:45.510
<v ->We've been dealing a lot with these different states</v>

31:45.510 --> 31:48.090
and it's very, very complicated.

31:48.090 --> 31:49.320
They all have different priorities,

31:49.320 --> 31:51.150
as you mentioned financially, you know,

31:51.150 --> 31:53.250
and they get different budgets.

31:53.250 --> 31:55.500
You're not gonna get there unless it comes from the top down

31:55.500 --> 31:56.550
and meet somewhere in the middle.

31:56.550 --> 31:58.560
So that's just my opinion, personal opinion.

31:58.560 --> 31:59.393
<v ->Right, right.</v>

31:59.393 --> 32:00.226
<v ->Unfortunately.
And certainly when you start</v>

32:00.226 --> 32:01.059
thinking about like-
<v ->Unfortunately.</v>

32:01.059 --> 32:03.850
<v ->The critical areas, right, like power.</v>

32:03.850 --> 32:05.760
<v ->Yeah, power, right.</v>
<v ->Power. (laughs)</v>

32:05.760 --> 32:08.070
Communications, the big ones, yeah.

32:08.070 --> 32:12.330
Well, we're getting down to, gosh, that panel went so fast.

32:12.330 --> 32:13.650
Because we have about eight minutes left,

32:13.650 --> 32:16.380
I wanna make sure if anyone has questions in the audience,

32:16.380 --> 32:18.390
we have time to answer them.

32:18.390 --> 32:19.620
But if you don't have any questions,

32:19.620 --> 32:21.270
I'll come up with some of my own.

32:23.790 --> 32:25.440
<v Participant>I've been in the embedded space a long time.</v>

32:25.440 --> 32:27.690
I've worked for a very large manufacturer

32:27.690 --> 32:31.860
that did an IoT SOC.

32:31.860 --> 32:36.150
And what I found in that situation

32:36.150 --> 32:40.495
was people weren't paying for security.

32:40.495 --> 32:43.440
And so when you get to the actual consumer,

32:43.440 --> 32:44.970
I understand everything you said,

32:44.970 --> 32:46.650
and I personally believe everything you said,

32:46.650 --> 32:48.960
but I think we all have propellers in our head

32:48.960 --> 32:50.640
or secure propellers in our head.

32:50.640 --> 32:52.290
But when it gets to the consumer,

32:52.290 --> 32:54.330
people buy the cheapest thing.

32:54.330 --> 32:59.330
And we found in that company that the cost would've been $20

32:59.430 --> 33:02.160
and the vendors wouldn't accept that.

33:02.160 --> 33:04.560
We lowered it down to a dollar

33:04.560 --> 33:06.660
and the vendors would not accept that.

33:06.660 --> 33:09.420
So when I hear you say, you know,

33:09.420 --> 33:10.560
convince the manufacturers,

33:10.560 --> 33:13.590
I think the manufacturers are convinced.

33:13.590 --> 33:17.610
So no manufacturer wants to know that it was, you know,

33:17.610 --> 33:22.260
ACME, whatever, IoT device that caused this break.

33:22.260 --> 33:24.240
You know it's a huge problem.

33:24.240 --> 33:26.760
So I think the challenge for us,

33:26.760 --> 33:29.070
and I'm kind of throwing that out,

33:29.070 --> 33:34.070
how do we get people to accept security?

33:34.140 --> 33:36.990
You know, and Michael, something you said at the end,

33:36.990 --> 33:38.813
maybe it has to be top down, right,

33:38.813 --> 33:42.270
'cause otherwise it's, you know, it's the cheapest part

33:42.270 --> 33:43.553
that I buy, that the consumer buy, throw that out.

33:45.660 --> 33:47.100
<v ->Well, I mean, you start with standards.</v>

33:47.100 --> 33:49.650
You try to be nice, do it the the nice way,

33:49.650 --> 33:52.650
get people to adopt it and implement it.

33:52.650 --> 33:54.900
And if that doesn't work, then you have to go to,

33:54.900 --> 33:56.040
you know, keep escalating.

33:56.040 --> 34:01.040
So it just, there's a, I mean there's a huge liability here

34:02.400 --> 34:04.773
that nobody really talks about that, you know,

34:05.940 --> 34:08.190
that could sink a business if they don't play,

34:08.190 --> 34:11.040
you know, take care of it so.

34:11.040 --> 34:12.150
Right, sink a city too.

34:12.150 --> 34:13.530
Right, exactly.

34:13.530 --> 34:16.260
<v ->Yeah, so in kind of our secure fault,</v>

34:16.260 --> 34:18.840
secure by design conversation, you know,

34:18.840 --> 34:22.320
we expressed the idea that corporate boards,

34:22.320 --> 34:23.610
you know, so on the manufacturer,

34:23.610 --> 34:26.220
on the developer side, have some responsibility.

34:26.220 --> 34:28.470
All of the risks shouldn't be translated

34:28.470 --> 34:30.180
right directly to the consumer.

34:30.180 --> 34:32.370
You know, there should be some on that side.

34:32.370 --> 34:34.890
But I equate that same thought process, you know,

34:34.890 --> 34:38.640
to how we think about partnering, you know, all of us.

34:38.640 --> 34:41.550
So if we just talk about the United States, you know,

34:41.550 --> 34:44.550
we have, you know, so now I'm gonna go off script,

34:44.550 --> 34:46.827
hopefully somebody's not recording this, you know,

34:46.827 --> 34:49.410
but so I'm gonna go off script for just a second.

34:49.410 --> 34:51.300
We have something like $23 trillion

34:51.300 --> 34:54.270
running through our gross domestic product, you know?

34:54.270 --> 34:59.270
So in my opinion, you can't tell me that we can't figure out

35:00.030 --> 35:04.320
a creative way to inside of $23 trillion

35:04.320 --> 35:07.380
sort out how we can improve security.

35:07.380 --> 35:09.570
You know, so at some level, you know,

35:09.570 --> 35:11.640
what Matt sort of mentioned the idea of, you know,

35:11.640 --> 35:14.100
maybe the consumer side picks it up, you know,

35:14.100 --> 35:18.090
is there maybe an idea that at some level,

35:18.090 --> 35:22.320
maybe there's some insurance that could be reduced?

35:22.320 --> 35:23.153
On some level,

35:23.153 --> 35:26.070
ts there some tax relief that could be introduced?

35:26.070 --> 35:30.360
You know, is there some way to create that ability

35:30.360 --> 35:33.690
to ensure that security is baked in

35:33.690 --> 35:36.270
and it's looked at each and every day?

35:36.270 --> 35:38.190
You know, by thinking more creatively

35:38.190 --> 35:40.530
about, you know, the entire GDP

35:40.530 --> 35:44.730
and how that could be utilized to bring us to a common place

35:44.730 --> 35:46.620
where we all recognize and believe that,

35:46.620 --> 35:50.970
hey, it takes all of us to improve resilience and security

35:50.970 --> 35:52.470
across the entire nation.

35:52.470 --> 35:54.540
It should take all of the GDP

35:54.540 --> 35:57.870
as we think about how can we get to that solution

35:57.870 --> 36:01.320
that makes it more cyber safe for all of us.

36:01.320 --> 36:02.550
<v ->Yeah, I think you're right on point</v>

36:02.550 --> 36:06.030
when it comes to things like perhaps tax incentives

36:06.030 --> 36:09.180
or, you know, or insurance incentives.

36:09.180 --> 36:12.540
So those sort of the key ways to help manufacturers

36:12.540 --> 36:14.700
that are saying, we've got a product

36:14.700 --> 36:17.370
and we've already gotten the price as low as we can

36:17.370 --> 36:20.790
and it's still, we don't wanna be the ACME, you know,

36:20.790 --> 36:23.460
IOT device that takes down the US, right?

36:23.460 --> 36:24.540
No one wants that.

36:24.540 --> 36:27.630
But I do think that, to your point,

36:27.630 --> 36:28.797
we certainly have a large GDP

36:28.797 --> 36:30.420
and we should be able to figure that out.

36:30.420 --> 36:31.470
<v ->I think it's shortsighted</v>

36:31.470 --> 36:36.470
because, you know, a current incident cost

36:36.660 --> 36:39.870
100 billion dollars in market cap for one company.

36:39.870 --> 36:44.610
And I was a shareholder, so I know that 100 billion's gonna,

36:44.610 --> 36:47.373
I mean that's like real, real money.

36:48.210 --> 36:51.660
So I think there's gonna be more of that,

36:51.660 --> 36:53.850
you know, as these attack, as these different,

36:53.850 --> 36:57.630
you know, threats come into play so.

36:57.630 --> 37:01.170
<v ->Just to add, I think that it's the biggest question</v>

37:01.170 --> 37:03.570
of the young generation.

37:03.570 --> 37:05.670
I think that the young generation that was born

37:05.670 --> 37:10.670
to this interconnected world cannot be just like, you know,

37:11.280 --> 37:14.190
they don't have any knowledge about cybersecurity.

37:14.190 --> 37:17.100
It's not like when I was born, we didn't have computers.

37:17.100 --> 37:17.933
That's great.

37:17.933 --> 37:19.410
But now, like what?

37:19.410 --> 37:23.640
So I think this is the role of the next educational systems.

37:23.640 --> 37:27.060
And I think that the FCC is involved in that.

37:27.060 --> 37:28.827
And also, they're trying not to figure out

37:28.827 --> 37:31.410
how to make the, for example, the IoT Trust Mark

37:31.410 --> 37:35.010
more friendly for consumers to make them more incentivized,

37:35.010 --> 37:38.217
trying to convince my mom why she need to pay more, right?

37:38.217 --> 37:39.840
But this is the old generation.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.780
What about the new TikTok generation, right?

37:42.780 --> 37:44.820
It means something, this currency of data,

37:44.820 --> 37:47.280
it means something that, as we talked about before,

37:47.280 --> 37:50.340
we understand it because we are from it.

37:50.340 --> 37:53.040
But how I make sure that the next generation

37:53.040 --> 37:54.000
willing to pay for it

37:54.000 --> 37:55.917
because the understanding significant of that.

37:55.917 --> 37:58.830
And I think this is the biggest question

37:58.830 --> 38:03.830
that we need to touch it, like we need to find a solution.

38:04.320 --> 38:06.330
<v ->Yeah, I think, there one more question?</v>

38:06.330 --> 38:07.163
Yeah?
<v ->Yeah.</v>

38:07.163 --> 38:10.590
So really loving that, you know,

38:10.590 --> 38:13.350
fantastic point for you Michelle.

38:13.350 --> 38:16.740
Perhaps a question to the audience, to the panelists,

38:16.740 --> 38:18.630
building on that, and we love your perspective

38:18.630 --> 38:20.013
as well on this, Michelle,

38:21.000 --> 38:23.310
we talked about perhaps consumer salience,

38:23.310 --> 38:24.390
consumer awareness.

38:24.390 --> 38:26.250
Great, we're working at maybe not enough,

38:26.250 --> 38:28.960
but what we have seen is fellow procurement

38:29.820 --> 38:31.590
and we've seen fellow procurement

38:31.590 --> 38:33.870
potentially prioritizing the trust mark, right?

38:33.870 --> 38:36.690
There's been some reporting on that coming in soon.

38:36.690 --> 38:39.210
We've seen fellow procurement prioritizing security

38:39.210 --> 38:40.080
based on measures.

38:40.080 --> 38:42.990
That's the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act.

38:42.990 --> 38:45.870
I heard from you maybe the states

38:45.870 --> 38:48.450
and cities can take that approach.

38:48.450 --> 38:51.240
So we'd love to hear more all, you know,

38:51.240 --> 38:53.520
audio your perspective on this.

38:53.520 --> 38:56.190
Should we have state and local officials

38:56.190 --> 38:58.440
using their procurement authority, right,

38:58.440 --> 39:01.440
to incentivize those manufacturers of IoT

39:01.440 --> 39:03.750
who are putting the secure by design culture in.

39:03.750 --> 39:05.503
What do you think?

39:05.503 --> 39:08.280
<v ->I think it's important, significant, obviously,</v>

39:08.280 --> 39:12.000
and also this is exactly the point,

39:12.000 --> 39:14.513
If it'll make smart cities smart enough on cybersecurity

39:14.513 --> 39:16.590
or not, because we can all agree it depends

39:16.590 --> 39:18.060
on which state local it'll be

39:18.060 --> 39:20.670
and who will be deleting authority, right,

39:20.670 --> 39:23.070
and which who, what you will incentivize.

39:23.070 --> 39:25.470
and if cybersecurity even will be something

39:25.470 --> 39:26.340
that you think about

39:26.340 --> 39:28.340
when you're thinking about smart cities.

39:29.190 --> 39:30.750
So exactly to your point.

39:30.750 --> 39:32.520
And I think that this gap

39:32.520 --> 39:34.170
that we see not only in smart cities

39:34.170 --> 39:37.980
but in so many different elements of security

39:37.980 --> 39:40.920
or national security, we need to mitigate the gap

39:40.920 --> 39:44.640
between the federal and the federal perspective

39:44.640 --> 39:46.350
and the local government.

39:46.350 --> 39:48.600
And we need to see how we can make sure

39:48.600 --> 39:50.310
that the same security baseline,

39:50.310 --> 39:53.430
exactly the point that we just talked about,

39:53.430 --> 39:56.820
how there is a threshold that is we can make sure

39:56.820 --> 39:59.940
that the foundation is equal to every state,

39:59.940 --> 40:03.480
<v Veronica>Right, and that's definitely a challenge,</v>

40:03.480 --> 40:06.870
I'd say, in some of my time working with the states.

40:06.870 --> 40:07.860
And we have 30 seconds,

40:07.860 --> 40:09.510
so make that a quick question for me.

40:09.510 --> 40:11.790
<v Participant>Yeah, you talked a lot about cyber attacks,</v>

40:11.790 --> 40:14.340
how to protect the critical infrastructure.

40:14.340 --> 40:16.860
So when we had some windstorms to Texas,

40:16.860 --> 40:20.370
cable was cut.

40:20.370 --> 40:22.677
<v ->Yeah, yeah, no that's 100% right.</v>

40:22.677 --> 40:26.070
And as we think about cyber security,

40:26.070 --> 40:28.260
we think about the actual nexus

40:28.260 --> 40:30.247
between physical security and cybersecurity.

40:30.247 --> 40:33.210
You know, so physical challenges

40:33.210 --> 40:35.640
that were experienced in Texas a few years ago

40:35.640 --> 40:37.230
and that ice storm, you know,

40:37.230 --> 40:40.080
when power was lost was, it was a fuels problem.

40:40.080 --> 40:42.450
You know, there was some decisions made on fuels

40:42.450 --> 40:45.090
and, you know, they've since recognized

40:45.090 --> 40:47.220
that the temperatures could be sub-zero

40:47.220 --> 40:49.800
and it's a problem the way they're doing fuels then.

40:49.800 --> 40:51.330
So, you know, they've started to correct that,

40:51.330 --> 40:54.660
but that's kind of thinking all across the nation

40:54.660 --> 40:57.720
and recognizing and understanding physical threats

40:57.720 --> 41:00.720
and how those physical threats can also impact

41:00.720 --> 41:03.540
the security on the cyber side of our systems

41:03.540 --> 41:06.090
that are more and more IP connected.

41:06.090 --> 41:07.740
<v ->Well we are now out of time,</v>

41:07.740 --> 41:09.887
so I wanna thank my panelists for joining me.

41:09.887 --> 41:11.490
It was a great conversation.

41:11.490 --> 41:12.660
I can't believe it went so fast.

41:12.660 --> 41:15.090
So thank you very much for attending today.

41:15.090 --> 41:16.788
We really appreciate it.

41:16.788 --> 41:21.788
