00:00.171 --> 00:02.754
(upbeat music)

00:10.680 --> 00:14.070
<v Daniel>Hello everyone, and welcome back from lunch.</v>

00:14.070 --> 00:16.260
We've got a great panel here, and today,

00:16.260 --> 00:18.720
we're gonna be talking about energy management

00:18.720 --> 00:19.923
and the demand for that.

00:22.410 --> 00:25.080
And I'd like to start off by thanking our sponsors again

00:25.080 --> 00:26.100
for your generous support.

00:26.100 --> 00:28.893
We couldn't put on a summit like this without you.

00:30.111 --> 00:32.160
For today, we're gonna be talking a lot

00:32.160 --> 00:35.250
about energy management highlighted by Schneider Electric,

00:35.250 --> 00:37.170
and we're talking about the demand

00:37.170 --> 00:38.400
for energy management home.

00:38.400 --> 00:39.900
Afterwards, we'll have a networking break,

00:39.900 --> 00:41.430
and then we'll talk about multifamily

00:41.430 --> 00:42.730
with my colleague Kristen.

00:45.180 --> 00:46.350
So to start off with,

00:46.350 --> 00:49.500
I wanna talk about the great energy squeeze.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.870
American consumers have been used

00:51.870 --> 00:53.010
to lower electricity rates

00:53.010 --> 00:55.020
than the rest of the world for many years.

00:55.020 --> 00:56.700
But over the last five years,

00:56.700 --> 00:58.950
we've started to see an increase in energy.

00:58.950 --> 01:02.520
So much so that two thirds of internet households

01:02.520 --> 01:06.330
in our data say that their costs are too high,

01:06.330 --> 01:09.660
and no one, not even the wealthy, are exempt from this.

01:09.660 --> 01:13.380
Only 12% say that costs are not enough

01:13.380 --> 01:15.000
to make them concerned.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.780
And one third are actively working to reduce their,

01:18.780 --> 01:21.390
or want to reduce their energy consumption at home,

01:21.390 --> 01:22.413
but don't know how.

01:25.290 --> 01:28.560
And we think that devices are a good way

01:28.560 --> 01:30.480
for people to manage their energy.

01:30.480 --> 01:32.640
We're starting to see the possibility

01:32.640 --> 01:34.290
of different energy management devices

01:34.290 --> 01:37.680
that can be set to work together

01:37.680 --> 01:42.180
and be turned back to save energy when costs are too high.

01:42.180 --> 01:44.920
And we have asked in our research

01:45.870 --> 01:48.510
whether people have integrations

01:48.510 --> 01:51.270
with their smart devices into routines.

01:51.270 --> 01:53.520
40% say that they do.

01:53.520 --> 01:55.680
And we find that energy management

01:55.680 --> 01:58.680
is the primary routine type

01:58.680 --> 02:00.780
that they are looking to set up.

02:00.780 --> 02:03.540
29% say that they are looking at saving energy

02:03.540 --> 02:04.890
through their routines.

02:04.890 --> 02:06.420
Now one thing that's important to note is

02:06.420 --> 02:09.810
that one key energy saving device, smart thermostats,

02:09.810 --> 02:12.360
is only at 16% adoption today.

02:12.360 --> 02:14.730
So there's definitely a lot more that the industry needs

02:14.730 --> 02:17.700
to do to create adoption in those areas

02:17.700 --> 02:21.060
so that you can have things like demand response programs

02:21.060 --> 02:23.760
that can interact with that and save energy

02:23.760 --> 02:26.733
and also reduce the strain on the grid.

02:27.750 --> 02:29.790
So to talk more about this,

02:29.790 --> 02:31.410
we have my great panel here

02:31.410 --> 02:32.837
that's gonna be talking

02:32.837 --> 02:34.649
about innovations in energy management,

02:34.649 --> 02:39.649
the adoption is actually needed, and what's out there today.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.120
And we're gonna talk also about partnerships

02:42.120 --> 02:44.550
and ecosystem players.

02:44.550 --> 02:46.530
Is it important to partner with people?

02:46.530 --> 02:47.850
Who do you partner with?

02:47.850 --> 02:49.350
Exactly what is the process,

02:49.350 --> 02:51.120
and how do you split the profits?

02:51.120 --> 02:54.060
And then future directions in smart energy,

02:54.060 --> 02:55.890
what's hot, what's coming up,

02:55.890 --> 02:58.683
what should be on our radar for the future.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.160
So I have a great panel here

03:02.160 --> 03:06.240
with representatives from Duke Energy, Shelly, NRG,

03:06.240 --> 03:08.430
Schneider Electric, Resideo,

03:08.430 --> 03:10.680
and of course myself, Parks Associates.

03:10.680 --> 03:13.230
And we'll be talking a lot about energy management

03:13.230 --> 03:14.700
in the home today.

03:14.700 --> 03:15.533
To start off with,

03:15.533 --> 03:17.760
I wanted to have Lon introduce himself,

03:17.760 --> 03:21.780
tell us a little bit about you and what you do at Duke.

03:21.780 --> 03:23.010
<v Lon>Great, well thanks for having me.</v>

03:23.010 --> 03:25.140
And just briefly, Lon Huber,

03:25.140 --> 03:27.870
I lead up a lot of our customer solutions.

03:27.870 --> 03:31.110
So think all the pricing that a customer sees,

03:31.110 --> 03:32.400
the time of use rates,

03:32.400 --> 03:35.790
or TOU as you might hear on this panel,

03:35.790 --> 03:37.110
all of our economic development.

03:37.110 --> 03:40.260
So that's the data centers as well coming in

03:40.260 --> 03:42.690
as well as manufacturing our wholesale business,

03:42.690 --> 03:44.940
regulatory enablement, customer load analytics.

03:44.940 --> 03:47.130
So a lot of the fun things

03:47.130 --> 03:49.800
and the key is figuring out how to orchestrate it all

03:49.800 --> 03:51.630
so that we drive value for customers

03:51.630 --> 03:54.183
and try to keep their bills as low as possible.

03:55.800 --> 03:56.633
<v Daniel>Great.</v>

03:56.633 --> 03:59.730
And now Wolfgang, go ahead and introduce yourself.

03:59.730 --> 04:00.900
<v Wolfgang>Yeah, I'm Wolfgang Kirsch,</v>

04:00.900 --> 04:03.540
I'm the CEO of Shelly Group.

04:03.540 --> 04:06.210
Shelly is producing smart home devices

04:06.210 --> 04:09.630
with a strong focus on energy monitoring, energy saving.

04:09.630 --> 04:10.950
We are well known in Europe.

04:10.950 --> 04:13.680
We are still at the beginning in the United States,

04:13.680 --> 04:16.080
growing 40, 50% every year.

04:16.080 --> 04:18.870
A French journalist a week ago or two weeks ago said

04:18.870 --> 04:21.750
we will be a mini Schneider in the future,

04:21.750 --> 04:25.170
so looking to my left, and that's a great honor for us.

04:25.170 --> 04:26.020
Happy to be here.

04:27.930 --> 04:28.763
<v Daniel>Great.</v>

04:28.763 --> 04:31.140
And now Meghan, go ahead and introduce yourself.

04:31.140 --> 04:35.190
<v Meghan>Hello, Meghan McConomy. I am with NRG.</v>

04:35.190 --> 04:37.530
I lead the brand strategy

04:37.530 --> 04:39.810
for the consumer organization.

04:39.810 --> 04:43.230
And so that is our smart home brand, Vivint,

04:43.230 --> 04:46.050
but also working with our energy brands

04:46.050 --> 04:47.430
in competitive market.

04:47.430 --> 04:49.773
So that's gonna be in Texas in the east.

04:50.670 --> 04:54.480
My 12 years at NRG, I've had a number of different roles,

04:54.480 --> 04:56.310
really focused on energy management,

04:56.310 --> 04:58.020
so looking forward to this discussion.

04:58.020 --> 04:59.070
Thanks for having me.

05:00.720 --> 05:03.390
<v Daniel>And Poonam, go ahead and introduce yourself.</v>

05:03.390 --> 05:06.450
<v Poonam>Good afternoon everyone, I'm Poonam Narang,</v>

05:06.450 --> 05:10.350
and I lead the product management team at Schneider Electric

05:10.350 --> 05:12.963
for the residential segment in North America.

05:14.190 --> 05:17.280
And my focus is really all things residential

05:17.280 --> 05:19.960
from breakers to enclosures to panels

05:21.150 --> 05:24.360
across what exists today as well as

05:24.360 --> 05:29.360
how the industry is evolving into newer equipment

05:29.606 --> 05:31.383
as well as energy management.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.310
<v Daniel>Great. And now Michael.</v>

05:35.310 --> 05:37.020
<v Michael>All right, Michael Siemann,</v>

05:37.020 --> 05:39.780
I lead our Energy Sciences Team at Resideo

05:39.780 --> 05:41.550
as well as direct to technical efforts

05:41.550 --> 05:43.140
of our Grid Services Team.

05:43.140 --> 05:45.480
The Grid Services Team has been developing

05:45.480 --> 05:47.670
demand response and virtual power plant programs

05:47.670 --> 05:49.440
for over the last decade.

05:49.440 --> 05:52.200
And I'm gonna bring like an experience

05:52.200 --> 05:53.820
where I have both

05:53.820 --> 05:56.760
helping develop the energy management features

05:56.760 --> 05:59.340
that of customers use to help

05:59.340 --> 06:01.920
reduce their energy bills as well as

06:01.920 --> 06:03.810
managing those fleets of virtual power plants

06:03.810 --> 06:06.030
for utilities and energy markets.

06:06.030 --> 06:07.260
<v ->Great.</v>

06:07.260 --> 06:09.780
All right, well thank you so much to my panel

06:09.780 --> 06:10.860
for introducing themselves.

06:10.860 --> 06:14.520
I wanted to go ahead and start with the first question.

06:14.520 --> 06:16.650
We want to talk a lot about

06:16.650 --> 06:21.450
what the role is in energy management platforms,

06:21.450 --> 06:23.370
what tech is currently being used

06:23.370 --> 06:26.070
and how complicated the integrations are.

06:26.070 --> 06:29.850
So I'd like to direct that question to you first, Michael.

06:29.850 --> 06:32.760
<v ->All right, so energy management today</v>

06:32.760 --> 06:36.150
has kind of shifted from being traditionally about

06:36.150 --> 06:39.630
just energy reduction to a point now

06:39.630 --> 06:41.820
where it's about how do you shift energy,

06:41.820 --> 06:43.800
the energy usage at different times.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.980
So either driven by a time of use rate that you might have

06:46.980 --> 06:50.280
for electricity or part of a demand response,

06:50.280 --> 06:52.110
virtual power plant program,

06:52.110 --> 06:54.330
moving energy from the peak hours

06:54.330 --> 06:56.280
to off peak hours helps reduce strain

06:56.280 --> 06:57.810
on the electricity grid.

06:57.810 --> 07:02.810
And us at CES here, we know that customer's expecting them

07:02.940 --> 07:06.510
to do all this stuff on their own, take action.

07:06.510 --> 07:07.800
It's not realistic.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.170
So we're kind of challenged as

07:10.170 --> 07:13.140
technology providers to be able to automate,

07:13.140 --> 07:15.300
to put intelligence into these products

07:15.300 --> 07:17.220
so that way it gets it into the right position,

07:17.220 --> 07:20.221
and joining platforms is how to do that.

07:20.221 --> 07:22.290
Smart thermostats are the gateway

07:22.290 --> 07:25.110
kind of energy management product for customers.

07:25.110 --> 07:27.930
I mean there's tens of millions of them out there,

07:27.930 --> 07:30.993
as you said that 16% of them,

07:33.600 --> 07:35.040
that's the number that have been connected.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.120
So there's a lot of opportunities

07:36.120 --> 07:38.580
to get traditional thermostats connected.

07:38.580 --> 07:42.090
But yeah, what we see is having

07:42.090 --> 07:45.480
this controllable load available for utilities,

07:45.480 --> 07:47.190
customers are able to take control

07:47.190 --> 07:49.170
of their energy management ,

07:49.170 --> 07:51.930
control their bills and get to a position where

07:51.930 --> 07:53.160
they're helping out their community

07:53.160 --> 07:56.400
and able to provide multiple value for everyone involved.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.480
<v ->Yeah, yeah, that's great.</v>

07:57.480 --> 07:58.890
And definitely, like I said,

07:58.890 --> 08:02.370
our data does show that a significant amount

08:02.370 --> 08:05.400
of consumers do want to be able to manage their energy,

08:05.400 --> 08:06.660
but they just don't know how.

08:06.660 --> 08:09.780
And I don't think that we have enough marketing around that

08:09.780 --> 08:13.200
and exactly enough education for consumers.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.127
But I do know that

08:14.127 --> 08:15.810
it's a little bit different in Europe,

08:15.810 --> 08:17.100
and I don't know if you could talk a little bit

08:17.100 --> 08:19.113
about that, Wolfgang.

08:19.113 --> 08:20.970
<v ->Yes, in Europe,</v>

08:20.970 --> 08:23.820
energy prices are much higher than they are in the US.

08:23.820 --> 08:26.430
I personally paid 45 euro cents last year

08:26.430 --> 08:30.750
for my energy per kilowatt hour, which is quite expensive.

08:30.750 --> 08:35.100
And then customers automatically start to check

08:35.100 --> 08:37.170
where are they consuming their energy,

08:37.170 --> 08:38.580
how much are they consuming?

08:38.580 --> 08:41.130
And especially with our products quite affordable,

08:41.130 --> 08:43.350
they usually start with one or two devices

08:43.350 --> 08:46.170
with a central energy meter.

08:46.170 --> 08:48.090
They find out how much their apartment

08:48.090 --> 08:50.730
or their house is consuming when they're not at home,

08:50.730 --> 08:53.820
they start to ask themselves, where's this coming from?

08:53.820 --> 08:56.700
They put simple devices behind a wall switch

08:56.700 --> 09:00.150
or a plug in between to figure out what is the next step,

09:00.150 --> 09:01.500
and this is how it started.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.510
And that took off two years ago

09:03.510 --> 09:05.610
with the high energy prices like crazy.

09:05.610 --> 09:08.520
And now what we see is a boom of solar systems,

09:08.520 --> 09:10.470
especially popular in Germany

09:10.470 --> 09:13.110
and in other countries are very small systems

09:13.110 --> 09:14.490
that people put on their balcony,

09:14.490 --> 09:16.510
so-called balcony power stations

09:18.007 --> 09:20.040
that just deliver a small proportion of the energy

09:20.040 --> 09:23.490
that they need and the big systems of course as well.

09:23.490 --> 09:27.750
And then they as well start to use the energy

09:27.750 --> 09:28.583
that they have,

09:28.583 --> 09:30.180
find out now the batteries are full,

09:30.180 --> 09:32.340
what can I do with the excess of energy.

09:32.340 --> 09:34.890
Now I switch on my air condition, now I charge my car.

09:34.890 --> 09:38.280
That's similar to the US, but the attention is much higher,

09:38.280 --> 09:40.380
and it needs less education

09:40.380 --> 09:41.820
because they start to ask question

09:41.820 --> 09:43.590
because simply it hurts,

09:43.590 --> 09:45.930
45 euro cent hurts, now it's a bit down.

09:45.930 --> 09:48.450
And immediately we feel that

09:48.450 --> 09:51.069
as well the attention goes a little bit down,

09:51.069 --> 09:53.790
but it has as well to do with how much do I have to pay

09:53.790 --> 09:57.300
for such a system and how fast is the amortization time

09:57.300 --> 09:58.350
with these low prices?

09:58.350 --> 10:00.390
And that's something that really helps,

10:00.390 --> 10:03.450
and I think that that it has to hurt

10:03.450 --> 10:06.540
to a certain degree if we wanna change our habits.

10:06.540 --> 10:09.360
<v ->Yeah, I think that that's instrumental in the fact</v>

10:09.360 --> 10:11.370
that the European market has really adopted

10:11.370 --> 10:12.720
a lot of energy technology

10:12.720 --> 10:15.620
ahead of like the US market, even now,

10:15.620 --> 10:17.490
like I saw recently Homey had some release

10:17.490 --> 10:20.220
for energy monitoring that's really compatible

10:20.220 --> 10:21.630
with European devices,

10:21.630 --> 10:22.920
and I was thinking it'd be great

10:22.920 --> 10:24.300
to have that here in the US too.

10:24.300 --> 10:25.440
I think we'll get there eventually,

10:25.440 --> 10:29.940
but yeah, so I wanted to get also a sense of like,

10:29.940 --> 10:32.247
from Meghan, what do you think the benefits are

10:32.247 --> 10:34.440
for consumers, utility companies,

10:34.440 --> 10:36.450
and technology providers?

10:36.450 --> 10:39.003
<v ->So from a consumer perspective,</v>

10:40.020 --> 10:42.870
part of the approach we do at NRG

10:42.870 --> 10:44.940
but in the competitive market specifically

10:44.940 --> 10:47.760
because it's such a a competitive market,

10:47.760 --> 10:50.640
lots of competitors we need to differentiate is really

10:50.640 --> 10:51.810
talk to consumers.

10:51.810 --> 10:53.580
What do they want, what do they want

10:53.580 --> 10:58.050
out of these energy management companies and offerings?

10:58.050 --> 11:00.300
And like Daniel said,

11:00.300 --> 11:02.940
savings obviously rises to the top,

11:02.940 --> 11:05.610
but another benefit is really around convenience.

11:05.610 --> 11:09.480
And so Michael talked about time of use plans specifically,

11:09.480 --> 11:12.270
and what we learned was you can talk about time of use

11:12.270 --> 11:15.720
and you can talk about shifting energy to consumers,

11:15.720 --> 11:17.610
but they don't really know what that means

11:17.610 --> 11:19.530
and it's not convenient for them.

11:19.530 --> 11:22.050
And so what we did is we developed products

11:22.050 --> 11:23.280
that were easy to understand,

11:23.280 --> 11:26.850
this was years ago, like free weekends or free nights,

11:26.850 --> 11:29.340
these are time of use products

11:29.340 --> 11:32.640
that customers can really understand

11:32.640 --> 11:34.770
and take action around to save money.

11:34.770 --> 11:39.180
So that was a way to really marry savings and convenience.

11:39.180 --> 11:41.430
Another offering that we've got

11:41.430 --> 11:44.550
that we just started piloting was really getting

11:44.550 --> 11:46.830
some of that technology into the home

11:46.830 --> 11:48.990
to make it easy for consumers to save.

11:48.990 --> 11:52.230
So installing thermostats for free,

11:52.230 --> 11:54.270
but also including doorbell cameras,

11:54.270 --> 11:56.700
and so bundling that for energy customers.

11:56.700 --> 11:58.830
And we've started to see some traction there,

11:58.830 --> 12:00.840
and we're excited about kind of

12:00.840 --> 12:03.030
how that adoption is really starting

12:03.030 --> 12:05.520
to move forward as a result.

12:05.520 --> 12:06.630
<v ->Yeah, yeah, that's very great.</v>

12:06.630 --> 12:09.090
It's like the bundling thing is very interesting too,

12:09.090 --> 12:12.270
because that does create a bit more value for the consumers

12:12.270 --> 12:13.683
and helps get them on board.

12:14.940 --> 12:17.700
So I wanted to talk to Lon about like

12:17.700 --> 12:20.160
providing sort of examples of some of these short-term

12:20.160 --> 12:21.900
and long-term energy savings achieved

12:21.900 --> 12:25.023
through a home energy management system.

12:26.539 --> 12:27.690
<v ->Well it gets into the patchwork</v>

12:27.690 --> 12:29.100
of the electricity sector,

12:29.100 --> 12:31.500
which is a very complicated industry,

12:31.500 --> 12:35.600
needs a translation to the end consumer

12:35.600 --> 12:37.083
in a lot of different ways.

12:37.980 --> 12:41.310
But you heard about competitive markets,

12:41.310 --> 12:46.080
there's regulated markets, there's public, there's co-ops,

12:46.080 --> 12:50.283
sometimes a state will have a mix of all four within it.

12:51.535 --> 12:55.080
And so each of those models presents different types

12:55.080 --> 12:57.900
of value propositions to the customer.

12:57.900 --> 13:02.460
So maybe at the front end you could see an upfront incentive

13:02.460 --> 13:07.460
if the customer buys a device or enrolls a device.

13:08.310 --> 13:12.600
So that's upfront, maybe it's a bill credit

13:12.600 --> 13:14.130
or another way to do it.

13:14.130 --> 13:15.960
And then there's longer term savings

13:15.960 --> 13:18.930
where maybe it's the rate optimization,

13:18.930 --> 13:22.230
so time of use rate optimization with that device

13:22.230 --> 13:24.990
and then ongoing credits for enrollment,

13:24.990 --> 13:28.890
or it's a aggregation of customer resources

13:28.890 --> 13:31.920
and it pulls some revenue in from the wholesale market,

13:31.920 --> 13:35.880
which is more similar to a European style transaction.

13:35.880 --> 13:39.010
So there's all different ways that these value streams

13:40.260 --> 13:41.250
can reach consumer,

13:41.250 --> 13:43.470
and then to make matters even more complicated,

13:43.470 --> 13:45.270
it also depends on what portion

13:45.270 --> 13:47.730
of the grid you're providing value to.

13:47.730 --> 13:49.980
So if you're providing value to power plants

13:49.980 --> 13:52.290
that are centralized versus the wires

13:52.290 --> 13:53.850
that are in your neighborhood,

13:53.850 --> 13:55.920
those are two different systems

13:55.920 --> 13:57.840
and two different types of value streams

13:57.840 --> 14:00.330
that you can get from them.

14:00.330 --> 14:03.480
And so you could see in some markets you get a program

14:03.480 --> 14:07.290
for the wires and you get another program for the generator

14:07.290 --> 14:09.450
and how those interface could be different.

14:09.450 --> 14:11.850
So not to make it overly complex,

14:11.850 --> 14:14.760
but there's a variety of different value streams.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.590
Some are upfront, some are ongoing,

14:16.590 --> 14:18.543
some are fixed, some are variable.

14:19.500 --> 14:20.940
<v ->Yeah. Thank you for that, Lon.</v>

14:20.940 --> 14:22.590
Yeah, I think it's really interesting too that

14:22.590 --> 14:24.510
with like the bill credit,

14:24.510 --> 14:29.280
our research finds that incentives are an appealing reason

14:29.280 --> 14:31.830
for like demand response participation,

14:31.830 --> 14:34.920
and that for 80%, it's appealing to have a bill credit.

14:34.920 --> 14:38.070
So it's really important to have an incentive

14:38.070 --> 14:41.010
that really brings that home for consumers,

14:41.010 --> 14:43.650
but it does have to be enough for consumers to participate

14:43.650 --> 14:47.070
and get over the hump of not wanting

14:47.070 --> 14:49.503
to lose control of their devices.

14:51.360 --> 14:55.020
So I wanted to ask for Poonam,

14:55.020 --> 14:58.180
do you think that these are only for new homes

14:59.239 --> 15:01.860
or were there requirements for the investments

15:01.860 --> 15:03.873
especially like for like retrofits?

15:05.055 --> 15:08.890
<v ->Yeah, so at the end of the day today when we look at</v>

15:10.864 --> 15:15.864
the demand for energy within the utilities,

15:16.080 --> 15:18.870
that demand for energy has increased significantly

15:18.870 --> 15:20.430
over the last two years.

15:20.430 --> 15:25.080
And so while homes contribute towards 20%

15:25.080 --> 15:26.670
of the greenhouse gas,

15:26.670 --> 15:30.600
the energy prices have been continuously increasing.

15:30.600 --> 15:34.980
And so for us to really accelerate the energy transition,

15:34.980 --> 15:38.370
it's important that we look at the homes

15:38.370 --> 15:42.450
that are already built versus only new builds, right?

15:42.450 --> 15:45.360
We have almost 80% of the homes today

15:45.360 --> 15:47.520
that are built before 1980.

15:47.520 --> 15:50.700
We have 40 million homes today

15:50.700 --> 15:54.690
that are having electrical infrastructure in the homes

15:54.690 --> 15:56.890
that are not necessarily ready

15:59.585 --> 16:01.350
to consume more of the electrification, right?

16:01.350 --> 16:05.670
So adding EVs, adding heat pumps, so on and so forth.

16:05.670 --> 16:07.410
And so it's important

16:07.410 --> 16:12.030
and almost a responsibility for us as technology providers

16:12.030 --> 16:15.480
to be able to support the upgrade

16:15.480 --> 16:17.880
of the infrastructure within the home

16:17.880 --> 16:20.880
to enable for this greater electrification.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.283
And so no it can be new builds only,

16:24.810 --> 16:27.450
it needs to include and incorporate the retrofits.

16:27.450 --> 16:30.330
And now from a consumer perspective,

16:30.330 --> 16:33.210
it's almost like I need to know before I can do something.

16:33.210 --> 16:35.760
And we are seeing that a large part

16:35.760 --> 16:37.710
of the consumers in our surveys,

16:37.710 --> 16:41.070
you've seen more than 50% of the consumers,

16:41.070 --> 16:46.000
they want to know how much energy is being consumed

16:48.282 --> 16:50.220
by the various loads within their homes.

16:50.220 --> 16:53.940
And you can only control if you know, so once you know,

16:53.940 --> 16:55.440
that's step one, you got to be able

16:55.440 --> 16:59.700
to measure the energy consumption within your home.

16:59.700 --> 17:03.093
And Schneider's energy monitor enables you to do that.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.650
Now in terms of really upgrading the infrastructure,

17:07.650 --> 17:09.930
it's not necessarily an all or nothing, right?

17:09.930 --> 17:12.240
It can be incremental starting

17:12.240 --> 17:15.510
with something like an energy monitor,

17:15.510 --> 17:19.560
and then incrementing from there maybe a smart technology

17:19.560 --> 17:21.300
inside the panel to enable you

17:21.300 --> 17:24.060
to control the loads within the home itself.

17:24.060 --> 17:25.680
Now from a price point really

17:25.680 --> 17:29.130
that varies depending on the type of infrastructure

17:29.130 --> 17:31.380
that you've already got in the home

17:31.380 --> 17:33.690
and the type of load that you want to add,

17:33.690 --> 17:35.643
whether it be an EV, EV charger,

17:37.650 --> 17:41.853
or whether it be a heat pump or a HVAC,

17:43.032 --> 17:46.080
it really depends on the type of load you wanna add.

17:46.080 --> 17:50.040
But it can be anywhere from 400 to upwards of $3,000.

17:50.040 --> 17:53.220
But then there are tons of incentives as well that

17:53.220 --> 17:54.570
the utilities are providing

17:54.570 --> 17:56.733
for more electrification in the homes.

17:57.570 --> 17:58.920
<v ->Yeah, very interesting.</v>

17:58.920 --> 18:01.770
When it comes to installing in these homes too,

18:01.770 --> 18:05.100
I wonder if it's more DIY versus pro,

18:05.100 --> 18:08.340
if there's sort of any thoughts on that?

18:08.340 --> 18:10.120
I don't know if Wolfgang, you could speak to that.

18:10.120 --> 18:11.820
<v ->Yeah, of course.</v>

18:11.820 --> 18:14.820
We are doing 70 to 80%

18:14.820 --> 18:17.910
of our revenue with do it yourself customers.

18:17.910 --> 18:21.480
So they are able to install the solution very easy at home.

18:21.480 --> 18:25.410
Everyone who can change a power socket in the wall,

18:25.410 --> 18:28.770
buys that in a Home Depot can install Shelly.

18:28.770 --> 18:30.070
So that's a big advantage.

18:30.930 --> 18:33.150
And as well, coming back to the infrastructure,

18:33.150 --> 18:34.980
I think in Europe in most of the countries,

18:34.980 --> 18:37.140
the infrastructure is okay,

18:37.140 --> 18:39.930
but if you wanna install a central system

18:39.930 --> 18:42.510
for energy monitoring per device and per room,

18:42.510 --> 18:44.130
you need new wiring.

18:44.130 --> 18:45.180
With our devices,

18:45.180 --> 18:47.280
and that's what most customers really love,

18:47.280 --> 18:48.900
you don't need new wiring at all.

18:48.900 --> 18:53.460
You can do this room by room, switch by switch,

18:53.460 --> 18:55.890
the functionality of the device stays exactly the same.

18:55.890 --> 18:57.510
And that's what customers really love.

18:57.510 --> 18:58.530
We know from our data

18:58.530 --> 19:01.230
that a typical average Shelly customer starts

19:01.230 --> 19:05.010
with two devices and then adds two devices per year,

19:05.010 --> 19:06.450
which is very slow,

19:06.450 --> 19:09.750
but step by step they are making their homes smart

19:09.750 --> 19:10.890
and monitor the energy

19:10.890 --> 19:12.990
because we saw, as I already said,

19:12.990 --> 19:15.060
we saw with the increase of the energy prices,

19:15.060 --> 19:17.640
we saw a move from the same device

19:17.640 --> 19:20.340
that is not monitoring the energy to the device

19:20.340 --> 19:22.110
that is monitoring the energy, it's the same device,

19:22.110 --> 19:23.880
just one euro more expensive.

19:23.880 --> 19:26.850
It's almost 100% now with energy monitoring,

19:26.850 --> 19:29.280
the others are more or less gone,

19:29.280 --> 19:31.560
easy to install, relatively cheap.

19:31.560 --> 19:35.400
And with our devices for a couple of hundred euros,

19:35.400 --> 19:38.970
you make your whole home smart, including everything,

19:38.970 --> 19:40.530
can go up to a couple of thousand

19:40.530 --> 19:42.480
if you have a big villa or whatever.

19:42.480 --> 19:45.060
But most of the buildings are old.

19:45.060 --> 19:48.150
So the the new constructions are not that much,

19:48.150 --> 19:50.970
and that's a solution that customers really appreciate,

19:50.970 --> 19:53.700
and they have the full cost control as well

19:53.700 --> 19:57.030
doing this step by step and doing this on their own.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.350
<v ->Yeah, yeah, very good.</v>

19:58.350 --> 20:01.800
And of course whether we're talking about pro or DIY,

20:01.800 --> 20:05.100
one of the things we have to consider too is that

20:05.100 --> 20:06.810
the stakeholders involved in this,

20:06.810 --> 20:08.010
like on the stage for example,

20:08.010 --> 20:11.940
we have both utilities and device manufacturers represented.

20:11.940 --> 20:13.800
And so I wanna talk a little bit about like partnerships

20:13.800 --> 20:17.790
and ecosystem players, partnerships necessary,

20:17.790 --> 20:21.843
and what are the best partnerships to have?

20:22.890 --> 20:25.470
Poonam, I'd like you to address that if you could.

20:25.470 --> 20:27.420
<v ->Yeah, I think that's a great question</v>

20:27.420 --> 20:30.030
and we had great panels this morning

20:30.030 --> 20:32.430
by the way for those of you that had attended,

20:32.430 --> 20:34.890
I think this was also touched on in the morning

20:34.890 --> 20:39.890
that at the end of the day for the amount power

20:40.800 --> 20:44.430
that we need with the growth in demand,

20:44.430 --> 20:48.060
the energy transition needs to be accelerated.

20:48.060 --> 20:53.060
And if we try to do this as technologists all by ourselves,

20:53.670 --> 20:55.470
this is a slow process.

20:55.470 --> 20:59.520
So it is extremely important that as an industry,

20:59.520 --> 21:01.920
we work together collaboratively

21:01.920 --> 21:04.410
to drive this forward in an accelerated manner.

21:04.410 --> 21:07.110
And so partnerships are absolutely important.

21:07.110 --> 21:09.600
From a Schneider Electric perspective,

21:09.600 --> 21:12.030
we've got various types of partnerships, right?

21:12.030 --> 21:15.990
So we co-develop with partners.

21:15.990 --> 21:18.960
We also have partners we have invested in

21:18.960 --> 21:21.903
like Qmerit, Energy Sage, Applied,

21:22.980 --> 21:26.940
and they kind of touch across various parts

21:26.940 --> 21:28.023
of the value chain.

21:29.100 --> 21:32.010
And then we've also partnered with builders, right?

21:32.010 --> 21:34.857
So we've got an installation with

21:34.857 --> 21:38.070
and a strategic partnership with KB Homes,

21:38.070 --> 21:42.330
one of the large US builders where in California,

21:42.330 --> 21:47.330
we've installed KB Home partnered with Schneider Electric

21:47.910 --> 21:52.260
with Southern California as well as

21:52.260 --> 21:54.510
with University of California

21:54.510 --> 21:59.510
to drive energy-efficient homes, 200 homes in California.

22:01.620 --> 22:04.620
And this is with solar in each home

22:04.620 --> 22:09.270
with batteries in each home as well as a microgrid

22:09.270 --> 22:11.790
with a community battery.

22:11.790 --> 22:16.170
And they saw almost 40% reduction

22:16.170 --> 22:17.793
in energy consumption.

22:18.840 --> 22:23.840
They have cumulatively, for the homeowners,

22:24.210 --> 22:26.880
saved more than 800 million

22:26.880 --> 22:30.690
in revenue coming from energy savings,

22:30.690 --> 22:32.820
and from a CO2 reduction perspective,

22:32.820 --> 22:37.560
it's almost equal to 606,000 gas powered cars.

22:37.560 --> 22:40.770
So together as an industry, when we work together,

22:40.770 --> 22:42.990
we can make truly a large impact,

22:42.990 --> 22:45.723
both for the consumer as well as for the planet.

22:46.620 --> 22:48.488
<v ->Yeah, that's interesting.</v>

22:48.488 --> 22:49.340
It's also interesting to know that

22:49.340 --> 22:52.020
if you have these partnerships with home builders,

22:52.020 --> 22:54.360
but there's also, when it comes to partnerships,

22:54.360 --> 22:57.330
there's also solar they can install in these homes too.

22:57.330 --> 23:00.540
Wolfgang, could you talk a little bit about the solar angle?

23:00.540 --> 23:04.170
<v ->Yes, that is something that is really, really helpful.</v>

23:04.170 --> 23:07.140
We have almost with all solar panel producers,

23:07.140 --> 23:09.003
we have very close partnerships.

23:09.960 --> 23:13.050
Most of them just happened because they picked us,

23:13.050 --> 23:15.390
they integrated us in their solution,

23:15.390 --> 23:17.190
and they recommend us.

23:17.190 --> 23:20.010
And then it starts with the simple monitoring

23:20.010 --> 23:23.760
of how much energy is my solar system producing?

23:23.760 --> 23:26.520
The homeowner knows that's the energy that I have.

23:26.520 --> 23:29.580
And then they make the step-by-step integration afterwards.

23:29.580 --> 23:32.700
That's really helpful, and we are considered

23:32.700 --> 23:36.180
to be something like the standard for doing this together

23:36.180 --> 23:38.130
with solar panel producers in Europe.

23:38.130 --> 23:39.510
That's really helpful.

23:39.510 --> 23:44.010
But if I can add something to the builders,

23:44.010 --> 23:45.360
what we see in Europe,

23:45.360 --> 23:47.790
and I don't know if this is the same in the United States,

23:47.790 --> 23:50.790
if you have professional installers,

23:50.790 --> 23:53.070
the electricians installing devices,

23:53.070 --> 23:55.740
I would today say that 90% of them

23:55.740 --> 24:00.597
have no idea how to install something that is smart, 90%.

24:02.170 --> 24:04.620
So if you talk to them about something that is smart,

24:04.620 --> 24:06.810
if this is Schneider or if this is Shelly,

24:06.810 --> 24:07.643
the first thing they say,

24:07.643 --> 24:09.123
"What, this has an IP address?

24:09.960 --> 24:12.120
Let's put the old wires."

24:12.120 --> 24:13.860
And this is something that we have to break through

24:13.860 --> 24:16.800
where we are investing a lot in training them,

24:16.800 --> 24:18.480
in helping them to do that

24:18.480 --> 24:20.190
because they simply don't understand

24:20.190 --> 24:23.490
this will need a generation of new installers

24:23.490 --> 24:25.560
with a completely different mindset

24:25.560 --> 24:27.300
that are able to do that.

24:27.300 --> 24:31.890
So the solar installers, they are miles ahead.

24:31.890 --> 24:34.560
The traditional guys, they are really, really behind,

24:34.560 --> 24:36.660
and they wanna put their two or three cables

24:36.660 --> 24:38.640
in the wall and that's it.

24:38.640 --> 24:40.140
<v ->Yeah, that does beg the question</v>

24:40.140 --> 24:43.410
of whether solar installers need to be electricians

24:43.410 --> 24:44.640
or if they do not need to be

24:44.640 --> 24:48.870
if that helps with that particular value proposition.

24:48.870 --> 24:51.150
<v ->I think this is a new business</v>

24:51.150 --> 24:54.390
and that has new people and they have a new mindset,

24:54.390 --> 24:58.590
and that is something that completely changes the setup.

24:58.590 --> 25:01.620
So if someone did the same job 40 years long

25:01.620 --> 25:04.020
and says in five years I will retire anyhow,

25:04.020 --> 25:06.180
I don't want to learn that, it's too complicated,

25:06.180 --> 25:09.120
I might have to come back because something is not working.

25:09.120 --> 25:12.390
And that's one of the problems that we see there.

25:12.390 --> 25:15.570
<v ->Well it's funny is I had a great early Christmas present</v>

25:15.570 --> 25:18.500
of my HVAC system going out,

25:18.500 --> 25:20.467
and so I talked to the technician, I'm like,

25:20.467 --> 25:22.517
"Hey, I'd like to get a smart thermostat"

25:23.711 --> 25:26.160
and there should be a rebate from the local utility, right?

25:26.160 --> 25:27.620
And he's like, "Yeah, but you don't want

25:27.620 --> 25:29.280
to get a smart thermostat,

25:29.280 --> 25:32.880
it is going to also hurt the life of your system

25:32.880 --> 25:34.710
and like all these falsehoods."

25:34.710 --> 25:36.960
And I was like, not only could they not do it,

25:36.960 --> 25:38.580
but they're actively against it.

25:38.580 --> 25:41.310
And that's part of the challenge.

25:41.310 --> 25:43.500
<v ->Yeah, yeah. Very interesting.</v>

25:43.500 --> 25:47.580
I also wanna get kind of sort of a view

25:47.580 --> 25:50.340
of partnerships from both the utility perspective

25:50.340 --> 25:52.590
and the device manufacturer perspective.

25:52.590 --> 25:56.400
And so what are some examples

25:56.400 --> 25:57.720
of some successful collaborations

25:57.720 --> 26:00.630
between utility companies and smart home providers?

26:00.630 --> 26:03.840
And I'll lead off with Meghan to answer that.

26:03.840 --> 26:07.001
<v ->Well, I'll echo what Poonam said.</v>

26:07.001 --> 26:10.530
Just general increases in demand for electricity

26:10.530 --> 26:14.520
and energy is really requiring these strategic partnerships.

26:14.520 --> 26:18.570
And so an example of one in Texas that was just announced

26:18.570 --> 26:20.970
between NRG and Renew Home

26:20.970 --> 26:24.660
and Google is going to enable the building

26:24.660 --> 26:29.660
of a virtual power plant or VPP in Texas.

26:29.760 --> 26:31.020
So we're excited about that,

26:31.020 --> 26:33.750
but it is really requiring that partnership

26:33.750 --> 26:36.450
so that we can scale to make the impact

26:36.450 --> 26:38.910
that we need to in Texas specifically.

26:38.910 --> 26:40.740
And so from an NRG perspective,

26:40.740 --> 26:43.740
we've got the supply management expertise

26:43.740 --> 26:46.230
that we bring as well as our energy brands

26:46.230 --> 26:49.080
and customers that we bring to the program.

26:49.080 --> 26:52.383
And then from a Google and a Renew Home standpoint,

26:53.256 --> 26:54.870
they've got energy management capabilities

26:54.870 --> 26:56.040
that we'll be leveraging.

26:56.040 --> 26:58.770
So that bundle I had mentioned

26:58.770 --> 27:00.300
around the thermostat and doorbell,

27:00.300 --> 27:04.440
that's really speaking to customers getting that adoption.

27:04.440 --> 27:06.900
The key is really to get customer engagement

27:06.900 --> 27:10.650
so that we've got a scalable successful VPP.

27:10.650 --> 27:12.993
And so that's one example of a partnership.

27:15.870 --> 27:18.030
<v ->Michael, would you also care to weigh in?</v>

27:18.030 --> 27:23.030
I know that Resideo has a demand, sorry, a DERMS platform,

27:24.661 --> 27:27.120
and that that really is very useful to work with utilities.

27:27.120 --> 27:29.280
So tell me a little bit more about how that works.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.750
<v ->Yeah, so a piece in the puzzle</v>

27:30.750 --> 27:32.490
as Meghan was just describing is

27:32.490 --> 27:36.091
what we call a distributed energy management system,

27:36.091 --> 27:38.850
distributed energy resource management system, a DERMS,

27:38.850 --> 27:41.730
And what this DERMS is is like a software layer

27:41.730 --> 27:44.640
and like a team behind the scenes that actually is able

27:44.640 --> 27:47.490
to aggregate many different devices,

27:47.490 --> 27:51.090
kind of creating a collaboration with the manufacturers

27:51.090 --> 27:52.230
of the devices,

27:52.230 --> 27:55.320
being able to manage having programs

27:55.320 --> 27:56.640
that get to the device to be able

27:56.640 --> 27:59.430
to be controlled as part of the events when the utility

27:59.430 --> 28:02.040
or the energy company needs to have that energy.

28:02.040 --> 28:03.840
So kind of my advice

28:03.840 --> 28:05.970
to technology providers here in the audience

28:05.970 --> 28:08.460
is utilities,

28:08.460 --> 28:11.100
they don't want to talk to every device manufacturer,

28:11.100 --> 28:12.840
and frankly you guys don't wanna have

28:12.840 --> 28:14.070
to talk to every utility.

28:14.070 --> 28:15.570
It just doesn't scale.

28:15.570 --> 28:19.920
So the DERMS provider, the aggregator may be a simpler term,

28:19.920 --> 28:23.040
is able to be there in the middle coordinating things.

28:23.040 --> 28:24.210
We do stuff in the cloud,

28:24.210 --> 28:26.610
we're able to talk to utilities on secure channels.

28:26.610 --> 28:30.180
So look at that as a pathway if you want to get more

28:30.180 --> 28:33.060
of your devices involved in energy management.

28:33.060 --> 28:35.810
Speaking of success though, so I wanna bring up a story

28:36.870 --> 28:38.700
from my wife actually recently.

28:38.700 --> 28:39.570
I'm a scientist,

28:39.570 --> 28:41.970
so my house has been in demand response events

28:41.970 --> 28:44.190
since the beginning of demand response events.

28:44.190 --> 28:46.710
And this last year, like a few months ago,

28:46.710 --> 28:48.540
she's like made a comment that

28:48.540 --> 28:49.950
you haven't been running as many

28:49.950 --> 28:52.446
of those mad science experiments

28:52.446 --> 28:54.240
making our house really hot this past summer.

28:54.240 --> 28:55.080
And really what it was,

28:55.080 --> 28:56.730
it wasn't me controlling all these things,

28:56.730 --> 29:00.040
like it was the utilities are now calling events

29:01.591 --> 29:03.510
less frequently or at least not as strong

29:03.510 --> 29:05.040
as they had in the past.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.320
Parks Research kind of tells us this too,

29:07.320 --> 29:10.530
that when customers leave demand response programs now,

29:10.530 --> 29:12.907
it's a diminishing level of people saying,

29:12.907 --> 29:14.700
"Oh it was because I was uncomfortable,

29:14.700 --> 29:16.590
oh it was because we had too many events."

29:16.590 --> 29:18.240
It's more like they moved out

29:18.240 --> 29:20.160
or like something else changed.

29:20.160 --> 29:21.960
So our data is showing that too,

29:21.960 --> 29:24.540
that like events are being called

29:24.540 --> 29:27.336
maybe not as long as they used to

29:27.336 --> 29:28.169
or different times of the day

29:28.169 --> 29:30.649
we kind of like learn customer patterns

29:30.649 --> 29:31.620
and try to tailor the response

29:31.620 --> 29:33.660
to what we can do for that customer.

29:33.660 --> 29:36.090
So I think of it as like maybe

29:36.090 --> 29:37.710
if you were in a program in the past

29:37.710 --> 29:40.500
and like was uncomfortable for you,

29:40.500 --> 29:44.130
give it a shot because a lot has evolved in this space.

29:44.130 --> 29:46.440
<v ->I think you hit on something key there though,</v>

29:46.440 --> 29:51.060
which is we've gotta make sure we have customer trust

29:51.060 --> 29:53.520
because we have to have the scale to sign up

29:53.520 --> 29:55.440
to all these programs to get these devices

29:55.440 --> 29:57.870
to meet the challenge that everybody's been talking about

29:57.870 --> 29:58.703
because remember,

29:58.703 --> 30:01.380
decarbonization was a generational challenge

30:01.380 --> 30:03.270
when there was flat load growth.

30:03.270 --> 30:07.200
Now we've got high load growth and decarbonization target.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.330
So it's really unprecedented.

30:09.330 --> 30:11.700
And so in order to get that scale,

30:11.700 --> 30:13.890
you gotta make sure that that customer's comfortable.

30:13.890 --> 30:16.020
You gotta make sure it's simple, right?

30:16.020 --> 30:18.450
And you have to make sure

30:18.450 --> 30:20.490
that you don't break that trust

30:20.490 --> 30:21.967
so you don't have to come back and be like,

30:21.967 --> 30:24.900
"Hey, sorry we botched that a few years ago.

30:24.900 --> 30:26.280
Would you like to try it again?"

30:26.280 --> 30:29.010
Because that is such a hard sell, right?

30:29.010 --> 30:30.210
And the solar industry

30:30.210 --> 30:32.070
by the way is seeing the impacts

30:32.070 --> 30:35.850
when customers lose faith in your industry.

30:35.850 --> 30:37.770
What do your customer acquisition costs do

30:37.770 --> 30:39.753
when that happens, they go sky high.

30:40.710 --> 30:45.420
<v ->Yeah, and we've seen solar basically stall in adoption</v>

30:45.420 --> 30:47.430
and a lot of it has to do with cost,

30:47.430 --> 30:49.830
but definitely there's a lot of trust issues

30:49.830 --> 30:51.153
with the industry as well.

30:52.020 --> 30:53.400
So yeah, it's very interesting.

30:53.400 --> 30:54.840
We're seeing also that like a lot

30:54.840 --> 30:57.480
of people are afraid of losing control with demand response.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.610
So that's a big piece of it,

30:59.610 --> 31:01.860
and being able to gain their trust

31:01.860 --> 31:03.480
is gonna be very key to that.

31:03.480 --> 31:05.070
And also incentivizing them

31:05.070 --> 31:07.290
because we find that that's really the number one way

31:07.290 --> 31:10.833
to get consumers to participate in demand response.

31:12.720 --> 31:14.040
So I wanna talk a little bit about

31:14.040 --> 31:14.940
in the last few minutes,

31:14.940 --> 31:18.933
the future of smart home energy management.

31:20.370 --> 31:23.370
And this is really a hot topic of course,

31:23.370 --> 31:25.440
and I'd like to hear a little bit about Poonam,

31:25.440 --> 31:27.870
what you think about it, but how are advancements in AI,

31:27.870 --> 31:30.750
machine learning, and IOT changing the energy market,

31:30.750 --> 31:33.450
especially like AI and machine learning?

31:33.450 --> 31:35.883
<v ->We heard a lot about that this morning, right?</v>

31:36.780 --> 31:39.210
So again, I go back to the number one problem

31:39.210 --> 31:41.340
that we got to solve for the consumer,

31:41.340 --> 31:44.490
and that is reducing the energy bill.

31:44.490 --> 31:47.910
Now in an ideal state,

31:47.910 --> 31:51.161
I would like a climate conscience

31:51.161 --> 31:53.440
Greta Thunberg wired to my house

31:54.589 --> 31:57.150
that is going to do everything

31:57.150 --> 32:00.270
that needs to be done to make me comfortable,

32:00.270 --> 32:02.250
to reduce my energy bill,

32:02.250 --> 32:04.500
as well as do the right things for the planet, right?

32:04.500 --> 32:05.670
That's an ideal state,

32:05.670 --> 32:08.520
and I don't think that we are necessarily too far

32:08.520 --> 32:10.950
from what that state is.

32:10.950 --> 32:15.150
So for instance, in Europe,

32:15.150 --> 32:18.360
the Schneider energy monitor,

32:18.360 --> 32:23.100
that has AI built in that does energy monitoring

32:23.100 --> 32:26.493
that watches for user behavior,

32:28.290 --> 32:32.100
understands my energy consumption,

32:32.100 --> 32:35.520
looks at the energy prices, looks at the weather forecast,

32:35.520 --> 32:37.140
and does everything that needs

32:37.140 --> 32:41.790
to be done in terms of automating the usage

32:41.790 --> 32:42.843
within the house.

32:44.100 --> 32:48.480
For instance, if the energy prices are low,

32:48.480 --> 32:51.840
it'll heat up my water heater

32:51.840 --> 32:53.703
when the energy prices are low,

32:54.990 --> 32:58.740
it'll charge my EV when the energy prices are low.

32:58.740 --> 33:03.210
And it can also predict you user behavior

33:03.210 --> 33:06.900
to a certain degree and allow you

33:06.900 --> 33:11.900
to kind of make choices based on your behavior.

33:13.170 --> 33:15.780
So there's energy optimization that happens,

33:15.780 --> 33:19.440
but then also as your energy,

33:19.440 --> 33:21.960
if your energy prices are increasing to a certain degree,

33:21.960 --> 33:24.900
there is a potential that you've got an old appliance

33:24.900 --> 33:29.430
in the house that may be consuming more energy

33:29.430 --> 33:30.690
than it should.

33:30.690 --> 33:34.680
And that is an indication that probably in, I don't know,

33:34.680 --> 33:38.430
few months from now, my appliance may go down.

33:38.430 --> 33:40.927
So it gives you an alert necessarily to tell you,

33:40.927 --> 33:43.860
"Hey, take a look at this."

33:43.860 --> 33:46.230
So there is a little bit of that predictive piece

33:46.230 --> 33:47.580
within that as well.

33:47.580 --> 33:49.170
So there's a lot of advancements

33:49.170 --> 33:54.040
that AI from an energy management is being done

33:54.960 --> 33:57.720
to drive resiliency, to drive sustainability,

33:57.720 --> 33:59.193
and to drive efficiency.

34:00.660 --> 34:03.390
<v ->Yeah, definitely, it's very interesting,</v>

34:03.390 --> 34:07.230
and I think I also wanna understand the impact that EVs

34:07.230 --> 34:09.840
and new energy management programs such as VPPs

34:09.840 --> 34:12.750
might have, Lon, I don't know if you could take that one.

34:12.750 --> 34:16.200
<v ->Yeah, well it depends on the rate of adoption.</v>

34:16.200 --> 34:18.750
The utility industry we're at heart

34:18.750 --> 34:20.310
of infrastructure companies, right?

34:20.310 --> 34:25.310
So we own and operate these very complex grids.

34:26.340 --> 34:29.070
Duke Energy's grid can wrap around the world seven times.

34:29.070 --> 34:32.610
So just think about the maintenance and the analytics

34:32.610 --> 34:35.790
and everything that's required, and then on top of that,

34:35.790 --> 34:37.230
throw in extreme weather events

34:37.230 --> 34:39.960
or crazy people shooting at substations, right?

34:39.960 --> 34:42.150
So it's really hard to manage,

34:42.150 --> 34:44.880
and if all of a sudden you're getting a neighborhood

34:44.880 --> 34:48.450
and each home has a one or two EVs in a cul-de-sac,

34:48.450 --> 34:51.633
well that's gonna present an issue to that local system.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.480
And we're not even talking about the larger oh,

34:54.480 --> 34:56.930
do you have enough energy at this particular time

34:57.780 --> 34:59.010
from the bulk power system.

34:59.010 --> 35:04.010
So it will take more sophisticated algorithms

35:04.620 --> 35:07.125
and AI to be able to balance that

35:07.125 --> 35:08.760
and also make sure that you're meeting

35:08.760 --> 35:12.180
all the customer needs so that you can co-optimize

35:12.180 --> 35:14.700
with all those homes and the local grid.

35:14.700 --> 35:17.553
Now what comes with that is more value streams though.

35:18.581 --> 35:19.770
So if the customer can enroll

35:19.770 --> 35:21.930
in a more sophisticated program,

35:21.930 --> 35:24.060
then I can give them more incentives

35:24.060 --> 35:25.770
either on the front end or continue

35:25.770 --> 35:29.100
to do participation rewards, right?

35:29.100 --> 35:31.680
So there's always these trade-offs.

35:31.680 --> 35:33.120
You can have a maybe a simple program

35:33.120 --> 35:36.903
that doesn't pay as much, but as you get this adoption,

35:38.020 --> 35:40.890
you're gonna have to see more sophistication.

35:40.890 --> 35:43.800
But again, the positive thing is that usually

35:43.800 --> 35:45.850
comes with more compensation, more value.

35:46.710 --> 35:49.410
<v ->Great, well we're almost at the end of our panel here,</v>

35:49.410 --> 35:50.820
but as a quick lightning round,

35:50.820 --> 35:52.890
maybe a minute or less for each person,

35:52.890 --> 35:54.510
I had a conversation

35:54.510 --> 35:58.083
during lunch with a couple of folks from Hunter Industries,

35:58.920 --> 36:00.420
Matthew and Jessica,

36:00.420 --> 36:02.430
and they brought the question about

36:02.430 --> 36:05.220
how do you get the consumer

36:05.220 --> 36:08.520
to buy into the value of energy management at home,

36:08.520 --> 36:11.490
especially if they can't really turn down their energy use,

36:11.490 --> 36:14.760
they need the air conditioner on, they need the lights on,

36:14.760 --> 36:16.680
or if they've seen their energy insights once,

36:16.680 --> 36:19.800
if they never need to see them again for those same devices,

36:19.800 --> 36:21.360
how do you get them to buy into that value?

36:21.360 --> 36:23.553
So a minute or less starting with Poonam.

36:24.840 --> 36:29.400
<v ->So I think that at the end of the day, the consumer,</v>

36:29.400 --> 36:32.430
I think the statistics you showed earlier was

36:32.430 --> 36:35.940
that yes, they've tried to do everything.

36:35.940 --> 36:38.453
Most of the consumers, more than 50% of the consumers

36:38.453 --> 36:41.670
that we have surveyed believe

36:41.670 --> 36:45.639
that smart home will help them reduce their energy bills.

36:45.639 --> 36:49.500
Now the deployment and the adoption is still low,

36:49.500 --> 36:51.960
16% as you said, smart thermostats.

36:51.960 --> 36:54.570
However, the rate of adoption of that

36:54.570 --> 36:57.600
has been the highest in the last couple of years.

36:57.600 --> 37:01.590
So smart thermostats has increased as well

37:01.590 --> 37:04.590
as energy monitoring has increased

37:04.590 --> 37:06.093
over the last couple of years.

37:07.088 --> 37:10.380
Now with that, I think the biggest challenges for us

37:10.380 --> 37:14.250
to enable that adoption to drive engagement

37:14.250 --> 37:17.970
and to keep the technology really simple,

37:17.970 --> 37:20.730
to enable the engagement, right?

37:20.730 --> 37:24.840
Because the consumers are not geeks

37:24.840 --> 37:27.930
who are going to constantly be playing with the equipment.

37:27.930 --> 37:30.810
They want to set it and forget it

37:30.810 --> 37:33.750
and let the equipment kind of take care of everything

37:33.750 --> 37:35.010
that needs to be taken care of.

37:35.010 --> 37:36.990
And I think that's going to enable us

37:36.990 --> 37:38.583
to drive more of that adoption.

37:40.800 --> 37:44.020
<v ->Yeah, I can just add that</v>

37:46.581 --> 37:48.840
the smart home market is on the edge

37:48.840 --> 37:51.330
not being a geek market anymore,

37:51.330 --> 37:53.760
it's mass market, it's on the edge, it's not yet there.

37:53.760 --> 37:55.500
It's on the edge to the mass market.

37:55.500 --> 37:56.333
For the geeks,

37:56.333 --> 37:58.620
it was great to spend the whole weekend

37:58.620 --> 38:01.560
installing one device, trying out a lot of things,

38:01.560 --> 38:03.180
talking to the community.

38:03.180 --> 38:05.790
Now I found the solution, I can add something,

38:05.790 --> 38:09.060
that's over, and we are still, as an industry,

38:09.060 --> 38:12.120
we are still talking too much about technology

38:12.120 --> 38:13.800
and not enough about the solution.

38:13.800 --> 38:15.363
The customer has a problem,

38:16.372 --> 38:18.810
the problem is he wants to live with more convenience

38:18.810 --> 38:20.400
or he wants to save energy.

38:20.400 --> 38:21.930
How are we solving this problem?

38:21.930 --> 38:24.570
He doesn't care about the product that is behind

38:24.570 --> 38:28.260
and if this is matter or not matter or wifi or Z-Wave

38:28.260 --> 38:30.720
or whatever it is, he doesn't care.

38:30.720 --> 38:33.360
And this is something that is helping.

38:33.360 --> 38:34.680
So to make the products easier,

38:34.680 --> 38:37.080
to talk more about the use case and the solution.

38:37.080 --> 38:40.230
And the other thing I usually say on the energy side,

38:40.230 --> 38:43.950
it must hurt, if it's not hurting, no one will change.

38:43.950 --> 38:47.340
As long as the kilowatt hour is 5 cents or 10 cents,

38:47.340 --> 38:48.600
no one really looks at the bill.

38:48.600 --> 38:51.270
If it's 30 or 40 cents, people look at the bill,

38:51.270 --> 38:53.580
and that changes behavior completely.

38:53.580 --> 38:56.430
And the last thing is education of the installers.

38:56.430 --> 38:57.660
If we are not doing that

38:57.660 --> 39:01.410
and as long as they are behaving, like don't do that,

39:01.410 --> 39:03.870
it's really not good, it's not solid enough,

39:03.870 --> 39:05.343
then we'll not change.

39:06.810 --> 39:09.750
<v ->Yeah, I mean I think we need that interoperability too</v>

39:09.750 --> 39:13.590
because we just had a really bad experience

39:13.590 --> 39:16.110
with smart EV chargers now.

39:16.110 --> 39:18.243
A lot of homeowners now just,

39:19.740 --> 39:22.410
they're gonna have challenges with their charger

39:22.410 --> 39:24.816
because the company sort of picked up

39:24.816 --> 39:25.649
and then who can fill in

39:25.649 --> 39:27.780
and who can work with those software systems.

39:27.780 --> 39:29.670
So we have to think about that.

39:29.670 --> 39:32.400
But also when you have that consumer that has that app

39:32.400 --> 39:34.860
and they're looking, hey, how can I save money,

39:34.860 --> 39:37.140
that it pops up, auto discovers the devices

39:37.140 --> 39:38.250
that can enroll in a program

39:38.250 --> 39:39.690
that Duke Energy has,

39:39.690 --> 39:42.360
automatically one click enrollment,

39:42.360 --> 39:44.760
they get a bill credit or whatever else

39:44.760 --> 39:48.510
they get connected to a partner that can install something,

39:48.510 --> 39:50.190
those are the things that we're gonna have to do

39:50.190 --> 39:53.760
that helps reduce the amount of dependency you have

39:53.760 --> 39:56.130
on price signals hurting them, right?

39:56.130 --> 39:58.890
Because we don't want to have that situation happen.

39:58.890 --> 40:02.760
And so one of our successful programs is we fix the bill

40:02.760 --> 40:05.937
for bill certainty for them if they sign up for smart device

40:05.937 --> 40:08.070
and we drop it and we guarantee those savings.

40:08.070 --> 40:09.960
So these are the things we're experimenting on

40:09.960 --> 40:11.583
that could get some traction.

40:13.391 --> 40:15.750
<v ->And I know we're short on time, so I'll be really quick.</v>

40:15.750 --> 40:17.520
Innovation in the market.

40:17.520 --> 40:19.950
So a lot of what we've talked about,

40:19.950 --> 40:24.060
but also here at the show, the market continues to evolve.

40:24.060 --> 40:27.000
So what kind of plans are we offering customers

40:27.000 --> 40:28.080
so that they can save money?

40:28.080 --> 40:29.880
What kind of tools are we giving them?

40:29.880 --> 40:31.860
Understanding their different customer types.

40:31.860 --> 40:33.240
Some wanna set it and forget it,

40:33.240 --> 40:35.550
some wanna really dig into the details.

40:35.550 --> 40:38.880
So just continuing to innovate around those offerings

40:38.880 --> 40:41.400
so that customers have those options.

40:41.400 --> 40:42.450
<v ->I'll kinda like play on that.</v>

40:42.450 --> 40:44.070
Like as a technology producer,

40:44.070 --> 40:46.140
we really want things to be complex

40:46.140 --> 40:49.290
on like the utility side, like all these options,

40:49.290 --> 40:51.870
and then it's up to us to develop the technology

40:51.870 --> 40:54.290
so that way we make it really easy for the customer

40:54.290 --> 40:55.650
to just do it automatically.

40:55.650 --> 40:59.010
So pushed for more complexity and like the more constraints

40:59.010 --> 41:00.990
and options that are out there,

41:00.990 --> 41:04.680
but then the interface of the customer needs to be simple.

41:04.680 --> 41:06.180
<v ->Great. Well that's all the time we have.</v>

41:06.180 --> 41:08.760
Thank you so much, panel, for joining us for this.

41:08.760 --> 41:11.610
And we have a 20 minute networking break,

41:11.610 --> 41:14.400
and then join us later tonight for our networking reception.

41:14.400 --> 41:18.153
You can RSVP online or at that QR code there.

41:19.230 --> 41:21.810
And thanks again to our sponsors.

41:21.810 --> 41:24.000
And then if you want to check out our research,

41:24.000 --> 41:25.920
