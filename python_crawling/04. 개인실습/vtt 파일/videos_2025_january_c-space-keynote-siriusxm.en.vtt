<v Announcer>Please help me in welcoming Melissa Harrison,</v>

00:28.212 --> 00:30.539
<v ->Good morning, everyone.</v>

8
00:30.539 --> 00:31.710
<v Crowd>Good morning.</v>

9
00:31.710 --> 00:34.050
<v ->Come on, I know it's not that early in Las Vegas.</v>

10
00:34.050 --> 00:38.340
Good morning and welcome to CES 2025.

11
00:38.340 --> 00:40.650
We are thrilled to have you here.

12
00:40.650 --> 00:42.420
We cannot believe that it is time

13
00:42.420 --> 00:45.030
for CES again already this year.

14
00:45.030 --> 00:47.520
It is so exciting to be back in Las Vegas,

15
00:47.520 --> 00:50.310
and I can't wait for all that you're going to explore

16
00:50.310 --> 00:52.083
and see this year.

17
00:53.026 --> 00:56.250
We have a real treat for you this morning.

18
00:56.250 --> 01:01.250
We have SiriusXM and our, I don't know,

19
01:01.500 --> 01:02.333
I gotta tell you,

20
01:02.333 --> 01:04.770
we have a bunch of fan favorites at CES

21
01:04.770 --> 01:07.500
and CTA of Ashley Flowers.

22
01:07.500 --> 01:09.960
It is truly incredible

23
01:09.960 --> 01:12.090
that we have them here on the stage today.

24
01:12.090 --> 01:16.870
As you know, at CES, C Space is the heart of the content

25
01:17.890 --> 01:20.010
and advertising culture where we explore the trends

26
01:20.010 --> 01:24.480
transforming the entertainment we produce and consume.

27
01:24.480 --> 01:27.300
So I'm thrilled to welcome two trailblazers

28
01:27.300 --> 01:28.920
in audio entertainment,

29
01:28.920 --> 01:30.660
pushing the medium forward

30
01:30.660 --> 01:34.890
and helping millions of people reach the voices, stories,

31
01:34.890 --> 01:36.750
and the music they love.

32
01:36.750 --> 01:39.960
Jennifer Witz is the CEO of SiriusXM,

33
01:39.960 --> 01:41.250
one of North America's

34
01:41.250 --> 01:44.070
leading audio entertainment companies.

35
01:44.070 --> 01:47.220
In her more than two decades at SiriusXM,

36
01:47.220 --> 01:49.410
Jennifer has been front and center

37
01:49.410 --> 01:52.920
as the entertainment industry has transformed,

38
01:52.920 --> 01:55.920
driving the company's digital transformation,

39
01:55.920 --> 01:58.380
expanding its content offerings,

40
01:58.380 --> 02:02.820
advancing its streaming and in-car technology,

41
02:02.820 --> 02:06.330
and supporting the growth of its advertising business.

42
02:06.330 --> 02:08.220
She's known for her strategic vision

43
02:08.220 --> 02:10.500
and commitment to building a powerful

44
02:10.500 --> 02:14.940
and diverse slate of top voices across entertainment,

45
02:14.940 --> 02:19.410
news, music, sports, and talk radio.

46
02:19.410 --> 02:22.020
Today, she will be joined by Ashley Flowers,

47
02:22.020 --> 02:24.180
whose voice you may recognize

48
02:24.180 --> 02:27.600
from her hit podcast "Crime Junkie."

49
02:27.600 --> 02:29.970
But Ashley is so much more than that.

50
02:29.970 --> 02:34.380
She's a CEO, a founder, a crime stopper,

51
02:34.380 --> 02:37.350
and a passionate advocate for victims.

52
02:37.350 --> 02:39.240
You are in for a real treat today,

53
02:39.240 --> 02:42.720
Jennifer and Ashley will dive into the evolution

54
02:42.720 --> 02:44.790
and future of audio entertainment

55
02:44.790 --> 02:48.513
from satellite radio to streaming to podcasts.

56
02:50.670 --> 02:53.670
They'll explore the impact of tech on media consumption,

57
02:53.670 --> 02:56.640
how art and science come together to move listeners,

58
02:56.640 --> 02:58.170
and the biggest challenges

59
02:58.170 --> 03:01.500
and opportunities facing audio creators today.

60
03:01.500 --> 03:03.390
So please, without further ado,

61
03:03.390 --> 03:05.520
join me in welcoming Jennifer Witz

62
03:05.520 --> 03:07.305
and Ashley Flowers.

63
03:07.305 --> 03:10.472
(audience applauding)

64
03:11.790 --> 03:13.390
<v ->Thank you so much.</v>

65
03:13.390 --> 03:14.390
<v ->Thank you.</v>

66
03:20.820 --> 03:22.140
<v ->Hello, everyone.</v>

67
03:22.140 --> 03:24.900
It's my first time here at C Space

68
03:24.900 --> 03:29.610
and actually my first time back at CES in five years,

69
03:29.610 --> 03:32.520
and I'm really excited to be here with you all.

70
03:32.520 --> 03:37.200
At SiriusXM, our vision is to shape the future of audio

71
03:37.200 --> 03:41.700
where everyone can effortlessly connect to the voices,

72
03:41.700 --> 03:45.840
stories, and music they love wherever they are.

73
03:45.840 --> 03:47.940
Over the last two decades,

74
03:47.940 --> 03:51.420
we're proud to have been a foundation

75
03:51.420 --> 03:53.490
of the audio revolution

76
03:53.490 --> 03:55.710
from innovations in space

77
03:55.710 --> 03:59.040
and in the car across satellite and streaming.

78
03:59.040 --> 04:02.580
But while how we listen

79
04:02.580 --> 04:04.590
and the technology that's empowered that

80
04:04.590 --> 04:07.260
has changed dramatically,

81
04:07.260 --> 04:11.820
what remains really just the same is why we listen.

82
04:11.820 --> 04:14.400
And we are entertained

83
04:14.400 --> 04:18.360
and informed by audio, moved and enlightened.

84
04:18.360 --> 04:22.830
And most of all, it helps us feel connected.

85
04:22.830 --> 04:26.910
The enduring power of audio is centered around its ability

86
04:26.910 --> 04:30.967
to bring people together and to change hearts and minds.

87
04:30.967 --> 04:35.220
It's an innately personal medium,

88
04:35.220 --> 04:39.780
and yet with innovations across generative AI

89
04:39.780 --> 04:43.770
and immersive venues, like the Sphere just down the street,

90
04:43.770 --> 04:46.800
we're at a poignant moment in audio's history

91
04:46.800 --> 04:48.900
and also its future.

92
04:48.900 --> 04:51.900
And who better to discuss all of this with

93
04:51.900 --> 04:56.370
than the number one female podcaster in the nation,

94
04:56.370 --> 04:59.820
New York Times bestselling author and CEO

95
04:59.820 --> 05:03.030
and founder of Audiochuck, Ashley Flowers.

96
05:03.030 --> 05:04.068
<v ->Thank you.</v>

97
05:04.068 --> 05:07.235
(audience applauding)

98
05:09.030 --> 05:10.980
<v ->So if you're a true crime fan,</v>

99
05:10.980 --> 05:13.320
and I know many of you are out there,

100
05:13.320 --> 05:17.167
you are sure to know and love Ashley's podcast,

101
05:17.167 --> 05:21.510
"Crime Junkie" and the entire Audiochuck network.

102
05:21.510 --> 05:25.170
Ashley has been a proud member of the SiriusXM family

103
05:25.170 --> 05:27.030
I think since 2021,

104
05:27.030 --> 05:30.720
and we've supported the growth of her business as well.

105
05:30.720 --> 05:34.410
And her story is a great one to cover today

106
05:34.410 --> 05:38.580
because it's a fantastic example of what the evolution

107
05:38.580 --> 05:40.860
of audio technology has really enabled,

108
05:40.860 --> 05:42.930
and she's got a unique vantage point

109
05:42.930 --> 05:45.870
that I think will be helpful as we look at what's next.

110
05:45.870 --> 05:47.643
So let's dive in.

111
05:48.660 --> 05:51.420
Okay, so Ashley, I think we're gonna have a bit

112
05:51.420 --> 05:52.710
of a discussion and back and forth.

113
05:52.710 --> 05:54.240
I know you'll have some questions for me,

114
05:54.240 --> 05:56.100
but the first question I have for you

115
05:56.100 --> 05:59.130
is I would to start by hearing

116
05:59.130 --> 06:03.120
about how and why you found your way into audio,

117
06:03.120 --> 06:05.040
and in particular the role

118
06:05.040 --> 06:07.740
that the evolving tech landscape has played in that.

119
06:07.740 --> 06:09.540
And maybe you can talk a little bit

120
06:09.540 --> 06:11.970
about what that's done for you in terms

121
06:11.970 --> 06:14.190
of creating your connection to audiences.

122
06:14.190 --> 06:18.420
<v ->Yeah, audio is just something that I always loved.</v>

123
06:18.420 --> 06:19.680
I mean, when I was little,

124
06:19.680 --> 06:21.930
I used to go into my parents' minivan

125
06:21.930 --> 06:23.790
to like catch this one radio show

126
06:23.790 --> 06:25.530
for like kids back in the day.

127
06:25.530 --> 06:27.210
I fell in love with audiobooks

128
06:27.210 --> 06:30.450
long before podcasting was mainstream.

129
06:30.450 --> 06:33.480
And truth be told, I mean, it was something that I loved,

130
06:33.480 --> 06:34.313
but it was also,

131
06:34.313 --> 06:36.810
podcasting was the only space that would let me in.

132
06:36.810 --> 06:40.890
I didn't really come from a broadcasting background.

133
06:40.890 --> 06:43.590
I was some random girl from Indiana.

134
06:43.590 --> 06:46.320
And when we started, the beauty of podcasting,

135
06:46.320 --> 06:49.410
which which is still so beautiful is anyone can do it.

136
06:49.410 --> 06:51.270
And all I needed was, when you talk about tech,

137
06:51.270 --> 06:53.040
all I needed was an RSS feed.

138
06:53.040 --> 06:56.430
And so when we first started, that was really what it is.

139
06:56.430 --> 06:58.560
And the RSS feed hasn't changed so much,

140
06:58.560 --> 07:00.750
but I think what's really changed

141
07:00.750 --> 07:02.790
is the tech on the business side,

142
07:02.790 --> 07:06.180
how we are measuring what is a download, what is a stream,

143
07:06.180 --> 07:08.700
how do you deliver, how do you insert ads,

144
07:08.700 --> 07:09.780
how do you deliver ads?

145
07:09.780 --> 07:12.420
And the way that that's evolved in the seven years

146
07:12.420 --> 07:15.600
that I've been in podcasting has been unbelievable.

147
07:15.600 --> 07:19.860
Like anyone who was in podcasting in October of '23

148
07:19.860 --> 07:22.830
when Apple completely changed the way we measure downloads,

149
07:22.830 --> 07:26.490
it like changed the business for so many of us.

150
07:26.490 --> 07:28.050
But I think it's exciting

151
07:28.050 --> 07:31.680
because I think we were a brand new space,

152
07:31.680 --> 07:34.290
everyone says it's the wild west, it still is a little bit,

153
07:34.290 --> 07:37.080
and I think the more accurate we're getting,

154
07:37.080 --> 07:38.370
the more we're figuring it out,

155
07:38.370 --> 07:40.260
I think it's better for creators.

156
07:40.260 --> 07:41.520
I think it's better for listeners.

157
07:41.520 --> 07:43.770
We really know who our audience is.

158
07:43.770 --> 07:45.300
I think it's better for advertisers.

159
07:45.300 --> 07:47.730
They're really knowing what's getting delivered,

160
07:47.730 --> 07:49.440
who are their ads reaching.

161
07:49.440 --> 07:52.230
And so I don't think we're done,

162
07:52.230 --> 07:54.180
like it is constantly still evolving,

163
07:54.180 --> 07:57.000
but really it's been not so much on the creative side,

164
07:57.000 --> 07:59.580
but on the business side where the tech has played

165
07:59.580 --> 08:04.470
such a massive role in the evolution.

166
08:04.470 --> 08:07.050
And you asked me how did I get started,

167
08:07.050 --> 08:10.500
I think for you, why have you stayed so long?

168
08:10.500 --> 08:11.910
I mean, you've been with SiriusXM

169
08:11.910 --> 08:14.473
for almost two decades, right?

170
08:14.473 --> 08:17.550
<v ->Little longer, yeah.</v>
<v ->What inspires you?</v>

171
08:17.550 --> 08:21.286
What do you love about audio above all other mediums?

172
08:21.286 --> 08:24.780
<v ->Yeah, so I've always thought there are two sets</v>

173
08:24.780 --> 08:27.000
of people generally,

174
08:27.000 --> 08:29.910
those that after a long day kind of come home

175
08:29.910 --> 08:32.430
and gravitate towards video,

176
08:32.430 --> 08:35.520
turn the TV on or whatever your device of choice is,

177
08:35.520 --> 08:38.130
and those that sort of gravitate towards audio.

178
08:38.130 --> 08:40.920
And it could be your music collection

179
08:40.920 --> 08:43.950
or your favorite podcast or radio,

180
08:43.950 --> 08:45.270
like the example you gave

181
08:45.270 --> 08:47.460
of like going into the car and listening to something.

182
08:47.460 --> 08:49.710
And I've always been passionate about audio.

183
08:49.710 --> 08:53.100
It's always been the first thing I wanna do when I get home

184
08:53.100 --> 08:54.690
or I get on the subway to go to work.

185
08:54.690 --> 08:56.610
And it's just, I love it,

186
08:56.610 --> 08:59.430
and I love kind of that immersion you have

187
08:59.430 --> 09:01.020
when you are listening to something

188
09:01.020 --> 09:03.089
and you feel really connected to it.

189
09:03.089 --> 09:05.730
But I think if we take a step back,

190
09:05.730 --> 09:09.810
audio is so unique in terms of the science, the intimacy,

191
09:09.810 --> 09:12.030
and the connection that it affords.

192
09:12.030 --> 09:14.190
And particularly with science

193
09:14.190 --> 09:16.798
and the way the brain processes sound,

194
09:16.798 --> 09:21.330
it can really impact everything from your mood

195
09:21.330 --> 09:26.330
or your memories and your breathing or your heart rate.

196
09:28.350 --> 09:31.830
It's incredibly impactful on memory.

197
09:31.830 --> 09:35.280
And like your memory of listening to radio in the car,

198
09:35.280 --> 09:36.210
for any of you,

199
09:36.210 --> 09:39.480
I think if you hear a song you haven't heard in a long time,

200
09:39.480 --> 09:42.507
it'll just immediately take you back

201
09:42.507 --> 09:43.340
to that moment in your past.

202
09:43.340 --> 09:44.910
And I think that's so powerful.

203
09:44.910 --> 09:47.730
You just don't see that I think with a lot of other media.

204
09:47.730 --> 09:52.560
And the intimacy of audio I think plays into that, right?

205
09:52.560 --> 09:56.790
Where audio can go where so many other media can't go.

206
09:56.790 --> 09:59.250
Like the car or like in your earbuds

207
09:59.250 --> 10:00.167
when you're jogging or something.

208
10:00.167 --> 10:02.880
<v ->People take baths with me sometimes.</v>

209
10:02.880 --> 10:07.620
<v ->Yes, and so I just think it creates that connection</v>

210
10:07.620 --> 10:11.550
that you really can't get with video or other media.

211
10:11.550 --> 10:14.220
And I think there's something

212
10:14.220 --> 10:17.163
to the fact that like, during the pandemic,

213
10:18.390 --> 10:23.250
we often heard at Sirius that the hosts were

214
10:23.250 --> 10:26.520
just the constant companions that people were looking for,

215
10:26.520 --> 10:30.060
that there was like almost a social surrogate for that time

216
10:30.060 --> 10:31.890
when you couldn't be with people in person.

217
10:31.890 --> 10:35.670
And so the science, the intimacy, the connections,

218
10:35.670 --> 10:38.940
I think all of this is also what drives fandoms

219
10:38.940 --> 10:40.920
and whether it's Swifties

220
10:40.920 --> 10:42.993
or it's your Crime Junkies.

221
10:44.460 --> 10:48.420
<v ->I think something too is with the way AI is moving,</v>

222
10:48.420 --> 10:50.490
I think we might get to like personal movies

223
10:50.490 --> 10:51.750
for each one of us,

224
10:51.750 --> 10:54.630
but it does allow you to like use your imagination.

225
10:54.630 --> 10:56.280
And I think it's what makes it so great

226
10:56.280 --> 10:58.470
is like you get to picture it exactly how you want it

227
10:58.470 --> 11:00.720
so customized without the creator

228
11:00.720 --> 11:02.250
having to do all the customization.

229
11:02.250 --> 11:03.840
It's really interesting.

230
11:03.840 --> 11:07.050
So you've had this front row seat,

231
11:07.050 --> 11:09.960
if not being in the driver's seat this whole time

232
11:09.960 --> 11:12.840
to the industry as it's changed,

233
11:12.840 --> 11:17.840
what in the last 20 years has surprised you the most

234
11:17.850 --> 11:19.230
or been the most unexpected?

235
11:19.230 --> 11:20.580
And especially in the last year

236
11:20.580 --> 11:22.590
with like how the rate of change has just speeding up.

237
11:22.590 --> 11:23.423
<v ->That's it, right?</v>

238
11:23.423 --> 11:25.740
The pace of innovation has just been

239
11:25.740 --> 11:29.100
so rapid over the last two decades,

240
11:29.100 --> 11:32.370
and it's really across two primary areas.

241
11:32.370 --> 11:34.320
It's how we listen that's changed,

242
11:34.320 --> 11:36.030
and you touched on this a little bit before,

243
11:36.030 --> 11:39.540
and it's also how people create audio,

244
11:39.540 --> 11:41.700
and the technology of just

245
11:41.700 --> 11:44.130
how we listen has been fascinating

246
11:44.130 --> 11:45.150
over the last two decades,

247
11:45.150 --> 11:49.440
whether for music for instance with vinyl or cassettes

248
11:49.440 --> 11:52.110
or you think back you had all these CDs

249
11:52.110 --> 11:54.513
and MP3s and now of course streaming.

250
11:55.513 --> 11:57.210
And that's made music really global.

251
11:57.210 --> 11:59.910
And then the technology has also powered

252
11:59.910 --> 12:02.370
the growth of audiobooks and podcasts,

253
12:02.370 --> 12:07.370
and you have all of this audio in your pocket on your phone.

254
12:08.250 --> 12:11.700
It's hard to imagine that from 20 years ago.

255
12:11.700 --> 12:14.670
And we all have connected devices in our homes,

256
12:14.670 --> 12:16.320
and then of course the quality

257
12:16.320 --> 12:18.870
of the hardware has grown dramatically too.

258
12:18.870 --> 12:21.360
So just what you have in terms

259
12:21.360 --> 12:24.240
of your home speaker systems or your car systems,

260
12:24.240 --> 12:27.750
or again, like these immersive venues like the Sphere,

261
12:27.750 --> 12:31.770
it's just been amazing to see the evolution

262
12:31.770 --> 12:34.410
of how audio is delivered.

263
12:34.410 --> 12:36.660
And then for creators, like you said,

264
12:36.660 --> 12:41.520
it's much easier to create, market, and distribute,

265
12:41.520 --> 12:44.970
whether it's music or a podcast or a show.

266
12:44.970 --> 12:49.680
And that just affords so many opportunities for creators

267
12:49.680 --> 12:51.833
to build audiences.

268
12:51.833 --> 12:55.440
And I think the interesting thing is that, again,

269
12:55.440 --> 12:57.840
why we listen, while all this innovation has happened

270
12:57.840 --> 13:00.930
on sort of how we create and how we deliver audio,

271
13:00.930 --> 13:03.840
why we listen is still fundamentally the same, right?

272
13:03.840 --> 13:07.140
That it's that connection and the science of it,

273
13:07.140 --> 13:09.960
the intimacy that's really special about audio.

274
13:09.960 --> 13:13.253
So given all the breadth of content that's out there now,

275
13:13.253 --> 13:16.260
I think the big challenge is discovery really,

276
13:16.260 --> 13:19.238
finding the things that resonate with you.

277
13:19.238 --> 13:21.840
It's fantastic to see all these creators

278
13:21.840 --> 13:24.450
having the opportunity to distribute,

279
13:24.450 --> 13:27.210
but how do we actually find what we love?

280
13:27.210 --> 13:30.840
And I think that there's things like algorithms

281
13:30.840 --> 13:33.060
and of course, with Pandora,

282
13:33.060 --> 13:35.850
we've had a great algorithm for music discovery

283
13:35.850 --> 13:37.290
that we continue to perfect.

284
13:37.290 --> 13:41.250
But what's really special I think about SiriusXM

285
13:41.250 --> 13:44.040
is the hosts and the programmers that we have

286
13:44.040 --> 13:46.620
who are really just experts in their fields

287
13:46.620 --> 13:48.570
and they love what they do.

288
13:48.570 --> 13:50.250
They love the genre

289
13:50.250 --> 13:53.611
or the category of interests that they focus on,

290
13:53.611 --> 13:55.530
and that shows up in the content.

291
13:55.530 --> 13:57.880
And that's I think why listeners have

292
13:58.896 --> 14:01.140
built these real connections with our hosts.

293
14:01.140 --> 14:05.910
And it's just such a big part of who we are at Sirius XM

294
14:05.910 --> 14:09.390
to make sure that it's humans creating this content

295
14:09.390 --> 14:12.810
and curating it and bringing it to our audiences.

296
14:12.810 --> 14:16.500
And look, I think creators like yourself have been able

297
14:16.500 --> 14:20.550
to leverage the broader SiriusXM podcast network

298
14:20.550 --> 14:23.670
to build your audiences, build your fanbases,

299
14:23.670 --> 14:25.590
and build your brands ultimately.

300
14:25.590 --> 14:27.923
<v ->And learning from one another, it's been great.</v>

301
14:29.130 --> 14:30.840
<v ->So I have a question for you now,</v>

302
14:30.840 --> 14:34.560
and I think we've all heard the 2024 election

303
14:34.560 --> 14:36.750
was sort of the year of the podcast, right?

304
14:36.750 --> 14:40.680
And it's been amazing to see that more

305
14:40.680 --> 14:44.021
and more people have gravitated toward podcasts

306
14:44.021 --> 14:46.260
as a result around the world.

307
14:46.260 --> 14:48.360
And I think we're starting to really see

308
14:48.360 --> 14:50.910
the true power of the podcaster.

309
14:50.910 --> 14:54.869
So I think the influence that you have

310
14:54.869 --> 14:58.253
at the top of your game is phenomenal.

311
14:58.253 --> 14:59.086
And I wanted to ask you a few questions about that

312
14:59.086 --> 15:01.710
because as you think about podcasting,

313
15:01.710 --> 15:04.600
what do you think it is about that or audio in general

314
15:05.873 --> 15:08.190
that really fosters this connection with audiences?

315
15:08.190 --> 15:11.820
<v ->I mean, I think at the core of it, it is the intimacy.</v>

316
15:11.820 --> 15:14.490
And I mean, we're in a world where we are just inundated

317
15:14.490 --> 15:17.340
with so much, and it's headlines, it's clickbait,

318
15:17.340 --> 15:19.530
it's these fast videos

319
15:19.530 --> 15:24.420
and there's very few mediums where you get to spend time

320
15:24.420 --> 15:26.910
with the same person for hours a week,

321
15:26.910 --> 15:29.370
week after week, year after year.

322
15:29.370 --> 15:31.920
And what we've built in podcasting,

323
15:31.920 --> 15:35.370
myself and other podcasters is a relationship.

324
15:35.370 --> 15:39.810
And I think a relationship with someone who has influence

325
15:39.810 --> 15:42.180
and who has an audience, that is so different,

326
15:42.180 --> 15:43.650
I mean, it's the way that you talk to your friends

327
15:43.650 --> 15:45.360
and you trust their opinions.

328
15:45.360 --> 15:48.060
Like you said, we've become these surrogate friends

329
15:48.060 --> 15:51.060
for people and they've watched us grow up and change

330
15:51.060 --> 15:53.160
and change our minds and learn new things.

331
15:53.160 --> 15:54.930
And we've almost done that together.

332
15:54.930 --> 15:56.790
I think what I always say about podcasting

333
15:56.790 --> 15:58.980
that's so beautiful is I think it's

334
15:58.980 --> 16:01.320
one of the first like two-way mediums

335
16:01.320 --> 16:03.990
where we're not just broadcasting this out,

336
16:03.990 --> 16:07.530
but we are really getting feedback from our listeners

337
16:07.530 --> 16:09.240
who feel like they know us.

338
16:09.240 --> 16:13.230
And so I think they're trusting us

339
16:13.230 --> 16:16.890
because they've watched us be consistent,

340
16:16.890 --> 16:20.250
day in, day out, week in, week out, year over year.

341
16:20.250 --> 16:22.981
And I think that builds a relationship that

342
16:22.981 --> 16:26.340
you just cannot build with one post

343
16:26.340 --> 16:28.863
or with one 30 second video.

344
16:30.232 --> 16:34.350
<v ->And was there a moment where you felt this big shift,</v>

345
16:34.350 --> 16:36.120
either for you personally with your podcast

346
16:36.120 --> 16:37.680
or just the industry in general?

347
16:37.680 --> 16:38.610
<v ->I think it was when people</v>

348
16:38.610 --> 16:40.323
stopped asking what is a podcast?

349
16:41.790 --> 16:44.640
There was so long where people just didn't,

350
16:44.640 --> 16:49.640
they didn't know the reach we had or the value we bring.

351
16:50.310 --> 16:52.920
It was just everyone's side hobby.

352
16:52.920 --> 16:55.860
And so I think when people started really recognizing,

353
16:55.860 --> 17:00.860
I feel like that shift really happened in like '21, '22,

354
17:00.930 --> 17:02.790
at least for us,

355
17:02.790 --> 17:04.860
where it was no longer what is a podcast,

356
17:04.860 --> 17:06.930
I think that's when people really started understanding

357
17:06.930 --> 17:07.893
the power and the reach of them.

358
17:07.893 --> 17:10.050
<v ->It's amazing because the technology has been around</v>

359
17:10.050 --> 17:11.700
for 15 years, right?

360
17:11.700 --> 17:14.190
But it really has only come

361
17:14.190 --> 17:15.360
to the forefront I think in terms

362
17:15.360 --> 17:18.642
of audience expansion in the last four or five years

363
17:18.642 --> 17:19.475
as you said.

364
17:20.310 --> 17:24.630
So because you have such an incredible audience

365
17:24.630 --> 17:26.100
and brand and impact,

366
17:26.100 --> 17:31.100
how do you think about the responsibility you take on,

367
17:31.230 --> 17:33.360
especially with the storytelling you do

368
17:33.360 --> 17:34.410
in terms of true crime,

369
17:34.410 --> 17:37.680
and whether it's the work you do advocating for victims

370
17:37.680 --> 17:40.500
or for those wrongly convicted

371
17:40.500 --> 17:42.360
or picking a brand partner,

372
17:42.360 --> 17:45.450
how do you think about that responsibility to the audience,

373
17:45.450 --> 17:47.520
given the trust they have in you?

374
17:47.520 --> 17:50.820
<v ->I always say I don't want to be an influencer.</v>

375
17:50.820 --> 17:52.740
I want to have influence.

376
17:52.740 --> 17:55.500
And I think the way that you do that

377
17:55.500 --> 17:57.660
is through authenticity.

378
17:57.660 --> 18:00.330
And so that's the thing that I've really been very careful

379
18:00.330 --> 18:04.650
of never losing is I respect so much the people

380
18:04.650 --> 18:06.930
who listen and who are willing to give me, again,

381
18:06.930 --> 18:11.010
not 30 seconds of their day, but hours of their week.

382
18:11.010 --> 18:14.160
And I think showing them,

383
18:14.160 --> 18:16.080
like we've got every episode we've ever made

384
18:16.080 --> 18:19.230
like since 2018 when we were babies are out there.

385
18:19.230 --> 18:22.473
And I think seeing how we've grown,

386
18:24.060 --> 18:25.050
when we've made mistakes,

387
18:25.050 --> 18:27.480
when we've learned from them, when we've changed our minds,

388
18:27.480 --> 18:32.250
like I want to build a world that is open to new things,

389
18:32.250 --> 18:34.350
new ideas to open their hearts, open their minds.

390
18:34.350 --> 18:36.660
And I think that is so much of the responsibility

391
18:36.660 --> 18:39.890
for me is putting myself out there is that is as well

392
18:39.890 --> 18:43.080
is not asking people to do something I'm not willing to do.

393
18:43.080 --> 18:45.990
And it is, it's how I feel about the content.

394
18:45.990 --> 18:47.340
Again, when I think about the content,

395
18:47.340 --> 18:51.180
I want people to be open-minded, have open hearts,

396
18:51.180 --> 18:52.230
be willing to change your mind,

397
18:52.230 --> 18:54.300
be willing to learn something new.

398
18:54.300 --> 18:57.000
And I think if they're willing to do that with me,

399
18:57.000 --> 18:58.980
they also then deeply trust me

400
18:58.980 --> 19:01.470
when I tell them what my favorite toilet paper is.

401
19:01.470 --> 19:03.870
And I don't take that lightly.

402
19:03.870 --> 19:05.170
And I think once you start

403
19:06.186 --> 19:08.850
losing your authenticity even in one area,

404
19:08.850 --> 19:10.260
it affects everything.

405
19:10.260 --> 19:12.120
So when you talk about advertisers,

406
19:12.120 --> 19:15.450
I'm so strict about what we do and who we partner with,

407
19:15.450 --> 19:19.230
because I think the second that becomes false,

408
19:19.230 --> 19:20.250
everything I'm saying,

409
19:20.250 --> 19:22.290
I don't want them to look at that the same way.

410
19:22.290 --> 19:23.910
<v ->Yeah, you wanna make sure you have</v>

411
19:23.910 --> 19:25.080
that trust across the board.

412
19:25.080 --> 19:26.310
<v ->Exactly.</v>

413
19:26.310 --> 19:28.950
<v ->So one of the biggest shifts in the audio landscape</v>

414
19:28.950 --> 19:33.210
is the move to incorporate more video and more social.

415
19:33.210 --> 19:36.030
And as a creator, I think you've said before

416
19:36.030 --> 19:38.463
that you don't believe in video just for videos.

417
19:39.749 --> 19:42.420
And I tend to agree with that, by the way.

418
19:42.420 --> 19:44.250
Can you talk a little bit about your perspectives

419
19:44.250 --> 19:46.320
on this, video, social, other platforms,

420
19:46.320 --> 19:47.250
how you leverage them?

421
19:47.250 --> 19:50.349
<v ->Yeah, I mean, when I created the podcast, like I said,</v>

422
19:50.349 --> 19:52.200
I was creating it with audio in mind.

423
19:52.200 --> 19:54.420
I wasn't just talking for talking's sake.

424
19:54.420 --> 19:57.030
I thought about the way people envision things

425
19:57.030 --> 19:58.560
and put themselves in there,

426
19:58.560 --> 20:02.010
and it didn't necessarily one for one translate to video.

427
20:02.010 --> 20:03.990
And so many people said to me like,

428
20:03.990 --> 20:04.823
they just wanna see you,

429
20:04.823 --> 20:07.890
just put a camera on while you're in the studio.

430
20:07.890 --> 20:09.960
They just wanna see you. It'll be really easy.

431
20:09.960 --> 20:11.640
And like the second you tell me something's really easy,

432
20:11.640 --> 20:14.250
I'm like it's probably not the thing I should be doing.

433
20:14.250 --> 20:16.770
So when I think about video,

434
20:16.770 --> 20:18.840
when I think about it for the content

435
20:18.840 --> 20:20.370
we're currently making,

436
20:20.370 --> 20:24.000
I want to give people the same experience

437
20:24.000 --> 20:25.410
that they had listening,

438
20:25.410 --> 20:26.640
which has taken a lot of time.

439
20:26.640 --> 20:29.580
And we just started putting out video episodes

440
20:29.580 --> 20:32.250
of "Crime Junkie" because I took a lot of time

441
20:32.250 --> 20:35.820
hearing from people, what does it feel like to you,

442
20:35.820 --> 20:37.620
what do you imagine, what is it like?

443
20:37.620 --> 20:39.180
And all of them said,

444
20:39.180 --> 20:40.470
I think I'm on the same couch with you

445
20:40.470 --> 20:41.730
and we're all just like telling a story

446
20:41.730 --> 20:42.750
and we're in the living room,

447
20:42.750 --> 20:45.450
and we wanted to bring that experience to life

448
20:45.450 --> 20:47.250
because I felt like if I did video wrong,

449
20:47.250 --> 20:49.530
it could take away from everything I've done in audio.

450
20:49.530 --> 20:51.840
But I also think that there's opportunities for us

451
20:51.840 --> 20:56.840
to expand into YouTube, to TikTok, to Instagram,

452
20:57.630 --> 21:00.270
all these different socials in the short form,

453
21:00.270 --> 21:01.770
what are people responding to there?

454
21:01.770 --> 21:04.440
But I think you have to make specific content

455
21:04.440 --> 21:05.273
for those things.

456
21:05.273 --> 21:06.810
<v ->So it's additive.</v>

457
21:06.810 --> 21:08.490
<v ->Yeah, it's not just taking it away</v>

458
21:08.490 --> 21:12.780
and it's how do you bring people into your network,

459
21:12.780 --> 21:16.230
into your sphere, if you will,

460
21:16.230 --> 21:17.820
by creating something they like over here

461
21:17.820 --> 21:19.350
and saying, "Hey, you didn't know about us,

462
21:19.350 --> 21:20.910
but come over here, we've got something else."

463
21:20.910 --> 21:22.950
And I think that that's the way that

464
21:22.950 --> 21:24.693
you leverage that appropriately.

465
21:25.800 --> 21:28.020
And you, I mean, you've made a name for yourself in audio

466
21:28.020 --> 21:31.440
as well in the car specifically.

467
21:31.440 --> 21:33.240
What do you think about the new landscape?

468
21:33.240 --> 21:38.100
Like how are you really tackling changes in consumption?

469
21:38.100 --> 21:41.580
<v ->Yeah, so we're focusing on our strengths,</v>

470
21:41.580 --> 21:43.260
rather than chasing trends.

471
21:43.260 --> 21:45.990
So I think kind of how you talked about video,

472
21:45.990 --> 21:49.320
we've been audio first all this time,

473
21:49.320 --> 21:51.690
and we'll use video where it makes sense for us.

474
21:51.690 --> 21:54.030
But audio, and again,

475
21:54.030 --> 21:56.940
there's been a lot of shifts from audio into video,

476
21:56.940 --> 21:58.650
like we talked about with podcasting.

477
21:58.650 --> 22:01.530
There's also been a lot of shifts into audio, right?

478
22:01.530 --> 22:04.170
And that could be print in particular,

479
22:04.170 --> 22:08.220
whether it's news articles or it's audio books, right?

480
22:08.220 --> 22:11.940
So there's just this, I think, shift into audio

481
22:11.940 --> 22:15.570
that is critical in terms of thinking about

482
22:15.570 --> 22:17.130
what should be audio first.

483
22:17.130 --> 22:19.440
And given our focus on the car,

484
22:19.440 --> 22:22.500
and we are doubling down on that today

485
22:22.500 --> 22:24.693
because it's really our stronghold,

486
22:25.740 --> 22:27.810
audio makes the most sense in the car,

487
22:27.810 --> 22:30.150
and that's gonna be true for many years to come.

488
22:30.150 --> 22:32.790
I don't think we're gonna be in self-driving cars

489
22:32.790 --> 22:35.340
watching video any time in the near future.

490
22:35.340 --> 22:39.630
And the car is very much the perfect venue

491
22:39.630 --> 22:40.980
for audio and again,

492
22:40.980 --> 22:44.470
creating that companionship while you are driving

493
22:45.510 --> 22:46.440
and moving around.

494
22:46.440 --> 22:47.980
And I think that

495
22:49.587 --> 22:53.700
our presence in the car is indicative

496
22:53.700 --> 22:55.170
of that experience, right?

497
22:55.170 --> 22:57.360
So radio for instance

498
22:57.360 --> 23:01.740
has just about 75% share of ear in the car,

499
23:01.740 --> 23:04.890
and that's across AM, FM, and SiriusXM.

500
23:04.890 --> 23:09.150
SiriusXM has held this premium position in the car

501
23:09.150 --> 23:12.960
and we've been really the leader there,

502
23:12.960 --> 23:14.850
bigger than any other streaming provider

503
23:14.850 --> 23:16.920
in terms of share of ear in the car.

504
23:16.920 --> 23:18.540
And that's been critical

505
23:18.540 --> 23:22.140
and important in establishing our value proposition.

506
23:22.140 --> 23:26.190
And I think the car is also really the final frontier

507
23:26.190 --> 23:28.800
as you think about, you talked about advertising

508
23:28.800 --> 23:32.923
in terms of digital ad-supported media,

509
23:32.923 --> 23:34.170
and there's an opportunity for us,

510
23:34.170 --> 23:37.020
particularly with the strength we have in the car

511
23:37.020 --> 23:41.220
to provide other ad-supported opportunities within the car

512
23:41.220 --> 23:45.180
in a much more targeted way than say AM FM could do.

513
23:45.180 --> 23:46.530
But we're gonna continue

514
23:46.530 --> 23:48.960
to expand into adjacencies where it makes sense

515
23:48.960 --> 23:50.340
to support our core business.

516
23:50.340 --> 23:52.860
And that could be, of course, in streaming,

517
23:52.860 --> 23:56.130
we talked a lot about how streaming really reinforces

518
23:56.130 --> 23:58.560
our core value proposition.

519
23:58.560 --> 24:02.550
We've launched across Tesla models, we have 360L,

520
24:02.550 --> 24:05.370
it's how our customers consume our service

521
24:05.370 --> 24:06.570
outside of the car.

522
24:06.570 --> 24:08.760
And as a technology,

523
24:08.760 --> 24:10.560
it supports broadening our reach,

524
24:10.560 --> 24:12.270
it supports more personalization.

525
24:12.270 --> 24:15.150
We talked about how do we enhance discovery,

526
24:15.150 --> 24:18.060
and streaming provides a lot of that opportunity

527
24:18.060 --> 24:20.280
given its two-way nature.

528
24:20.280 --> 24:22.830
And I think there's also just opportunities

529
24:22.830 --> 24:24.840
to provide more control of the content

530
24:24.840 --> 24:27.597
to really find what you want and customize it.

531
24:27.597 --> 24:30.660
And then we've made investments in podcasting as well

532
24:30.660 --> 24:33.720
as you know as we've increased the network of podcasts

533
24:33.720 --> 24:35.730
that we have across SiriusXM.

534
24:35.730 --> 24:37.130
And that really allows us

535
24:37.130 --> 24:40.290
to take all the advertising capabilities we have

536
24:40.290 --> 24:43.440
and extend it beyond Pandora into podcasting

537
24:43.440 --> 24:45.990
and make sure that advertisers have the breadth

538
24:45.990 --> 24:48.630
of that reach across medium.

539
24:48.630 --> 24:53.520
And we've been very supportive of the open podcast ecosystem

540
24:53.520 --> 24:55.620
as we have with "Crime Junkie"

541
24:55.620 --> 24:56.790
and the rest of your network,

542
24:56.790 --> 24:59.490
making sure that it's available on all platforms,

543
24:59.490 --> 25:01.620
which appeals to listeners of course

544
25:01.620 --> 25:03.090
and advertisers as well

545
25:03.090 --> 25:05.430
to make sure that they've got that expansive reach.

546
25:05.430 --> 25:09.360
But we found ways I think also working with you

547
25:09.360 --> 25:11.790
to create a "Crime Junkie" radio channel,

548
25:11.790 --> 25:14.400
which works really well for the SiriusXM audience

549
25:14.400 --> 25:18.600
and enhances the exclusive content that we have at SiriusXM.

550
25:18.600 --> 25:21.780
And then we talked a bit about video and social,

551
25:21.780 --> 25:23.820
and I think video for us,

552
25:23.820 --> 25:25.410
we think similarly that it needs

553
25:25.410 --> 25:27.955
to be additive to the experience.

554
25:27.955 --> 25:32.430
So we will have long form exclusive video at SiriusXM

555
25:32.430 --> 25:34.470
primarily in the app where

556
25:34.470 --> 25:37.980
customers are more likely to consume video than in the car.

557
25:37.980 --> 25:40.920
And so, for instance, like with Howard Stern,

558
25:40.920 --> 25:44.760
it's very popular to have the long-form video in the app.

559
25:44.760 --> 25:46.620
But also I think it's important,

560
25:46.620 --> 25:48.180
as we talked about for marketing, right?

561
25:48.180 --> 25:51.180
You wanna have shorter form clips in video

562
25:51.180 --> 25:52.800
distributed on social.

563
25:52.800 --> 25:55.890
We think there's opportunities to extend

564
25:55.890 --> 25:59.910
advertiser relationships to be selling across social,

565
25:59.910 --> 26:01.680
audio, and video to create these

566
26:01.680 --> 26:04.620
sort of 360 sponsorship opportunities.

567
26:04.620 --> 26:06.840
And I think there's another opportunity for us

568
26:06.840 --> 26:09.480
to look at creating snackable forms

569
26:09.480 --> 26:11.850
of content within SiriusXM too,

570
26:11.850 --> 26:13.920
take advantage of the shift I think

571
26:13.920 --> 26:18.920
in listener and in video towards shorter form content,

572
26:19.650 --> 26:22.530
but in a way that makes sense for SiriusXM.

573
26:22.530 --> 26:23.363
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

574
26:24.600 --> 26:27.300
<v ->Okay, so let's talk about AI.</v>

575
26:27.300 --> 26:31.200
So lots of changes as a result of AI

576
26:31.200 --> 26:33.420
and there's voice cloning,

577
26:33.420 --> 26:36.960
there's generative AI podcasts

578
26:36.960 --> 26:39.210
starting to flood the scene.

579
26:39.210 --> 26:41.490
What's your perspective as a creator

580
26:41.490 --> 26:42.870
and a leader in audio

581
26:42.870 --> 26:45.300
and where do you see AI fitting in

582
26:45.300 --> 26:50.300
enhancing your experience or even maybe competing with you?

583
26:50.610 --> 26:52.830
<v ->Yeah, well, as far as like the cloning,</v>

584
26:52.830 --> 26:53.910
I like to keep them on their toes.

585
26:53.910 --> 26:56.280
I have a toddler who gets me sick about like once a quarter,

586
26:56.280 --> 26:58.143
just so they like can't quite do it.

587
26:59.100 --> 27:00.810
But I think that for us,

588
27:00.810 --> 27:04.860
like I'm really committed to not ever do.

589
27:04.860 --> 27:07.350
So like I don't use AI for any of our voices,

590
27:07.350 --> 27:09.930
any of our ads, any of our scripts,

591
27:09.930 --> 27:11.730
like in the creative process,

592
27:11.730 --> 27:12.870
very much the way that you guys

593
27:12.870 --> 27:14.760
appreciate the human experience, so do we.

594
27:14.760 --> 27:18.480
I actually think that's our competitive advantage right now.

595
27:18.480 --> 27:19.830
The more and more we're going

596
27:19.830 --> 27:22.800
to be getting these AI podcasts and all of that,

597
27:22.800 --> 27:24.000
I think the more and more people

598
27:24.000 --> 27:25.680
will be craving that genuine connection

599
27:25.680 --> 27:29.643
and looking to have that human touch and feel.

600
27:30.600 --> 27:33.510
But we are using AI I think in really interesting ways.

601
27:33.510 --> 27:37.320
So obviously like in a lot of our IT and security.

602
27:37.320 --> 27:40.920
But what we've recently started doing is how do we use AI

603
27:40.920 --> 27:44.670
to help us make the best experience for our listeners?

604
27:44.670 --> 27:49.200
So I've always been very focused on the listener experience.

605
27:49.200 --> 27:50.370
I tell a lot of people this,

606
27:50.370 --> 27:52.140
the very first person I ever hired at my company

607
27:52.140 --> 27:53.760
was a fan engagement person to make sure

608
27:53.760 --> 27:55.080
all the emails are getting read,

609
27:55.080 --> 27:56.730
the DMs are getting answered.

610
27:56.730 --> 28:00.630
And what we've done is we have kind of integrated

611
28:00.630 --> 28:02.760
all of this, all of the feedback, all the comments,

612
28:02.760 --> 28:07.290
DMs, emails that we get into Zendesk into this one place.

613
28:07.290 --> 28:09.210
And that's where our whole team responds from.

614
28:09.210 --> 28:11.250
And we don't use AI to even respond to them,

615
28:11.250 --> 28:13.680
like we want humans interacting.

616
28:13.680 --> 28:16.050
But we've recently started using AI

617
28:16.050 --> 28:20.070
to aggregate the thousands and thousands of messages,

618
28:20.070 --> 28:23.850
comments, whatever it is that we get after a single episode.

619
28:23.850 --> 28:25.383
And then we say,

620
28:26.550 --> 28:27.840
what were they saying about this episode?

621
28:27.840 --> 28:28.673
Like what was the sentiment?

622
28:28.673 --> 28:30.060
Was it positive, negative, neutral?

623
28:30.060 --> 28:30.893
What did they like?

624
28:30.893 --> 28:34.140
What are the elements of this that they're talking about?

625
28:34.140 --> 28:38.670
So we can really make a feedback loop into the content.

626
28:38.670 --> 28:40.170
<v ->So extracting the key themes.</v>

627
28:40.170 --> 28:42.090
<v ->Yeah, what are they responding to,</v>

628
28:42.090 --> 28:43.992
positively or negatively,

629
28:43.992 --> 28:47.220
how do we, because it's just enabling us to do

630
28:47.220 --> 28:49.950
that fan engagement experience a little bit quicker

631
28:49.950 --> 28:52.230
to influence what we're making.

632
28:52.230 --> 28:53.790
But we're not being influenced by AI.

633
28:53.790 --> 28:57.300
We're using AI to let our audience influence us.

634
28:57.300 --> 28:59.930
Which again is that circle I was talking about

635
28:59.930 --> 29:01.680
of that feedback loop and creating

636
29:01.680 --> 29:02.820
that two-way relationship,

637
29:02.820 --> 29:03.990
which I think is so important.

638
29:03.990 --> 29:05.520
<v ->Yeah, yeah, agreed.</v>

639
29:05.520 --> 29:07.650
That's I think very important to us too.

640
29:07.650 --> 29:09.220
And we see it similarly as

641
29:10.620 --> 29:12.570
enhancing the experience as opposed

642
29:12.570 --> 29:14.610
to providing the experience.

643
29:14.610 --> 29:19.610
So AI and generative AI can be incredibly powerful

644
29:19.920 --> 29:21.873
when they're used appropriately,

645
29:23.798 --> 29:24.870
when there's an opportunity to go

646
29:24.870 --> 29:26.880
beyond kind of the gimmicky examples

647
29:26.880 --> 29:30.210
you hear of I think many times recently,

648
29:30.210 --> 29:33.060
and really dive into the real promise of it.

649
29:33.060 --> 29:36.900
And I think that there's a lot of examples at SiriusXM,

650
29:36.900 --> 29:38.880
whether it's the precursor of AI,

651
29:38.880 --> 29:40.500
which was machine learning

652
29:40.500 --> 29:43.227
and the Pandora algorithm for music discovery

653
29:43.227 --> 29:45.750
and the music genome project.

654
29:45.750 --> 29:48.270
And today, I think for us,

655
29:48.270 --> 29:51.030
we're looking at ways to continue to leverage AI

656
29:51.030 --> 29:52.110
to support the business,

657
29:52.110 --> 29:53.910
and in similar ways that you talked about,

658
29:53.910 --> 29:56.880
like how do we use it to solve

659
29:56.880 --> 29:59.370
for this discovery problem, right?

660
29:59.370 --> 30:02.250
And really find ways for our listeners

661
30:02.250 --> 30:05.790
to dig into the content that they really love.

662
30:05.790 --> 30:08.670
And that could be attracting new customers

663
30:08.670 --> 30:12.240
into the service by using these other marketing channels

664
30:12.240 --> 30:14.310
and really finding opportunities

665
30:14.310 --> 30:18.360
to connect with the right customers of the right content.

666
30:18.360 --> 30:19.710
Also, just for our listener base,

667
30:19.710 --> 30:21.870
because the breadth of content we have on the platform

668
30:21.870 --> 30:24.330
is so extensive that we can use AI

669
30:24.330 --> 30:26.040
to better serve up recommendations

670
30:26.040 --> 30:27.570
as to other things you might like

671
30:27.570 --> 30:28.710
based on what you're listening,

672
30:28.710 --> 30:32.520
we can tailor your listening experience for the time of day

673
30:32.520 --> 30:35.190
or the location as to where you might be.

674
30:35.190 --> 30:37.920
And I think all of those things facilitate

675
30:37.920 --> 30:40.890
this need to really connect with the content

676
30:40.890 --> 30:43.260
that's really important to you.

677
30:43.260 --> 30:46.140
But in terms of, and look, we have synthetic voices

678
30:46.140 --> 30:47.490
you talked a little bit about,

679
30:47.490 --> 30:49.140
you're not using that today,

680
30:49.140 --> 30:51.270
but I think there's an opportunity

681
30:51.270 --> 30:54.870
for advertisers who are creating ads

682
30:54.870 --> 30:58.050
to bring in smaller advertisers to leverage AI

683
30:58.050 --> 31:00.660
to create ads with synthetic voices,

684
31:00.660 --> 31:03.060
to adapt them for different audiences,

685
31:03.060 --> 31:06.396
and for them to scale their campaigns using AI

686
31:06.396 --> 31:10.071
where it's not necessarily gonna be relevant

687
31:10.071 --> 31:13.230
or appropriate to have a direct sales person involved

688
31:13.230 --> 31:14.490
in that effort.

689
31:14.490 --> 31:16.080
So there's lots of opportunities I think

690
31:16.080 --> 31:17.220
to be more efficient

691
31:17.220 --> 31:20.550
and to provide a better personalized experience using AI.

692
31:20.550 --> 31:23.940
But where I would say we very much agree

693
31:23.940 --> 31:28.500
is that while I think you see this increase

694
31:28.500 --> 31:32.820
of technology and AI in creating content,

695
31:32.820 --> 31:37.042
and we are doubling down on humans creating content,

696
31:37.042 --> 31:38.670
like we really fundamentally believe

697
31:38.670 --> 31:40.230
people can tell the difference.

698
31:40.230 --> 31:43.470
And that is just foundational to the connection

699
31:43.470 --> 31:44.880
that audio provides.

700
31:44.880 --> 31:45.713
<v ->I agree.</v>

701
31:46.890 --> 31:51.890
<v ->So when you look back at the audio landscape</v>

702
31:52.050 --> 31:56.820
and you think about getting started, and when was that?

703
31:56.820 --> 31:58.800
What year did you actually get started?

704
31:58.800 --> 32:00.060
<v ->December of 2017.</v>

705
32:00.060 --> 32:02.010
<v ->It's not that long ago really.</v>

706
32:02.010 --> 32:04.906
<v ->I say podcast years are like dog years though.</v>

707
32:04.906 --> 32:06.900
<v ->I mean, amazing though wwhat you've been able to create</v>

708
32:06.900 --> 32:08.970
in that time period, really.

709
32:08.970 --> 32:10.830
But what are the biggest challenges you think

710
32:10.830 --> 32:13.680
and opportunities facing creators today?

711
32:13.680 --> 32:15.000
<v ->It's stuff we've hit on already.</v>

712
32:15.000 --> 32:18.540
I think the biggest challenge right now is discoverability.

713
32:18.540 --> 32:21.420
I think it was a challenge back in 2017,

714
32:21.420 --> 32:25.470
and just as there have been more and more podcasts

715
32:25.470 --> 32:28.560
that have come as the space has kind of

716
32:28.560 --> 32:30.690
become more consolidated into networks,

717
32:30.690 --> 32:34.200
it is harder and harder for independent creators

718
32:34.200 --> 32:36.600
to get discovered and to make those connections.

719
32:36.600 --> 32:40.020
So I think discoverability is important.

720
32:40.020 --> 32:43.560
I think the unique benefit that they'll have is,

721
32:43.560 --> 32:45.870
and it's what I tell everyone is there's still stuff

722
32:45.870 --> 32:47.520
missing from the space.

723
32:47.520 --> 32:50.220
It's creating something new and something fresh.

724
32:50.220 --> 32:52.470
So when we started "Crime Junkie,"

725
32:52.470 --> 32:55.560
there was no show formatted the way that we're formatted

726
32:55.560 --> 32:56.708
where someone tells the story

727
32:56.708 --> 32:59.010
and then you have a co-host really like sitting

728
32:59.010 --> 33:00.540
on behalf of the listeners.

729
33:00.540 --> 33:02.010
There's a ton of those shows now.

730
33:02.010 --> 33:02.970
And so I always tell people,

731
33:02.970 --> 33:03.930
don't just create the thing

732
33:03.930 --> 33:05.280
that you like listening to,

733
33:06.240 --> 33:08.490
there's so much opportunity for uniqueness,

734
33:08.490 --> 33:10.980
and as we keep talking about AI,

735
33:10.980 --> 33:13.560
uniqueness and that human factor

736
33:13.560 --> 33:15.720
is gonna continue to be the advantage

737
33:15.720 --> 33:17.820
for someone new coming in, I really believe.

738
33:17.820 --> 33:19.323
<v ->Absolutely. Agreed.</v>

739
33:22.020 --> 33:24.390
<v ->So, there are challenges and opportunities ahead.</v>

740
33:24.390 --> 33:27.750
What's inspiring you today? So what's the message?

741
33:27.750 --> 33:29.130
We're running out of time a little bit,

742
33:29.130 --> 33:31.410
but what's the message that you want

743
33:31.410 --> 33:33.600
to leave the audience with?

744
33:33.600 --> 33:35.010
Like when you look ahead,

745
33:35.010 --> 33:37.350
what are the innovations that are happening

746
33:37.350 --> 33:40.110
that's exciting you, what technology is exciting you,

747
33:40.110 --> 33:43.290
like specifically within audio, like, where are we going?

748
33:43.290 --> 33:45.720
I said you're in the driver's seat, tell us.

749
33:45.720 --> 33:49.157
<v ->Well it's really inspiring as we talked about</v>

750
33:49.157 --> 33:53.550
to see the technology supporting all of these creators,

751
33:53.550 --> 33:56.880
whether it be musicians or podcasters,

752
33:56.880 --> 33:58.800
letting them find new audiences

753
33:58.800 --> 34:00.300
and really pursuing their dreams.

754
34:00.300 --> 34:02.280
I think that's incredibly inspiring, right?

755
34:02.280 --> 34:05.100
That just really wasn't possible

756
34:05.100 --> 34:06.900
before the advent of streaming I think,

757
34:06.900 --> 34:11.190
and increasingly with AI supporting that.

758
34:11.190 --> 34:14.820
But I think, I guess the most fun part of my job

759
34:14.820 --> 34:17.490
is just seeing all the great talent

760
34:17.490 --> 34:20.640
coming through our offices and our studios that

761
34:20.640 --> 34:25.140
whether it's a new band or a new show or a new podcast,

762
34:25.140 --> 34:29.220
I love discovering new audio and I can't get enough of it.

763
34:29.220 --> 34:31.890
So I mean, again, seeing people come through the halls,

764
34:31.890 --> 34:33.480
that's something that not everyone can do.

765
34:33.480 --> 34:35.533
I wish we could find a way to scale that.

766
34:35.533 --> 34:37.080
<v ->Your offices are the coolest offices.</v>

767
34:37.080 --> 34:39.850
<v ->It is really fun, lots of people crossing paths</v>

768
34:40.750 --> 34:42.870
in the lobby that you would never think would come together.

769
34:42.870 --> 34:46.500
So it is really special to be able to have that.

770
34:46.500 --> 34:48.420
And that's what we're looking to really bring

771
34:48.420 --> 34:51.690
to our listeners and in the way that we curate.

772
34:51.690 --> 34:56.690
And I think also just there's this epidemic of loneliness,

773
34:56.820 --> 35:01.410
and I think audio really plays a special role in that.

774
35:01.410 --> 35:03.900
And I don't mean for that to feel self-serving.

775
35:03.900 --> 35:06.990
I really do believe it's like what you talked about.

776
35:06.990 --> 35:10.170
You create this amazing connection with a listener.

777
35:10.170 --> 35:13.620
It's how you tell stories, and it's just fundamental

778
35:13.620 --> 35:16.830
to what we do every day at SiriusXM

779
35:16.830 --> 35:20.340
is find these opportunities to bring storytellers,

780
35:20.340 --> 35:24.900
to bring artists and musicians to our listener base.

781
35:24.900 --> 35:27.480
And it's really inspiring

782
35:27.480 --> 35:29.790
to get to be a part of that every day.

783
35:29.790 --> 35:33.720
And look, we're gonna continue to leverage technology.

784
35:33.720 --> 35:35.670
I mean, I think in some ways we think of ourselves

785
35:35.670 --> 35:37.470
as sort of the anti-AI,

786
35:37.470 --> 35:40.830
that we wanna be focused on human creation

787
35:40.830 --> 35:42.534
and curation of content.

788
35:42.534 --> 35:45.450
But there's certainly a role for technology

789
35:45.450 --> 35:47.160
like we talked about in terms of

790
35:47.160 --> 35:50.190
how we deliver audio to our customers.

791
35:50.190 --> 35:53.610
And for us, that means leveraging streaming in the car

792
35:53.610 --> 35:55.080
as a compliment to satellite

793
35:55.080 --> 35:57.780
to deliver more personalized experiences.

794
35:57.780 --> 36:00.960
I think there's real demand

795
36:00.960 --> 36:05.670
for live, linear content alongside time shifting

796
36:05.670 --> 36:06.750
and on-demand.

797
36:06.750 --> 36:08.880
And we can bring both of those together

798
36:08.880 --> 36:11.670
with our 360L listening experience.

799
36:11.670 --> 36:15.240
And it's easier than ever now with things like AI

800
36:15.240 --> 36:20.240
to allow for discovery in the car and outside of the car.

801
36:20.885 --> 36:23.460
And I think one of the things that's really exciting

802
36:23.460 --> 36:26.520
is to be working with great talent like yourself

803
36:26.520 --> 36:28.440
and have the opportunity

804
36:28.440 --> 36:31.200
to hopefully give you a bigger platform

805
36:31.200 --> 36:33.240
and have an opportunity to get

806
36:33.240 --> 36:34.980
in front of the SiriusXM audience

807
36:34.980 --> 36:38.490
and our loyal subscribers with different forms of audio

808
36:38.490 --> 36:40.830
that make sense for our service.

809
36:40.830 --> 36:45.150
And I think it's a really incredible opportunity

810
36:45.150 --> 36:47.280
to be part of SiriusXM,

811
36:47.280 --> 36:50.280
