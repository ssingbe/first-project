1
00:00.000 --> 00:02.917
(optimistic music)

2
00:11.280 --> 00:14.313
<v ->Welcome, everybody. Thanks for joining us.</v>

3
00:15.180 --> 00:18.030
I am Drew Schiller, I'm the co-founder and CEO at Validic.

4
00:18.030 --> 00:21.240
Thanks for coming to our panel and the future of funding.

5
00:21.240 --> 00:23.340
In addition to being the CEO of Validic,

6
00:23.340 --> 00:24.600
which is a digital health company

7
00:24.600 --> 00:25.830
that brings personal health data

8
00:25.830 --> 00:28.740
from digital health apps, wearables, in-home health devices

9
00:28.740 --> 00:30.360
into the healthcare system, I'm also

10
00:30.360 --> 00:31.920
on the Health Division Board

11
00:31.920 --> 00:35.850
of CTA, Consumer Technology Association, which puts on CES,

12
00:35.850 --> 00:38.550
as well as the Board of Industry Leaders.

13
00:38.550 --> 00:40.440
So really appreciate you all coming today.

14
00:40.440 --> 00:44.400
And just to kinda set the table, digital health funding went

15
00:44.400 --> 00:48.000
through a wild cycle over the last couple of years.

16
00:48.000 --> 00:50.040
And that's what we're really here to talk about today is

17
00:50.040 --> 00:53.220
to talk about, you know, what's gonna happen

18
00:53.220 --> 00:54.090
in the future, right?

19
00:54.090 --> 00:57.270
We saw startups go through a really challenging cycle

20
00:57.270 --> 00:59.400
of down sales.

21
00:59.400 --> 01:01.500
We saw a lot of valuation crunches.

22
01:01.500 --> 01:03.390
We saw a lot of down rounds.

23
01:03.390 --> 01:04.500
What's gonna happen in the future?

24
01:04.500 --> 01:07.530
And our panelists here are gonna help tell us

25
01:07.530 --> 01:09.630
what's gonna happen in the future.

26
01:09.630 --> 01:13.440
And in this panel, I've talked to my team here,

27
01:13.440 --> 01:16.170
and we have agreed to make this a little fun and engaging.

28
01:16.170 --> 01:21.030
And we are going to say the quiet parts out loud.

29
01:21.030 --> 01:23.760
And so what I mean by that is, I was

30
01:23.760 --> 01:26.557
in a conversation the other day and somebody said,

31
01:26.557 --> 01:28.717
"You know, the healthcare system's broken.

32
01:28.717 --> 01:30.300
"You know, we need to fix it."

33
01:30.300 --> 01:32.167
And I said, "Listen, I actually disagree with that.

34
01:32.167 --> 01:33.397
"The healthcare system's not broken.

35
01:33.397 --> 01:35.677
"It's working exactly as it's intended.

36
01:35.677 --> 01:37.687
"It might not work very well for you and me,

37
01:37.687 --> 01:40.987
"but it certainly works very well for the people at the top

38
01:40.987 --> 01:42.900
"and for the people who are perpetuating it."

39
01:42.900 --> 01:45.180
And that's the real challenge that we have to solve.

40
01:45.180 --> 01:48.210
And Rene Quashie said to me, who's head

41
01:48.210 --> 01:49.957
of Digital Health at CTA, said to me,

42
01:49.957 --> 01:52.140
"Whoa, that's something you wouldn't say on stage."

43
01:52.140 --> 01:56.610
And I said, "I bet you I will." (laughing)

44
01:56.610 --> 01:58.530
So that's what we're gonna do today in our introductions.

45
01:58.530 --> 02:00.990
We're going to, I'm gonna ask my panelists each

46
02:00.990 --> 02:02.520
to introduce themselves very quick,

47
02:02.520 --> 02:04.260
name, rank, serial number, what they do

48
02:04.260 --> 02:05.610
in digital health very quickly.

49
02:05.610 --> 02:08.590
And then, what is the unsaid thing that they are solving

50
02:09.688 --> 02:14.160
that maybe they wouldn't normally say in their introduction.

51
02:14.160 --> 02:15.910
So Megan, I'm gonna start with you.

52
02:16.890 --> 02:18.543
<v ->Challenge accepted, I guess.</v>

53
02:19.950 --> 02:21.690
Thanks for having me. This is super fun.

54
02:21.690 --> 02:24.180
I'm Megan Zweig, I'm the President and CEO

55
02:24.180 --> 02:26.430
of Rock Health Advisory.

56
02:26.430 --> 02:28.590
We exist to support enterprises

57
02:28.590 --> 02:31.260
with their digital health innovation strategies.

58
02:31.260 --> 02:33.540
Other parts of Rock Health, we have a venture funds.

59
02:33.540 --> 02:34.680
We're doing early investing.

60
02:34.680 --> 02:36.030
We also have rockhealth.org,

61
02:36.030 --> 02:37.930
which is our nonprofit, really focused

62
02:39.011 --> 02:40.740
on making sure that innovation

63
02:40.740 --> 02:43.170
and technology are closing equity gaps as opposed

64
02:43.170 --> 02:44.463
to exacerbating them.

65
02:46.740 --> 02:48.420
We were founded back in 2010

66
02:48.420 --> 02:50.220
and I think, at that time, there was a ton

67
02:50.220 --> 02:52.350
of skepticism about digital health.

68
02:52.350 --> 02:56.820
And so I think the unsaid thing was like,

69
02:56.820 --> 02:59.130
how do we even start to create this market?

70
02:59.130 --> 03:02.640
How do we even start to convince key stakeholders

71
03:02.640 --> 03:04.080
and health systems and health plans

72
03:04.080 --> 03:06.870
and life sciences companies that, you know, I think

73
03:06.870 --> 03:09.360
what was thought of as like the Silicon Valley bros,

74
03:09.360 --> 03:11.370
like have something to bring to the table.

75
03:11.370 --> 03:13.980
That like software is eating the world

76
03:13.980 --> 03:16.500
and yes, it's going to eat healthcare as well.

77
03:16.500 --> 03:19.860
And I think we decided to exist because we needed

78
03:19.860 --> 03:21.300
to bridge those worlds

79
03:21.300 --> 03:25.740
and figure out where collaboration made sense.

80
03:25.740 --> 03:28.650
Fast forward to today, I think we now exist really

81
03:28.650 --> 03:31.620
because there's still so much friction that exists

82
03:31.620 --> 03:34.770
between incumbents and between emerging players,

83
03:34.770 --> 03:36.723
small players, big players.

84
03:37.710 --> 03:42.630
And there's a lot that goes unsaid in terms of

85
03:42.630 --> 03:43.980
how are the cultures different,

86
03:43.980 --> 03:45.930
how are the capabilities different,

87
03:45.930 --> 03:48.000
how are the incentives really different,

88
03:48.000 --> 03:49.440
and that's gonna impact success.

89
03:49.440 --> 03:53.490
And so I think we really exist to help be a translator

90
03:53.490 --> 03:55.320
between all of these pieces

91
03:55.320 --> 03:57.510
and really always look at things from the perspective

92
03:57.510 --> 04:00.390
of the consumer, the patient, incentives aside.

93
04:00.390 --> 04:01.680
Like what is the world that we are trying

94
04:01.680 --> 04:04.500
to build towards and how do we get there.

95
04:04.500 --> 04:06.450
<v ->And, dude, by incentives, you mean</v>

96
04:06.450 --> 04:09.570
if it doesn't make ROI in plan year,

97
04:09.570 --> 04:10.770
it ain't getting funded.

98
04:13.110 --> 04:16.560
<v ->Hi, Ben Schlatka, I'm partner in Material Impact Fund.</v>

99
04:16.560 --> 04:19.200
We're a Boston-based venture capital fund

100
04:19.200 --> 04:22.650
with approximately $800 million under management.

101
04:22.650 --> 04:24.450
I'm proud to say before I joined

102
04:24.450 --> 04:25.860
that team, I was an entrepreneur.

103
04:25.860 --> 04:28.200
I'm up here with a lot of CEOs and leaders

104
04:28.200 --> 04:29.670
of great healthcare organizations.

105
04:29.670 --> 04:32.760
I led a digital health company for 12 years

106
04:32.760 --> 04:34.650
through an acquisition, and then spent two years

107
04:34.650 --> 04:35.490
at the acquirer,

108
04:35.490 --> 04:37.530
so I got to see the other side of what

109
04:37.530 --> 04:39.180
that journey looked like.

110
04:39.180 --> 04:43.020
I think one of the unstated, well, it's part

111
04:43.020 --> 04:44.430
of our mandate, but as it relates

112
04:44.430 --> 04:46.530
to material science innovation,

113
04:46.530 --> 04:50.670
and the tough tech ecosystem, we really focus

114
04:50.670 --> 04:52.320
on underrepresented health.

115
04:52.320 --> 04:54.810
So that could be access, that could be diagnostics,

116
04:54.810 --> 04:58.260
that could be care often through the combination

117
04:58.260 --> 05:00.810
of breakthrough devices that leverage some sort

118
05:00.810 --> 05:03.570
of material science along with analytics.

119
05:03.570 --> 05:06.150
And I'm proud to say that one of our portfolio companies

120
05:06.150 --> 05:08.820
and, by extension, teammates is up here on stage, Alicia,

121
05:08.820 --> 05:09.993
so I'll pass it to you.

122
05:11.040 --> 05:13.350
<v ->Thank you. Hi, everyone, I'm Alicia.</v>

123
05:13.350 --> 05:16.230
I'm the founder and CEO at BloomerTech.

124
05:16.230 --> 05:20.880
Our company is focused on heart disease in women,

125
05:20.880 --> 05:22.350
which is the leading cause of death

126
05:22.350 --> 05:23.820
and disability worldwide.

127
05:23.820 --> 05:27.120
And today, it is harder to recognize, diagnose,

128
05:27.120 --> 05:28.293
and treat it in women.

129
05:29.370 --> 05:31.950
We've created a wearable bra

130
05:31.950 --> 05:35.100
that collects data all around the torso

131
05:35.100 --> 05:37.770
in a medical-grade way.

132
05:37.770 --> 05:40.650
We call it a textile sensory intelligence,

133
05:40.650 --> 05:44.970
and we can inform cardiologists and patients

134
05:44.970 --> 05:47.220
about her heart, her lungs, her hormones,

135
05:47.220 --> 05:49.140
and her metabolism, right?

136
05:49.140 --> 05:51.870
So we're taking healthcare all the way over

137
05:51.870 --> 05:54.000
to the unspoken thing,

138
05:54.000 --> 05:57.690
which is the huge problem in the healthcare system

139
05:57.690 --> 06:02.370
of most of our system is designed around male physiology.

140
06:02.370 --> 06:05.130
It's not doing the work that it needs

141
06:05.130 --> 06:06.990
to diagnose women properly so

142
06:06.990 --> 06:08.550
that they can get the right intervention.

143
06:08.550 --> 06:09.720
It is seven times harder

144
06:09.720 --> 06:13.350
to diagnose a woman today with heart disease.

145
06:13.350 --> 06:16.050
So this is a huge problem.

146
06:16.050 --> 06:18.162
And I think when we look

147
06:18.162 --> 06:23.162
at the true unspoken things is the value that it creates

148
06:24.360 --> 06:26.280
to do female-specific solutions.

149
06:26.280 --> 06:30.210
Just last year, Shockwave Medical, which got a huge,

150
06:30.210 --> 06:31.920
I think, one of the largest acquisitions,

151
06:31.920 --> 06:34.560
if not the largest, they are the only ones

152
06:34.560 --> 06:37.530
that have done a female-only study

153
06:37.530 --> 06:40.470
of their technology, which is for an intervention

154
06:40.470 --> 06:41.610
to the heart, right?

155
06:41.610 --> 06:45.510
So the value of doing this is highly significant,

156
06:45.510 --> 06:50.310
and we're not looking at these industries how we should

157
06:50.310 --> 06:53.130
because of the potential of these untapped opportunities

158
06:53.130 --> 06:56.070
because we haven't served populations

159
06:56.070 --> 06:58.143
that are different for a long time.

160
06:59.310 --> 07:01.110
<v ->Yeah, I love that. Thanks, Alicia.</v>

161
07:01.110 --> 07:04.500
I mean, men's health has certainly served me well,

162
07:04.500 --> 07:06.030
but it hasn't served the rest of the,

163
07:06.030 --> 07:07.680
like the other half of the population, right?

164
07:07.680 --> 07:11.370
And I think that's exactly what needs to happen.

165
07:11.370 --> 07:15.300
Okay, so to start us off, Ben, so I've been talking

166
07:15.300 --> 07:18.660
to some friends of mine who are in VC, in fact one

167
07:18.660 --> 07:20.460
who recently switched VCs

168
07:20.460 --> 07:25.460
because the VC he was at raised a fund in 2018.

169
07:25.980 --> 07:28.110
And now, for the life of them,

170
07:28.110 --> 07:30.030
because they've been unable to return capital

171
07:30.030 --> 07:31.560
because of the market downturn

172
07:31.560 --> 07:34.830
in digital health, they cannot raise their next fund.

173
07:34.830 --> 07:36.540
They have no idea when they're gonna be able

174
07:36.540 --> 07:37.890
to close their next fund.

175
07:37.890 --> 07:41.190
And you know, I'm seeing this as a real trend

176
07:41.190 --> 07:43.920
and so I'm just curious, you know, do we expect there

177
07:43.920 --> 07:46.830
to be less investor capital in general?

178
07:46.830 --> 07:48.120
Like in digital health specifically,

179
07:48.120 --> 07:50.753
but maybe more in general, what are you seeing in that?

180
07:51.630 --> 07:53.070
<v ->Well, I'm gonna (clears throat) defer</v>

181
07:53.070 --> 07:55.980
to my esteemed panelists for some of the statistics

182
07:55.980 --> 07:58.470
'cause Megan is closely focused on this issue.

183
07:58.470 --> 08:01.830
But I can definitely touch on the macro point of view.

184
08:01.830 --> 08:05.040
If I look over the last two years, obviously,

185
08:05.040 --> 08:08.460
venture capital funding has come down significantly.

186
08:08.460 --> 08:11.040
If you look at new first-time fund starts, some

187
08:11.040 --> 08:13.500
of the lowest in years.

188
08:13.500 --> 08:16.260
If capital is being deployed, it's being deployed

189
08:16.260 --> 08:19.590
towards the top 10% of money managers who tend

190
08:19.590 --> 08:21.300
to have very large funds and who tend

191
08:21.300 --> 08:23.790
to have very mature companies

192
08:23.790 --> 08:25.170
that are staying private longer

193
08:25.170 --> 08:26.880
'cause the IPO window has closed.

194
08:26.880 --> 08:28.620
That money that's getting deployed there is

195
08:28.620 --> 08:32.820
definitely coming at the expense of new, exciting startups.

196
08:32.820 --> 08:34.860
So that's the cynical moment we're in.

197
08:34.860 --> 08:36.810
I think Megan might have some perspectives on

198
08:36.810 --> 08:38.730
where we may be headed on that topic.

199
08:38.730 --> 08:40.020
But that said, you know,

200
08:40.020 --> 08:42.240
I'll just use our firm as an example.

201
08:42.240 --> 08:46.083
We announced our third fund at the end of 2023.

202
08:47.550 --> 08:50.280
So you know, there was an example of first time,

203
08:50.280 --> 08:51.540
second time, third time fund.

204
08:51.540 --> 08:54.360
It was our largest fund, so definitely some momentum there.

205
08:54.360 --> 08:56.040
To mention partners, I just announced

206
08:56.040 --> 08:58.620
a $500 million crossover fund between biology

207
08:58.620 --> 09:01.440
and technology focused on life science tools.

208
09:01.440 --> 09:03.540
So I think for the right theses

209
09:03.540 --> 09:06.330
and the right teams, capital is still getting deployed

210
09:06.330 --> 09:07.950
to newer money managers.

211
09:07.950 --> 09:11.760
I think, also, I see in the seed and A-round deals,

212
09:11.760 --> 09:15.000
the newest of new capital still being deployed

213
09:15.000 --> 09:16.890
to innovative companies.

214
09:16.890 --> 09:18.090
There is still this view, though,

215
09:18.090 --> 09:19.920
that particularly in the digital health sector,

216
09:19.920 --> 09:23.070
if you raised a lot of capital and you got to a spot

217
09:23.070 --> 09:24.900
where your valuation was high

218
09:24.900 --> 09:26.910
and you hadn't quite proved out your business model,

219
09:26.910 --> 09:28.590
you hadn't shown a path to profitability,

220
09:28.590 --> 09:31.470
that's a really difficult spot for those companies to be in.

221
09:31.470 --> 09:33.150
Many companies, though, led

222
09:33.150 --> 09:35.370
by experienced entrepreneurs tacked into the wind

223
09:35.370 --> 09:38.070
and, you know, readjusted their operations very quickly.

224
09:38.070 --> 09:40.080
And I think those companies will come out the other side.

225
09:40.080 --> 09:42.390
I think about a little bit like my grandmother

226
09:42.390 --> 09:44.850
that grew up in the Depression and made it

227
09:44.850 --> 09:47.400
to '93, walked two miles a day and could beat me

228
09:47.400 --> 09:48.870
in arm wrestling till I was 30.

229
09:48.870 --> 09:50.520
Some of that was genetics, but I think it was a lot

230
09:50.520 --> 09:51.507
of the environment she grew up in,

231
09:51.507 --> 09:53.730
and I think the best companies come out

232
09:53.730 --> 09:54.903
of those environments.

233
09:56.040 --> 09:58.470
<v ->Yeah, you know, it's a really, really good point.</v>

234
09:58.470 --> 10:02.220
And I'm thinking that maybe underpinning

235
10:02.220 --> 10:03.210
what you said, I'm just curious

236
10:03.210 --> 10:05.520
if you could validate this or not.

237
10:05.520 --> 10:07.230
Maybe it's the first-time funds

238
10:07.230 --> 10:09.090
where their first fund was raised in 2018,

239
10:09.090 --> 10:10.620
they don't have an operational history,

240
10:10.620 --> 10:11.550
they haven't had the exits.

241
10:11.550 --> 10:14.220
Maybe they're the ones who are struggling more?

242
10:14.220 --> 10:16.050
<v ->I don't have primary data on it.</v>

243
10:16.050 --> 10:18.180
'cause it doesn't apply to us.
<v ->I'm asking for your gut.</v>

244
10:18.180 --> 10:22.200
<v ->Yeah, but I get the sense that if you've been out</v>

245
10:22.200 --> 10:23.850
in the market for a really long time

246
10:23.850 --> 10:24.930
and have a great track record

247
10:24.930 --> 10:26.850
and you're large, it's easier for sure.

248
10:26.850 --> 10:28.530
And if you're a newer fund,

249
10:28.530 --> 10:30.570
you definitely have a differentiated point of view.

250
10:30.570 --> 10:31.890
You have to have a great portfolio

251
10:31.890 --> 10:34.500
that, you know, LPs are excited about as you start

252
10:34.500 --> 10:35.640
to raise subsequent funds.

253
10:35.640 --> 10:37.230
But let's ask the expert.

254
10:37.230 --> 10:38.520
<v ->No, I'm good, I'm good.</v>

255
10:38.520 --> 10:42.270
What I'll add to that is when we look across industries,

256
10:42.270 --> 10:43.320
so not just in healthcare,

257
10:43.320 --> 10:46.650
there's incredible capital concentration among

258
10:46.650 --> 10:48.660
what are now deemed mega funds,

259
10:48.660 --> 10:53.660
so those funds that have at least $500 million to deploy.

260
10:53.940 --> 10:55.770
I think it was PitchBook, they reported

261
10:55.770 --> 11:00.770
that over 2024, it was something like nine funds raised 50%

262
11:01.920 --> 11:04.293
of all capital from LPs.

263
11:05.760 --> 11:07.500
Just looking at General Catalyst

264
11:07.500 --> 11:11.160
and Andreessen Horowitz, they raised 20% between the two

265
11:11.160 --> 11:14.910
of them of all capital raised by venture funds.

266
11:14.910 --> 11:19.500
So that is not some, we have not seen

267
11:19.500 --> 11:22.680
that degree of capital concentration in the past.

268
11:22.680 --> 11:26.730
GC, Andreessen also are huge investors in digital health.

269
11:26.730 --> 11:30.660
According to our tracking, they had the most deals last year

270
11:30.660 --> 11:31.860
in terms of any VCs.

271
11:31.860 --> 11:35.220
I think it was something like 14 deals plus each.

272
11:35.220 --> 11:38.850
And so I do think that to your point, there has

273
11:38.850 --> 11:43.320
to be true differentiation among the smaller funds in terms

274
11:43.320 --> 11:45.150
of what that value add is.

275
11:45.150 --> 11:48.000
I think the big funds, I mean they're huge power,

276
11:48.000 --> 11:50.070
huge networks, huge expertise,

277
11:50.070 --> 11:51.960
but they also really can tip the scale when it comes

278
11:51.960 --> 11:55.740
to terms and when it comes to the trajectory of the company.

279
11:55.740 --> 11:56.610
<v Ben>Agree with that.</v>

280
11:56.610 --> 11:57.450
<v ->Yeah, all right.</v>

281
11:57.450 --> 12:01.380
So let's expand on that a little bit more.

282
12:01.380 --> 12:03.390
I was telling you just before this

283
12:03.390 --> 12:06.220
that I heard this week from a VC

284
12:07.950 --> 12:11.760
that they have a digital health practice

285
12:11.760 --> 12:15.000
and they are now only investing in companies

286
12:15.000 --> 12:17.550
that are outside of the traditional healthcare system.

287
12:17.550 --> 12:20.280
Which kind of blew my mind when this is like

288
12:20.280 --> 12:25.280
the largest part of the economy of the largest economy

289
12:25.680 --> 12:27.300
in the history of the world. (chuckles)

290
12:27.300 --> 12:29.790
And then, they're trying to invest in companies

291
12:29.790 --> 12:30.623
that are outside.

292
12:30.623 --> 12:31.456
And I think you made a really good point,

293
12:31.456 --> 12:33.480
which I hope you'll make again around that.

294
12:33.480 --> 12:36.840
But what are some of the trends that you're seeing outside

295
12:36.840 --> 12:40.170
of my anecdotal surprise there with Rock Health?

296
12:40.170 --> 12:44.520
<v ->Yeah, yeah, so we track venture funding every year.</v>

297
12:44.520 --> 12:46.020
We're looking at funding that's flowing

298
12:46.020 --> 12:48.660
into US-based digital health startups.

299
12:48.660 --> 12:51.060
Our next report is gonna be published on Monday,

300
12:51.060 --> 12:54.240
so I can give you a little bit of a sneak peek on that.

301
12:54.240 --> 12:58.020
When we look at 2024, we saw about $10 billion

302
12:58.020 --> 12:58.853
that was invested

303
12:58.853 --> 13:00.900
in these US-based digital health companies.

304
13:00.900 --> 13:02.130
That's actually pretty similar to

305
13:02.130 --> 13:03.300
what we saw the year prior.

306
13:03.300 --> 13:05.280
It is much lower than what we saw

307
13:05.280 --> 13:07.380
in those peak years of '21, '22

308
13:07.380 --> 13:09.960
where we saw it was something like, you know, I think it was

309
13:09.960 --> 13:12.513
over $20 billion invested into the space.

310
13:13.860 --> 13:15.720
I think what's interesting, though, is when you look

311
13:15.720 --> 13:18.390
at the numbers compared to 2019, so using that

312
13:18.390 --> 13:22.890
as kind of like the pre-COVID benchmark year, the dollars

313
13:22.890 --> 13:24.870
that were invested this past year,

314
13:24.870 --> 13:27.000
if you look at it inflation adjusted,

315
13:27.000 --> 13:30.240
were essentially the same as what was invested in 2019.

316
13:30.240 --> 13:31.560
So we're almost kind of back

317
13:31.560 --> 13:35.163
into this pre-pandemic funding level.

318
13:37.020 --> 13:38.520
Couple interesting dynamics, though.

319
13:38.520 --> 13:40.770
One is that we saw more funding last year flowing

320
13:40.770 --> 13:42.120
into early-stage companies.

321
13:42.120 --> 13:45.090
So in '21, '22, there was so much capital available.

322
13:45.090 --> 13:46.590
You had a ton of these mega deals,

323
13:46.590 --> 13:48.660
these deals over a hundred million dollars.

324
13:48.660 --> 13:51.630
You saw the volume of those deals really shrink

325
13:51.630 --> 13:53.520
over the past year.

326
13:53.520 --> 13:54.930
So that brought funding numbers down,

327
13:54.930 --> 13:56.640
and you saw more investment going

328
13:56.640 --> 13:58.410
into these earlier stage companies, I think,

329
13:58.410 --> 14:02.550
who don't quite have those valuation hangovers relative

330
14:02.550 --> 14:03.690
to the companies that raised

331
14:03.690 --> 14:06.540
at really high valuations in '21, '22.

332
14:06.540 --> 14:10.170
So little bit of a dichotomy of, yes, still a ton

333
14:10.170 --> 14:11.700
of momentum and investment going

334
14:11.700 --> 14:13.500
into those early-stage companies,

335
14:13.500 --> 14:16.320
but at the same time you have capital concentration

336
14:16.320 --> 14:17.940
among venture funds.

337
14:17.940 --> 14:20.280
And also, we can get to this later,

338
14:20.280 --> 14:22.890
but I think that there's also a lot

339
14:22.890 --> 14:24.720
that's happening in the market

340
14:24.720 --> 14:29.610
that is creating, I'll just say, more power, more influence

341
14:29.610 --> 14:33.240
among like the Goliaths of the healthcare industry.

342
14:33.240 --> 14:36.870
When you think about who's building foundational AI models,

343
14:36.870 --> 14:39.030
who's even building a lot of those application layers

344
14:39.030 --> 14:40.770
on top, it is the big tech companies.

345
14:40.770 --> 14:42.750
It is the most well-funded startups that we see

346
14:42.750 --> 14:43.710
in the space.

347
14:43.710 --> 14:45.570
Part of that is driven by enterprise demand.

348
14:45.570 --> 14:46.680
They don't want point solutions.

349
14:46.680 --> 14:48.480
They want something that's gonna be able to integrate

350
14:48.480 --> 14:50.280
across all their AI use cases,

351
14:50.280 --> 14:53.700
so you see the Kamirs of the world, the Abridges

352
14:53.700 --> 14:55.680
of the world filling that need.

353
14:55.680 --> 14:58.470
And so I think there's this interesting dichotomy right now

354
14:58.470 --> 15:01.290
of, yes, investors are still really excited

355
15:01.290 --> 15:03.870
about early-stage innovation, but when you look at some

356
15:03.870 --> 15:06.000
of the big plays that happened this past year

357
15:06.000 --> 15:08.730
of the big pharma companies going direct to consumer

358
15:08.730 --> 15:11.910
for the first time with PfizerForAll, with LillyDirect.

359
15:11.910 --> 15:13.620
When you look at just the big tech companies

360
15:13.620 --> 15:15.540
and all the plays that they are making with Cerner,

361
15:15.540 --> 15:17.953
with Epic on the AI front, a lot of the big moves

362
15:17.953 --> 15:21.663
that we're seeing are really coming from those big players.

363
15:23.100 --> 15:24.450
<v ->Yeah, yeah, that's really great.</v>

364
15:24.450 --> 15:26.940
And you know, Alicia, I'd love to, you

365
15:26.940 --> 15:29.880
and I are kinda like living through this together, man,

366
15:29.880 --> 15:33.000
this like rollercoaster ride over the last, you know,

367
15:33.000 --> 15:34.650
four, five, six years, et cetera.

368
15:34.650 --> 15:36.030
I mean, I've been doing this for a long time,

369
15:36.030 --> 15:38.460
but it's been pretty wild to see like

370
15:38.460 --> 15:41.760
what happened 2020, '21, '22,

371
15:41.760 --> 15:45.420
and then like, whoa, just like bottom dropped out, right?

372
15:45.420 --> 15:46.620
And now, we're seeing the return.

373
15:46.620 --> 15:48.270
And Megan just mentioned a couple companies,

374
15:48.270 --> 15:51.180
I won't rename if you guys remember who they are.

375
15:51.180 --> 15:52.020
I'm not gonna say 'em again,

376
15:52.020 --> 15:55.623
but I'll just say like a hundred X revenue valuations.

377
15:57.390 --> 15:59.070
So we're seeing the return of some

378
15:59.070 --> 16:01.440
of these mega valuations now.

379
16:01.440 --> 16:04.080
And I'm curious, like, as a startup founder,

380
16:04.080 --> 16:06.360
as a CEO, as you're navigating this, like

381
16:06.360 --> 16:09.390
how do you think about steering the company

382
16:09.390 --> 16:11.880
through these like peaks and valleys

383
16:11.880 --> 16:14.193
of, you know, valuations and capital funding?

384
16:15.180 --> 16:16.650
<v ->Yes, thank you.</v>

385
16:16.650 --> 16:18.030
I think one of the things

386
16:18.030 --> 16:21.720
that we've seen throughout this roller coaster,

387
16:21.720 --> 16:25.140
as you call it, we've seen companies raise a ton of money

388
16:25.140 --> 16:28.920
and those rise and falls and people trying to figure out

389
16:28.920 --> 16:31.323
that sustainable growth strategy.

390
16:32.520 --> 16:36.840
For us, we were very clear since our inception

391
16:36.840 --> 16:39.930
that we wanted to grow with the company.

392
16:39.930 --> 16:42.330
And I think one of the things that hit me very hard

393
16:42.330 --> 16:46.020
at the very beginning was when my co-founder, we both met

394
16:46.020 --> 16:48.757
at MIT, told me at the very beginning,

395
16:48.757 --> 16:51.487
"Hey, we can't continue not sleeping

396
16:51.487 --> 16:55.173
"and doing like we're running a marathon,

397
16:56.197 --> 16:58.087
"being like we're running a sprint instead

398
16:58.087 --> 16:59.347
"of a marathon, right?

399
16:59.347 --> 17:01.897
"Like, we need to be more sustainable if we want

400
17:01.897 --> 17:03.600
"to take this for the long run."

401
17:03.600 --> 17:05.850
Because we chose to be in deep tech.

402
17:05.850 --> 17:07.740
We chose to be in women's health, which

403
17:07.740 --> 17:10.740
for a long time has been severely underfunded

404
17:10.740 --> 17:12.660
for hundreds of years.

405
17:12.660 --> 17:16.650
And we chose to build a physical regulated product, right?

406
17:16.650 --> 17:20.070
We wanted to validate something clinical

407
17:20.070 --> 17:22.080
with clinical quality.

408
17:22.080 --> 17:25.410
So this was not going to happen overnight.

409
17:25.410 --> 17:27.630
We needed time to collect the right data.

410
17:27.630 --> 17:31.696
We needed time to ensure that we create the value

411
17:31.696 --> 17:33.030
that we need.

412
17:33.030 --> 17:35.970
So for us, it was about getting the right partners

413
17:35.970 --> 17:38.970
at the right time so that we could deliver

414
17:38.970 --> 17:42.870
what we envisioned our company is going to become

415
17:42.870 --> 17:44.880
and how we're going to transform healthcare.

416
17:44.880 --> 17:47.310
So we went into finding the right partners,

417
17:47.310 --> 17:49.440
which means they have experience in cardiology

418
17:49.440 --> 17:52.260
and if they have experience taking technology out

419
17:52.260 --> 17:53.250
of the lab.

420
17:53.250 --> 17:56.268
And we did this, and to give you a little bit

421
17:56.268 --> 17:58.680
of the glance, right?

422
17:58.680 --> 18:00.720
Like, we met at MIT.

423
18:00.720 --> 18:03.000
We were part of MIT's Computational Cardiovascular

424
18:03.000 --> 18:05.880
Research Group and a program called Integrated Design

425
18:05.880 --> 18:08.130
and Management, which focuses

426
18:08.130 --> 18:10.200
on product design and development.

427
18:10.200 --> 18:14.340
And in 2017, we realized we should incorporate,

428
18:14.340 --> 18:16.110
'cause this is a huge opportunity,

429
18:16.110 --> 18:18.360
like the market is untapped.

430
18:18.360 --> 18:20.970
But we graduated in 2018,

431
18:20.970 --> 18:22.560
and when we graduated we focused

432
18:22.560 --> 18:24.810
on our early feasibility studies, all of this

433
18:24.810 --> 18:26.520
with non-dilutive funding.

434
18:26.520 --> 18:30.930
2020, we raised our first round, our seed round.

435
18:30.930 --> 18:32.760
We closed it in February.

436
18:32.760 --> 18:36.180
What happened in March? The pandemic.

437
18:36.180 --> 18:37.013
And bear in mind,

438
18:37.013 --> 18:40.350
we were building a physical product, right?

439
18:40.350 --> 18:42.960
And then, all of these roller coasters

440
18:42.960 --> 18:45.690
that you're talking about started to happen

441
18:45.690 --> 18:48.810
and we saw companies rise and fall, rise and fall.

442
18:48.810 --> 18:51.937
So I've kept in mind what my co-founder said,

443
18:51.937 --> 18:53.047
"This is a marathon.

444
18:53.047 --> 18:54.727
"We need to build sustainable growth.

445
18:54.727 --> 18:57.157
"We need to be laser focused on the type

446
18:57.157 --> 18:59.280
"of company we need to build."

447
18:59.280 --> 19:01.740
And I think that's how we've been able

448
19:01.740 --> 19:04.710
to go through these cycles and seeing everything

449
19:04.710 --> 19:06.450
that's happening and being mindful

450
19:06.450 --> 19:08.580
of getting the right partnerships, ensuring

451
19:08.580 --> 19:13.110
that we meet the ecosystem that we're building

452
19:13.110 --> 19:15.480
because we could use our sensor technology

453
19:15.480 --> 19:17.220
for different applications.

454
19:17.220 --> 19:20.130
We've chosen this area because we see huge trends

455
19:20.130 --> 19:21.720
and opportunities here.

456
19:21.720 --> 19:23.790
And just last year, it was announced

457
19:23.790 --> 19:28.790
that the femtech industry is worth $1.5 trillion.

458
19:29.580 --> 19:34.084
And heart disease is the largest challenge

459
19:34.084 --> 19:35.490
in those trends.

460
19:35.490 --> 19:38.760
So we do believe we're on the right track there.

461
19:38.760 --> 19:39.749
<v Drew>Go Bloomer.</v>

462
19:39.749 --> 19:40.710
(everyone chuckling)

463
19:40.710 --> 19:41.910
<v ->You know, I'll just comment on</v>

464
19:41.910 --> 19:44.640
what Alicia has said from an an investor perspective

465
19:44.640 --> 19:47.190
'cause she's powerful, but she's humble.

466
19:47.190 --> 19:50.820
This team is the definition of how

467
19:50.820 --> 19:54.810
to operate a lean, scrappy, aggressive startup

468
19:54.810 --> 19:57.150
while appreciating it's a marathon.

469
19:57.150 --> 19:59.430
I mean, the things that this team gets done

470
19:59.430 --> 20:01.230
with the resources that they have,

471
20:01.230 --> 20:04.320
given the environment, is best of breed.

472
20:04.320 --> 20:06.360
And I think, you know, that's a really tough choice

473
20:06.360 --> 20:09.120
if you have access to capital to make the choice

474
20:09.120 --> 20:11.670
that I'm gonna build the company in a very determinate way

475
20:11.670 --> 20:15.150
that is gonna grow with the milestones that I hit.

476
20:15.150 --> 20:16.410
And a lot of companies don't do that.

477
20:16.410 --> 20:17.490
A lot of CEOs don't do that.

478
20:17.490 --> 20:20.790
I think Alicia definitely stands out from the crowd in

479
20:20.790 --> 20:23.095
that regard and so does Bloomer.

480
20:23.095 --> 20:24.030
<v ->Thank you.</v>
<v ->Yeah, that's awesome.</v>

481
20:24.030 --> 20:27.210
You know, we've all heard the phrase unicorn, right?

482
20:27.210 --> 20:30.180
Which the startup with a billion dollar plus valuation,

483
20:30.180 --> 20:34.800
which Arlene Chung coined that phrase like 15 years ago

484
20:34.800 --> 20:36.840
in an article, intending it

485
20:36.840 --> 20:39.483
to say a unicorn is something you don't see.

486
20:40.515 --> 20:42.153
(chuckles) And then, it became like-

487
20:42.153 --> 20:43.947
<v Ben>Then a goal, it became a goal.</v>

488
20:43.947 --> 20:46.620
<v ->Then, it became a goal to become a unicorn.</v>

489
20:46.620 --> 20:48.990
She, yeah, I've had a really funny conversation

490
20:48.990 --> 20:50.520
with her about that.

491
20:50.520 --> 20:55.080
She was somewhat regretful about creating that goal,

492
20:55.080 --> 20:59.400
but the counterpart to a unicorn company

493
20:59.400 --> 21:00.233
that I think you're talking

494
21:00.233 --> 21:02.007
about, Alicia, is called a zebra, right?

495
21:02.007 --> 21:05.610
And a zebra is a company that is able to live

496
21:05.610 --> 21:07.590
within its own means, build within itself,

497
21:07.590 --> 21:09.810
build an actual real company.

498
21:09.810 --> 21:11.760
And so I really appreciate that.

499
21:11.760 --> 21:15.480
You know, Alicia, one tag-on that I'll ask you about is

500
21:15.480 --> 21:17.520
that one of the things that drove me most nuts,

501
21:17.520 --> 21:20.250
and fortunately it didn't impact Validic too much

502
21:20.250 --> 21:23.790
because, you know, we've been very thoughtful like you about

503
21:23.790 --> 21:26.310
how we take capital and deploy it.

504
21:26.310 --> 21:29.613
But this was really something that, I saw it

505
21:29.613 --> 21:32.490
with a lot of my friends who had raised big rounds, is

506
21:32.490 --> 21:37.490
that in 2021 and early '22, everything was about growth.

507
21:37.620 --> 21:39.270
And it was like your cash graph

508
21:39.270 --> 21:40.567
and it's like, "Oh, well, when you get to here,

509
21:40.567 --> 21:41.970
"we just raise more money."

510
21:41.970 --> 21:44.640
But as long as there was growth, right?

511
21:44.640 --> 21:49.260
And what that meant was that we could use venture capital

512
21:49.260 --> 21:52.320
to subsidize the cost of our product

513
21:52.320 --> 21:54.150
for the health system.

514
21:54.150 --> 21:56.760
The healthcare system was extremely stretched thin.

515
21:56.760 --> 21:59.940
Health systems, especially, weren't able to afford things,

516
21:59.940 --> 22:01.590
so there were free pilots.

517
22:01.590 --> 22:04.350
You know, you were selling things

518
22:04.350 --> 22:05.820
for whatever people could pay for it,

519
22:05.820 --> 22:07.740
which oftentimes was actually less than the cost

520
22:07.740 --> 22:09.240
of servicing the product.

521
22:09.240 --> 22:11.340
And that was all subsidized by venture capital.

522
22:11.340 --> 22:14.910
And then, what happened was 2022, mid '22 hit

523
22:14.910 --> 22:18.390
into '23, venture capital evaporated.

524
22:18.390 --> 22:21.090
And now, all of a sudden, you have a business model

525
22:21.090 --> 22:22.830
that just doesn't work in that environment

526
22:22.830 --> 22:24.270
and you can't raise any more capital.

527
22:24.270 --> 22:27.000
And so that's why I think we saw so many companies squeeze.

528
22:27.000 --> 22:29.220
So I'm curious, Alicia, if you saw any of that

529
22:29.220 --> 22:32.640
or felt any of that or like kinda what your perspective is?

530
22:32.640 --> 22:37.640
<v ->Sure, I think we definitely saw a lot of that, especially</v>

531
22:38.160 --> 22:40.800
how it hit people's payrolls and you see the layoffs

532
22:40.800 --> 22:45.240
and you see all of these things happening with many

533
22:45.240 --> 22:48.030
of the digital health companies

534
22:48.030 --> 22:51.270
that you either admired, looked up to.

535
22:51.270 --> 22:54.630
And you saw that they raised a lot of funding

536
22:54.630 --> 22:57.900
and that they were deploying and having a lot of engagement.

537
22:57.900 --> 23:00.660
And it seemed a lot like the tech bubble

538
23:00.660 --> 23:04.080
that happened even before that.

539
23:04.080 --> 23:09.080
So at the same time, right, like we're very

540
23:10.170 --> 23:11.910
into the evidence.

541
23:11.910 --> 23:15.900
And some of these companies also had this gray area

542
23:15.900 --> 23:18.720
of not having scientific papers published,

543
23:18.720 --> 23:22.380
of not having enough support for the outcomes

544
23:22.380 --> 23:23.640
that they were seeing.

545
23:23.640 --> 23:25.080
So some of the things

546
23:25.080 --> 23:28.890
that have vanished, you're actually kind

547
23:28.890 --> 23:31.470
of wanting more evidence.

548
23:31.470 --> 23:33.743
They spent so much money, how come if you have access-

549
23:33.743 --> 23:35.880
<v Ben>Are you saying they deserved it?</v>

550
23:35.880 --> 23:39.453
<v ->No, no, not. Eh, I wouldn't say that.</v>

551
23:40.350 --> 23:45.350
But I think it's good examples of how you can learn from

552
23:45.840 --> 23:50.840
what you see, so that you can avoid some of those pitfalls.

553
23:51.810 --> 23:56.810
I think it's something that for a long time because, right,

554
23:59.430 --> 24:01.320
like the more money you take, the more you have

555
24:01.320 --> 24:03.870
to deliver and return at the same time.

556
24:03.870 --> 24:05.520
And if you raised a ton of money

557
24:05.520 --> 24:07.800
before having the value in your product

558
24:07.800 --> 24:12.540
because you haven't figured that value yet, you're not going

559
24:12.540 --> 24:15.000
to be able to sell it at the price point that you need

560
24:15.000 --> 24:17.280
to sell it to deliver the money back.

561
24:17.280 --> 24:19.800
So it goes hand on hand.

562
24:19.800 --> 24:22.440
You have, again, you have to grow sustainably

563
24:22.440 --> 24:24.750
with your company to be able to sell and push it

564
24:24.750 --> 24:27.510
to the market when it has the right value instead

565
24:27.510 --> 24:29.670
of like not having the evidence.

566
24:29.670 --> 24:32.040
We're talking about people's lives and people's health

567
24:32.040 --> 24:33.390
at the end of the day, right?

568
24:33.390 --> 24:38.390
It's not just a tech product that will,

569
24:39.300 --> 24:41.160
yeah, you know what I mean.

570
24:41.160 --> 24:42.450
<v ->Yeah, no, totally. I totally agree.</v>

571
24:42.450 --> 24:46.914
And so Ben, I'm gonna transition to you because-

572
24:46.914 --> 24:47.747
<v ->I'm ready.</v>

573
24:47.747 --> 24:49.560
<v ->You know, Alicia just said, you know,</v>

574
24:49.560 --> 24:51.870
the mega valuations were starting to come back to it.

575
24:51.870 --> 24:56.870
AI is like all the craze, and I'm curious,

576
24:56.910 --> 24:58.920
and you mentioned, Megan, a couple

577
24:58.920 --> 25:03.030
of those companies, I'm curious

578
25:03.030 --> 25:08.030
how big of a role is AI playing in your investment thesis?

579
25:08.880 --> 25:12.930
And how do you even vet the companies and like

580
25:12.930 --> 25:14.550
what they claim are their technologies

581
25:14.550 --> 25:16.680
because it's brand new, a lot of it?

582
25:16.680 --> 25:18.900
<v ->Yeah, I certainly can comment on that</v>

583
25:18.900 --> 25:23.040
from our perspective, which by definition links the concept

584
25:23.040 --> 25:24.600
of AI to a physical product,

585
25:24.600 --> 25:26.040
which may be a little bit different

586
25:26.040 --> 25:28.740
than a pure play software company that's applying it

587
25:28.740 --> 25:29.760
to the healthcare system.

588
25:29.760 --> 25:31.410
So A, it's important.

589
25:31.410 --> 25:34.560
We have several investments where AI is critically featured

590
25:34.560 --> 25:36.150
in the business.

591
25:36.150 --> 25:39.090
If I think about healthcare broadly,

592
25:39.090 --> 25:41.730
my first segmentation would be is

593
25:41.730 --> 25:46.730
in a company using AI addressing an operational efficiency

594
25:47.010 --> 25:48.690
within the healthcare system

595
25:48.690 --> 25:51.360
or are they addressing a clinical need

596
25:51.360 --> 25:52.950
in the system with AI?

597
25:52.950 --> 25:54.240
And I guess, from my perspective,

598
25:54.240 --> 25:58.560
if it's the first, you ought to show up to an investor

599
25:58.560 --> 26:01.680
with an example that works if it's an operational efficiency

600
26:01.680 --> 26:04.410
and you can prove it because that is something you can do

601
26:04.410 --> 26:05.880
by the time you reach

602
26:05.880 --> 26:09.060
an institutional investment inflection point.

603
26:09.060 --> 26:11.670
On the clinical side, we sort of see it

604
26:11.670 --> 26:15.360
as it follows really good evidence generation.

605
26:15.360 --> 26:18.240
You can see AI applied to algorithms on the clinical side.

606
26:18.240 --> 26:20.070
I'm personally a little skeptical that

607
26:20.070 --> 26:22.470
in the near term, you're gonna see

608
26:22.470 --> 26:27.060
an FDA-regulated product where AI is suddenly just improving

609
26:27.060 --> 26:29.730
whatever the FDA certified.

610
26:29.730 --> 26:32.430
I think that's kind of a future state

611
26:32.430 --> 26:34.470
where regulatory frameworks have to evolve for

612
26:34.470 --> 26:36.750
where technology can be accurately applied

613
26:36.750 --> 26:38.790
to cost savings and efficiency elsewhere

614
26:38.790 --> 26:40.140
in the healthcare system, particularly

615
26:40.140 --> 26:41.610
on the operational side.

616
26:41.610 --> 26:44.273
Megan, you probably have some opinions on that, I think.

617
26:45.150 --> 26:48.690
<v ->Yeah, actually, I may have a question for like both</v>

618
26:48.690 --> 26:52.080
of you, which is, I heard something the other day,

619
26:52.080 --> 26:54.540
which is that investors are going to believe

620
26:54.540 --> 26:58.560
that companies are going to need less capital

621
26:58.560 --> 27:00.870
because if they use gen AI and all the machine learning

622
27:00.870 --> 27:03.390
and everything that we have available today, they're going

623
27:03.390 --> 27:07.440
to be able to build a company more quickly

624
27:07.440 --> 27:09.180
and with less capital.

625
27:09.180 --> 27:12.840
And so what it takes to build a digital health company

626
27:12.840 --> 27:14.970
now actually is gonna require less capital than

627
27:14.970 --> 27:16.980
when you like founded your company, for example.

628
27:16.980 --> 27:18.870
And so I was curious like how do you think about that

629
27:18.870 --> 27:21.630
from a CEO running your company where the tech stack

630
27:21.630 --> 27:24.570
that you probably originally built very different than

631
27:24.570 --> 27:28.200
what is required now and from an investor standpoint, like

632
27:28.200 --> 27:29.280
how are you factoring that in?

633
27:29.280 --> 27:31.110
And I'm not talking about the startups

634
27:31.110 --> 27:33.810
that are selling algorithms as their business,

635
27:33.810 --> 27:36.000
but every startup right now is thinking about

636
27:36.000 --> 27:38.940
how do I use gen AI capabilities

637
27:38.940 --> 27:41.310
to make my business more capital efficient?

638
27:41.310 --> 27:42.840
<v ->And just to be clear, you're talking</v>

639
27:42.840 --> 27:45.205
about the actual building of the company?

640
27:45.205 --> 27:46.038
<v ->Yeah.</v>

641
27:46.038 --> 27:50.760
<v ->Yeah, well, I'll say I don't think it's percolated its way</v>

642
27:50.760 --> 27:53.160
through the heuristics that investors use

643
27:53.160 --> 27:56.010
on what capital a company needs.

644
27:56.010 --> 27:56.970
At this moment in time,

645
27:56.970 --> 27:58.680
given all the things we just talked about,

646
27:58.680 --> 28:01.350
the much bigger statement is you have to be lean

647
28:01.350 --> 28:02.357
and you have to be efficient with capital

648
28:02.357 --> 28:03.750
'cause it's hard to come by.

649
28:03.750 --> 28:06.540
And that's probably the lowest common denominator

650
28:06.540 --> 28:07.560
in the perspective.

651
28:07.560 --> 28:11.490
But I'll say, organically, like over our 35 companies,

652
28:11.490 --> 28:14.280
I just, and I think about running a company 10 years ago

653
28:14.280 --> 28:17.790
and doing like marketing work and now watching like some

654
28:17.790 --> 28:22.170
of our portfolio companies, Alicia included, teach me like

655
28:22.170 --> 28:26.010
how they're so much more efficiently doing the mundane tasks

656
28:26.010 --> 28:27.840
of like building a great company

657
28:27.840 --> 28:29.490
that are functional in nature.

658
28:29.490 --> 28:32.940
And so what we see is more of like a cross-pollinization.

659
28:32.940 --> 28:35.340
Like if I see somebody developing amazing artwork

660
28:35.340 --> 28:38.670
and graphics for pennies instead of $50,000

661
28:38.670 --> 28:41.370
with a brand agency, I'd put that CEO in touch

662
28:41.370 --> 28:43.200
with five others that are at that inflection point

663
28:43.200 --> 28:44.550
'cause they're doing that kind of thing.

664
28:44.550 --> 28:45.383
And that's sort

665
28:45.383 --> 28:48.180
of percolating around our portfolio actively.

666
28:48.180 --> 28:50.370
<v ->Yeah, I think it's a really great point</v>

667
28:50.370 --> 28:52.200
and it's a great question.

668
28:52.200 --> 28:55.140
Just to give you my perspective quickly,

669
28:55.140 --> 28:57.750
so most of my friends

670
28:57.750 --> 29:02.750
who are digital health founders now are getting a lot

671
29:02.940 --> 29:05.100
further faster, which is actually good

672
29:05.100 --> 29:09.450
because right now, you know, it used to be seed funding was,

673
29:09.450 --> 29:11.430
or pre-seed funding was an idea.

674
29:11.430 --> 29:14.520
Seed funding was like maybe a little bit of revenue

675
29:14.520 --> 29:15.960
and certainly a product.

676
29:15.960 --> 29:18.780
And you know, series A was certainly like sub,

677
29:18.780 --> 29:22.350
if you were at a million in ARR, you were like definitely

678
29:22.350 --> 29:23.183
that was great.

679
29:23.183 --> 29:24.270
And everything is increased now.

680
29:24.270 --> 29:26.880
Like now, pre-seed you've gotta have a half million dollars

681
29:26.880 --> 29:29.220
and you like you have to have a product

682
29:29.220 --> 29:31.140
and half million dollars in revenue.

683
29:31.140 --> 29:33.750
And then, you know, seed funding, you've gotta have,

684
29:33.750 --> 29:34.647
you know, a million dollars.

685
29:34.647 --> 29:37.800
And A is like, you know, 3 million, maybe 5 million

686
29:37.800 --> 29:39.000
or at least eyes toward it.

687
29:39.000 --> 29:40.770
And like that's not exact.

688
29:40.770 --> 29:43.320
Like there's certainly categories where that doesn't fit,

689
29:43.320 --> 29:45.840
but you have to go a lot farther with less.

690
29:45.840 --> 29:48.270
And so I think AI certainly helps with that.

691
29:48.270 --> 29:51.660
I'll say from our perspective as a growth stage company,

692
29:51.660 --> 29:55.170
we're actually now uniquely looking at a spot where we think

693
29:55.170 --> 29:56.670
that we can double our revenue

694
29:56.670 --> 29:58.680
without increasing our headcount.

695
29:58.680 --> 30:01.950
And it's not because, I mean substantially.

696
30:01.950 --> 30:04.020
There will be certain roles like client success

697
30:04.020 --> 30:06.690
that we really need to continue to invest,

698
30:06.690 --> 30:09.900
but we are seeing so much more efficiency in other areas

699
30:09.900 --> 30:14.790
of the business that it's pretty impactful

700
30:14.790 --> 30:16.530
for us using AI internally.

701
30:16.530 --> 30:17.363
<v ->I think, and what you just said</v>

702
30:17.363 --> 30:20.370
about client success, I think, is really important

703
30:20.370 --> 30:23.490
because when you saw those incredibly high valuations,

704
30:23.490 --> 30:25.500
I think that there was this mistake

705
30:25.500 --> 30:29.760
that everybody was making of like digital health companies

706
30:29.760 --> 30:32.760
as a category are going to have SaaS-like returns.

707
30:32.760 --> 30:35.040
And so we're going to value it as such.

708
30:35.040 --> 30:37.800
And the reality is that we know healthcare is messy

709
30:37.800 --> 30:40.830
and complicated and requires so much change management

710
30:40.830 --> 30:42.780
and sustained change management.

711
30:42.780 --> 30:44.280
And so what I hear from a lot

712
30:44.280 --> 30:46.980
of founders is like, we're actually, yes,

713
30:46.980 --> 30:48.960
of course we wanna automate as much as we can,

714
30:48.960 --> 30:51.360
but we're never going to get rid of the services component

715
30:51.360 --> 30:54.180
of our business because that's how we are sticky.

716
30:54.180 --> 30:56.040
That's how we earn trust.

717
30:56.040 --> 31:00.060
That's how we actually change behavior and care protocols

718
31:00.060 --> 31:02.640
and practices and all the things that we need to do

719
31:02.640 --> 31:03.990
with our clients.

720
31:03.990 --> 31:05.340
And that actually has to be sustained.

721
31:05.340 --> 31:06.840
And that requires a change on the part

722
31:06.840 --> 31:09.150
of investors, I think, to figure out, okay,

723
31:09.150 --> 31:11.100
what are the margins of this business actually look like

724
31:11.100 --> 31:13.200
if it's not pure SaaS?

725
31:13.200 --> 31:14.340
And we're actually allowing

726
31:14.340 --> 31:17.790
for more variation in these different types of companies,

727
31:17.790 --> 31:20.340
whether there's a device involved, whether it is just SaaS,

728
31:20.340 --> 31:24.150
whether it's, you know, SaaS plus really embedded

729
31:24.150 --> 31:25.530
tightly partnered services

730
31:25.530 --> 31:27.510
because that's what the healthcare system needs

731
31:27.510 --> 31:30.060
from their partners to drive change.

732
31:30.060 --> 31:31.623
<v ->Yeah, yeah, absolutely.</v>

733
31:32.610 --> 31:35.370
All right, Alicia, we're talking

734
31:35.370 --> 31:37.200
about the future of funding.

735
31:37.200 --> 31:39.420
What is something

736
31:39.420 --> 31:43.440
that you wish every investor would know going forward

737
31:43.440 --> 31:46.740
for you about running a startup

738
31:46.740 --> 31:48.270
that would make them better partners?

739
31:48.270 --> 31:49.200
<v ->I think-</v>
<v ->Keeping in mind</v>

740
31:49.200 --> 31:50.970
that Ben is sitting right next to you.

741
31:50.970 --> 31:52.440
<v ->I think Drew's trying to end the panel</v>

742
31:52.440 --> 31:55.620
with some provocative debate.

743
31:55.620 --> 31:57.210
Alicia, I'm gonna close my ears. Go ahead.

744
31:57.210 --> 32:02.210
<v ->Yeah, something that I wish that partners like Ben knew,</v>

745
32:03.750 --> 32:05.133
no, no, just kidding.

746
32:06.240 --> 32:09.180
So yeah, like one of the things that we've seen

747
32:09.180 --> 32:10.560
in the last few years, right,

748
32:10.560 --> 32:12.540
and I'm just going to ask Ben a few questions

749
32:12.540 --> 32:15.420
since he was an entrepreneur before becoming an investor

750
32:15.420 --> 32:20.180
as he shared is if you could give us an example of

751
32:21.030 --> 32:23.613
when did you last launch your first product?

752
32:24.540 --> 32:27.747
<v ->We launched our first consumer product in 2012</v>

753
32:27.747 --> 32:32.747
and our first regulated healthcare product in 2016.

754
32:32.880 --> 32:35.910
<v ->Okay, and when you built that product,</v>

755
32:35.910 --> 32:37.083
where did you build it?

756
32:40.020 --> 32:43.470
<v ->Well, the team, one team, one roof.</v>

757
32:43.470 --> 32:45.807
Pretty much one big room and, you know, through that-

758
32:45.807 --> 32:47.310
<v ->All of you guys were together?</v>

759
32:47.310 --> 32:48.390
<v ->Yes in the-</v>

760
32:48.390 --> 32:50.130
<v ->Going to the office every day.</v>

761
32:50.130 --> 32:51.420
<v ->Every day.</v>
<v ->The traditional way</v>

762
32:51.420 --> 32:52.925
of the past.

763
32:52.925 --> 32:55.590
<v ->The traditional way of the past, yes.</v>

764
32:55.590 --> 32:59.250
<v ->So we closed around in 2020,</v>

765
32:59.250 --> 33:01.590
and things dramatically changed even

766
33:01.590 --> 33:03.480
if you're building a physical product, right?

767
33:03.480 --> 33:06.360
In the early days, for us, right, we were going

768
33:06.360 --> 33:07.260
with our masks.

769
33:07.260 --> 33:09.990
And fortunately, all of us were in Cambridge, Massachusetts,

770
33:09.990 --> 33:12.150
so we can go and take the physical product

771
33:12.150 --> 33:13.860
to someone else's house.

772
33:13.860 --> 33:16.200
We had to basically build labs

773
33:16.200 --> 33:19.110
in their houses so that they could work,

774
33:19.110 --> 33:21.090
so that we could test and validate

775
33:21.090 --> 33:23.460
and continue moving the company forward.

776
33:23.460 --> 33:26.730
So I think one of the things is investors look a lot

777
33:26.730 --> 33:30.390
at patterns and like what has happened in the past

778
33:30.390 --> 33:32.970
to project the future and all of the data.

779
33:32.970 --> 33:37.970
But we are living in dramatically different times right now.

780
33:38.070 --> 33:41.280
And the way that the company is run is differently,

781
33:41.280 --> 33:43.080
the way the talent wants to work.

782
33:43.080 --> 33:46.620
Some of the things we really have to do hands-on together.

783
33:46.620 --> 33:48.900
Other things, everyone wants to work remote.

784
33:48.900 --> 33:51.300
Everyone wants more flexibility, right?

785
33:51.300 --> 33:53.160
And you want to hire the right talents

786
33:53.160 --> 33:55.680
that really cares about what you're building

787
33:55.680 --> 33:58.380
and you want to also build a heart-healthy company, right?

788
33:58.380 --> 34:00.390
Like we are all about heart health,

789
34:00.390 --> 34:03.240
so we think about all of these things into

790
34:03.240 --> 34:07.110
how we wrap all of the different areas

791
34:07.110 --> 34:09.510
and departments of our company.

792
34:09.510 --> 34:12.330
And for me, it's really important

793
34:12.330 --> 34:16.080
that we don't get compared to companies

794
34:16.080 --> 34:19.530
that have done things differently at different times, right?

795
34:19.530 --> 34:21.630
Like we are living in really different times.

796
34:21.630 --> 34:25.410
We're also unlocking a new category

797
34:25.410 --> 34:27.750
in the cardiovascular industry

798
34:27.750 --> 34:30.570
because for such a long time, it's been universal.

799
34:30.570 --> 34:35.570
So for me, it's really important to kind of open

800
34:35.880 --> 34:40.880
to this new wave and how we can use AI, right?

801
34:41.820 --> 34:45.060
Like with our team, I think it's super important

802
34:45.060 --> 34:49.500
that we open new roles at the right time, right?

803
34:49.500 --> 34:50.970
Because in small teams, you need

804
34:50.970 --> 34:53.370
to have people wear many hats.

805
34:53.370 --> 34:57.270
The right tools, if you choose to have a subscription

806
34:57.270 --> 35:00.450
for some of these tools, Copilot, call it whatever.

807
35:00.450 --> 35:03.270
They can perform more than if you hire a new person

808
35:03.270 --> 35:06.510
that will need to ramp up.

809
35:06.510 --> 35:10.170
Or right now, they're spread thin, you actually have to hire

810
35:10.170 --> 35:11.280
that person, right?

811
35:11.280 --> 35:13.200
So making all of these decisions, we're

812
35:13.200 --> 35:14.550
in a different time, right?

813
35:14.550 --> 35:17.310
Like I think it's super important

814
35:17.310 --> 35:20.190
to think about these different patterns

815
35:20.190 --> 35:21.750
and look at it in a different way.

816
35:21.750 --> 35:23.010
What do you think, Ben?

817
35:23.010 --> 35:26.070
<v ->Well, so I agree with the facts</v>

818
35:26.070 --> 35:30.210
that building a regulated medical product

819
35:30.210 --> 35:32.100
over the trailing three years was

820
35:32.100 --> 35:33.690
a fundamentally different endeavor

821
35:33.690 --> 35:36.690
than doing it six years ago or 12 years ago.

822
35:36.690 --> 35:39.630
And I do agree that you have to, as an investor

823
35:39.630 --> 35:42.240
or an entrepreneur, look at that moment in time.

824
35:42.240 --> 35:44.910
I would say if we look at one of our host's books,

825
35:44.910 --> 35:47.190
Gary Shapiro, the title is "Pivot or Die."

826
35:47.190 --> 35:50.280
I actually do think, though, that, that is a universal truth

827
35:50.280 --> 35:52.320
and a heuristic for young technology companies.

828
35:52.320 --> 35:54.180
And I think you just gave a couple great examples of

829
35:54.180 --> 35:55.530
how you're doing it.

830
35:55.530 --> 35:57.300
That actually I don't think has changed.

831
35:57.300 --> 35:59.820
I mean, yes, the circumstances of the last three

832
35:59.820 --> 36:03.750
or four years are obviously unique in history,

833
36:03.750 --> 36:05.490
but the companies that are gonna survive

834
36:05.490 --> 36:08.793
that are gonna use the age-old adage, pivot or die.

835
36:10.350 --> 36:14.280
<v ->Yeah, and I'll just say that my best board members, just</v>

836
36:14.280 --> 36:16.801
to validate, Alicia, what you were, I think, saying

837
36:16.801 --> 36:21.300
about Ben, my best board members are the ones

838
36:21.300 --> 36:23.050
with actual operational history

839
36:24.060 --> 36:26.520
that have actually built companies first.

840
36:26.520 --> 36:29.790
Whether it's founded or at least operated

841
36:29.790 --> 36:32.970
at a senior level in them makes a huge difference.

842
36:32.970 --> 36:35.043
Those who came straight out of finance,

843
36:35.940 --> 36:37.993
we have some different conversations sometimes.

844
36:37.993 --> 36:39.930
(everyone chuckling)

845
36:39.930 --> 36:44.250
So wrapping-up question, you know, CES we're here.

846
36:44.250 --> 36:47.550
It's all about the future and robots

847
36:47.550 --> 36:48.850
that clean swimming pools.

848
36:49.710 --> 36:54.585
So 10 years from now, we are going like, let's just say

849
36:54.585 --> 36:56.460
that we're going to reconvene this panel.

850
36:56.460 --> 36:59.950
So without naming a specific company

851
37:00.990 --> 37:05.610
or anything like that, what is one area of digital health

852
37:05.610 --> 37:06.693
that you see will have,

853
37:06.693 --> 37:09.510
that you predict will have transformed the industry?

854
37:09.510 --> 37:11.250
And then, what's one area of digital health

855
37:11.250 --> 37:13.830
that was like completely overvalued

856
37:13.830 --> 37:15.330
and has totally bombed out?

857
37:15.330 --> 37:16.230
Megan, we'll start with you.

858
37:16.230 --> 37:20.343
<v ->Oh, goodness. (chuckling) Is AI a category?</v>

859
37:22.830 --> 37:23.663
Let's see.

860
37:27.750 --> 37:30.600
I think that if we do this well, I'm gonna come back

861
37:30.600 --> 37:33.100
to like the equity comment that I made at the top,

862
37:34.170 --> 37:36.300
I think that right now there is still a lot

863
37:36.300 --> 37:41.160
that is being built, which is built as intended

864
37:41.160 --> 37:44.550
as you said, to serve the incentives that exist.

865
37:44.550 --> 37:49.200
But too few people have access to great care.

866
37:49.200 --> 37:54.200
And I think we are at a real rocky moment

867
37:54.600 --> 37:57.090
in terms of the degree of trust

868
37:57.090 --> 37:59.730
that consumers have in the healthcare system.

869
37:59.730 --> 38:04.140
So what I hope in 10 years is that we have been able

870
38:04.140 --> 38:06.540
to leverage this for good,

871
38:06.540 --> 38:10.710
and I don't really mind where the innovation is coming from,

872
38:10.710 --> 38:12.900
if it's coming from the small players or the big players

873
38:12.900 --> 38:16.020
or the incumbents or newcomers.

874
38:16.020 --> 38:18.780
But I do think that we need to figure out what is going

875
38:18.780 --> 38:21.120
to build trust with consumers.

876
38:21.120 --> 38:24.270
Because right now, they're actually willing to go outside

877
38:24.270 --> 38:26.250
of the system, experiment,

878
38:26.250 --> 38:28.503
use these direct-to-consumer companies.

879
38:29.370 --> 38:32.227
You know, I was chatting with someone, they're like,

880
38:32.227 --> 38:34.417
"We're seeing like a rise in acupuncture

881
38:34.417 --> 38:35.640
"and naturopathic medicine."

882
38:35.640 --> 38:39.240
Like people really want different sorts of solutions.

883
38:39.240 --> 38:42.180
And so I think if we do this well, we kind

884
38:42.180 --> 38:46.107
of reinstate trust in whatever that system looks like,

885
38:46.107 --> 38:47.880
and that it is really serving those people.

886
38:47.880 --> 38:48.960
So I know I kinda cheated,

887
38:48.960 --> 38:50.400
I didn't really say like one thing.

888
38:50.400 --> 38:53.250
But I think that digital health really plays a role

889
38:53.250 --> 38:56.163
in creating that trust and access.

890
38:57.480 --> 38:58.777
<v ->I love that. Yeah, that's great.</v>

891
38:58.777 --> 39:02.766
All right, Ben, we got not much time left, let's go.

892
39:02.766 --> 39:04.800
<v ->Okay, I'll make it fast.</v>

893
39:04.800 --> 39:08.820
I think, prediction, looking out 10 years

894
39:08.820 --> 39:11.640
from now, all the major tech companies are gonna continue

895
39:11.640 --> 39:14.190
to invest in digital health infrastructure.

896
39:14.190 --> 39:16.230
But by virtue of their businesses,

897
39:16.230 --> 39:18.120
it's gonna be largely horizontal.

898
39:18.120 --> 39:20.430
And that's gonna leave a major opportunity

899
39:20.430 --> 39:24.330
to develop clinically specific care pathways

900
39:24.330 --> 39:27.060
for the home and chronic disease management

901
39:27.060 --> 39:30.090
because nobody here, if you're ill, would prefer

902
39:30.090 --> 39:32.130
to be in a hospital than your home

903
39:32.130 --> 39:34.770
unless it's for something incredibly acute like a surgery

904
39:34.770 --> 39:36.900
or an emergency room triage.

905
39:36.900 --> 39:38.760
So I think there's gonna be a great opportunity

906
39:38.760 --> 39:41.820
for companies that figure out that care pathway

907
39:41.820 --> 39:43.470
for a particular disease

908
39:43.470 --> 39:45.120
and build the right technology solution

909
39:45.120 --> 39:48.990
that will include sensors, data, and healthcare services.

910
39:48.990 --> 39:51.210
And I think something that, well, I won't go

911
39:51.210 --> 39:53.430
with the bomb 'cause I wanna give Alicia a chance

912
39:53.430 --> 39:54.960
to answer the question.

913
39:54.960 --> 39:55.793
<v ->No, thank you.</v>

914
39:55.793 --> 39:59.400
So prediction, I think women's health is human's health.

915
39:59.400 --> 40:02.280
We have done so much for male health so far

916
40:02.280 --> 40:03.660
and it's changed the industry,

917
40:03.660 --> 40:05.310
and women's health will change the industry

918
40:05.310 --> 40:06.630
for both men and women.

919
40:06.630 --> 40:07.920
So I think if we do this right

920
40:07.920 --> 40:10.200
where we're not doing like the pink tags

921
40:10.200 --> 40:13.230
where we're putting pink on a razor and it's the same thing,

922
40:13.230 --> 40:14.910
but we're actually going deep

923
40:14.910 --> 40:18.480
into changing the way we provide care for women.

924
40:18.480 --> 40:22.710
It's going to be significant the way that we improve quality

925
40:22.710 --> 40:25.980
of lives and the way that we build products in the future.

926
40:25.980 --> 40:29.940
And in terms of what's overhyped, I think a lot

927
40:29.940 --> 40:34.940
of services that we're seeing, right, similar

928
40:36.360 --> 40:39.150
to what I was saying about the pink tags.

929
40:39.150 --> 40:43.860
Replicating things just with a different catchy phrase,

930
40:43.860 --> 40:46.593
we're going to see those fade out more.

931
40:47.460 --> 40:48.690
<v ->That's great. Awesome.</v>

932
40:48.690 --> 40:52.620
Well, my prediction is that CES is going to be the place

933
40:52.620 --> 40:54.150
to see those futures.

934
40:54.150 --> 40:55.980
<v ->Agreed.</v>
<v ->So please keep coming back.</v>

935
40:55.980 --> 40:57.270
<v ->See you guys next year.</v>

936
40:57.270 --> 41:00.690
<v ->Yeah, and thank you all for joining us in this panel.</v>

937
41:00.690 --> 41:02.206
Please join me in thanking my panelists.

938
41:02.206 --> 41:03.039
(audience applauding)

939
41:03.039 --> 41:04.780
Yeah, we look forward to talking soon.

940
41:06.836 --> 41:09.503
(hopeful music)
