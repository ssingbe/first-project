1
00:00.000 --> 00:02.583
(upbeat music)

2
00:10.222 --> 00:13.740
<v ->Well, we are delighted to be here today</v>

3
00:13.740 --> 00:17.250
to dive into an incredibly interesting topic, which is AI,

4
00:17.250 --> 00:19.920
which is ever-present at CES this year,

5
00:19.920 --> 00:21.270
but specifically to dive

6
00:21.270 --> 00:22.800
into how it's changing consumer behavior,

7
00:22.800 --> 00:23.850
also consumer behavior,

8
00:23.850 --> 00:28.050
not just on a device, but in the content that we consume.

9
00:28.050 --> 00:29.790
So let me start, I'm gonna start by introducing myself.

10
00:29.790 --> 00:30.780
My name's Kevin Yalowitz.

11
00:30.780 --> 00:34.110
I lead our software and platform segment at Accenture.

12
00:34.110 --> 00:36.030
And throughout this panel,

13
00:36.030 --> 00:37.800
we're gonna dive into some really interesting data

14
00:37.800 --> 00:39.990
that we commissioned 18,000 consumers

15
00:39.990 --> 00:44.400
across 11 countries about how they are using AI,

16
00:44.400 --> 00:46.770
how they're paying for AI, and how they expect it

17
00:46.770 --> 00:50.430
to better their experience with both devices and content.

18
00:50.430 --> 00:53.640
And our four panelists here today are equally well-suited

19
00:53.640 --> 00:56.580
to comment on this from various different points

20
00:56.580 --> 00:57.870
of view in the industry.

21
00:57.870 --> 00:58.860
But just to give everyone a sense

22
00:58.860 --> 00:59.850
of how we're gonna cover this,

23
00:59.850 --> 01:02.970
we're gonna first dive into adoption of GenAI

24
01:02.970 --> 01:06.450
and specifically how end users are starting to use GenAI,

25
01:06.450 --> 01:08.760
their perceptions of whether they think they're using GenAI

26
01:08.760 --> 01:09.990
or whether they're not.

27
01:09.990 --> 01:13.200
And then specifically how they expect the experience

28
01:13.200 --> 01:16.650
of their entertainment to change as a result of GenAI.

29
01:16.650 --> 01:17.820
And then lastly,

30
01:17.820 --> 01:20.490
we would be remiss if we didn't touch on trust.

31
01:20.490 --> 01:21.660
So we're gonna touch on trust.

32
01:21.660 --> 01:23.310
So Paul, why don't I start with you for introductions

33
01:23.310 --> 01:25.380
and then we can go down the rest of the panel.

34
01:25.380 --> 01:26.213
<v ->Certainly.</v>

35
01:26.213 --> 01:27.450
Hello, I'm Paul Pastor.

36
01:27.450 --> 01:30.690
I'm the co-founder and chief business officer of Quickplay.

37
01:30.690 --> 01:31.860
Quickplay is a company

38
01:31.860 --> 01:34.140
that builds the OTT streaming services

39
01:34.140 --> 01:36.600
for Madison Square Garden, Yankee Sports Network.

40
01:36.600 --> 01:39.360
So we're the system behind all of your apps

41
01:39.360 --> 01:40.983
for delivering content.

42
01:42.300 --> 01:43.860
<v ->Hi, I am Shalini Govil-Pai.</v>

43
01:43.860 --> 01:45.460
I head up Google TV

44
01:45.460 --> 01:49.110
and prior to Google TV, I was at YouTube for many years.

45
01:49.110 --> 01:52.110
So been in the media space for a long time.

46
01:52.110 --> 01:55.680
I'm very excited about talking about how AI impacts content

47
01:55.680 --> 01:57.003
as well as devices.

48
01:57.960 --> 01:59.760
<v ->Hi everybody, my name is Anjali.</v>

49
01:59.760 --> 02:00.810
It's great to be here.

50
02:00.810 --> 02:03.540
I'm the founder and CEO of Diesel Labs.

51
02:03.540 --> 02:05.490
We're an audience intelligence company

52
02:05.490 --> 02:08.012
that creates AI-based panels to help all

53
02:08.012 --> 02:09.270
of our friends in the media

54
02:09.270 --> 02:11.790
and marketing space get intelligence almost

55
02:11.790 --> 02:13.743
within seconds in real time.

56
02:14.580 --> 02:15.420
<v ->Hello everybody.</v>

57
02:15.420 --> 02:16.740
Thank you for having me here.

58
02:16.740 --> 02:18.261
My name is Haohong Wang.

59
02:18.261 --> 02:20.888
I'm the general manager of TCL Research America.

60
02:20.888 --> 02:22.007
As some of you may know,

61
02:22.007 --> 02:25.200
TCL is the world largest TV maker,

62
02:25.200 --> 02:28.950
shipping more than 40 million TVs last year.

63
02:28.950 --> 02:33.900
In the last two years, we made a quite good progress on AI

64
02:33.900 --> 02:35.430
and the streaming services.

65
02:35.430 --> 02:37.930
For the streaming services, in the last two years,

66
02:39.439 --> 02:42.090
we make a growth about 100 times

67
02:42.090 --> 02:46.590
and we launched seven AI-based films last year.

68
02:46.590 --> 02:47.670
Thank you.

69
02:47.670 --> 02:50.490
<v ->And two of our panelists</v>

70
02:50.490 --> 02:52.560
have had a great relationship here at CES

71
02:52.560 --> 02:55.200
with an pretty interesting product announcement

72
02:55.200 --> 02:57.840
of Google TV, Gemini on TCO.

73
02:57.840 --> 02:58.673
It's very cool.

74
02:58.673 --> 02:59.506
<v ->That's right.</v>

75
02:59.506 --> 03:00.339
<v ->Very cool.</v>

76
03:00.339 --> 03:02.970
Okay, so let's dive in specifically to adoption.

77
03:02.970 --> 03:06.210
So as I mentioned, this broad based consumer study

78
03:06.210 --> 03:08.520
that we did had some particularly interesting findings,

79
03:08.520 --> 03:11.310
some frankly that really surprised me.

80
03:11.310 --> 03:14.370
But first and foremost, we found that roughly two thirds

81
03:14.370 --> 03:18.420
of consumers are comfortable and familiar with GenAI.

82
03:18.420 --> 03:19.920
It's not all that surprising.

83
03:19.920 --> 03:22.369
Interestingly though, 32% of those,

84
03:22.369 --> 03:24.060
or roughly 32%, so roughly half of

85
03:24.060 --> 03:26.880
that are using GenAI on a weekly basis.

86
03:26.880 --> 03:29.970
And of that subset are 5x more likely

87
03:29.970 --> 03:32.880
to actually be paying for a GenAI tool.

88
03:32.880 --> 03:34.200
And we can't really see the audience,

89
03:34.200 --> 03:36.210
but I would love to take just a quick poll.

90
03:36.210 --> 03:39.360
Raise your hand if you are paying for a GenAI tool

91
03:39.360 --> 03:40.193
of some sort,

92
03:40.193 --> 03:41.283
personal or professional.

93
03:42.960 --> 03:46.050
That probably squares with our numbers, about a third.

94
03:46.050 --> 03:48.870
What's interesting is, as we dove into this further,

95
03:48.870 --> 03:51.150
is that we found that the exposure

96
03:51.150 --> 03:54.000
that consumers think they have to GenAI,

97
03:54.000 --> 03:56.032
it's their perception, is actually really high.

98
03:56.032 --> 03:58.530
So within search, they think 60%

99
03:58.530 --> 04:01.530
of the content they see in search is generative AI,

100
04:01.530 --> 04:02.940
40% in music,

101
04:02.940 --> 04:05.460
which is actually equally interesting is GenAI.

102
04:05.460 --> 04:07.380
And even more interestingly,

103
04:07.380 --> 04:10.050
40% of consumers believe they can detect

104
04:10.050 --> 04:13.080
what content is generative or what isn't,

105
04:13.080 --> 04:14.010
which is actually pretty impressive

106
04:14.010 --> 04:16.770
'cause I don't think I could do that 40% of the time.

107
04:16.770 --> 04:21.060
But Shalini, I wanna start with you specifically.

108
04:21.060 --> 04:26.060
Based off of this dynamic between perceptions and behavior

109
04:26.130 --> 04:27.210
and this somewhat disconnect

110
04:27.210 --> 04:29.013
of being able to actually identify,

111
04:29.999 --> 04:33.090
how can we help consumers really engage

112
04:33.090 --> 04:35.430
with GenAI knowing that they may

113
04:35.430 --> 04:37.863
or may not be seeing generative content?

114
04:39.750 --> 04:42.540
<v ->Yeah, I think it's a good question.</v>

115
04:42.540 --> 04:45.510
I would say, like, AI is not new.

116
04:45.510 --> 04:47.370
AI has been been around for a while.

117
04:47.370 --> 04:48.203
<v ->For sure.</v>

118
04:48.203 --> 04:51.630
<v ->And this wave of AI is what we call generative,</v>

119
04:51.630 --> 04:54.360
which is, you know, it can actually generate summaries,

120
04:54.360 --> 04:57.420
it can generate content, it can generate text.

121
04:57.420 --> 04:59.010
And so that's the difference.

122
04:59.010 --> 05:00.810
Like, this is the first time that we've actually been able

123
05:00.810 --> 05:03.540
to get computers to generate things.

124
05:03.540 --> 05:07.410
And I would say maybe two years ago, when it launched,

125
05:07.410 --> 05:09.240
you know, with ChatGPT,

126
05:09.240 --> 05:12.300
there was a lot of hallucinations that were happening.

127
05:12.300 --> 05:14.610
And so there was this like, "Oh my gosh,

128
05:14.610 --> 05:15.600
what's gonna happen?

129
05:15.600 --> 05:17.280
But it's all gonna be crazy

130
05:17.280 --> 05:20.100
'cause you're not gonna know what's fake and what's real."

131
05:20.100 --> 05:21.120
But what we're seeing is

132
05:21.120 --> 05:23.520
that the models are getting much more intelligent,

133
05:23.520 --> 05:28.050
much more grounded, and a lot of focus on making sure that

134
05:28.050 --> 05:31.023
what we're providing is actually accurate and true.

135
05:31.950 --> 05:33.390
And so I think that that's

136
05:33.390 --> 05:35.490
why we're seeing people getting more comfortable

137
05:35.490 --> 05:37.920
with this concept of, "Hey, maybe this is something

138
05:37.920 --> 05:40.560
that can actually provide value."

139
05:40.560 --> 05:44.370
And I think that in terms of how users actually get it,

140
05:44.370 --> 05:46.530
for us it's a lot about, you know,

141
05:46.530 --> 05:49.770
paradigms that people are already very used to.

142
05:49.770 --> 05:51.240
For example, search.

143
05:51.240 --> 05:53.280
If you think of Google search, like we have, what,

144
05:53.280 --> 05:56.850
3 billion plus users who use it on a daily basis.

145
05:56.850 --> 05:59.760
And just yesterday I wanted to play craps

146
05:59.760 --> 06:01.230
and so I went into Google search,

147
06:01.230 --> 06:03.960
I've never played craps before, and I went into search

148
06:03.960 --> 06:05.580
and I said, "Hey, what is, you know,

149
06:05.580 --> 06:08.190
tell me about probabilities and craps."

150
06:08.190 --> 06:10.500
And I got an AI-generated overview,

151
06:10.500 --> 06:13.380
it's very clearly flagged it's AI generated,

152
06:13.380 --> 06:16.260
but it gave me the summary of how the probabilities

153
06:16.260 --> 06:19.890
of the dice work, why seven is the most probable, et cetera.

154
06:19.890 --> 06:21.450
And then it gave me all the links

155
06:21.450 --> 06:24.000
that you would expect from regular search.

156
06:24.000 --> 06:26.490
And you know, it was just so phenomenal.

157
06:26.490 --> 06:28.200
I actually went and played last night based

158
06:28.200 --> 06:29.940
on all of this research.

159
06:29.940 --> 06:30.773
<v ->How did you do?</v>

160
06:30.773 --> 06:31.606
<v ->Yeah, I was gonna say.</v>

161
06:31.606 --> 06:32.439
(Shalini laughing)

162
06:32.439 --> 06:34.260
<v ->Well you know, the house always wins, so...</v>

163
06:34.260 --> 06:36.501
<v ->Yeah, right, right, right.</v>

164
06:36.501 --> 06:39.396
<v ->But I did play for two hours, so...</v>

165
06:39.396 --> 06:41.940
But you know, my point being, like, those are the ways

166
06:41.940 --> 06:43.770
that I think people are gonna get comfortable

167
06:43.770 --> 06:47.430
with it is like, "Oh, I use it in my regular day-to-day.

168
06:47.430 --> 06:50.310
And yeah, it's actually very, very helpful."

169
06:50.310 --> 06:51.990
And I think that's how consumers

170
06:51.990 --> 06:53.640
are gonna really take it mainstream.

171
06:53.640 --> 06:54.510
<v ->Yeah, Anjali, how about you?</v>

172
06:54.510 --> 06:55.343
What's your perspective?

173
06:55.343 --> 06:57.150
<v ->I completely second the motion</v>

174
06:57.150 --> 07:00.060
and I think that from my perspective,

175
07:00.060 --> 07:01.530
I also think there's something really interesting

176
07:01.530 --> 07:05.220
about almost being thrown into it professionally speaking,

177
07:05.220 --> 07:07.950
which is making me even more comfortable as a consumer.

178
07:07.950 --> 07:10.380
So there's something interesting about the fact that,

179
07:10.380 --> 07:13.800
for example, what we do is we will leverage all

180
07:13.800 --> 07:17.130
of these wonderful tools, Gemini, ChatGPT, et cetera,

181
07:17.130 --> 07:19.560
to create essentially, you know,

182
07:19.560 --> 07:21.690
bespoke but bleeding edge tools

183
07:21.690 --> 07:24.720
for our clients in the marketing and media space.

184
07:24.720 --> 07:27.030
That means now instead of waiting a few weeks

185
07:27.030 --> 07:29.070
to be able to engage with a focus group

186
07:29.070 --> 07:30.510
of you're a target consumer,

187
07:30.510 --> 07:31.950
you can do it instantaneously

188
07:31.950 --> 07:33.930
while you're on the train live, asking questions,

189
07:33.930 --> 07:36.750
what did my audience think about X or Y

190
07:36.750 --> 07:39.330
and get back responses right away.

191
07:39.330 --> 07:43.290
And so that has accelerated my own comfort level

192
07:43.290 --> 07:44.123
and adoption.

193
07:44.123 --> 07:46.440
So when I have experiences like the one Shalini was talking

194
07:46.440 --> 07:49.233
about within Google search for example,

195
07:50.460 --> 07:51.900
you start to see the parallels

196
07:51.900 --> 07:54.180
of how this technology can really impact not only

197
07:54.180 --> 07:57.022
what we're doing professionally, but also personally.

198
07:57.022 --> 07:58.268
<v ->Yeah, so in a way it's a flywheel,</v>

199
07:58.268 --> 08:00.390
the adoption drives experience

200
08:00.390 --> 08:02.070
and experience drives further adoption.

201
08:02.070 --> 08:03.058
<v Anjali>Yeah, I think that's right.</v>

202
08:03.058 --> 08:03.891
And it's like, you know,

203
08:03.891 --> 08:05.970
every time we have better and better experiences

204
08:05.970 --> 08:09.300
and with the technology getting so much more robust

205
08:09.300 --> 08:11.560
and so much more accurate, I think that it's sort of a,

206
08:11.560 --> 08:12.660
like, if you build it,

207
08:12.660 --> 08:13.860
they will come kind of...
<v ->Yeah.</v>

208
08:13.860 --> 08:14.693
Yeah.

209
08:14.693 --> 08:17.220
Haohong, how about for you from a TCO perspective?

210
08:17.220 --> 08:18.053
<v ->Yes.</v>

211
08:18.053 --> 08:20.160
As you know that because we have to,

212
08:20.160 --> 08:22.050
you know, bring the best experience

213
08:22.050 --> 08:24.630
to our large volume users.

214
08:24.630 --> 08:27.510
That's a recently, as you know, that we launched

215
08:27.510 --> 08:32.510
with Google together the Gemini AI into our TVs, right?

216
08:32.640 --> 08:34.290
We think this is the best experience

217
08:34.290 --> 08:37.740
that we can provide it with Google to our audiences.

218
08:37.740 --> 08:41.340
We are also the first, actually many, many years ago,

219
08:41.340 --> 08:44.640
first to put the Google assistant on our TV.

220
08:44.640 --> 08:47.820
Actually I would say this is an upgraded version.

221
08:47.820 --> 08:50.130
At that time when you say Google assistant at that time,

222
08:50.130 --> 08:52.230
I can easily tell which is AI generated,

223
08:52.230 --> 08:53.400
which is not AI generated.

224
08:53.400 --> 08:56.400
But with this latest GenAI technology,

225
08:56.400 --> 08:59.910
I believe very soon you cannot tell easily,

226
08:59.910 --> 09:01.517
you know, what is generated,

227
09:01.517 --> 09:03.660
'cause some of the content that are generated

228
09:03.660 --> 09:07.350
by AI may be better than a normal consumer, right?

229
09:07.350 --> 09:10.950
'Cause sometimes something is coming out of box, you know,

230
09:10.950 --> 09:15.300
you never imagine that so smart this AI can be, right?

231
09:15.300 --> 09:19.410
So I believe this GenAI brings a lot of curiosity,

232
09:19.410 --> 09:21.540
you know, for our audiences

233
09:21.540 --> 09:23.520
because you can imagine today,

234
09:23.520 --> 09:27.240
every people that can express themselves using some

235
09:27.240 --> 09:29.070
of the prompts that you can generate,

236
09:29.070 --> 09:31.710
text, image, video, and so on, right?

237
09:31.710 --> 09:34.410
So that's a amazing part that we can see.

238
09:34.410 --> 09:35.477
And we tried that

239
09:35.477 --> 09:39.720
to put our AI films onto our streaming services,

240
09:39.720 --> 09:40.920
you know, last year.

241
09:40.920 --> 09:43.110
I have something to report to you guys.

242
09:43.110 --> 09:44.820
You know, it's surprisingly,

243
09:44.820 --> 09:47.460
you know, overwhelmingly successful

244
09:47.460 --> 09:50.700
because you can see that all the AI films,

245
09:50.700 --> 09:52.620
the finishing rate,

246
09:52.620 --> 09:56.040
the playback completion rate is about 50%,

247
09:56.040 --> 09:57.240
which is unbelievable.

248
09:57.240 --> 09:59.130
Of course, you can say, "Hey, because it's a shot,

249
09:59.130 --> 10:00.600
it's five to 10 minutes."

250
10:00.600 --> 10:03.150
But also the frequency of the viewings

251
10:03.150 --> 10:05.070
of that is on the top list.

252
10:05.070 --> 10:06.780
So we can see that.

253
10:06.780 --> 10:10.020
I can see that a lot of good user engagement

254
10:10.020 --> 10:13.590
with AI-based storytelling is going on.

255
10:13.590 --> 10:16.440
I think AI will evolve to get a better experience

256
10:16.440 --> 10:18.270
for our consumers.

257
10:18.270 --> 10:19.290
<v ->Interesting.</v>

258
10:19.290 --> 10:22.200
And Paul, I mean, you're the enabler in many cases.

259
10:22.200 --> 10:24.000
I mean, how do you view this?

260
10:24.000 --> 10:24.833
<v ->Yeah, sure.</v>

261
10:24.833 --> 10:26.400
So grounding my answer a bit in our industry, right?

262
10:26.400 --> 10:28.320
One is from a creator perspective, right,

263
10:28.320 --> 10:30.240
and a creator community,

264
10:30.240 --> 10:32.640
I think this is an incredible tool.

265
10:32.640 --> 10:36.000
And we used to be the province of movies

266
10:36.000 --> 10:37.500
and then through "Game of Thrones",

267
10:37.500 --> 10:38.700
we brought in amazing graphics

268
10:38.700 --> 10:41.010
into television is now actually in the hands

269
10:41.010 --> 10:42.570
of literally everyday consumers

270
10:42.570 --> 10:46.110
and influencers and users to create incredible stories

271
10:46.110 --> 10:48.750
and incredible content and leverage all of that.

272
10:48.750 --> 10:51.510
Now what was interesting is also in your stat

273
10:51.510 --> 10:53.910
that 43% said they could tell the difference.

274
10:53.910 --> 10:55.170
And I will tell you, over the holidays,

275
10:55.170 --> 10:56.670
I was playing on my own feed

276
10:56.670 --> 10:59.220
and I saw something from "America's Got Talent"

277
10:59.220 --> 11:00.690
and they were watching all these singers

278
11:00.690 --> 11:02.790
and dancers turn into animals.

279
11:02.790 --> 11:05.580
And because somebody interposed that

280
11:05.580 --> 11:08.310
with real live reactions from the show,

281
11:08.310 --> 11:09.840
it took me a moment to understand

282
11:09.840 --> 11:11.340
what I was watching, right?

283
11:11.340 --> 11:13.500
So I don't know if consumers really,

284
11:13.500 --> 11:15.990
really understand what they see.

285
11:15.990 --> 11:17.700
But then from a distributor perspective,

286
11:17.700 --> 11:19.320
I think it's really interesting this partnership

287
11:19.320 --> 11:21.240
that Google's put together with TCL

288
11:21.240 --> 11:23.580
because the enablement on discovery

289
11:23.580 --> 11:25.320
that AI can potentially enable

290
11:25.320 --> 11:27.090
is gonna be tremendous, right?

291
11:27.090 --> 11:29.730
Something that's absolutely personalized, well understood,

292
11:29.730 --> 11:32.610
and comprehended and makes my, you know,

293
11:32.610 --> 11:36.150
we know a consumer spends 23 minutes a day searching

294
11:36.150 --> 11:38.435
for a piece of content just trying to figure out

295
11:38.435 --> 11:39.930
what to watch.

296
11:39.930 --> 11:42.210
In the acceleration of this partnership, right,

297
11:42.210 --> 11:44.790
you can reduce that and actually spend more time.

298
11:44.790 --> 11:45.623
And guess what?

299
11:45.623 --> 11:47.340
For the media company, they're making more money

300
11:47.340 --> 11:48.990
'cause they're putting more ads forward.

301
11:48.990 --> 11:50.730
You're spending more time with their product.

302
11:50.730 --> 11:53.160
So there's huge advances that are happening

303
11:53.160 --> 11:55.110
through this user experience in AI.

304
11:55.110 --> 11:57.030
<v ->Yeah, and that's a great, great example</v>

305
11:57.030 --> 12:00.000
of how we can educate consumers to adopt

306
12:00.000 --> 12:03.090
or to see the benefits of GenAI sort

307
12:03.090 --> 12:04.590
of being baked into the experience.

308
12:04.590 --> 12:06.840
I mean, I think it'd be interesting, Anjali,

309
12:06.840 --> 12:07.673
to talk a little bit

310
12:07.673 --> 12:09.540
from your perspective talking with consumers.

311
12:09.540 --> 12:11.520
How do we go about educating them in a way

312
12:11.520 --> 12:13.860
that I think we have to be careful, right?

313
12:13.860 --> 12:15.300
I mean, consumers are smart

314
12:15.300 --> 12:16.920
and you know, how do you recognize that

315
12:16.920 --> 12:18.990
and balance that with some of the unknown?

316
12:18.990 --> 12:19.823
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

317
12:19.823 --> 12:22.350
And just before I jump into that, I'll put a quick plugin

318
12:22.350 --> 12:25.080
'cause one of the hack week projects we did a little

319
12:25.080 --> 12:27.480
while ago is to create essentially a TV guide

320
12:27.480 --> 12:28.380
'cause I don't know about you guys,

321
12:28.380 --> 12:30.030
but your point about 23 minutes

322
12:30.030 --> 12:31.680
to find content... - Yeah, it's totally true.

323
12:31.680 --> 12:33.360
<v ->We have this sort of internal thing</v>

324
12:33.360 --> 12:35.760
where we call it tile fatigue,

325
12:35.760 --> 12:37.590
but I don't think we named it.

326
12:37.590 --> 12:40.020
I feel like that's a well known issue.

327
12:40.020 --> 12:42.390
But one of the side effects of our data is that we know

328
12:42.390 --> 12:44.940
what everyone is talking about all the time

329
12:44.940 --> 12:46.980
across the entire spectrum of content.

330
12:46.980 --> 12:49.710
So we put together a small tool called WatchNxt,

331
12:49.710 --> 12:50.940
which you guys can go check out.

332
12:50.940 --> 12:52.950
It's watchnxt.com,

333
12:52.950 --> 12:55.095
where it literally tells you every single brand new piece

334
12:55.095 --> 12:58.770
of content coming out every day and how popular it is.

335
12:58.770 --> 13:00.630
And the thing that always blows my mind is

336
13:00.630 --> 13:02.150
that every day there's 10

337
13:02.150 --> 13:05.970
to 30 brand new things coming out.

338
13:05.970 --> 13:08.310
Doesn't even include new seasons of shows

339
13:08.310 --> 13:09.690
or returning shows.

340
13:09.690 --> 13:11.280
It's literally only brand new stuff.

341
13:11.280 --> 13:15.000
So if you're curious, that's an MVP of a product

342
13:15.000 --> 13:16.320
that we have been working on

343
13:16.320 --> 13:18.840
and soon to include some new AI technology.

344
13:18.840 --> 13:21.000
In terms of getting consumers comfortable,

345
13:21.000 --> 13:22.620
I think with AI, we were talking

346
13:22.620 --> 13:23.640
about this a little bit actually

347
13:23.640 --> 13:24.510
in the green room,

348
13:24.510 --> 13:28.110
disclosure and sort of transparency are, I think,

349
13:28.110 --> 13:29.850
really, really critical at this juncture.

350
13:29.850 --> 13:33.720
I think we are all here, especially in a venue like CES,

351
13:33.720 --> 13:35.370
we all know what to look out for.

352
13:35.370 --> 13:36.330
We know the watch outs.

353
13:36.330 --> 13:38.760
We know what we're looking at when we're within social media

354
13:38.760 --> 13:39.900
or search or what have you.

355
13:39.900 --> 13:41.280
But I think it's fair to say

356
13:41.280 --> 13:43.230
that not every single person out there would have

357
13:43.230 --> 13:45.240
that same sort of thought process.

358
13:45.240 --> 13:46.720
And so making sure that we

359
13:46.720 --> 13:49.950
as an industry are doing a good job of being very clear

360
13:49.950 --> 13:52.860
where information's coming from, how we're using data,

361
13:52.860 --> 13:54.120
where data is sourced.

362
13:54.120 --> 13:55.920
These are things that at least, you know,

363
13:55.920 --> 13:58.050
from where we come from as a data company,

364
13:58.050 --> 13:59.553
are critically important tenants to our service.

365
13:59.553 --> 14:01.200
<v ->Yeah, I think that's spot on.</v>

366
14:01.200 --> 14:03.060
We're gonna end with that a little bit in our trust section,

367
14:03.060 --> 14:05.100
but I think it seeds the discussion

368
14:05.100 --> 14:06.300
and where we're going.

369
14:06.300 --> 14:10.080
Shalini, how about education from an OS perspective

370
14:10.080 --> 14:11.670
and a UI perspective,

371
14:11.670 --> 14:14.130
how do you balance educating consumers about the benefits

372
14:14.130 --> 14:15.963
of GenAI and the experience?

373
14:17.400 --> 14:18.330
<v ->Well, first I just wanted</v>

374
14:18.330 --> 14:21.060
to answer your 23 minutes on what to watch.

375
14:21.060 --> 14:22.890
You're clearly not using Google TV.

376
14:22.890 --> 14:23.916
<v ->Yeah, there you go.</v>

377
14:23.916 --> 14:24.749
Right.

378
14:24.749 --> 14:25.582
<v ->Have to make a note of that.</v>

379
14:25.582 --> 14:26.415
<v ->Because...</v>

380
14:26.415 --> 14:27.390
<v ->We knew that was coming.</v>
<v ->That's the whole value</v>

381
14:27.390 --> 14:28.980
proposition of Google TV.

382
14:28.980 --> 14:30.120
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

383
14:30.120 --> 14:33.300
<v ->Is to quickly get to what the content you wanna watch,</v>

384
14:33.300 --> 14:34.770
but would love to explore the data models

385
14:34.770 --> 14:36.570
that you're building on top of that.

386
14:37.800 --> 14:39.030
In terms of education,

387
14:39.030 --> 14:42.960
look, the way I think about it is if something's useful,

388
14:42.960 --> 14:45.000
it will carry its own weight

389
14:45.000 --> 14:46.770
and you don't really need to educate.

390
14:46.770 --> 14:49.380
Like, the UI should always be that simple.

391
14:49.380 --> 14:50.460
That there's no real,

392
14:50.460 --> 14:53.520
like, this is a video on how to use something

393
14:53.520 --> 14:56.340
and these are the five steps you have to do.

394
14:56.340 --> 14:57.540
It shouldn't be that way.

395
14:57.540 --> 14:58.800
It should always be like,

396
14:58.800 --> 15:00.180
just is so intuitive

397
15:00.180 --> 15:03.180
and it just makes sense 'cause it's valuable.

398
15:03.180 --> 15:04.770
I talked about the search example,

399
15:04.770 --> 15:08.100
but the other example I'll give you is NotebookLM,

400
15:08.100 --> 15:11.010
which I'm hoping all of you have downloaded and used.

401
15:11.010 --> 15:13.170
It's an amazing tool.

402
15:13.170 --> 15:16.590
And what it does is you can upload, you know,

403
15:16.590 --> 15:20.940
like tens of PDFs or any multimodal content links

404
15:20.940 --> 15:24.420
and then you can ask it questions on that content

405
15:24.420 --> 15:26.670
and it'll also create a podcast for you.

406
15:26.670 --> 15:29.190
But I recently did that for my finances.

407
15:29.190 --> 15:31.170
I'm not a very good financial planner,

408
15:31.170 --> 15:33.420
but I put up a lot of my finances.

409
15:33.420 --> 15:36.903
I asked it about should I invest in a casino.

410
15:39.240 --> 15:41.040
And you know, it had, like, a lot

411
15:41.040 --> 15:42.933
of great recommendations for me,

412
15:44.580 --> 15:46.530
you know, and it did it in such a quick manner

413
15:46.530 --> 15:48.720
that, you know, I didn't have to spend tons

414
15:48.720 --> 15:50.460
and tons of hours researching.

415
15:50.460 --> 15:53.040
I could have probably gotten to the same conclusion,

416
15:53.040 --> 15:56.970
but it actually was very helpful in terms of shortening

417
15:56.970 --> 16:00.750
that time and getting me to what I wanted to very quickly.

418
16:00.750 --> 16:02.190
And I think that's the value.

419
16:02.190 --> 16:04.920
And I think that's how we educate is here's something

420
16:04.920 --> 16:08.040
so valuable that you cannot actually live without it.

421
16:08.040 --> 16:08.940
And once you get there,

422
16:08.940 --> 16:11.190
like, it just takes off from there.

423
16:11.190 --> 16:12.570
<v ->Yeah, very cool.</v>

424
16:12.570 --> 16:14.190
It's a perfect segue to experience

425
16:14.190 --> 16:15.840
because as we think about experience,

426
16:15.840 --> 16:19.530
I mean, if we look at what consumers tell us, right,

427
16:19.530 --> 16:23.160
88% of users that are actively using GenAI

428
16:23.160 --> 16:25.140
believe it can improve the experience for them.

429
16:25.140 --> 16:27.090
So once you get through the barrier of making

430
16:27.090 --> 16:30.330
that convincing argument, they get it, right?

431
16:30.330 --> 16:31.350
What's equally interesting,

432
16:31.350 --> 16:34.500
and this is something you hit on, Haohong, is the consumers,

433
16:34.500 --> 16:37.770
83% of them that are active users believe

434
16:37.770 --> 16:40.590
that generative content can be more creative than humans.

435
16:40.590 --> 16:42.300
Which again, is a little surprising to me

436
16:42.300 --> 16:45.810
that out of the gate that we see consumers there.

437
16:45.810 --> 16:48.270
But I'd actually love to hear from everyone on the panel,

438
16:48.270 --> 16:50.640
what is the most impactful thing

439
16:50.640 --> 16:53.790
from an experience perspective you think GenAI will enable

440
16:53.790 --> 16:55.260
or unlock between now

441
16:55.260 --> 16:58.263
and when we're here in Las Vegas 12 months from now?

442
16:59.250 --> 17:00.270
<v ->Oh my gosh.</v>
<v ->I'll start with you, Paul.</v>

443
17:00.270 --> 17:03.660
<v ->That's quite a vision that we have to create here.</v>

444
17:03.660 --> 17:04.830
<v ->Make it investible.</v>

445
17:04.830 --> 17:05.880
<v ->Yes, exactly.</v>

446
17:05.880 --> 17:07.680
Well, listen, I will say if we're thinking

447
17:07.680 --> 17:08.970
about 12 months out from here,

448
17:08.970 --> 17:10.830
and it's gonna get into some of your trust conversation,

449
17:10.830 --> 17:11.850
I think we're gonna be having a lot

450
17:11.850 --> 17:13.020
of conversations...
<v ->100%.</v>

451
17:13.020 --> 17:15.360
<v ->On disclosure and GDPR, like, things.</v>

452
17:15.360 --> 17:16.193
<v ->Yep, yep.</v>

453
17:16.193 --> 17:17.174
<v ->But I also think that the one thing</v>

454
17:17.174 --> 17:20.010
that I anticipate coming out of generative AIs,

455
17:20.010 --> 17:21.990
people understand the value proposition,

456
17:21.990 --> 17:23.400
but they don't yet understand how much

457
17:23.400 --> 17:24.930
of their own data is actually being used

458
17:24.930 --> 17:26.340
to actually drive the models.

459
17:26.340 --> 17:28.350
And I think that there will be companies,

460
17:28.350 --> 17:30.720
there's a company based in Miami called Crosshatch,

461
17:30.720 --> 17:33.180
which is basically a locker for your content.

462
17:33.180 --> 17:35.370
And then you can decide as you interact with an agent

463
17:35.370 --> 17:36.780
which fields you want unlocked

464
17:36.780 --> 17:38.820
and how much power you want it to drive.

465
17:38.820 --> 17:40.890
And I think that those are where some of the pieces

466
17:40.890 --> 17:44.070
of innovation are gonna sit is how do I wanna interact

467
17:44.070 --> 17:46.740
with AI because I understand its capabilities,

468
17:46.740 --> 17:49.830
but I don't know how much I want it to understand about me.

469
17:49.830 --> 17:50.670
So I think those will be some

470
17:50.670 --> 17:52.325
of the things we'll be discussing in 12 months from now.

471
17:52.325 --> 17:53.880
<v ->Yeah, very cool.</v>

472
17:53.880 --> 17:55.260
Lots of barriers to get there, though,

473
17:55.260 --> 17:57.570
with stitching together that across...

474
17:57.570 --> 17:58.680
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
<v ->Multiple platforms</v>

475
17:58.680 --> 18:00.330
that consumers touch daily.

476
18:00.330 --> 18:01.860
<v ->That stat that you shared,</v>

477
18:01.860 --> 18:03.390
it actually doesn't surprise me too much.

478
18:03.390 --> 18:05.640
And this is probably 'cause I spend way too much time

479
18:05.640 --> 18:08.130
listening to what people say about content online.

480
18:08.130 --> 18:09.600
It's a hazard of the job.

481
18:09.600 --> 18:11.400
By the way, my parents are delighted when I get

482
18:11.400 --> 18:13.110
to tell people I watch TV for work.

483
18:13.110 --> 18:14.550
I'm sure yours are too.
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

484
18:14.550 --> 18:15.383
<v ->Right?</v>

485
18:15.383 --> 18:17.010
<v ->It was my favorite party trick when I ran research is</v>

486
18:17.010 --> 18:18.090
like, "I know what you watch

487
18:18.090 --> 18:18.983
and I know what you watch",

488
18:18.983 --> 18:21.180
'cause you know their demographics.

489
18:21.180 --> 18:22.380
<v ->But one of the fascinating things</v>

490
18:22.380 --> 18:23.610
that's happening right now is,

491
18:23.610 --> 18:26.040
and for those of you who are on TikTok, of course, there,

492
18:26.040 --> 18:28.080
you know, BookTok has really taken off.

493
18:28.080 --> 18:29.700
And one of the things consumers are doing

494
18:29.700 --> 18:34.261
is actually fan casting their favorite books

495
18:34.261 --> 18:36.240
using generative AI.

496
18:36.240 --> 18:38.010
So, you know, for example,

497
18:38.010 --> 18:39.030
there are many books out there

498
18:39.030 --> 18:42.210
that have already been optioned by Netflix, by Amazon,

499
18:42.210 --> 18:45.180
by Hulu, et cetera, which we will all be waiting, you know,

500
18:45.180 --> 18:47.220
two years to see those things come to life.

501
18:47.220 --> 18:50.370
But fans and consumers have taken it upon themselves

502
18:50.370 --> 18:52.950
to create scenes from their favorite novels

503
18:52.950 --> 18:54.120
using generative AI.

504
18:54.120 --> 18:57.000
And so I think that in terms of,

505
18:57.000 --> 19:00.570
you know, people saying that AI can be just as creative

506
19:00.570 --> 19:01.890
or maybe even more creative,

507
19:01.890 --> 19:03.270
it's really bringing those tools into the hands

508
19:03.270 --> 19:04.860
of regular people

509
19:04.860 --> 19:08.370
and enabling us to share our thoughts, feelings, reactions,

510
19:08.370 --> 19:10.260
responses in a way that's, like, technical

511
19:10.260 --> 19:11.640
or sight/sound in motion

512
19:11.640 --> 19:13.710
in a way that hasn't been possible before.

513
19:13.710 --> 19:14.850
<v ->Yeah, I think that's spot on.</v>

514
19:14.850 --> 19:16.110
Haohong, maybe we'll go with you

515
19:16.110 --> 19:17.160
and then come back to Shalini.

516
19:17.160 --> 19:18.990
<v ->Yeah, I think the key thing is</v>

517
19:18.990 --> 19:22.350
that AI redefines the creativity area.

518
19:22.350 --> 19:23.610
I think that's a key thing

519
19:23.610 --> 19:27.570
that actually make every people could become a creator.

520
19:27.570 --> 19:31.290
Okay, because now by leverage the capability of the AI,

521
19:31.290 --> 19:32.640
which is still evolving,

522
19:32.640 --> 19:35.730
I mean, we feel that the speed is very rapid.

523
19:35.730 --> 19:37.563
Actually during the last year,

524
19:39.060 --> 19:41.370
it cannot limit your imagination

525
19:41.370 --> 19:44.647
that 12 months later how much these are a normal,

526
19:44.647 --> 19:46.710
you know, user of the TV

527
19:46.710 --> 19:50.430
or normal user of the mobile devices,

528
19:50.430 --> 19:54.810
what they can do to utilize the little tool the AI provide

529
19:54.810 --> 19:55.643
to them.

530
19:55.643 --> 19:58.530
So I think, you know, this is something that we're seeing

531
19:58.530 --> 20:01.800
that it makes self-expression innovation actually much,

532
20:01.800 --> 20:04.770
much more accessible in the next 12 months.

533
20:04.770 --> 20:07.260
<v ->It democratizes content creation at the end of the day.</v>

534
20:07.260 --> 20:08.130
Yeah, absolutely.

535
20:08.130 --> 20:10.500
Yeah, Shalini, what's your take?

536
20:10.500 --> 20:12.240
<v ->Yeah, I think that those are all good points.</v>

537
20:12.240 --> 20:14.400
Especially, I resonate very much with you

538
20:14.400 --> 20:17.370
that this field is evolving so rapidly.

539
20:17.370 --> 20:19.200
Like, who would've thought 12 months ago

540
20:19.200 --> 20:21.330
that we would be here with,

541
20:21.330 --> 20:24.660
you know, using all of these chat agents, using Gemini

542
20:24.660 --> 20:28.830
and other forms of generative AI in the ways that we are

543
20:28.830 --> 20:31.740
and who knows what's really gonna happen in 12 months.

544
20:31.740 --> 20:32.940
But I would say there are two things

545
20:32.940 --> 20:35.910
that I am very bullish on.

546
20:35.910 --> 20:37.860
Of course, we are a knowledge company as Google,

547
20:37.860 --> 20:42.150
and I think that knowledge is gonna be a huge focus.

548
20:42.150 --> 20:44.160
And I think that generative AI is gonna help us

549
20:44.160 --> 20:47.070
in tremendous ways over the next 12 months

550
20:47.070 --> 20:50.520
just understanding the world in many different ways.

551
20:50.520 --> 20:53.310
As you know, of course, I talked about NotebookLM.

552
20:53.310 --> 20:55.500
I talked about our search experience.

553
20:55.500 --> 20:58.050
As you know, we also have through our DeepMinds team,

554
20:58.050 --> 20:59.460
a lot of research that we're doing

555
20:59.460 --> 21:01.710
in the human world, right,

556
21:01.710 --> 21:04.590
in the actual bio engineering side of things

557
21:04.590 --> 21:08.460
where AlphaFold, which we got Nobel Prize for,

558
21:08.460 --> 21:11.580
has uncovered a lot in the DNA side.

559
21:11.580 --> 21:14.070
And I think that that's gonna revolutionize medicine.

560
21:14.070 --> 21:15.570
And it's all through knowledge, right?

561
21:15.570 --> 21:19.320
It's just understanding our world that much better

562
21:19.320 --> 21:23.010
for individuals, but also for all these enterprises

563
21:23.010 --> 21:24.990
that want to make a difference.

564
21:24.990 --> 21:26.880
So I think that's number one in my mind.

565
21:26.880 --> 21:28.213
It's gonna be huge leaps

566
21:28.213 --> 21:31.443
and bounds changes in the next 12 months.

567
21:32.460 --> 21:34.440
And then number two,

568
21:34.440 --> 21:37.380
I agree with you on the creativity front.

569
21:37.380 --> 21:40.177
I think, you know, we're already seeing the early signs of,

570
21:40.177 --> 21:43.680
you know, the video generators, image generators.

571
21:43.680 --> 21:45.810
They're getting so much more powerful

572
21:45.810 --> 21:48.720
that the consumer sentiment that I can tell

573
21:48.720 --> 21:50.760
what's the difference between what's generated

574
21:50.760 --> 21:52.440
and what's human made.

575
21:52.440 --> 21:55.200
I think that goes away in 12 months.

576
21:55.200 --> 21:56.580
But I will also say this.

577
21:56.580 --> 21:57.960
I work at Pixar animation

578
21:57.960 --> 22:00.210
and so I'm very close to the creator community,

579
22:00.210 --> 22:01.980
also from YouTube.

580
22:01.980 --> 22:06.360
And I would say this is a tool for creativity

581
22:06.360 --> 22:10.590
and it's only gonna make creativity more easily democratized

582
22:10.590 --> 22:12.990
so that everyone can be creating.

583
22:12.990 --> 22:16.530
However, I personally, this is my personal opinion,

584
22:16.530 --> 22:19.620
I don't think that it's quite ready for,

585
22:19.620 --> 22:21.150
maybe it gets there in five years,

586
22:21.150 --> 22:22.200
but as of today,

587
22:22.200 --> 22:24.690
I would say the storytelling is still

588
22:24.690 --> 22:26.520
in the hands of humans.

589
22:26.520 --> 22:28.220
I think that we need to be part of it.

590
22:28.220 --> 22:30.240
We need to be understanding how

591
22:30.240 --> 22:32.370
to use these tools for creativity.

592
22:32.370 --> 22:34.380
But the creativity is,

593
22:34.380 --> 22:35.310
it's new, right?

594
22:35.310 --> 22:38.640
Like, these models are built on patterns of the past.

595
22:38.640 --> 22:41.180
And what humans can do is think about the future.

596
22:41.180 --> 22:43.920
And I think that's really the value proposition

597
22:43.920 --> 22:45.780
that we've gotta really embrace.

598
22:45.780 --> 22:48.720
<v ->Yeah, which actually, as all of you have spoken,</v>

599
22:48.720 --> 22:50.490
it sort of triggers another question for me,

600
22:50.490 --> 22:52.020
which we didn't really talk about in advance,

601
22:52.020 --> 22:54.240
but over the past 12 months,

602
22:54.240 --> 22:56.970
we've seen a distinct shift from AI.

603
22:56.970 --> 23:00.660
Is AI, GenAI at least, really being more about chatbots

604
23:00.660 --> 23:05.400
for end users to agentic AI being something that's known,

605
23:05.400 --> 23:06.233
but also something

606
23:06.233 --> 23:08.280
that's getting increasingly real, right?

607
23:08.280 --> 23:11.340
And we see it starting to touch consumers as well.

608
23:11.340 --> 23:12.540
Like, if we look at what Apple's doing

609
23:12.540 --> 23:13.470
with Apple Intelligence,

610
23:13.470 --> 23:16.350
it's actually natively in the operating system

611
23:16.350 --> 23:19.483
and can actually do things that, you know,

612
23:19.483 --> 23:21.300
a typical assistant would not have been able

613
23:21.300 --> 23:23.130
to with limited access.

614
23:23.130 --> 23:27.360
How do you see agentic AI changing the experience

615
23:27.360 --> 23:28.500
of entertainment going forward?

616
23:28.500 --> 23:29.910
Are we there yet to see that?

617
23:29.910 --> 23:32.940
I mean, I see some angles with, you know,

618
23:32.940 --> 23:36.510
your TV being able to predict what you want,

619
23:36.510 --> 23:39.393
but have you thought about that, anyone on the panel?

620
23:40.260 --> 23:41.460
<v ->I feel like we've been doing a little bit</v>

621
23:41.460 --> 23:43.983
of that in our content strategy work.

622
23:45.240 --> 23:48.480
Let me see if I can link it to the agentic component of it,

623
23:48.480 --> 23:52.800
but you know, content recommendations, content discovery,

624
23:52.800 --> 23:54.720
I think we can all agree, has been an area

625
23:54.720 --> 23:57.060
that really did need a lot of legwork,

626
23:57.060 --> 23:59.970
whether from our friends at Google or otherwise,

627
23:59.970 --> 24:01.870
some of the stuff we're doing as well.

628
24:02.730 --> 24:05.500
But, you know, being able to determine

629
24:06.450 --> 24:08.430
to create the next story.

630
24:08.430 --> 24:11.280
So it's one thing to predict what you wanna watch next out

631
24:11.280 --> 24:14.370
of content that's finite and already exists.

632
24:14.370 --> 24:16.170
It's another thing to predict

633
24:16.170 --> 24:17.490
what someone's gonna watch,

634
24:17.490 --> 24:19.680
what someone's gonna wanna watch a year or two years

635
24:19.680 --> 24:20.513
from now.

636
24:20.513 --> 24:21.570
I say a year or two years

637
24:21.570 --> 24:24.390
'cause that's currently how long general cycles are

638
24:24.390 --> 24:25.320
for content creation.

639
24:25.320 --> 24:26.430
Although we know

640
24:26.430 --> 24:29.070
that those cycles are probably gonna shrink.

641
24:29.070 --> 24:30.810
That would be another prediction that I would make,

642
24:30.810 --> 24:34.080
which is I do think we're gonna start to see shorter cycles

643
24:34.080 --> 24:35.730
for some kinds of content.

644
24:35.730 --> 24:36.963
Maybe not all of them.

645
24:38.190 --> 24:39.979
So, you know, the way,

646
24:39.979 --> 24:42.210
and I think Shalini said this earlier too,

647
24:42.210 --> 24:44.160
that AI has been around for a long time

648
24:44.160 --> 24:45.930
under the hood of a lot of things.

649
24:45.930 --> 24:47.940
And I think that's what's gonna continue to happen.

650
24:47.940 --> 24:50.010
And as the technology continues to improve,

651
24:50.010 --> 24:52.320
everything we can do with it will get better.

652
24:52.320 --> 24:54.840
But content recommendations has been something

653
24:54.840 --> 24:57.420
that I know a lot of incredibly talented companies

654
24:57.420 --> 24:58.837
have been working on for a long time.

655
24:58.837 --> 25:01.830
<v ->I'll also say we were here at CES,</v>

656
25:01.830 --> 25:03.750
Quickplay announced we developed a new product

657
25:03.750 --> 25:05.220
called Quickplay Shorts.

658
25:05.220 --> 25:06.870
And one of the very cool things

659
25:06.870 --> 25:08.040
about the product is actually

660
25:08.040 --> 25:09.930
in the content generation side.

661
25:09.930 --> 25:11.100
So it used to,

662
25:11.100 --> 25:12.900
let's imagine you go to any studio

663
25:12.900 --> 25:14.670
and they have a 100,000 assets.

664
25:14.670 --> 25:16.440
Trying to figure out what to create short-form

665
25:16.440 --> 25:18.660
out of would usually take them an army

666
25:18.660 --> 25:20.550
of people and years to do.

667
25:20.550 --> 25:22.170
And now we say we can process

668
25:22.170 --> 25:23.880
that in a couple of days.

669
25:23.880 --> 25:26.520
We can literally look at what's happening on Google Trends

670
25:26.520 --> 25:29.340
or otherwise or something we're seeing in the social space

671
25:29.340 --> 25:32.070
and very quickly identify moments that match

672
25:32.070 --> 25:34.410
that across the entire content catalog

673
25:34.410 --> 25:36.480
and cut, clip, and verticalize that

674
25:36.480 --> 25:39.270
and be able to syndicate that into any number

675
25:39.270 --> 25:42.630
of platforms literally in minutes, right?

676
25:42.630 --> 25:44.160
That's some of the power of AI

677
25:44.160 --> 25:46.650
and content creation that's absolutely incredible

678
25:46.650 --> 25:47.910
and it creates a huge amount

679
25:47.910 --> 25:50.880
of velocity in a space where you need velocity.

680
25:50.880 --> 25:53.250
But also it really presents a huge opportunity

681
25:53.250 --> 25:54.630
for many of these media companies

682
25:54.630 --> 25:55.740
to have these large libraries.

683
25:55.740 --> 25:57.090
<v ->Yeah, no, I think that's spot on.</v>

684
25:57.090 --> 25:59.460
We're seeing that specifically in advertising, right?

685
25:59.460 --> 26:02.610
The ability to create generative ads for the right context

686
26:02.610 --> 26:06.300
for the right user on the fly is quite powerful,

687
26:06.300 --> 26:08.910
especially if you think about audio and video.

688
26:08.910 --> 26:09.743
Yeah.

689
26:09.743 --> 26:10.580
Haohong, any thoughts?

690
26:10.580 --> 26:14.349
<v ->Yeah, so as a veteran in this TV business,</v>

691
26:14.349 --> 26:16.590
okay, for 15 years, every day,

692
26:16.590 --> 26:19.350
in my mind I was thinking about user experiences, right?

693
26:19.350 --> 26:23.250
Because that's what people are using our devices.

694
26:23.250 --> 26:26.160
So I think there are two key component of the experiences.

695
26:26.160 --> 26:27.360
One is the content.

696
26:27.360 --> 26:30.810
If you don't have a good content, nobody will watch.

697
26:30.810 --> 26:31.980
They don't turn TV, right?

698
26:31.980 --> 26:34.380
In some regions, they watch more mobile devices

699
26:34.380 --> 26:35.850
than TVs, in some regions.

700
26:35.850 --> 26:38.310
But in US, we're lucky still a lot, a lot

701
26:38.310 --> 26:40.920
of people spend a lot of hours on TV, right?

702
26:40.920 --> 26:43.380
So which make us responsible

703
26:43.380 --> 26:45.780
to give them a better user experience.

704
26:45.780 --> 26:49.410
So one is content, the other is user interactivity.

705
26:49.410 --> 26:51.450
Okay, let's talk about first for the content,

706
26:51.450 --> 26:54.000
that's the why we're doing this AI-generated content.

707
26:54.000 --> 26:56.520
We already been able to cover, you know,

708
26:56.520 --> 26:57.910
six genre of the content.

709
26:57.910 --> 26:59.760
There are many genres as you know

710
26:59.760 --> 27:03.000
that AI is still in this nascent stage.

711
27:03.000 --> 27:04.290
The phase will change,

712
27:04.290 --> 27:05.940
the background will change all the time

713
27:05.940 --> 27:08.310
if you carefully look at the AI-generated content.

714
27:08.310 --> 27:12.510
So we're able to generate the sci-fi, horror, you know,

715
27:12.510 --> 27:17.100
comedy, romance, documentary, you know,

716
27:17.100 --> 27:19.500
six genres in total already.

717
27:19.500 --> 27:21.870
So this is just our step one, okay?

718
27:21.870 --> 27:23.910
We want to build a foundation for our,

719
27:23.910 --> 27:27.450
actually the other step, which is a user interactivity.

720
27:27.450 --> 27:30.120
Because earlier, there's a lot

721
27:30.120 --> 27:32.100
of content from the big studios out there.

722
27:32.100 --> 27:33.000
You cannot do anything.

723
27:33.000 --> 27:33.960
That's their copyright.

724
27:33.960 --> 27:35.550
You cannot do anything, right?

725
27:35.550 --> 27:38.340
But now it's AI generated,

726
27:38.340 --> 27:41.250
and I know we put a lot of efforts in there.

727
27:41.250 --> 27:44.190
We might have some rights of something that we could do.

728
27:44.190 --> 27:47.100
So we launched a feature called Ideal,

729
27:47.100 --> 27:50.070
which is interactive video, which enable you,

730
27:50.070 --> 27:54.150
the TV viewers to interact with the IP characters

731
27:54.150 --> 27:56.460
or story characters anytime

732
27:56.460 --> 27:59.100
that these story characters empowered

733
27:59.100 --> 28:02.010
by AI basically will talk to you,

734
28:02.010 --> 28:04.890
answer your questions, tell you the backstories,

735
28:04.890 --> 28:07.320
and basically bring you curiosity

736
28:07.320 --> 28:08.580
and explore further, right?

737
28:08.580 --> 28:12.120
So these are the things that we believe will be the future.

738
28:12.120 --> 28:15.390
This is something that actually the content itself

739
28:15.390 --> 28:17.340
become interactive content

740
28:17.340 --> 28:19.530
and actually this AI will be able

741
28:19.530 --> 28:22.110
to support these new experiences

742
28:22.110 --> 28:25.800
to make user have a deeper engagement

743
28:25.800 --> 28:29.190
and a more immersive experiences in front of TV.

744
28:29.190 --> 28:30.300
<v ->Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

745
28:30.300 --> 28:32.610
I think that that's a great example.

746
28:32.610 --> 28:36.390
So I wanna spend our last segment on trust.

747
28:36.390 --> 28:39.450
And we've hit on that throughout our discussion thus far.

748
28:39.450 --> 28:41.760
But we would be remiss not to dive deep into it.

749
28:41.760 --> 28:45.810
So consumer skepticism around AI is very much real.

750
28:45.810 --> 28:48.720
And if we look at our data, 60% of consumers told us

751
28:48.720 --> 28:52.770
that they have real concerns about misinformation.

752
28:52.770 --> 28:53.820
Even more interestingly,

753
28:53.820 --> 28:56.970
if we look at how consumers view disclosure,

754
28:56.970 --> 28:59.610
so our active users of GenAI,

755
28:59.610 --> 29:02.730
when you disclose that something is generative,

756
29:02.730 --> 29:05.880
they're disproportionately more likely to trust it.

757
29:05.880 --> 29:06.930
And if you flip the script

758
29:06.930 --> 29:09.330
and you compare that to those that are not users,

759
29:09.330 --> 29:12.060
they are disproportionately more likely not

760
29:12.060 --> 29:15.210
to trust it if you disclose that it's generative.

761
29:15.210 --> 29:17.190
So I think the question that I'd actually

762
29:17.190 --> 29:20.280
like to hear from everyone on is how do you build trust

763
29:20.280 --> 29:23.790
with consumers in this sort of transitional era

764
29:23.790 --> 29:24.900
that we're in?

765
29:24.900 --> 29:25.733
Paul, do you wanna start?

766
29:25.733 --> 29:26.790
<v ->Sure.</v>

767
29:26.790 --> 29:29.541
So first of all, I'm a big fan of disclosure, right?

768
29:29.541 --> 29:30.374
<v ->Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

769
29:30.374 --> 29:31.207
<v ->I think over time,</v>

770
29:31.207 --> 29:32.370
when people understand the use cases,

771
29:32.370 --> 29:35.160
and I think to your point earlier, understand the value

772
29:35.160 --> 29:38.190
that is delivered, they'll come to trust it more.

773
29:38.190 --> 29:39.810
But I do believe we'll see, you know,

774
29:39.810 --> 29:41.430
whether or not governments can get their acts together

775
29:41.430 --> 29:42.450
to do these things.

776
29:42.450 --> 29:44.940
But over time I think we will also have required disclosures

777
29:44.940 --> 29:46.860
that look a lot like GDPR.

778
29:46.860 --> 29:50.220
And I think we'll probably see platforms enroll a method

779
29:50.220 --> 29:51.810
that's not unlike what was announced yesterday

780
29:51.810 --> 29:52.643
on Meta, right?

781
29:52.643 --> 29:55.530
Which is to say we'll let the community tell

782
29:55.530 --> 29:58.200
and opine as to what is true and what is not true.

783
29:58.200 --> 29:59.550
So it'll be the responsibility

784
29:59.550 --> 30:01.980
of the province of that community.

785
30:01.980 --> 30:04.110
So I personally believe that's the direction

786
30:04.110 --> 30:06.720
that we're headed, but you know,

787
30:06.720 --> 30:10.080
as you were articulating earlier, when you see the value,

788
30:10.080 --> 30:12.573
I think that will longer term yield benefit.

789
30:13.973 --> 30:14.980
<v ->Yeah, Shalini?</v>

790
30:14.980 --> 30:17.880
<v ->Yeah, I mean, definitely huge proponent of value.</v>

791
30:17.880 --> 30:19.650
Like, without value, there's nothing.

792
30:19.650 --> 30:22.320
Why does anyone go to anything if there's no value to them?

793
30:22.320 --> 30:26.493
So I think that's always the number one holy grail.

794
30:27.390 --> 30:28.890
I think in terms of disclosures,

795
30:28.890 --> 30:30.600
like, I personally believe three things.

796
30:30.600 --> 30:33.540
One is I think we should always fully disclose

797
30:33.540 --> 30:37.170
and you know, if you look at all of our products at Google,

798
30:37.170 --> 30:41.146
we just launched, you know, with TCL Gemini on TV,

799
30:41.146 --> 30:45.900
we just are showcasing AI-summarized news,

800
30:45.900 --> 30:47.430
which is news that we take

801
30:47.430 --> 30:49.620
from what's happening across the world.

802
30:49.620 --> 30:50.910
And we summarize it for you

803
30:50.910 --> 30:53.790
in, like, this quick three-minute podcast.

804
30:53.790 --> 30:55.290
It is very clearly labeled

805
30:55.290 --> 30:58.751
that the news is summarized by AI.

806
30:58.751 --> 31:01.470
And you know, all the feedback we've been getting,

807
31:01.470 --> 31:03.960
which when we are gonna launch I will hear more,

808
31:03.960 --> 31:06.450
is that this is phenomenal.

809
31:06.450 --> 31:08.130
Like, I just want a three-minute clip

810
31:08.130 --> 31:11.520
and then in my own time, I will go and dig deeper.

811
31:11.520 --> 31:14.040
And so I think that A, we should always be disclosing

812
31:14.040 --> 31:16.950
and if there's value, people will value it.

813
31:16.950 --> 31:19.203
Not be scared of it or run away from it.

814
31:20.310 --> 31:24.423
Two, I think just, you know,

815
31:24.423 --> 31:25.950
Facebook announced that they're gonna

816
31:25.950 --> 31:27.540
have AI-generated channels.

817
31:27.540 --> 31:29.130
So we talk about creativity.

818
31:29.130 --> 31:31.980
The whole channel is gonna be AI generated.

819
31:31.980 --> 31:34.200
And again, like, it's full disclosure

820
31:34.200 --> 31:36.000
and it's up to the consumer at that point.

821
31:36.000 --> 31:38.430
Like, if the content is gonna be as sticky

822
31:38.430 --> 31:40.800
as you're saying, it's gonna be five minutes,

823
31:40.800 --> 31:43.980
10 minutes fully, your users are gonna go through all of it,

824
31:43.980 --> 31:45.150
again, all power to them.

825
31:45.150 --> 31:47.280
Like, you know, because it's fully out there

826
31:47.280 --> 31:51.270
that this is AI generated and then the choice is yours,

827
31:51.270 --> 31:53.760
like, is it valuable or enough or not.

828
31:53.760 --> 31:56.490
And then my third point is just, you know, as Google,

829
31:56.490 --> 31:58.980
we have taken a lot of steps to make sure

830
31:58.980 --> 32:00.390
that we're also fingerprinting,

831
32:00.390 --> 32:02.880
not only disclosing within our own products,

832
32:02.880 --> 32:04.170
but as we see images

833
32:04.170 --> 32:07.290
and videos that are generated, we are fingerprinting

834
32:07.290 --> 32:10.830
and trying to mark out that this is generated

835
32:10.830 --> 32:13.320
so that consumers feel more trust

836
32:13.320 --> 32:15.840
between what is human and what is not.

837
32:15.840 --> 32:17.187
And we'll see how this evolves.

838
32:17.187 --> 32:20.430
But at this time, this is our commitment.

839
32:20.430 --> 32:23.160
<v ->Is there initial thinking on the best way</v>

840
32:23.160 --> 32:25.367
to disclose without disrupting the user experience?

841
32:25.367 --> 32:27.270
'Cause you could imagine a YouTube video

842
32:27.270 --> 32:28.290
that has a red screen

843
32:28.290 --> 32:31.020
that says this is generative AI probably not creating

844
32:31.020 --> 32:32.100
the best user experience.

845
32:32.100 --> 32:34.749
Like, is that just something we have to see how it evolves?

846
32:34.749 --> 32:36.760
<v ->Yeah, I think the experience is gonna evolve</v>

847
32:36.760 --> 32:38.400
as to how you consume it.

848
32:38.400 --> 32:41.220
Like, whether there's little tag at the bottom

849
32:41.220 --> 32:45.510
that discloses it, whether it is a red screen, I doubt it.

850
32:45.510 --> 32:47.220
<v ->I hope not.</v>
<v ->But it could be.</v>

851
32:47.220 --> 32:48.488
Those are all things that are evolving.

852
32:48.488 --> 32:49.800
<v ->Yeah, cool.</v>

853
32:49.800 --> 32:52.770
<v ->Yeah, I kind of go back to the,</v>

854
32:52.770 --> 32:56.790
you know, when we started talking about generative AI,

855
32:56.790 --> 32:59.730
it came hand in hand with this concept of hallucinations,

856
32:59.730 --> 33:01.140
which you brought up earlier.

857
33:01.140 --> 33:04.830
And so I think that even in how we introduced generative AI

858
33:04.830 --> 33:07.200
to ourselves, to the world,

859
33:07.200 --> 33:09.600
there was already skepticism attached to it.

860
33:09.600 --> 33:13.410
And maybe I'm standing alone on this one,

861
33:13.410 --> 33:15.120
but I actually think that's a good thing.

862
33:15.120 --> 33:18.450
I'm glad that when we started talking about generative AI,

863
33:18.450 --> 33:20.160
that there was education around

864
33:20.160 --> 33:22.800
where can AI maybe sometimes go wrong

865
33:22.800 --> 33:25.290
'cause that helps us all understand how to interpret

866
33:25.290 --> 33:28.290
and analyze what we're actually watching.

867
33:28.290 --> 33:31.350
The scary thing, another example would be, you know,

868
33:31.350 --> 33:34.530
I, in total transparency, used to work over at Twitter many,

869
33:34.530 --> 33:37.470
many moons ago, still when it was Twitter 1.0.

870
33:37.470 --> 33:39.630
And we've always had an issue

871
33:39.630 --> 33:42.690
with non-human generated content on the platform.

872
33:42.690 --> 33:44.670
It's something we've been very thoughtful about

873
33:44.670 --> 33:46.860
since the inception of that platform.

874
33:46.860 --> 33:50.280
And so now that content that is being generated

875
33:50.280 --> 33:52.470
by non-human is just getting more sophisticated,

876
33:52.470 --> 33:54.870
it's getting a little bit harder to detect,

877
33:54.870 --> 33:57.630
but its incumbents on us to then to your point,

878
33:57.630 --> 34:00.930
fingerprint or otherwise create better detection systems

879
34:00.930 --> 34:04.380
so that we can be honest and transparent with ourselves

880
34:04.380 --> 34:05.670
and with our communities.

881
34:05.670 --> 34:08.160
So I guess I'm just giving two stories

882
34:08.160 --> 34:12.240
of how I personally feel like coming at AI

883
34:12.240 --> 34:15.210
with some skepticism and trying to be,

884
34:15.210 --> 34:17.397
you know, trying to educate yourself on how to consume it

885
34:17.397 --> 34:19.950
and how to use it is a good first step.

886
34:19.950 --> 34:21.780
Even though we know that it's going

887
34:21.780 --> 34:23.070
to get better and better and better.

888
34:23.070 --> 34:25.440
And hopefully that skepticism will fade over time

889
34:25.440 --> 34:27.930
as the value proposition continues to increase.

890
34:27.930 --> 34:29.188
<v ->Yeah, I think there's are great points, great points.</v>

891
34:29.188 --> 34:30.021
Haohong?

892
34:30.021 --> 34:31.860
<v ->Yeah, agree with all the panelists,</v>

893
34:31.860 --> 34:35.670
basically, to label these AI-generated content,

894
34:35.670 --> 34:39.180
make it transparent to the audiences is extremely important.

895
34:39.180 --> 34:40.530
I want to add there two more points.

896
34:40.530 --> 34:44.070
One point is that actually we, in our execution,

897
34:44.070 --> 34:47.220
the human oversight, we put that at the top priority

898
34:47.220 --> 34:50.520
because you need a robust system that be able to review

899
34:50.520 --> 34:53.880
and validate its content to make sure there's no bias

900
34:53.880 --> 34:56.100
or harmful information to go out.

901
34:56.100 --> 34:58.290
That's why in our AI filmmaking process,

902
34:58.290 --> 35:01.500
we use human writer, human director, and the human,

903
35:01.500 --> 35:05.790
you know, filmmakers produces.

904
35:05.790 --> 35:08.760
That they basically utilize advances

905
35:08.760 --> 35:10.620
of AI technology, right?

906
35:10.620 --> 35:13.920
But they will make sure all the output aligned

907
35:13.920 --> 35:15.030
with the artistic vision.

908
35:15.030 --> 35:15.870
That's very important.

909
35:15.870 --> 35:16.987
Someone needs to know,

910
35:16.987 --> 35:18.570
"Hey, this is what I want.

911
35:18.570 --> 35:20.130
Okay, this is not what I want.

912
35:20.130 --> 35:21.600
That's dangerous", right?

913
35:21.600 --> 35:23.730
The other point is that I wanna emphasize

914
35:23.730 --> 35:25.620
because, you know, I'm from the technical background

915
35:25.620 --> 35:29.370
so this is still in the very nascent AI,

916
35:29.370 --> 35:32.190
you know, I don't think AI is already there yet.

917
35:32.190 --> 35:33.690
I don't think the AGI is there yet.

918
35:33.690 --> 35:35.280
I think it's still very nascent.

919
35:35.280 --> 35:38.010
That's why I would like to say that we need

920
35:38.010 --> 35:41.220
to strike a balance between these innovations,

921
35:41.220 --> 35:44.670
AI innovations, and the management of the trust

922
35:44.670 --> 35:46.470
for this AI-generated content.

923
35:46.470 --> 35:47.303
<v ->Yeah.</v>

924
35:47.303 --> 35:48.136
Yeah, no, that's spot on.

925
35:48.136 --> 35:50.760
Which actually leads us to our last question.

926
35:50.760 --> 35:53.940
I wanna spend the last few minutes a little bit open-ended

927
35:53.940 --> 35:54.810
to be totally honest.

928
35:54.810 --> 35:56.220
And I just wanna hear from our panelists,

929
35:56.220 --> 35:59.403
and I'll go first just to take the scariness out of it.

930
36:01.020 --> 36:02.700
What the one or two things are

931
36:02.700 --> 36:05.460
that you're most excited about from an AI perspective

932
36:05.460 --> 36:06.780
in the coming year.

933
36:06.780 --> 36:07.613
And I'll start, I mean,

934
36:07.613 --> 36:09.300
I think if we look at the market,

935
36:09.300 --> 36:11.610
I think we've been in what's sort of called,

936
36:11.610 --> 36:13.320
what I call the middle miles of AI,

937
36:13.320 --> 36:16.350
where the excitement is sort of given way to this

938
36:16.350 --> 36:19.410
how do we make this real and drive real business value?

939
36:19.410 --> 36:22.260
And for me at least, you're starting to see

940
36:22.260 --> 36:24.900
that on the consumer side with agentic AI in some ways

941
36:24.900 --> 36:28.230
and on a B2B perspective, in the back office,

942
36:28.230 --> 36:29.250
this is getting real, right?

943
36:29.250 --> 36:30.630
In advertising, this is getting real.

944
36:30.630 --> 36:33.090
And I think 12 months from now, it's gonna be,

945
36:33.090 --> 36:35.220
the business value will be much more proven out.

946
36:35.220 --> 36:37.560
So that's what I'm excited about.

947
36:37.560 --> 36:38.393
Paul?

948
36:38.393 --> 36:40.440
<v ->Yeah, I mean, there's so many different angles</v>

949
36:40.440 --> 36:41.360
in which to attack the service, right?

950
36:41.360 --> 36:42.193
<v ->You can do it however you want.</v>

951
36:42.193 --> 36:43.680
<v ->Like, I mean, I love the advances</v>

952
36:43.680 --> 36:45.090
that could be made in medical technology.

953
36:45.090 --> 36:46.140
That seems fascinating, right?

954
36:46.140 --> 36:46.973
<v ->Incredible.</v>

955
36:46.973 --> 36:49.470
<v ->The ability to enhance story</v>

956
36:49.470 --> 36:52.650
and storytelling, the ability to drive consumer value

957
36:52.650 --> 36:54.180
in the amount of time we search for content, right?

958
36:54.180 --> 36:56.793
All these things are absolutely exciting.

959
36:57.930 --> 37:00.723
Honestly, I think the thing that keeps me up awake

960
37:00.723 --> 37:02.670
at night a little bit about it at the same time is, like,

961
37:02.670 --> 37:04.560
how do we also understand our value add

962
37:04.560 --> 37:06.240
as humans in this process?

963
37:06.240 --> 37:07.560
And think about that as well.

964
37:07.560 --> 37:10.920
And these models are,

965
37:10.920 --> 37:13.200
it's great input in great,

966
37:13.200 --> 37:14.640
creates great output, right?

967
37:14.640 --> 37:16.320
So how do you think about your value add

968
37:16.320 --> 37:17.949
in the ecosystem as the human

969
37:17.949 --> 37:20.940
in this environment?
<v ->Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

970
37:20.940 --> 37:21.870
<v ->Yeah, absolutely, Paul.</v>

971
37:21.870 --> 37:24.513
There's so many things to be excited about.

972
37:25.560 --> 37:28.426
I'm from TV and so are you, Haohong,

973
37:28.426 --> 37:30.270
so of course,

974
37:30.270 --> 37:31.980
the thing that I'm most excited about is

975
37:31.980 --> 37:34.440
what we just announced with TCL,

976
37:34.440 --> 37:37.260
which we're launching along with TCL

977
37:37.260 --> 37:40.110
and always on TV with a far field microphone.

978
37:40.110 --> 37:41.850
So right from your living room,

979
37:41.850 --> 37:46.620
you can ask Gemini any question that you always wanted to.

980
37:46.620 --> 37:48.510
Imagine sitting with your child

981
37:48.510 --> 37:49.357
and they're asking you,

982
37:49.357 --> 37:51.660
"Hey, tell me more about the solar system."

983
37:51.660 --> 37:53.220
And you don't have a clue.

984
37:53.220 --> 37:55.350
And you just asked Gemini right in the living room.

985
37:55.350 --> 37:57.960
And not only do you get a response, you also get videos.

986
37:57.960 --> 37:59.760
It's all multimodal.

987
37:59.760 --> 38:01.530
I think it's just gonna change the nature

988
38:01.530 --> 38:05.190
of how we engage on our TVs with our families.

989
38:05.190 --> 38:08.244
And that's really what I'm the most excited about.

990
38:08.244 --> 38:09.210
<v ->Yeah.</v>

991
38:09.210 --> 38:10.410
<v ->I feel like I agree.</v>

992
38:10.410 --> 38:11.243
Sorry.

993
38:11.243 --> 38:13.497
<v ->By the way, it is demoing at the TCL booth.</v>

994
38:13.497 --> 38:14.330
<v ->Is it?</v>

995
38:14.330 --> 38:15.263
We'll head there right now.
<v ->Let's take a look.</v>

996
38:15.263 --> 38:16.440
<v ->It's nice.</v>
<v ->Sorry.</v>

997
38:16.440 --> 38:17.273
<v ->Please.</v>

998
38:17.273 --> 38:20.100
I feel like this reminds me of is any,

999
38:20.100 --> 38:21.450
maybe we're all at this age,

1000
38:21.450 --> 38:23.100
does anyone remember gonna Disney World

1001
38:23.100 --> 38:24.990
and seeing the thing where, like, they were in space

1002
38:24.990 --> 38:27.570
and talking on FaceTime with people on earth?

1003
38:27.570 --> 38:29.010
I don't know if anybody remembers that.

1004
38:29.010 --> 38:32.370
And that exhibit probably went away a really long time ago.

1005
38:32.370 --> 38:37.170
But honestly, I feel like we're in the precipice right now

1006
38:37.170 --> 38:41.790
of AI being almost like it's our imagination,

1007
38:41.790 --> 38:44.610
which is going to help us understand all the different ways

1008
38:44.610 --> 38:45.750
that this technology,

1009
38:45.750 --> 38:49.110
I think, will advance every facet of our lives.

1010
38:49.110 --> 38:51.120
I kind of liken, maybe this is cheesy,

1011
38:51.120 --> 38:52.890
but I liken it a little bit too, you know,

1012
38:52.890 --> 38:54.930
us all having now supercomputers in our pockets,

1013
38:54.930 --> 38:57.090
which we didn't have 25 years ago,

1014
38:57.090 --> 39:00.180
and how that has fundamentally changed every single thing

1015
39:00.180 --> 39:02.430
that we do and every single way that we behave.

1016
39:02.430 --> 39:04.050
So maybe that's not the best answer

1017
39:04.050 --> 39:05.670
'cause it's way, way, way too big.

1018
39:05.670 --> 39:08.520
But that's sort of how I look at the universe.

1019
39:08.520 --> 39:11.310
When I put my TV and media hat on,

1020
39:11.310 --> 39:14.010
the part that gets me really excited is the fact

1021
39:14.010 --> 39:16.800
that we can bring so many more stories to life.

1022
39:16.800 --> 39:19.830
So one of the things we've always done is observed,

1023
39:19.830 --> 39:21.810
you know, how much content is coming out

1024
39:21.810 --> 39:23.220
from how many different places

1025
39:23.220 --> 39:25.560
and, you know, can everybody remember what their,

1026
39:25.560 --> 39:27.300
the favorite thing they watched last year

1027
39:27.300 --> 39:29.730
versus the favorite thing they're gonna watch this year?

1028
39:29.730 --> 39:32.940
And the fact that now every person can be creative

1029
39:32.940 --> 39:35.340
in their own unique ways, means platforms

1030
39:35.340 --> 39:38.430
that are video-centric are gonna bring new stories

1031
39:38.430 --> 39:40.980
to life in a way that is unprecedented,

1032
39:40.980 --> 39:42.450
I think is what we'll see.

1033
39:42.450 --> 39:43.530
<v ->100%</v>

1034
39:43.530 --> 39:45.810
<v ->Yeah, from my perspective, you know,</v>

1035
39:45.810 --> 39:49.320
2024 seems a long year for me, okay?

1036
39:49.320 --> 39:50.543
Very long year, okay?

1037
39:50.543 --> 39:52.740
<v ->For all of us.</v>
<v ->Since last February,</v>

1038
39:52.740 --> 39:54.360
once the OpenAI,

1039
39:54.360 --> 39:56.760
they announced Sora, right?

1040
39:56.760 --> 39:59.520
So opens everybody's eyes, say, "Wow,

1041
39:59.520 --> 40:01.500
every people can be a filmmaker tomorrow."

1042
40:01.500 --> 40:02.460
Of course, it's not true.

1043
40:02.460 --> 40:06.330
But the point is that people has a very high expectation

1044
40:06.330 --> 40:07.890
for this video generation era.

1045
40:07.890 --> 40:09.870
Of course, Google has a good announcement

1046
40:09.870 --> 40:11.670
of Veo 2, which is great.

1047
40:11.670 --> 40:14.970
But my point is that during this 10 month,

1048
40:14.970 --> 40:18.270
so many companies, so many tools, Runway, Kling,

1049
40:18.270 --> 40:22.320
a lot of tools coming out, maybe 20 to 50 different tools

1050
40:22.320 --> 40:23.310
in that area.

1051
40:23.310 --> 40:25.830
Today, we don't know who eventually will be best.

1052
40:25.830 --> 40:29.190
Maybe no best, but all of them work together

1053
40:29.190 --> 40:32.220
to facilitate this capability about AI filmmaking.

1054
40:32.220 --> 40:35.070
That's why I believe that in 12 months,

1055
40:35.070 --> 40:38.130
we should be able to see a long form, you know,

1056
40:38.130 --> 40:39.360
AI generative film,

1057
40:39.360 --> 40:43.680
like 90 minutes maybe theatrical film in 12 months.

1058
40:43.680 --> 40:44.940
I foresee that

1059
40:44.940 --> 40:48.570
and at this moment, the TCL TV+ is the first

1060
40:48.570 --> 40:51.630
to try this AI content on the streaming services.

1061
40:51.630 --> 40:52.617
I believe more

1062
40:52.617 --> 40:56.667
and more streaming services will join us into adoption more

1063
40:56.667 --> 41:00.120
and more AI content in their streaming services.

1064
41:00.120 --> 41:01.282
<v ->That's spot on.</v>

1065
41:01.282 --> 41:04.680
Haohong, Anjali, Shalini, Paul, thank you.

1066
41:04.680 --> 41:05.513
Great discussion.

1068
41:06.497 --> 41:07.330
<v ->Thanks for being here</v>

1069
41:07.330 --> 41:08.163
and have a great rest of CES.

1070
41:08.163 --> 41:09.079
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1071
41:09.079 --> 41:09.954
(audience applauding)

1072
41:09.954 --> 41:12.537
(upbeat music)
