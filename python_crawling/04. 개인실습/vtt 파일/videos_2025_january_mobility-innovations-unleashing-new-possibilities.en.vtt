1
00:00.901 --> 00:03.484
(upbeat music)

2
00:10.920 --> 00:12.570
<v ->All right, so we made it.</v>

3
00:12.570 --> 00:16.350
Session six, now capping off the 25th year of Connect2Car.

4
00:16.350 --> 00:17.760
I appreciate everybody sticking with us.

5
00:17.760 --> 00:19.210
Who was in the first session?

6
00:20.160 --> 00:21.450
All right, excellent, excellent.

7
00:21.450 --> 00:24.450
Well, this is gonna be a treat for all of you that are here.

8
00:26.010 --> 00:27.570
Coming back to the beginning,

9
00:27.570 --> 00:30.000
again, this was about getting the aftermarket

10
00:30.000 --> 00:32.040
and the OEM talking to each other

11
00:32.040 --> 00:35.520
about integration and integrating products into the vehicle.

12
00:35.520 --> 00:36.840
And while that's still an issue

13
00:36.840 --> 00:38.580
for a lot of the aftermarket providers,

14
00:38.580 --> 00:40.920
a lot of it's been solved by going to data buses

15
00:40.920 --> 00:42.000
and other things.

16
00:42.000 --> 00:44.730
The very first session at Connect2Car

17
00:44.730 --> 00:49.587
was actually a discussion between IDB-1394,

18
00:49.587 --> 00:51.870
IDB can and most,

19
00:51.870 --> 00:54.360
and having a conversation about those networks

20
00:54.360 --> 00:56.940
going into a vehicle, 'cause at the point that point,

21
00:56.940 --> 00:58.770
most of those networks weren't in.

22
00:58.770 --> 01:01.140
So we've gone from that to where we are today,

23
01:01.140 --> 01:02.460
which is pretty amazing.

24
01:02.460 --> 01:03.690
Pretty amazing panelists today,

25
01:03.690 --> 01:06.600
and again, I appreciate everybody hanging out with us.

26
01:06.600 --> 01:09.270
So right now I'd like to introduce my new friend Logan,

27
01:09.270 --> 01:10.890
who invited me to a party last night,

28
01:10.890 --> 01:13.440
so it's why I am letting him do the panel.

29
01:13.440 --> 01:15.450
We met out in the parking lot earlier.

30
01:15.450 --> 01:17.970
Logan is the director of Mobility and Smart Cities

31
01:17.970 --> 01:19.620
for Plug and Play Tech center,

32
01:19.620 --> 01:22.380
which I'm very interested in coming to see.

33
01:22.380 --> 01:24.000
And you're gonna have a little conversation

34
01:24.000 --> 01:26.580
with Chris Coulter at CampX for Volvo

35
01:26.580 --> 01:29.010
to talk about fostering innovation, right?

36
01:29.010 --> 01:29.843
Fantastic.

37
01:31.050 --> 01:32.430
<v Logan>Awesome, thank you so much, Chris.</v>

38
01:32.430 --> 01:33.360
Really looking forward to it.

39
01:33.360 --> 01:36.180
Hello everybody, fantastic to be here

40
01:36.180 --> 01:40.140
as we end the Connect2Car, one of the longest tracks.

41
01:40.140 --> 01:43.350
I mean, this is just fantastic, so really happy to be here.

42
01:43.350 --> 01:45.510
As you mentioned, my name is Logan Azelton

43
01:45.510 --> 01:48.510
and I am the Director of US Mobility in Smart Cities

44
01:48.510 --> 01:50.430
for Plug and Play Tech Center.

45
01:50.430 --> 01:52.350
We're the world's largest venture capital company

46
01:52.350 --> 01:54.480
and we run over 60 different accelerator programs

47
01:54.480 --> 01:58.230
across the world, connecting startups to new corporations.

48
01:58.230 --> 01:59.520
And like he had mentioned,

49
01:59.520 --> 02:03.540
I would love to introduce my new buddy, Chris Coulter,

50
02:03.540 --> 02:04.373
to come up here.

51
02:04.373 --> 02:06.510
He's with Volvo CampX, so if you guys wouldn't mind,

52
02:06.510 --> 02:08.932
just give him a nice round of applause as he comes on up.

53
02:08.932 --> 02:11.932
(audience applauds)

54
02:13.140 --> 02:14.880
Awesome, so Chris is gonna help us out.

55
02:14.880 --> 02:17.640
He's gonna talk about kind of the importance of innovation

56
02:17.640 --> 02:18.630
with different startups

57
02:18.630 --> 02:20.610
and kind of the collaboration within the industry

58
02:20.610 --> 02:22.710
and how that can move the ball forward.

59
02:22.710 --> 02:23.830
So Chris, the stage is all yours.

60
02:23.830 --> 02:26.070
<v ->Thank you, thank you Logan.</v>

61
02:26.070 --> 02:27.990
Logan's birthday today.

62
02:27.990 --> 02:29.220
Did anybody?

63
02:29.220 --> 02:30.311
Yeah.

64
02:30.311 --> 02:32.490
(audience applauds)

65
02:32.490 --> 02:33.690
Be careful what you tell me,

66
02:33.690 --> 02:35.250
I don't let it go so quick, right?

67
02:35.250 --> 02:38.070
So yeah, okay, thank you Logan.

68
02:38.070 --> 02:38.970
So I'm Chris Coulter.

69
02:38.970 --> 02:43.970
I'm the CampX North America Hub Lead, CampX by Volvo Group.

70
02:44.850 --> 02:46.860
The Volvo Group is not Volvo car.

71
02:46.860 --> 02:51.860
We're Volvo, we make trucks, construction equipment,

72
02:53.790 --> 02:58.503
power solutions for (indistinct), buses, service solutions,

73
03:00.720 --> 03:02.850
finance solutions, so a lot.

74
03:02.850 --> 03:06.150
102, 104,000 people globally,

75
03:06.150 --> 03:08.220
so for those of you not totally familiar with us.

76
03:08.220 --> 03:13.220
So CampX was started in 2019 in Sweden.

77
03:14.340 --> 03:17.970
The purpose is to find new technologies

78
03:17.970 --> 03:19.860
and innovation for the Volvo group

79
03:19.860 --> 03:21.180
through startups actually.

80
03:21.180 --> 03:23.490
So we run proof of values.

81
03:23.490 --> 03:26.040
There are four hubs globally.

82
03:26.040 --> 03:30.030
There's a hub in Sweden, India, and France

83
03:30.030 --> 03:34.023
and in the US representing North America, so, yeah.

84
03:37.350 --> 03:38.640
We have three programs.

85
03:38.640 --> 03:42.390
We have the incubator, which is very early phase startups,

86
03:42.390 --> 03:44.670
where we're strategically looking down the road,

87
03:44.670 --> 03:46.200
we're demand driven innovation.

88
03:46.200 --> 03:49.080
So somebody said, this is what we're looking for,

89
03:49.080 --> 03:50.460
or we're looking at our strategies

90
03:50.460 --> 03:53.103
and how startups can complement those strategies.

91
03:54.870 --> 03:58.680
So we'll bring them in a program to be with us two years

92
03:58.680 --> 04:02.610
or up to two years to develop the startups further.

93
04:02.610 --> 04:04.590
Also, we have a venture client program,

94
04:04.590 --> 04:08.310
which is startups that are more mature, closer to scaling.

95
04:08.310 --> 04:12.600
So we run proof of value projects in that case.

96
04:12.600 --> 04:15.990
We've ran over 200 of those since the beginning

97
04:15.990 --> 04:17.850
around the four hubs there.

98
04:17.850 --> 04:20.370
So, and then we also have the venture client,

99
04:20.370 --> 04:23.730
which is where employees internally can have an idea

100
04:23.730 --> 04:26.640
that we create spinoff companies around.

101
04:26.640 --> 04:29.370
Also, if there's IP at universities

102
04:29.370 --> 04:31.320
that we can capture and scale,

103
04:31.320 --> 04:34.320
we'll also use the venture client program for that.

104
04:34.320 --> 04:36.333
So a little bit about it.

105
04:37.260 --> 04:40.230
We have tools that allow us to go fast.

106
04:40.230 --> 04:42.210
If you guys have read "The Innovator's Dilemma,"

107
04:42.210 --> 04:45.840
I like to to say that was a lot of inspiration

108
04:45.840 --> 04:47.400
for how I like to think about this.

109
04:47.400 --> 04:50.850
So we have the tools, we have contracts, processes,

110
04:50.850 --> 04:52.590
and we can go pretty fast.

111
04:52.590 --> 04:57.187
I was telling somebody last night, I think the fastest case

112
04:58.200 --> 05:00.210
that we've had from inception to approval

113
05:00.210 --> 05:02.610
was in two under two weeks.

114
05:02.610 --> 05:05.435
So to give you an idea of what we're talking about

115
05:05.435 --> 05:07.260
when we need speed.

116
05:07.260 --> 05:11.400
So yeah, and then you talked about the value Logan

117
05:11.400 --> 05:13.650
of working with startups, right?

118
05:13.650 --> 05:15.270
So it is speed.

119
05:15.270 --> 05:18.090
When you're in a a large corporate,

120
05:18.090 --> 05:20.130
the challenge sometimes becomes speed.

121
05:20.130 --> 05:22.020
So startups can be a shot in the arm

122
05:22.020 --> 05:24.030
to remind us we need to be fast,

123
05:24.030 --> 05:26.703
but also to innovate more quickly.

124
05:27.990 --> 05:31.260
They can change the way we're thinking about something

125
05:31.260 --> 05:33.420
if we approach this correctly, right?

126
05:33.420 --> 05:35.670
So we may think we're going down one path,

127
05:35.670 --> 05:36.720
but a startup could come in

128
05:36.720 --> 05:38.730
with a completely different idea,

129
05:38.730 --> 05:42.993
and even in some cases, we co-collaborate and we can come up

130
05:42.993 --> 05:46.050
with an entirely new direction between the two of us,

131
05:46.050 --> 05:50.760
so that's one of the values of speed, agility, right?

132
05:50.760 --> 05:53.133
And it goes both ways, so yeah.

133
05:54.390 --> 05:57.120
Logan, I think that we're on the clock here,

134
05:57.120 --> 05:59.280
so I'll hand it back over to you to tell us.

135
05:59.280 --> 06:00.180
You're gonna introduce us

136
06:00.180 --> 06:02.820
to some of the super exciting startups here,

137
06:02.820 --> 06:05.340
maybe a few that have even been through our program here,

138
06:05.340 --> 06:07.320
so I'll hand it back over to you.

139
06:07.320 --> 06:09.060
<v ->Yeah, absolutely, thank you so much, Chris.</v>

140
06:09.060 --> 06:10.698
Everybody give Chris one more round of applause.

141
06:10.698 --> 06:13.698
(audience applauds)

142
06:15.120 --> 06:16.620
Awesome, so like Chris mentioned,

143
06:16.620 --> 06:18.240
now we're coming into the next portion of this

144
06:18.240 --> 06:20.220
where we're gonna demonstrate a few of these different

145
06:20.220 --> 06:22.500
very successful world-class companies

146
06:22.500 --> 06:24.090
that have been able to break through

147
06:24.090 --> 06:26.460
into the automotive industry and beyond

148
06:26.460 --> 06:30.540
in order to kind of improve upon a lot of different things.

149
06:30.540 --> 06:32.790
So this is where innovation starts at the heart.

150
06:32.790 --> 06:36.290
So to start us off, we have Jeremy Agulnek.

151
06:36.290 --> 06:38.310
He is the SVP of HAAS Alert.

152
06:38.310 --> 06:40.080
So HAAS Alert notifies drivers

153
06:40.080 --> 06:42.120
of incoming emergency vehicles

154
06:42.120 --> 06:44.790
and then connects vehicles for better visibility,

155
06:44.790 --> 06:46.350
faster response times.

156
06:46.350 --> 06:47.925
So everybody give him a round of applause.

157
06:47.925 --> 06:50.925
(audience applauds)

158
06:54.540 --> 06:57.090
<v ->Thank you Logan and just a quick little plug.</v>

159
06:57.090 --> 07:01.080
So Plug and Play was instrumental in getting HAAS Alert

160
07:01.080 --> 07:05.280
introduced to our first automotive OEM partner, Stellantis,

161
07:05.280 --> 07:07.920
and helping get commercialized with them

162
07:07.920 --> 07:10.350
and also being part of the CampX program,

163
07:10.350 --> 07:12.693
so it's been great working with you guys all.

164
07:14.160 --> 07:16.830
So a little bit about HAAS Alert.

165
07:16.830 --> 07:21.830
When HAAS Alert's CEO was working formerly

166
07:22.110 --> 07:24.240
at HERE Technologies,

167
07:24.240 --> 07:26.590
he was almost struck and killed by an ambulance

168
07:27.600 --> 07:30.810
when he was driving through downtown Chicago.

169
07:30.810 --> 07:35.760
Thankfully, everything was okay, but that experience of his

170
07:35.760 --> 07:40.710
really transformed him into trying to solve for initially,

171
07:40.710 --> 07:43.980
how can we help cars and emergency vehicles

172
07:43.980 --> 07:45.870
communicate with each other?

173
07:45.870 --> 07:49.380
But as he dug into this roadway safety problem,

174
07:49.380 --> 07:52.080
he realized that it's a much broader problem,

175
07:52.080 --> 07:54.840
and so he expanded HAAS Alert's mission

176
07:54.840 --> 07:56.040
to now really think about,

177
07:56.040 --> 07:58.563
how do we make safety available to everyone?

178
08:03.750 --> 08:08.040
And our approach from the beginning towards roadway safety

179
08:08.040 --> 08:11.070
has been very different, and unlike anyone else's.

180
08:11.070 --> 08:12.660
We didn't wanna just go out there

181
08:12.660 --> 08:16.140
and build new to market technology that required,

182
08:16.140 --> 08:20.460
you know, 10 plus years to get fully adopted by OEMs, right?

183
08:20.460 --> 08:22.890
The people you see here on the screen,

184
08:22.890 --> 08:25.140
they needed help immediately,

185
08:25.140 --> 08:27.030
and they couldn't wait 10 years

186
08:27.030 --> 08:30.480
for safety solutions to become available to them.

187
08:30.480 --> 08:33.420
We also just didn't build a software platform

188
08:33.420 --> 08:36.690
and expect everyone to come to us and start connecting.

189
08:36.690 --> 08:38.580
Frankly, that's kind of lazy, right?

190
08:38.580 --> 08:41.850
You gotta put in the hard work, and that's what we did.

191
08:41.850 --> 08:45.390
We literally went door to door talking to fire departments,

192
08:45.390 --> 08:49.530
talking to tow truck operators, talking to DOTs,

193
08:49.530 --> 08:52.800
and developing a community of users

194
08:52.800 --> 08:55.530
and a community of safety advocates

195
08:55.530 --> 08:58.560
who really wanted to make a difference in the world.

196
08:58.560 --> 09:00.660
And we are the voice of these people

197
09:00.660 --> 09:03.540
that you see here into the automotive industry.

198
09:03.540 --> 09:06.120
They don't have a chance to go to events like this

199
09:06.120 --> 09:09.300
and to meet with OEMs, so we are representing them

200
09:09.300 --> 09:10.900
when we're sitting at the table.

201
09:13.680 --> 09:15.750
So a couple weeks ago,

202
09:15.750 --> 09:19.290
the Illinois State Police had a press conference

203
09:19.290 --> 09:21.630
where they were announcing their safety partnership

204
09:21.630 --> 09:23.220
with HAAS Alert.

205
09:23.220 --> 09:25.950
The director that you see here stood at the podium

206
09:25.950 --> 09:28.410
and he talked about the safety risks

207
09:28.410 --> 09:30.570
that the men and women of his department

208
09:30.570 --> 09:33.633
faced every single day when they're out on the roadway.

209
09:34.560 --> 09:39.390
He also took the opportunity to thank Chrysler, Dodge,

210
09:39.390 --> 09:43.890
Jeep, Ram, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen

211
09:43.890 --> 09:45.660
for investing in safety

212
09:45.660 --> 09:48.300
because those are the only OEMs today

213
09:48.300 --> 09:50.490
that are actually warning their drivers

214
09:50.490 --> 09:53.223
about emergency vehicles that are up in the road.

215
09:56.220 --> 09:59.520
Sadly, less than one week later,

216
09:59.520 --> 10:02.880
trooper Clay Carns was clearing debris from the highway

217
10:02.880 --> 10:05.313
when he was struck and killed by a pickup truck.

218
10:06.690 --> 10:07.523
At the funeral,

219
10:07.523 --> 10:11.040
that same director stood at the podium once again,

220
10:11.040 --> 10:13.340
but this time he had a very different message.

221
10:14.430 --> 10:15.577
And here's what he said,

222
10:15.577 --> 10:19.860
"People have got to slow down, move over, pay attention,

223
10:19.860 --> 10:22.920
just give a damn about these human beings.

224
10:22.920 --> 10:24.720
Have some respect for officers

225
10:24.720 --> 10:27.990
who do this job on a daily basis."

226
10:27.990 --> 10:30.813
You could sense the level of frustration in his voice.

227
10:33.210 --> 10:37.260
Now, it's no secret that OEMs care about safety, right?

228
10:37.260 --> 10:40.800
For example, this is on the wall at GM's headquarters,

229
10:40.800 --> 10:43.140
right, zero crashes.

230
10:43.140 --> 10:47.130
You see companies like Honda issuing press releases

231
10:47.130 --> 10:50.100
talking about how they're gonna be investing more

232
10:50.100 --> 10:52.590
in their focus on safety.

233
10:52.590 --> 10:55.410
Now the good news is that all these OEMs today,

234
10:55.410 --> 10:58.470
not just the ones here, but every single OEM,

235
10:58.470 --> 11:01.440
they have vehicles that are capable of communicating

236
11:01.440 --> 11:03.900
with their cloud platforms.

237
11:03.900 --> 11:08.790
And as such, they have vehicles that are V2X capable,

238
11:08.790 --> 11:11.910
and they can start making a safety difference today

239
11:11.910 --> 11:14.583
through that existing capability that they have.

240
11:17.610 --> 11:21.900
So what HAAS Alert has built is our Safety Cloud platform.

241
11:21.900 --> 11:25.323
It's the first V2X as-a-service solution.

242
11:26.250 --> 11:30.120
And what's unique about it is that we can easily help OEMs

243
11:30.120 --> 11:32.910
achieve their safety goals faster,

244
11:32.910 --> 11:36.480
cost effectively, and more easily.

245
11:36.480 --> 11:39.450
And it's really a gateway for the OEM

246
11:39.450 --> 11:43.170
into the broader connected transportation ecosystem.

247
11:43.170 --> 11:45.930
Safety Cloud enables vehicles

248
11:45.930 --> 11:48.690
to receive information and messages

249
11:48.690 --> 11:51.930
from other vehicles and infrastructure in the roadway,

250
11:51.930 --> 11:54.810
so that their drivers and their driving systems

251
11:54.810 --> 11:57.243
can make safer and smarter decisions.

252
11:58.380 --> 12:01.080
Safety Cloud also helps OEMs

253
12:01.080 --> 12:04.710
communicate with other OEM vehicles on the road,

254
12:04.710 --> 12:07.710
especially when their drivers are most vulnerable.

255
12:07.710 --> 12:10.080
For example, when they're stopped in the roadway,

256
12:10.080 --> 12:11.790
or let's say they're a wrong way driver

257
12:11.790 --> 12:14.790
entering the highway in the wrong direction,

258
12:14.790 --> 12:18.180
by simply integrating the cloud platform

259
12:18.180 --> 12:22.560
into Safety Cloud through a single API,

260
12:22.560 --> 12:24.540
all the sudden you have immediate access

261
12:24.540 --> 12:27.123
to the world's largest V2X network.

262
12:29.850 --> 12:32.670
Now, to achieve this goal

263
12:32.670 --> 12:36.570
and to really provide global solution for the OEMs,

264
12:36.570 --> 12:39.120
we realize that we can't do it all ourselves.

265
12:39.120 --> 12:41.730
In fact, core to HAAS Alert's strategy

266
12:41.730 --> 12:45.420
is enabling an ecosystem for other companies

267
12:45.420 --> 12:48.270
to participate and get connected

268
12:48.270 --> 12:51.330
into the transportation network broadly.

269
12:51.330 --> 12:53.580
And we're humbled and proud

270
12:53.580 --> 12:55.920
that all these organizations that you see here

271
12:55.920 --> 12:58.440
are trusting Safety Cloud today.

272
12:58.440 --> 12:59.640
And even just yesterday,

273
12:59.640 --> 13:02.130
we announced a partnership with AiDEN,

274
13:02.130 --> 13:03.810
who you'll hear from in a minute.

275
13:03.810 --> 13:07.440
And that big red firetruck that you see on the show floor,

276
13:07.440 --> 13:09.570
that's also connected to Safety Cloud

277
13:09.570 --> 13:12.843
through our partnership with Oshkosh and Pierce.

278
13:15.930 --> 13:18.930
So, you know, when you think about

279
13:18.930 --> 13:20.610
HAAS Alert's user community,

280
13:20.610 --> 13:23.010
we've got over 4,000 partners

281
13:23.010 --> 13:24.600
that are working with us today

282
13:24.600 --> 13:28.557
combined with the ecosystem that I just showed you.

283
13:28.557 --> 13:30.000
You get to a scale now

284
13:30.000 --> 13:32.340
where we can really start to make a difference

285
13:32.340 --> 13:34.170
with roadway safety.

286
13:34.170 --> 13:36.480
And even though we're processing a lot of data

287
13:36.480 --> 13:40.020
every single day, you know, our job is still not done

288
13:40.020 --> 13:42.390
until everyone can make it home safely.

289
13:42.390 --> 13:45.063
And that's what we're on a mission to continue doing.

290
13:46.020 --> 13:48.093
So thank you for the few minutes here.

291
13:48.960 --> 13:49.793
You know, we'll be

292
13:49.793 --> 13:52.500
at the COVESA networking reception tonight.

293
13:52.500 --> 13:55.050
We've got some demo vehicles there.

294
13:55.050 --> 13:57.540
We'd love to connect with you more throughout the week,

295
13:57.540 --> 13:59.130
so feel free to reach out.

296
13:59.130 --> 14:00.330
If you scan that QR code,

297
14:00.330 --> 14:02.190
it sends me an email immediately

298
14:02.190 --> 14:03.780
and we'll look forward to talking.

299
14:03.780 --> 14:04.613
Thank you.

300
14:06.032 --> 14:09.810
(audience applauds)

301
14:09.810 --> 14:12.510
<v Logan>Thank you so much, Jeremy, all right.</v>

302
14:12.510 --> 14:13.770
And now we're just gonna keep it going.

303
14:13.770 --> 14:15.750
As he mentioned, we're gonna bring up AiDEN.

304
14:15.750 --> 14:19.140
So AiDEN is a software only solutions

305
14:19.140 --> 14:22.860
providing in-car services with their white label

306
14:22.860 --> 14:25.023
bi-directional hub.

307
14:26.400 --> 14:29.910
Niclas Gyllenram, I am super excited to hear from you.

308
14:29.910 --> 14:30.840
The stage is yours.

309
14:30.840 --> 14:32.871
Everybody, round of applause.

310
14:32.871 --> 14:34.643
(audience applauds)
<v Niclas>Oh, thank you.</v>

311
14:36.840 --> 14:39.240
Great to be here, thanks for the introduction,

312
14:39.240 --> 14:42.720
and yeah, I'm from AiDEN,

313
14:42.720 --> 14:46.290
and going straight to what we do, we basically connect cars.

314
14:46.290 --> 14:49.350
That's the core of the whole idea really.

315
14:49.350 --> 14:51.210
It's a no-code app framework.

316
14:51.210 --> 14:54.840
We put data privacy first, simply because if you do,

317
14:54.840 --> 14:57.723
then you're able to do more, not less, actually.

318
14:59.190 --> 15:00.270
Where do I control the slides?

319
15:00.270 --> 15:01.103
Is this one?

320
15:02.460 --> 15:03.630
The green button?

321
15:03.630 --> 15:06.900
Okay, so my name is Niclas.

322
15:06.900 --> 15:08.760
I've been working for AiDEN Automotive

323
15:08.760 --> 15:10.590
for the last four years.

324
15:10.590 --> 15:13.530
Before that, I've done about 20 years

325
15:13.530 --> 15:14.700
in the automotive industry,

326
15:14.700 --> 15:17.400
working mainly in infotainment and connected vehicles.

327
15:17.400 --> 15:20.700
So I think that, basically the aspects of vehicles

328
15:20.700 --> 15:25.170
that have failed most over the last two decades.

329
15:25.170 --> 15:26.913
I feel very frustrated about that.

330
15:27.780 --> 15:30.780
For a long time, we had built-in navigation systems

331
15:30.780 --> 15:34.590
and music players and voice control systems

332
15:34.590 --> 15:37.200
that frankly people didn't want to use.

333
15:37.200 --> 15:40.560
They would probably use their phones instead.

334
15:40.560 --> 15:42.030
Over the last four or five years,

335
15:42.030 --> 15:43.590
that has changed a little bit.

336
15:43.590 --> 15:45.660
Now, we've got pretty much the whole industry

337
15:45.660 --> 15:48.720
building infotainment systems based on Android automotive,

338
15:48.720 --> 15:50.340
and suddenly you can get

339
15:50.340 --> 15:53.640
more different mature navigation systems

340
15:53.640 --> 15:56.883
from HERE Technologies from Waze from Google Maps and so on,

341
15:58.140 --> 15:59.640
but there's still something missing,

342
15:59.640 --> 16:03.213
and that is really what we're addressing with AiDEN.

343
16:05.940 --> 16:10.680
It's been 20 years, for me at least, of talk in the industry

344
16:10.680 --> 16:13.470
where we've been talking about all these different things

345
16:13.470 --> 16:16.440
about how you should service your vehicle.

346
16:16.440 --> 16:21.440
We had the last session on connecting with 911 responders,

347
16:21.510 --> 16:24.210
connected insurance, paying for services, and so on,

348
16:24.210 --> 16:27.900
and frankly, there's no shortage of amazing companies

349
16:27.900 --> 16:31.653
building awesome services, but still,

350
16:32.820 --> 16:36.390
there's just no connected services at scale.

351
16:36.390 --> 16:38.880
Any one of you who have a new car,

352
16:38.880 --> 16:40.710
most of you actually, if you have a really new car,

353
16:40.710 --> 16:42.480
probably already have a vehicle

354
16:42.480 --> 16:44.520
with an Android-based system.

355
16:44.520 --> 16:48.300
You have all the necessary hardware and software,

356
16:48.300 --> 16:50.103
but still, there's no services.

357
16:52.830 --> 16:54.153
This is the current state.

358
16:55.290 --> 16:58.080
Hardware is there, there's a common software platform,

359
16:58.080 --> 17:01.650
there's millions of vehicles on the roads as we speak,

360
17:01.650 --> 17:04.290
but still no connected services at scale.

361
17:04.290 --> 17:05.760
This is what we're addressing.

362
17:05.760 --> 17:07.980
So the question of course becomes why?

363
17:07.980 --> 17:09.303
Why is it like that?

364
17:10.260 --> 17:12.720
Well, it turns out that I,

365
17:12.720 --> 17:15.330
frankly, when I started working on Android eight years ago

366
17:15.330 --> 17:17.610
for the automotive industry, I actually initially thought,

367
17:17.610 --> 17:19.620
great, our work here is done.

368
17:19.620 --> 17:22.140
Now it's all gonna be like the phone industry,

369
17:22.140 --> 17:24.030
everything's gonna be connected and smart

370
17:24.030 --> 17:26.790
and we'll have all the apps in the world.

371
17:26.790 --> 17:28.770
But that hasn't happened,

372
17:28.770 --> 17:32.490
and there's a multitude of different reasons for that.

373
17:32.490 --> 17:34.980
And I think these are at least the main reasons

374
17:34.980 --> 17:38.160
why we don't have connected services currently.

375
17:38.160 --> 17:40.500
First of all, contrary to the phone industry,

376
17:40.500 --> 17:43.260
the automotive industry is much, much more fragmented.

377
17:43.260 --> 17:46.140
Like the largest automotive OEMs

378
17:46.140 --> 17:50.730
still have less than 10% of the complete global market.

379
17:50.730 --> 17:54.303
That's unlikely to change significantly any time soon.

380
17:55.320 --> 17:58.080
The service side of it, the parking companies,

381
17:58.080 --> 18:02.820
the charging, fueling, insurance, 911 responder,

382
18:02.820 --> 18:04.890
that's even more fragmented.

383
18:04.890 --> 18:05.730
On a global scale,

384
18:05.730 --> 18:08.550
you'd probably need to have tens of thousands

385
18:08.550 --> 18:12.900
or even hundreds of thousands of different services

386
18:12.900 --> 18:14.730
to cover, to have global coverage.

387
18:14.730 --> 18:18.030
Now you might wonder, why don't you just build apps?

388
18:18.030 --> 18:22.140
I used to work for Volvo cars before I was at AiDEN,

389
18:22.140 --> 18:24.780
and we actually tried to do just that on Android.

390
18:24.780 --> 18:29.160
So that's how we started with the realization

391
18:29.160 --> 18:30.180
that something needs to be done.

392
18:30.180 --> 18:31.013
We worked with

393
18:31.013 --> 18:33.150
one of the largest charging infrastructure providers

394
18:33.150 --> 18:34.740
here in the US.

395
18:34.740 --> 18:38.160
They built an app, we deployed it into production vehicles,

396
18:38.160 --> 18:41.100
and that whole project took roughly 12 months.

397
18:41.100 --> 18:44.220
And to me, that was the proof point that this will not work.

398
18:44.220 --> 18:47.670
There's no way for any car company really to do that

399
18:47.670 --> 18:50.580
with 10 or 100,000 different service providers,

400
18:50.580 --> 18:53.160
and there's no way that that charging company can do it

401
18:53.160 --> 18:55.710
with 40, 50 different OEMs.

402
18:56.730 --> 18:59.880
It also turns out that technically the services,

403
18:59.880 --> 19:01.980
the types of services you want in a vehicle

404
19:01.980 --> 19:04.650
are different to what you have in phones.

405
19:04.650 --> 19:06.510
Most of the things you do on your phone

406
19:06.510 --> 19:08.820
is something where you pick up the phone and you engage

407
19:08.820 --> 19:12.330
and you initiate something to get something done.

408
19:12.330 --> 19:16.710
Whereas with cars, like with insurance or with service

409
19:16.710 --> 19:19.440
and maintenance and tire services, whatever you want,

410
19:19.440 --> 19:20.520
those are mainly things

411
19:20.520 --> 19:23.340
that you just run in the background all the time.

412
19:23.340 --> 19:24.810
You will never start your trip

413
19:24.810 --> 19:28.413
by launching the insurance app in your vehicle, right?

414
19:29.670 --> 19:31.050
You'll never start your trip

415
19:31.050 --> 19:34.890
by launching the Let's Serve My Vehicle app.

416
19:34.890 --> 19:37.530
If you don't launch it, it's not running.

417
19:37.530 --> 19:40.110
This is a main difference actually.

418
19:40.110 --> 19:41.640
With our solution now,

419
19:41.640 --> 19:45.150
well, frankly, and that's part of the main problem here,

420
19:45.150 --> 19:47.490
they mainly need to run in the background,

421
19:47.490 --> 19:50.913
and they need to communicate different sets of data,

422
19:51.960 --> 19:53.580
and they need to be able to support

423
19:53.580 --> 19:56.490
any kind of user interface,

424
19:56.490 --> 19:58.860
and lastly and most importantly,

425
19:58.860 --> 20:00.480
as I touched upon in the beginning,

426
20:00.480 --> 20:05.480
they need to also be serving data privacy regulations.

427
20:05.730 --> 20:09.990
And especially in the EU, you have something called GDPR,

428
20:09.990 --> 20:11.310
which I think on a global scale

429
20:11.310 --> 20:13.560
is probably the strictest privacy regulation.

430
20:14.400 --> 20:17.613
So these are all the problems that you need to have solved.

431
20:20.940 --> 20:23.790
So conclusion, what we need,

432
20:23.790 --> 20:25.080
we need something in the industry

433
20:25.080 --> 20:27.240
because nothing has happened over the last 20 years

434
20:27.240 --> 20:29.520
when it comes to actually scaling services.

435
20:29.520 --> 20:32.610
And I think it needs to be something that is scalable,

436
20:32.610 --> 20:35.340
something that actually works across markets,

437
20:35.340 --> 20:38.730
across car brands, across models.

438
20:38.730 --> 20:40.410
It has to be flexible.

439
20:40.410 --> 20:43.560
It can't be limited to what anyone,

440
20:43.560 --> 20:46.110
let's say automaker is saying that these are the limits,

441
20:46.110 --> 20:48.330
this is the amount of data or the type of data

442
20:48.330 --> 20:51.120
or the type of user interface you can build

443
20:51.120 --> 20:53.460
because that's all gonna be different

444
20:53.460 --> 20:56.130
for any one particular service provider.

445
20:56.130 --> 20:57.690
And it also has to be sustainable.

446
20:57.690 --> 21:00.450
That charging app I told you about in the beginning

447
21:00.450 --> 21:02.550
that we spent 12 months on,

448
21:02.550 --> 21:05.220
I actually don't think you can get it anymore

449
21:05.220 --> 21:09.060
because as the cars update to newer versions of Android

450
21:09.060 --> 21:12.660
every one or two years, nobody has the time or energy

451
21:12.660 --> 21:15.690
to keep updating and maintaining old apps,

452
21:15.690 --> 21:17.553
so now it's no longer there.

453
21:19.290 --> 21:24.290
And finally, now, I come to what I think is a solution

454
21:24.870 --> 21:25.860
to this problem.

455
21:25.860 --> 21:30.860
So what we do with AiDEN, it's a software solution

456
21:31.230 --> 21:34.200
that's compatible with any Android automotive vehicle.

457
21:34.200 --> 21:38.040
That means that it's immediately possible to run it on

458
21:38.040 --> 21:40.710
pretty much all the major OEMs,

459
21:40.710 --> 21:42.843
newest car models that are launched now.

460
21:43.830 --> 21:45.900
It has a data privacy first approach

461
21:45.900 --> 21:49.770
so that people are able to see exactly what is requested

462
21:49.770 --> 21:51.450
in terms of data from them

463
21:51.450 --> 21:53.370
and exactly what they get in return,

464
21:53.370 --> 21:56.250
what service is requesting to know my position

465
21:56.250 --> 21:57.510
and for what purpose.

466
21:57.510 --> 21:59.040
And people are in control of their data

467
21:59.040 --> 22:01.650
and control of their services.

468
22:01.650 --> 22:03.900
It's sustainable because it's a no code solution.

469
22:03.900 --> 22:06.270
So as a third party service provider,

470
22:06.270 --> 22:07.800
you can connect with vehicles

471
22:07.800 --> 22:11.190
and have an in-vehicle app-like experience

472
22:11.190 --> 22:15.510
without having to write any code, none, no code whatsoever.

473
22:15.510 --> 22:18.690
And that actually is what makes it

474
22:18.690 --> 22:20.790
both flexible and scalable.

475
22:20.790 --> 22:23.850
And the UX we allow in the vehicles

476
22:23.850 --> 22:25.980
are basically anything you can do in a web browser,

477
22:25.980 --> 22:29.403
you can now do with an app-like approach in the vehicle.

478
22:32.850 --> 22:35.250
And our current status

479
22:35.250 --> 22:39.300
is that we're working with multiple different partners,

480
22:39.300 --> 22:42.360
not only HAAS Alert and Mavi

481
22:42.360 --> 22:44.790
that you will hear from later here.

482
22:44.790 --> 22:47.370
We're also deploying later this spring

483
22:47.370 --> 22:50.280
with one of the largest global OEMs.

484
22:50.280 --> 22:55.280
We are going to deploy one pay for fuel service.

485
22:55.920 --> 22:57.780
There's gonna be safety services,

486
22:57.780 --> 23:00.840
contextual automatic road and traffic information,

487
23:00.840 --> 23:04.440
connected insurance, and automatic tolling services.

488
23:04.440 --> 23:09.440
And if you are either working for a car company

489
23:11.700 --> 23:15.060
and you're interested in getting more flexible services

490
23:15.060 --> 23:18.480
onto your vehicles, please reach out.

491
23:18.480 --> 23:20.310
If you're any service provider

492
23:20.310 --> 23:22.050
that actually think it would be,

493
23:22.050 --> 23:26.220
you would be able to build a great automotive service,

494
23:26.220 --> 23:28.140
also, please reach out.

495
23:28.140 --> 23:32.130
We will also be at the COVESA event at the Bellagio tonight

496
23:32.130 --> 23:37.130
with HAAS Alert and Mavi, and yeah, that's it.

497
23:38.850 --> 23:39.810
Thank you very much,

498
23:39.810 --> 23:43.380
and I also would like to thank Connect2Car and COVESA

499
23:43.380 --> 23:46.410
for letting us come here and pitch.

500
23:46.410 --> 23:47.410
Thank you.

501
23:47.410 --> 23:50.850
(audience applauds)

502
23:50.850 --> 23:54.600
<v ->All right, thank you so much Niclas and AiDEN,</v>

503
23:54.600 --> 23:58.380
making the roads better and making the roads safer.

504
23:58.380 --> 23:59.790
Speaking of making the roads better,

505
23:59.790 --> 24:04.790
now we're gonna call up Mavi.io and the CEO Cynthia Hollen.

506
24:04.950 --> 24:09.540
She is about to tell you about OnMyWay Commerce

507
24:09.540 --> 24:12.600
and the trailblazing in car commerce marketplace,

508
24:12.600 --> 24:17.340
transforming the world's automotive, retail, and payments.

509
24:17.340 --> 24:20.949
Give a nice another round of a hand for Cynthia, everybody.

510
24:20.949 --> 24:22.853
(audience applauds)
<v ->Thank you, thank you, Logan.</v>

511
24:26.730 --> 24:28.053
Green is for clicking?

512
24:30.780 --> 24:32.030
Oh, the big green button.

513
24:35.100 --> 24:37.560
Hi everybody, thank you, my name is Cynthia,

514
24:37.560 --> 24:40.170
and I think that what we're about to talk about

515
24:40.170 --> 24:42.810
is a summary of a lot of what we've heard about

516
24:42.810 --> 24:45.390
all throughout this day, because to me,

517
24:45.390 --> 24:48.330
shopping and having your car do stuff for you

518
24:48.330 --> 24:51.510
and get stuff done is the ultimate expression

519
24:51.510 --> 24:54.900
of what we're all trying to get to with Connect2Car.

520
24:54.900 --> 24:59.130
We are building in-car commerce to solve the problem

521
24:59.130 --> 25:01.740
that you are now all saying to yourself

522
25:01.740 --> 25:02.970
because you're used to being able

523
25:02.970 --> 25:04.770
to get stuff done with your phone.

524
25:04.770 --> 25:07.410
You're starting to see these awesome new applications

525
25:07.410 --> 25:09.990
and great interfaces show up in your car

526
25:09.990 --> 25:11.707
and every single one of you is now saying,

527
25:11.707 --> 25:12.690
"Well, wait a minute,

528
25:12.690 --> 25:15.810
how come my car can't do this thing for me?"

529
25:15.810 --> 25:19.230
And the expectations that we have as consumers

530
25:19.230 --> 25:22.680
from the rest of our world is quickly getting focused

531
25:22.680 --> 25:26.250
on this unbelievably biggest interactive screen

532
25:26.250 --> 25:27.390
in my household.

533
25:27.390 --> 25:28.920
And we have understood

534
25:28.920 --> 25:31.860
because we've been building e-commerce for 20 years

535
25:31.860 --> 25:33.420
in different channels

536
25:33.420 --> 25:36.450
that the right modality for the right use case

537
25:36.450 --> 25:38.130
is the thing that makes consumers

538
25:38.130 --> 25:40.260
be able to get more things done.

539
25:40.260 --> 25:43.830
This great big giant electronic shopping cart on wheels,

540
25:43.830 --> 25:46.290
as I said earlier, is the modality

541
25:46.290 --> 25:49.083
that's allowing us to bring in-car commerce to you.

542
25:50.760 --> 25:54.270
We know that consumers, when surveyed,

543
25:54.270 --> 25:56.317
open-ended questions, when we ask them,

544
25:56.317 --> 25:59.400
"What is it that you want to have your car do for you?"

545
25:59.400 --> 26:01.507
Off the top of their head, they absolutely say,

546
26:01.507 --> 26:03.390
"I wanna be able to pay for,

547
26:03.390 --> 26:05.820
have my car figure out for me parking,

548
26:05.820 --> 26:08.490
fuel, car washing, tolls."

549
26:08.490 --> 26:10.807
More than 50% of them also say,

550
26:10.807 --> 26:14.250
"I also want it to be able to get all of my erranding

551
26:14.250 --> 26:15.570
and food and groceries

552
26:15.570 --> 26:18.120
and other sorts of purchasing for me."

553
26:18.120 --> 26:19.740
That's what we are focused on.

554
26:19.740 --> 26:23.400
We're focused on the moms and the Uber drivers,

555
26:23.400 --> 26:25.717
the professional drivers who all say,

556
26:25.717 --> 26:28.680
"Please just make my life easier.

557
26:28.680 --> 26:31.680
Make me not have to do math when I'm walking around.

558
26:31.680 --> 26:34.200
Make me not have to get the kids out of the seatbelt

559
26:34.200 --> 26:35.033
in the back.

560
26:35.033 --> 26:37.920
Make this great big giant computer I have

561
26:37.920 --> 26:39.960
do all of my work for me."

562
26:39.960 --> 26:43.620
So we have invented OnMyWay Commerce

563
26:43.620 --> 26:46.290
to take all of the math and take all of the thinking

564
26:46.290 --> 26:48.810
and take all of that stuff that you're doing on the phone

565
26:48.810 --> 26:53.280
in your lap at 90 miles an hour away and get back to safety

566
26:53.280 --> 26:55.530
and let your car do the simple things.

567
26:55.530 --> 26:57.780
Find something quickly that you need,

568
26:57.780 --> 26:59.010
help you get it purchased,

569
26:59.010 --> 27:01.320
help you do it while you stay focused

570
27:01.320 --> 27:03.180
on being safe and driving your car.

571
27:03.180 --> 27:08.180
OnMyWay Commerce is about on route curation.

572
27:08.347 --> 27:09.847
"Hey Audi, I'm hungry."

573
27:09.847 --> 27:12.000
"Okay, Cynthia, your favorite cheeseburger

574
27:12.000 --> 27:14.370
can be ready for you in 10 minutes.

575
27:14.370 --> 27:15.870
Nine minutes down the road,

576
27:15.870 --> 27:18.510
should I order it for you with your in-car wallet

577
27:18.510 --> 27:20.850
and have it ready for you when you get there?

578
27:20.850 --> 27:22.650
I'll tell them when you're three minutes away

579
27:22.650 --> 27:24.600
so they can start the french fries,

580
27:24.600 --> 27:26.520
and I'll tell them when you've pulled into the parking lot

581
27:26.520 --> 27:28.050
so they can bring it out to you."

582
27:28.050 --> 27:30.390
So again, you can focus on what you're doing,

583
27:30.390 --> 27:33.270
the screaming kids and focus on the car in the road.

584
27:33.270 --> 27:36.330
Curating all of those transactions together

585
27:36.330 --> 27:37.830
and putting it together with the wallet

586
27:37.830 --> 27:39.870
that's already in the car,

587
27:39.870 --> 27:42.720
doing what we call Persistent Order Status.

588
27:42.720 --> 27:45.570
Nobody wants to get off the highway to go pick up an order

589
27:45.570 --> 27:47.700
that might not be there, that you're not sure

590
27:47.700 --> 27:49.650
that's the reason you're getting off the highway.

591
27:49.650 --> 27:52.200
So pulling that entire experience together

592
27:52.200 --> 27:56.280
is what makes OnMyWay Commerce meaningful to consumers.

593
27:56.280 --> 27:58.530
We're working with some of the largest car brands

594
27:58.530 --> 28:01.980
in the world and you can see some installations here.

595
28:01.980 --> 28:03.990
This was the Lamborghini that we're,

596
28:03.990 --> 28:07.080
should be launching any day now with Volkswagen.

597
28:07.080 --> 28:10.050
We're launching with Jeep Dodge Chrysler, Ram Volkswagen,

598
28:10.050 --> 28:13.980
BMW Mercedes, working with a lot of other OEMs as well,

599
28:13.980 --> 28:17.040
and we need to be able to bring all of our retailers

600
28:17.040 --> 28:18.330
to all car companies,

601
28:18.330 --> 28:19.950
so please come up and talk to us

602
28:19.950 --> 28:23.130
about how we can get our restaurants into your cars as well.

603
28:23.130 --> 28:25.680
We're starting with the order and pickup payments.

604
28:25.680 --> 28:27.997
We have had a lot of people come to us and say,

605
28:27.997 --> 28:29.940
"But I can't charge my car

606
28:29.940 --> 28:31.800
or pick a place that I'm gonna charge my car

607
28:31.800 --> 28:33.540
if I don't know what I'm going to do

608
28:33.540 --> 28:35.760
when I am charging my car,

609
28:35.760 --> 28:39.510
so help me pick charging and a food and dining occasion

610
28:39.510 --> 28:40.740
at the same time."

611
28:40.740 --> 28:41.573
So we're pulling through

612
28:41.573 --> 28:45.150
a lot of those other experiences as well.

613
28:45.150 --> 28:48.930
Of course, the reason that this makes sense now, in 2025,

614
28:48.930 --> 28:50.580
when it didn't four years ago,

615
28:50.580 --> 28:52.530
the last time people tried this

616
28:52.530 --> 28:57.060
is that stores were 2% capable of pre-order before pandemic.

617
28:57.060 --> 28:59.010
They're now 98%.

618
28:59.010 --> 29:01.500
Consumers who were early adopters

619
29:01.500 --> 29:03.750
placing orders and deliveries in 2019,

620
29:03.750 --> 29:06.735
now you're a barbarian, if you think of going in the store

621
29:06.735 --> 29:08.640
and standing in line and waiting to pay

622
29:08.640 --> 29:09.960
and then waiting for your food.

623
29:09.960 --> 29:11.310
No one wants to do that.

624
29:11.310 --> 29:14.070
And all the CPG companies, advertisers are all

625
29:14.070 --> 29:16.920
looking for ways to reach their customers differently.

626
29:16.920 --> 29:17.790
I told you we're working

627
29:17.790 --> 29:20.700
with some of the best car brands in the world already.

628
29:20.700 --> 29:23.970
We're launching with about 100,000 restaurant locations

629
29:23.970 --> 29:24.803
and expect to do

630
29:24.803 --> 29:27.480
about a million location transactions this year.

631
29:27.480 --> 29:29.490
Of course, since we're at CES, gonna tell you,

632
29:29.490 --> 29:32.550
we have AI throughout our application menu,

633
29:32.550 --> 29:35.310
understanding, voice enabling of menus,

634
29:35.310 --> 29:38.040
how we process the orders through personalization,

635
29:38.040 --> 29:41.910
et cetera, and we'd love to work with you.

636
29:41.910 --> 29:42.743
Thank you.

637
29:43.688 --> 29:46.688
(audience applauds)

638
29:47.760 --> 29:50.640
<v ->Thank you so much, Cynthia, absolutely amazing.</v>

639
29:50.640 --> 29:54.150
I know as a chubby kid, getting food on the way home

640
29:54.150 --> 29:57.870
is definitely something I looked forward to every day.

641
29:57.870 --> 29:59.520
Now we're gonna keep it rolling at the last,

642
29:59.520 --> 30:01.290
but definitely not the least.

643
30:01.290 --> 30:03.390
We now have Aditi Desai with Voltpost.

644
30:03.390 --> 30:06.300
Voltpost is democratizing charging access.

645
30:06.300 --> 30:08.790
Volpost retrofits lampposts

646
30:08.790 --> 30:12.660
into modular electric vehicle charging platforms.

647
30:12.660 --> 30:15.270
Please give her a round of applause everybody.

648
30:15.270 --> 30:18.270
(audience applauds)

649
30:20.490 --> 30:23.280
<v ->Hi everyone, how's it going?</v>

650
30:23.280 --> 30:25.020
Thanks Logan for the warm introduction.

651
30:25.020 --> 30:27.990
As Logan mentioned, I am our Director of Partnerships

652
30:27.990 --> 30:30.330
and a founding team member at Voltpost.

653
30:30.330 --> 30:33.180
We founded Voltpost with the mission to decarbonize mobility

654
30:33.180 --> 30:36.360
by democratizing electric vehicle charging access,

655
30:36.360 --> 30:37.350
and we plan on doing that

656
30:37.350 --> 30:41.460
by making charging as ubiquitous as lampposts.

657
30:41.460 --> 30:42.480
So the problem statement here,

658
30:42.480 --> 30:44.010
I'm sure you're all very well aware of,

659
30:44.010 --> 30:46.680
which is that the top EV adoption barrier for drivers

660
30:46.680 --> 30:49.590
is a lack of convenient and accessible charging.

661
30:49.590 --> 30:52.050
There are just 2% of cars on the road today in the US

662
30:52.050 --> 30:52.883
that are electric,

663
30:52.883 --> 30:54.840
but that number's increasing year over year

664
30:54.840 --> 30:59.840
with new car sale, new EV sales being 9% just last year.

665
31:00.450 --> 31:02.670
And with different climate targets,

666
31:02.670 --> 31:05.730
it's very clear that we need to decarbonize quickly.

667
31:05.730 --> 31:07.140
But there's a particular challenge,

668
31:07.140 --> 31:08.910
especially in urban environments

669
31:08.910 --> 31:13.910
where city drivers don't have a dedicated charging at home.

670
31:14.220 --> 31:15.960
They're not able to charge in their garage.

671
31:15.960 --> 31:17.790
And as you can see here in the picture of the left

672
31:17.790 --> 31:19.830
of somebody charging from the second floor

673
31:19.830 --> 31:21.270
of their Brooklyn brownstone in New York,

674
31:21.270 --> 31:22.860
which I will say is a site

675
31:22.860 --> 31:25.290
that you see more often than you would expect,

676
31:25.290 --> 31:26.610
it's clear that charging

677
31:26.610 --> 31:28.260
is currently scarce and inconvenient,

678
31:28.260 --> 31:29.880
and so we're building the best solution

679
31:29.880 --> 31:31.413
to meet those drivers' needs.

680
31:32.580 --> 31:34.650
At Voltpost, we're retrofitting lampposts

681
31:34.650 --> 31:37.590
into a modular electric vehicle charging platform.

682
31:37.590 --> 31:39.510
By retrofitting the existing infrastructure,

683
31:39.510 --> 31:41.640
we're able to cut down on the cost, timing,

684
31:41.640 --> 31:44.550
and footprint of charger installation because we get rid

685
31:44.550 --> 31:48.180
of that timely and costly construction and trenching.

686
31:48.180 --> 31:50.880
Our modular design maximizes the chargers uptime

687
31:50.880 --> 31:53.823
while keeping the O and M expenses as low as possible.

688
31:54.960 --> 31:58.680
Our charging hardware has LED feedback, uses a smart meter,

689
31:58.680 --> 32:00.990
and has an integrated cable management system.

690
32:00.990 --> 32:02.490
So typically a lot of charging stations

691
32:02.490 --> 32:04.350
will have the cable out and exposed,

692
32:04.350 --> 32:08.160
which makes it vulnerable to vandalism, inclement weather.

693
32:08.160 --> 32:10.770
It's also a trip hazard for drivers, bikers,

694
32:10.770 --> 32:13.680
and pedestrians, and so inside of our charging module,

695
32:13.680 --> 32:15.210
we have about 20 feet of cable,

696
32:15.210 --> 32:16.200
where at the press of a button,

697
32:16.200 --> 32:17.850
you can pull out as much cable as you need,

698
32:17.850 --> 32:19.320
plug, put it into your car,

699
32:19.320 --> 32:21.090
unplug, stick it back into the module,

700
32:21.090 --> 32:23.430
and it sucks it in like a vacuum.

701
32:23.430 --> 32:24.600
On the software side of things,

702
32:24.600 --> 32:26.010
we have a custom mobile application

703
32:26.010 --> 32:28.770
where you can surface Voltpost on a map,

704
32:28.770 --> 32:30.750
manage the end-to-end charging session.

705
32:30.750 --> 32:33.330
We're also pursuing an open charging distribution strategy

706
32:33.330 --> 32:36.870
so that you can surface Voltpost on partner apps and maps,

707
32:36.870 --> 32:39.000
and we have a dashboard on the backend

708
32:39.000 --> 32:41.520
that can be used to track charging utilization data

709
32:41.520 --> 32:42.480
and other insights

710
32:42.480 --> 32:45.333
to benchmark and forecast future charging need.

711
32:47.250 --> 32:48.960
One of the benefits of our modularity

712
32:48.960 --> 32:50.310
is being able to future proof

713
32:50.310 --> 32:52.140
and upgrade the product over time.

714
32:52.140 --> 32:54.720
We see charging as an entry point to what is ultimately

715
32:54.720 --> 32:56.940
an intelligent infrastructure platform

716
32:56.940 --> 32:58.950
that goes beyond just our current offering,

717
32:58.950 --> 33:01.650
which is the charging hardware, the software, the data,

718
33:01.650 --> 33:02.700
and the O and M,

719
33:02.700 --> 33:04.530
but we're exploring different sorts of verticals,

720
33:04.530 --> 33:06.000
so think connectivity, right,

721
33:06.000 --> 33:09.270
integrating things like 5G and Wi-Fi into the modules.

722
33:09.270 --> 33:11.730
Just last year we announced a partnership with AT&amp;T

723
33:11.730 --> 33:12.900
to do just that.

724
33:12.900 --> 33:14.760
We're also looking at integrating things like sensors

725
33:14.760 --> 33:17.310
related to air quality, curb management,

726
33:17.310 --> 33:20.250
thinking about how can a network of chargers

727
33:20.250 --> 33:22.620
be used as a distributed energy resource

728
33:22.620 --> 33:25.110
in the case of, you know, grid outages,

729
33:25.110 --> 33:27.930
and also looking at more traditional media

730
33:27.930 --> 33:30.063
and advertisement verticals as well.

731
33:31.170 --> 33:32.730
In terms of the traction of the company,

732
33:32.730 --> 33:35.610
so we've done a couple of pilot projects in New York City

733
33:35.610 --> 33:37.470
with the Department of Transportation there,

734
33:37.470 --> 33:40.440
as well as Detroit through the state of Michigan.

735
33:40.440 --> 33:42.270
And starting in just a few weeks,

736
33:42.270 --> 33:44.460
we're gearing up to deploy the commercial product.

737
33:44.460 --> 33:47.610
We have projects in New York, Michigan, California,

738
33:47.610 --> 33:49.860
Illinois, Massachusetts, and Connecticut

739
33:49.860 --> 33:51.753
with the public and private sector.

740
33:53.610 --> 33:55.200
Voltpost was founded in 2021.

741
33:55.200 --> 33:57.270
We're headquartered in New York, but our team is split up

742
33:57.270 --> 33:59.010
between New York and San Francisco.

743
33:59.010 --> 34:01.470
The founding team is former Samsung and Barclays

744
34:01.470 --> 34:02.760
and has extensive experience

745
34:02.760 --> 34:05.040
of bringing products from concept to commercialization

746
34:05.040 --> 34:08.310
with over 50 patents under the team's belt collectively.

747
34:08.310 --> 34:10.140
Some of our investors include RWE,

748
34:10.140 --> 34:12.720
which is the largest German utility, as well as Exelon,

749
34:12.720 --> 34:14.691
which is the largest utility here in the US,

750
34:14.691 --> 34:19.683
alongside other mission aligned climate tech VCs.

751
34:21.060 --> 34:23.640
We have a scalable hardware as a service business model

752
34:23.640 --> 34:25.800
where we own and operate our charging network

753
34:25.800 --> 34:27.600
and lease a turnkey offering,

754
34:27.600 --> 34:29.940
which includes a charging hardware, the software,

755
34:29.940 --> 34:31.800
the data, and the O and M.

756
34:31.800 --> 34:33.360
Under our model, we're able to apply

757
34:33.360 --> 34:36.090
different types of grants and non-diluted funding

758
34:36.090 --> 34:38.400
to offset the project cost for the customer,

759
34:38.400 --> 34:41.283
and we view electricity as a pass through to the utility.

760
34:43.050 --> 34:44.250
Ultimately, we're building this out

761
34:44.250 --> 34:45.630
as a mission driven company

762
34:45.630 --> 34:48.180
with the goal of increasing public charging access

763
34:48.180 --> 34:50.700
so that we can reduce carbon and air pollution.

764
34:50.700 --> 34:51.870
We wanna put these chargers up

765
34:51.870 --> 34:53.520
in communities that need them most,

766
34:53.520 --> 34:54.600
and are especially excited

767
34:54.600 --> 34:56.553
about the Green Workforce opportunity.

768
34:58.500 --> 35:01.170
Our company was born in America and built coast to coast,

769
35:01.170 --> 35:02.190
and we welcome you

770
35:02.190 --> 35:05.130
to transform lampposts into Voltposts with us.

771
35:05.130 --> 35:08.340
I will be at the COVESA networking reception later today

772
35:08.340 --> 35:09.210
and would love to connect

773
35:09.210 --> 35:11.880
if you're interested about learning more about Voltpost.

774
35:11.880 --> 35:12.813
Thank you.

775
35:13.685 --> 35:16.685
(audience applauds)

776
35:18.090 --> 35:19.800
<v ->All right, thank you so much Aditi</v>

777
35:19.800 --> 35:22.230
for closing us out here.

778
35:22.230 --> 35:24.990
I do just want to take one moment to let everybody know

779
35:24.990 --> 35:27.300
that we don't want the conversations to stop here.

780
35:27.300 --> 35:29.850
We want to continue to grow with everybody in this room,

781
35:29.850 --> 35:32.070
and we would love to open up these different conversations.

782
35:32.070 --> 35:33.900
As each one of them mentioned,

783
35:33.900 --> 35:36.840
we will all be at COVESA later tonight at the Bellagio.

784
35:36.840 --> 35:38.760
We invite you all to come and join us.

785
35:38.760 --> 35:41.850
It's gonna be all the way back in the convention center.

786
35:41.850 --> 35:43.470
If you guys haven't already signed up,

787
35:43.470 --> 35:44.760
please come and find us after.

788
35:44.760 --> 35:47.940
We will gladly get you guys registered.

789
35:47.940 --> 35:50.010
I want to give one more round of applause everybody

790
35:50.010 --> 35:50.850
for the presenters,

791
35:50.850 --> 35:54.750
as well as Chris Cook and the Connect2Car team.

792
35:54.750 --> 35:56.250
Thank you all so much for being here

793
35:56.250 --> 35:59.790
and I will turn it over to Chris to close you guys out.

794
35:59.790 --> 36:01.042
Thank you.

795
36:01.042 --> 36:04.042
(audience applauds)

796
36:14.910 --> 36:16.317
I don't know where Chris is.

797
36:16.317 --> 36:18.660
There he is, he's on his way up.

798
36:18.660 --> 36:21.163
But one more time, thank you all so much.

799
36:22.899 --> 36:24.643
<v ->Yeah, and I don't need to step up there to say goodbye.</v>

800
36:24.643 --> 36:25.740
I think everybody can hear me

801
36:25.740 --> 36:27.390
from pretty much anywhere I am.

802
36:27.390 --> 36:30.060
I appreciate everybody hanging out with us

803
36:30.060 --> 36:31.560
for the day for Connect2Car.

804
36:31.560 --> 36:34.380
Logan, thank you so much for everything that you do

805
36:34.380 --> 36:37.023
and I look forward to you being back next year.

806
36:37.890 --> 36:39.780
All right, good.

807
36:39.780 --> 36:41.610
And like the format too,

808
36:41.610 --> 36:44.550
so I appreciate all of you taking the time.

809
36:44.550 --> 36:49.260
The videos for these will be up on connect2car.tech,

810
36:49.260 --> 36:52.140
usually in a week or two when we get 'em from CES.

811
36:52.140 --> 36:54.210
The first presentation of the day,

812
36:54.210 --> 36:58.803
Steve, when he did the, I say keynote lightly,
