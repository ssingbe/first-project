1
00:00.000 --> 00:02.583
(upbeat music)

2
00:10.830 --> 00:13.470
<v ->All right, hello CES, how is everybody doing today</v>

3
00:13.470 --> 00:15.480
on a Thursday afternoon?

4
00:15.480 --> 00:16.890
Yes. Oh, I like that energy.

5
00:16.890 --> 00:18.330
Thank you so much for that.

6
00:18.330 --> 00:21.210
Yeah, but you're gonna be glad you came to this one

7
00:21.210 --> 00:23.040
and everyone's gonna be very sad that they didn't come here.

8
00:23.040 --> 00:25.080
We have such a great panel here today

9
00:25.080 --> 00:27.450
and I'm really excited about this topic.

10
00:27.450 --> 00:32.450
I'm Eric Iverson, I'm the CTO at United Talent Agency,

11
00:33.450 --> 00:37.260
and we're one of the leading talent agencies in Hollywood.

12
00:37.260 --> 00:39.030
I've been in media entertainment technology

13
00:39.030 --> 00:42.240
for about 25 years and I couldn't be more excited

14
00:42.240 --> 00:45.270
than to interview this very wonderful and esteemed panel.

15
00:45.270 --> 00:48.900
So we're going to go through each one

16
00:48.900 --> 00:51.570
and let them talk about themselves a little bit.

17
00:51.570 --> 00:54.630
And so the first I start with Soyoung,

18
00:54.630 --> 00:57.510
you wanna just a quick introduction of yourself.

19
00:57.510 --> 00:59.730
<v ->Hey everyone, I'm Soyoung, I'm one of the Co-founders</v>

20
00:59.730 --> 01:02.880
and Head of Go-to-Market at a company called Twelve Labs.

21
01:02.880 --> 01:06.270
And Twelve Labs is a company that builds foundation models

22
01:06.270 --> 01:09.540
for multimodal video understanding, which is a fancy way

23
01:09.540 --> 01:12.030
of saying we build AI that can contextually comprehend

24
01:12.030 --> 01:14.940
everything inside video, just like a human can.

25
01:14.940 --> 01:17.880
That then allows our end users to be able to search

26
01:17.880 --> 01:20.700
and find any moment across large video libraries

27
01:20.700 --> 01:24.030
using everyday language, automatically summarize, describe,

28
01:24.030 --> 01:26.400
ask questions about what's happening inside video,

29
01:26.400 --> 01:28.530
create highlights and so on.

30
01:28.530 --> 01:30.960
<v ->Yeah, and I thought this was like such a great picture</v>

31
01:30.960 --> 01:34.410
of Soyoung and magically you come to CES

32
01:34.410 --> 01:37.260
and that, you know, don't you think it was like,

33
01:37.260 --> 01:38.850
this looks like someone that should be in a movie.

34
01:38.850 --> 01:39.720
Like when you look at that photo

35
01:39.720 --> 01:42.270
and then you saw like this, like very kind of diva look.

36
01:42.270 --> 01:43.980
Anyway, I thought you look really great. It's amazing.

37
01:43.980 --> 01:45.060
I didn't do anything by the way.

38
01:45.060 --> 01:48.172
It just, you come to CES and magically the photo does that.

39
01:48.172 --> 01:49.620
So anyway, that's great.

40
01:49.620 --> 01:51.630
Cody now is very nervous about what's gonna happen next.

41
01:51.630 --> 01:53.670
But Cody, would you please do a quick introduction

42
01:53.670 --> 01:54.503
of yourself?

43
01:56.670 --> 01:59.640
<v ->Good afternoon everyone. I am Dr. Cody Coleman.</v>

44
01:59.640 --> 02:03.450
I'm the CEO and Co-founder of Coactive AI.

45
02:03.450 --> 02:07.290
Coactive is a multimodal AI platform

46
02:07.290 --> 02:11.790
that makes it easy to search and analyze images and video.

47
02:11.790 --> 02:13.140
We work a lot with media

48
02:13.140 --> 02:14.250
and retail companies,

49
02:14.250 --> 02:18.923
allowing them to build applications on all of their content.

50
02:18.923 --> 02:20.670
<v Eric>Yeah, it's great, great technology</v>

51
02:20.670 --> 02:23.010
and it's really great 'cause you get these photos

52
02:23.010 --> 02:24.780
and then you never know what's gonna happen

53
02:24.780 --> 02:27.630
and all of a sudden like, what's behind Cody?

54
02:27.630 --> 02:30.360
You know, and you'd be surprised like in Hollywood

55
02:30.360 --> 02:31.620
what could just be right behind a picture.

56
02:31.620 --> 02:33.810
So anyway, thank you for that Cody.

57
02:33.810 --> 02:37.500
And then next, David, would you do a quick intro?

58
02:37.500 --> 02:39.270
<v ->Sure, okay, I didn't know, I thought photos were optional,</v>

59
02:39.270 --> 02:40.380
so I didn't know where you got that, but hey,

60
02:40.380 --> 02:41.970
my name is David Bennett.

61
02:41.970 --> 02:44.730
I'm the Chief Customer Officer at Tenstorrent,

62
02:44.730 --> 02:46.830
Tenstorrent and AI hardware company.

63
02:46.830 --> 02:48.690
We build computers for AI

64
02:48.690 --> 02:50.820
and what that means, actually, we're kind of full stack.

65
02:50.820 --> 02:55.230
We build the IP, we build the chips, we put in AI technology

66
02:55.230 --> 02:57.810
and compute technology to basically offer an alternative

67
02:57.810 --> 02:59.280
for people that are looking to power

68
02:59.280 --> 03:02.070
their training, their inference, whatever.

69
03:02.070 --> 03:04.260
So yeah, it's an exciting time to be in our space.

70
03:04.260 --> 03:07.260
<v Eric>That's great, and to compliment David,</v>

71
03:07.260 --> 03:08.130
we have Simon.

72
03:08.130 --> 03:09.690
Simon, would you do a quick intro?

73
03:09.690 --> 03:12.930
<v ->I will. Nice to meet y'all. It's great to be here.</v>

74
03:12.930 --> 03:15.597
So Simon Crownshaw, so I run Media

75
03:15.597 --> 03:18.303
and Entertainment at a small company called Microsoft.

76
03:19.350 --> 03:23.460
And before that, I was 17 years at the Walt Disney Company

77
03:23.460 --> 03:26.880
and now I spend the majority of my time helping customers

78
03:26.880 --> 03:28.920
think through their AI journey.

79
03:28.920 --> 03:30.840
<v ->Yeah, so we have a pretty good panel here</v>

80
03:30.840 --> 03:32.580
and it was interesting, like it is,

81
03:32.580 --> 03:34.050
I never saw this ever happen before,

82
03:34.050 --> 03:37.050
but these photos got really competitive with one another.

83
03:37.050 --> 03:40.830
And so I think they were ready for this panel here today.

84
03:40.830 --> 03:43.080
So anyway, thank you guys for really

85
03:43.080 --> 03:44.190
bringing your best here today.

86
03:44.190 --> 03:46.500
That's really impressive. Okay.

87
03:46.500 --> 03:49.080
So if you didn't think that we had such a great panel,

88
03:49.080 --> 03:50.640
and Simon hasn't seen this either,

89
03:50.640 --> 03:55.640
but I asked Co-pilot if how serious Microsoft

90
03:56.310 --> 03:59.190
was actually about Media and Entertainment

91
03:59.190 --> 04:00.240
and you could read for yourself,

92
04:00.240 --> 04:01.380
this is straight outta Co-pilot

93
04:01.380 --> 04:02.790
so for sure you could believe a hundred percent of it.

94
04:02.790 --> 04:05.460
But my favorite part was right here is the one name

95
04:05.460 --> 04:08.220
that it called out on its own was Simon Crownshaw.

96
04:08.220 --> 04:09.720
And he's right here, right here.

97
04:09.720 --> 04:12.840
Like the guy that if you asked Co-pilot, he's right here.

98
04:12.840 --> 04:15.030
So you're gonna get to hear from him directly here today.

99
04:15.030 --> 04:17.460
Okay. So I'm gonna do a little context.

100
04:17.460 --> 04:20.340
Our industry, I've been this in pretty much most

101
04:20.340 --> 04:21.690
aspects of media entertainment.

102
04:21.690 --> 04:24.000
I, Simon, you cross most aspects of it,

103
04:24.000 --> 04:26.157
super fascinating on what's happening and going on.

104
04:26.157 --> 04:29.310
And so I made this up for some colleagues a little while ago

105
04:29.310 --> 04:31.980
to almost explain some of the changes I think we're seeing

106
04:31.980 --> 04:34.770
with consumers and consumers are continually dealing

107
04:34.770 --> 04:39.210
with this time versus quality kind of basically matrix

108
04:39.210 --> 04:40.562
that I think that we're doing.

109
04:40.562 --> 04:42.480
And what's interesting about quality

110
04:42.480 --> 04:46.140
is how many people here like to drink wine, right?

111
04:46.140 --> 04:47.797
And have you ever get these things like,

112
04:47.797 --> 04:49.647
"Hey, is that a good wine?"

113
04:51.101 --> 04:54.150
And you know, there's some very high-end,

114
04:54.150 --> 04:56.280
you know, and people that know like,

115
04:56.280 --> 04:58.130
but at the end of the day, what is a good wine?

116
04:58.130 --> 05:01.110
A good wine is the wine you like, right?

117
05:01.110 --> 05:04.110
And so I think that's the thing was, we think of quality,

118
05:04.110 --> 05:06.240
you have to put the hat on

119
05:06.240 --> 05:08.520
of what is quality to the consumer

120
05:08.520 --> 05:12.930
and if, how many people have kids or friends with kids

121
05:12.930 --> 05:16.290
or used to be a kid, alright, no, but kids, current kids?

122
05:16.290 --> 05:17.782
<v Simon>So still are a child?</v>

123
05:17.782 --> 05:20.640
<v ->Yes. Still that's yes. Yeah, might be on stage.</v>

124
05:20.640 --> 05:25.050
But it's interesting what quality is to like,

125
05:25.050 --> 05:27.420
I have three kids, the quality is to those three kids

126
05:27.420 --> 05:28.920
is changing, its different.

127
05:28.920 --> 05:30.690
Does everybody agree with that?

128
05:30.690 --> 05:32.400
Alright, but this equation is really

129
05:32.400 --> 05:35.670
this equation, you could take this one to the bank, right?

130
05:35.670 --> 05:37.650
How, what's the quality to me

131
05:37.650 --> 05:41.460
and how much time do I have to spend to get to the quality?

132
05:41.460 --> 05:43.560
And what are we seeing as a net result of that?

133
05:43.560 --> 05:45.330
We're seeing kind of features

134
05:45.330 --> 05:48.480
like feature films being compressed on time.

135
05:48.480 --> 05:51.187
We saw what did we see in "Episodic?"

136
05:51.187 --> 05:54.450
"Episodic" went from 22, 24 episodes down to six to eight.

137
05:54.450 --> 05:55.800
I can get through it a little bit quicker, right?

138
05:55.800 --> 05:58.500
And so we're seeing that the board eSports,

139
05:58.500 --> 06:01.710
eSports is what like a 12 minute match

140
06:01.710 --> 06:04.110
as opposed to maybe three hours

141
06:04.110 --> 06:07.920
and thirty minutes for in an NFL game.

142
06:07.920 --> 06:09.690
And probably the one that was most interesting to me,

143
06:09.690 --> 06:12.960
I don't know anyone see MLB introduced the shot clock

144
06:12.960 --> 06:14.180
or basically the Pitch Clock, you know, for that answer?

145
06:14.180 --> 06:16.110
<v David>Yeah, after every pitch, right?</v>

146
06:16.110 --> 06:17.340
<v ->Yeah. Super interesting.</v>

147
06:17.340 --> 06:22.340
That reduced the length of an MLB game by thirty minutes.

148
06:22.500 --> 06:23.880
That is a major impact.

149
06:23.880 --> 06:25.620
Again, making that a little bit more accessible,

150
06:25.620 --> 06:27.900
improving how your access is on that.

151
06:27.900 --> 06:29.490
So that's kind of what we have going on

152
06:29.490 --> 06:33.594
is in context it is, you could imagine this is in fact

153
06:33.594 --> 06:35.310
how we get through that

154
06:35.310 --> 06:37.350
and how we do that for consumers at the end of the day,

155
06:37.350 --> 06:39.690
which is what we're gonna work backwards

156
06:39.690 --> 06:42.870
from, it goes across the different places where media works.

157
06:42.870 --> 06:45.090
And what I thought I'd do is just take a quick second

158
06:45.090 --> 06:48.150
and explain kind of like the really large bubbles

159
06:48.150 --> 06:50.010
and we're gonna start way to the green.

160
06:50.010 --> 06:53.190
Everyone, we're at the Consumer Electronic Show,

161
06:53.190 --> 06:54.930
so we're gonna talk about consumers first, right?

162
06:54.930 --> 06:56.760
Everybody's on the far right side, alright?

163
06:56.760 --> 06:59.310
At the end of the day, the only reason that any

164
06:59.310 --> 07:01.080
of us are here in the entertainment business

165
07:01.080 --> 07:02.670
is because consumers watch content.

166
07:02.670 --> 07:03.750
Hopefully that makes sense, right?

167
07:03.750 --> 07:06.120
If we do the greatest content in the world

168
07:06.120 --> 07:07.620
and nobody ever watches it

169
07:07.620 --> 07:09.930
and there is no business,

170
07:09.930 --> 07:11.340
you might do like really fun work

171
07:11.340 --> 07:13.365
at a school play or something.

172
07:13.365 --> 07:15.750
But that's for business of media entertainment.

173
07:15.750 --> 07:17.670
And there's only two ways in our industry

174
07:17.670 --> 07:21.120
that really any money, anything is monetized.

175
07:21.120 --> 07:22.950
So you have ad supported and paid.

176
07:22.950 --> 07:24.690
So that's what we're looking at the end

177
07:24.690 --> 07:25.523
of the day with consumers.

178
07:25.523 --> 07:27.120
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna walk backwards

179
07:27.120 --> 07:29.460
from like where does the consumer experience,

180
07:29.460 --> 07:32.580
we're gonna walk backwards to where is the supply chains

181
07:32.580 --> 07:34.410
that there's a bunch of works, so distributors

182
07:34.410 --> 07:36.600
and other people that get content to the exhibitors

183
07:36.600 --> 07:37.950
that has to get improved.

184
07:37.950 --> 07:40.680
And we're gonna talk about what creators are doing with AI

185
07:40.680 --> 07:42.030
and those are the three big topics

186
07:42.030 --> 07:42.960
we're gonna talk about today.

187
07:42.960 --> 07:45.720
You ready? 'Cause we got a good panel.

188
07:45.720 --> 07:48.420
Alright, so with that we're gonna hop right in into it

189
07:49.454 --> 07:51.420
and I have some examples teed up here

190
07:51.420 --> 07:52.560
for a little bit as we get into it.

191
07:52.560 --> 07:56.380
So with that Soyoung, you love content.

192
07:58.500 --> 08:00.690
So we're gonna start with this, I've just really quick,

193
08:00.690 --> 08:03.090
what seems something was awesome that you have seen kind

194
08:03.090 --> 08:06.090
of over this holiday break from a content point of view?

195
08:06.090 --> 08:08.040
<v ->So I had grand plans for my holiday,</v>

196
08:08.040 --> 08:09.570
but I ended up on YouTube

197
08:09.570 --> 08:12.300
and I watched, I was scrolling through a lot of shorts,

198
08:12.300 --> 08:15.120
so highlights of all of the really great moments

199
08:15.120 --> 08:17.040
from the show of "Friends"

200
08:17.040 --> 08:19.410
and I got into scrolling and scrolling

201
08:19.410 --> 08:21.450
and watching all of that on YouTube.

202
08:21.450 --> 08:24.900
And then I actually ended up resubscribing to Max

203
08:24.900 --> 08:28.237
and I ended up spending all my holiday rewatching the entire

204
08:28.237 --> 08:31.110
"Friends" series and I did the same thing

205
08:31.110 --> 08:33.930
with "Silicon Valley", the show.

206
08:33.930 --> 08:35.670
Yeah. So that's what I spent my holiday.

207
08:35.670 --> 08:37.800
<v ->All right, so you got to watch some pretty good content,</v>

208
08:37.800 --> 08:38.633
pretty good experience.

209
08:38.633 --> 08:39.900
Now when you were going through that,

210
08:39.900 --> 08:42.420
was there anything that you were like in your holiday break

211
08:42.420 --> 08:44.442
you were like, "Oh, this should be better."

212
08:44.442 --> 08:47.180
It should be easier to do and you fill in the blank.

213
08:47.180 --> 08:51.260
<v ->Yeah, so I feel like it should be easier</v>

214
08:51.260 --> 08:54.480
to have personalized packages of highlights

215
08:54.480 --> 08:56.190
or content I can consume.

216
08:56.190 --> 08:58.770
And using the example of "Friends",

217
08:58.770 --> 09:01.702
'cause I'm such a fan, I love all,

218
09:01.702 --> 09:03.690
there's some moments across,

219
09:03.690 --> 09:05.880
no matter how many times I watch it,

220
09:05.880 --> 09:07.980
themes that really speak to me personally

221
09:07.980 --> 09:11.040
and things like Monica's obsession with cleaning

222
09:11.040 --> 09:13.440
or Phoebe's spiritual beliefs, right?

223
09:13.440 --> 09:17.530
And so if I had the ability to actually just watch

224
09:18.450 --> 09:22.740
these moments across the series where certain things

225
09:22.740 --> 09:25.170
that speak to me personally and emotionally

226
09:25.170 --> 09:26.730
and that hooks me in

227
09:26.730 --> 09:30.316
and I'm able to find those really easily, I feel like

228
09:30.316 --> 09:34.590
that would probably help me spend of my spare time.

229
09:34.590 --> 09:36.930
<v ->I like that. How many, does that sound good to you too?</v>

230
09:36.930 --> 09:39.230
I know I want some of that, but great example of that.

231
09:39.230 --> 09:42.000
How about David, how about you over the break,

232
09:42.000 --> 09:43.110
good experience?

233
09:43.110 --> 09:45.240
<v ->No, you know for me it's, I think, you know, when you gave</v>

234
09:45.240 --> 09:47.430
that first list, I think it was the episodic content.

235
09:47.430 --> 09:48.300
I've got all these dreams

236
09:48.300 --> 09:49.920
of catching up on all these long movies

237
09:49.920 --> 09:52.140
and watching all this thing, I just don't have the time.

238
09:52.140 --> 09:54.750
So what I found myself doing is really looking at a show

239
09:54.750 --> 09:56.970
and if it starts with a couple episodes

240
09:56.970 --> 09:58.650
or it only has a couple episodes in it,

241
09:58.650 --> 10:00.570
that's the one I kind of tend to lean towards.

242
10:00.570 --> 10:01.770
So I wish I had something more interesting,

243
10:01.770 --> 10:04.080
but for me it's really about that moving from the long form

244
10:04.080 --> 10:05.760
content to something kinda like

245
10:05.760 --> 10:07.380
you did with the YouTube shorts, right?

246
10:07.380 --> 10:08.700
I don't know if I'd be able to make that jump

247
10:08.700 --> 10:10.500
than going watching the series, but I try

248
10:10.500 --> 10:12.060
and like find some things that are really short

249
10:12.060 --> 10:13.290
and short bites to go watch.

250
10:13.290 --> 10:15.570
<v ->Yeah, I love it, and anything you were annoyed</v>

251
10:15.570 --> 10:17.407
with over the break that you were like,

252
10:17.407 --> 10:18.807
"Oh this is great" but then.

253
10:20.070 --> 10:23.250
<v ->No, you know, I live my life in the hardware space</v>

254
10:23.250 --> 10:25.320
and when I want to get harder, my problem is being able

255
10:25.320 --> 10:26.610
to find the hardware I want to buy.

256
10:26.610 --> 10:28.620
And we have a problem right now in the industry.

257
10:28.620 --> 10:31.470
I think Simon might bring it up a little bit later,

258
10:31.470 --> 10:32.820
but the reality is you know,

259
10:32.820 --> 10:35.906
if we look at the amount of compute that's required

260
10:35.906 --> 10:39.510
to do all the things that we want to get done, it's endless.

261
10:39.510 --> 10:41.730
And frankly, we're trying to do all these experiments,

262
10:41.730 --> 10:43.260
we need to get the hardware in our hands to go do it.

263
10:43.260 --> 10:46.230
So what frustrated me is not consuming the content,

264
10:46.230 --> 10:47.940
it's actually getting the hardware in people's hand

265
10:47.940 --> 10:49.200
to be able to go create the content

266
10:49.200 --> 10:50.700
that we all want to consume.

267
10:50.700 --> 10:51.990
That's a bigger picture.

268
10:51.990 --> 10:53.880
<v ->Yeah. Well, we'll talk more about that.</v>

269
10:53.880 --> 10:55.330
Alright, Cody, how about you?

270
10:56.370 --> 10:59.880
<v ->So I have to give a disclaimer that I am a nerd</v>

271
10:59.880 --> 11:01.860
and my friends are nerds.

272
11:01.860 --> 11:04.440
So one of my friends, he is a musician

273
11:04.440 --> 11:06.480
and he was creating a vinyl record.

274
11:06.480 --> 11:08.010
So he had recorded these songs

275
11:08.010 --> 11:10.770
and he printed out a vinyl record

276
11:10.770 --> 11:12.900
and he was scratching his head about the cover art.

277
11:12.900 --> 11:15.180
Like what is he gonna do for cover art

278
11:15.180 --> 11:16.830
for his like vinyl record?

279
11:16.830 --> 11:19.740
And he generated it using AI

280
11:19.740 --> 11:23.160
and he actually created the cover art, packaged the vinyl

281
11:23.160 --> 11:25.920
and he gave that to me as a gift and I loved

282
11:25.920 --> 11:28.952
that because it was one like awesome music

283
11:28.952 --> 11:31.140
and it was great to hear my friend's music

284
11:31.140 --> 11:33.390
and it combined, you know, the old

285
11:33.390 --> 11:35.460
and the new together to create such a thoughtful

286
11:35.460 --> 11:36.780
and amazing experience

287
11:36.780 --> 11:38.520
and it was the best Christmas gift

288
11:38.520 --> 11:39.930
that I think I've ever gotten.

289
11:39.930 --> 11:42.210
<v ->That's really cool. I love that. Great experience.</v>

290
11:42.210 --> 11:43.980
Anything that you were annoyed with over the break?

291
11:43.980 --> 11:46.830
<v ->So this is kind of funny, there was this moment</v>

292
11:46.830 --> 11:49.050
I was with my family in New York City

293
11:49.050 --> 11:52.200
and we were all having espresso martinis

294
11:52.200 --> 11:54.750
and someone had seen this meme about like, you know,

295
11:54.750 --> 11:57.120
once one person orders an espresso martini,

296
11:57.120 --> 12:00.000
everyone else ends up ordering an espresso martini

297
12:00.000 --> 12:03.360
and we spent like, you know, 15, 20 minutes trying to find

298
12:03.360 --> 12:06.510
that video to just like, you know, show that kind

299
12:06.510 --> 12:08.220
of funny meme to each other.

300
12:08.220 --> 12:10.170
So, you know, searching, trying to find

301
12:10.170 --> 12:11.610
that was actually quite difficult.

302
12:11.610 --> 12:14.490
<v ->Yeah, how many, if we could just search better on content,</v>

303
12:14.490 --> 12:16.200
is everyone like with this explosion of content,

304
12:16.200 --> 12:17.160
it's just gotten harder.

305
12:17.160 --> 12:18.270
We do want a little bit better on that?

306
12:18.270 --> 12:20.820
Yeah, me too, and there's lots of places

307
12:20.820 --> 12:21.690
where we want that search.

308
12:21.690 --> 12:23.550
I think we're gonna talk bit about that.

309
12:23.550 --> 12:24.573
Alright, last Simon.

310
12:25.950 --> 12:27.750
<v ->I have follow all of that stuff.</v>

311
12:27.750 --> 12:30.720
I've gotta be honest, for me sports, right?

312
12:30.720 --> 12:33.930
I love sports of the holidays, going skiing myself,

313
12:33.930 --> 12:35.760
but really just enjoying a lot of the content

314
12:35.760 --> 12:36.870
that's on for me.

315
12:36.870 --> 12:40.770
I love the way that sports content has really changed.

316
12:40.770 --> 12:43.200
Live sports is where so much is happening, right?

317
12:43.200 --> 12:45.180
In terms of differentiating on every platform,

318
12:45.180 --> 12:46.983
how do I find it, what going on?

319
12:47.910 --> 12:49.800
And I love the variation that I'm seeing across

320
12:49.800 --> 12:52.200
the different platforms in terms of what I'm seeing, right?

321
12:52.200 --> 12:54.480
So how am I watching, how I find the highlights,

322
12:54.480 --> 12:55.890
what happened just two seconds ago

323
12:55.890 --> 12:57.960
and how are I refactoring that into a process

324
12:57.960 --> 13:00.002
where I can see that, understand it.

325
13:00.002 --> 13:02.010
Also just make sure that I'm not seeing something

326
13:02.010 --> 13:05.070
I don't wanna see or if I haven't watched the game.

327
13:05.070 --> 13:06.481
So for me,

328
13:06.481 --> 13:08.880
and also it is great to see Netflix fix their stuff

329
13:08.880 --> 13:11.730
from what happened during the boxing event

330
13:11.730 --> 13:14.070
to the NFL on on Christmas Day

331
13:14.070 --> 13:16.320
and just how fast things are moving.

332
13:16.320 --> 13:18.480
I just love to watch that because it's really the only time

333
13:18.480 --> 13:19.313
I get to sit down

334
13:19.313 --> 13:20.940
and just sit there for two weeks going, okay,

335
13:20.940 --> 13:22.350
what's really happening in the world

336
13:22.350 --> 13:24.300
rather than just traveling around talking about it.

337
13:24.300 --> 13:26.220
<v ->Yeah, no I love it. I love it.</v>

338
13:26.220 --> 13:28.290
<v ->I think nothing annoyed me by the way,</v>

339
13:28.290 --> 13:31.706
other than the fact that my team didn't always win.

340
13:31.706 --> 13:32.820
That's what I'm gonna say.

341
13:32.820 --> 13:33.653
<v ->Yeah, no, for sure.</v>

342
13:33.653 --> 13:35.850
And I think one of the things I love is that innovation

343
13:35.850 --> 13:40.850
and anyone here live in Dallas or Los Angeles? Okay, good.

344
13:41.160 --> 13:44.490
Any of you guys been to the Cosm? Yeah. Very cool. Yeah.

345
13:44.490 --> 13:46.579
Okay, go see this guy. What's your name?

346
13:46.579 --> 13:47.412
<v Rick>Rick.</v>

347
13:47.412 --> 13:49.020
<v ->Rick, okay. You should go talk to Rick afterwards.</v>

348
13:49.020 --> 13:51.030
It's pretty awesome, right? Yeah.

349
13:51.030 --> 13:53.067
And if you haven't seen it, you go look it up.

350
13:53.067 --> 13:56.220
You cosm, you should check it up on your phones right now.

351
13:56.220 --> 13:58.260
I love the innovation that we're seeing in our industry

352
13:58.260 --> 13:59.910
right now on live experiences

353
13:59.910 --> 14:01.470
and digital and live coming together

354
14:01.470 --> 14:02.370
and we're gonna see the AI,

355
14:02.370 --> 14:03.510
digital and live coming together.

356
14:03.510 --> 14:05.760
It's gonna be really fantastic.

357
14:05.760 --> 14:07.050
So really encourage you to go do that.

358
14:07.050 --> 14:07.883
Anyway, that was something I did over the break,

359
14:07.883 --> 14:09.570
I thought was great.

360
14:09.570 --> 14:12.000
Alright so, Soyoung, you started talking a little bit

361
14:12.000 --> 14:13.170
about search a little bit more.

362
14:13.170 --> 14:16.200
So when it comes to these like the consumer experiences

363
14:16.200 --> 14:17.670
like we were talking about working backwards

364
14:17.670 --> 14:19.470
and like the cus the customer on that,

365
14:19.470 --> 14:22.920
what are the consumer experiences that are ripe for AI

366
14:22.920 --> 14:24.690
that are gonna help the consumer experiences?

367
14:24.690 --> 14:26.610
These are real consumer experiences that we're looking

368
14:26.610 --> 14:29.370
to help with where there's an unmet customer need

369
14:29.370 --> 14:30.203
that we're trying to solve.

370
14:30.203 --> 14:32.310
So Soyoung, what do you think?

371
14:32.310 --> 14:35.250
<v ->So I think increasingly because, and it's ironic</v>

372
14:35.250 --> 14:38.700
because there's so much more content than ever before,

373
14:38.700 --> 14:41.580
which also ironically makes it more difficult

374
14:41.580 --> 14:45.330
for content to speak to me as a consumer

375
14:45.330 --> 14:47.040
specifically and personally.

376
14:47.040 --> 14:50.100
And so even if there it's content that has existed

377
14:50.100 --> 14:52.980
for a while and I have consumed it before

378
14:52.980 --> 14:56.580
or it's new content, you can actually package it

379
14:56.580 --> 14:59.760
and show it to me in a way that really speaks

380
14:59.760 --> 15:02.640
to me personally that makes me want to either subscribe

381
15:02.640 --> 15:05.160
to something or makes me keep on watching it.

382
15:05.160 --> 15:08.550
And I feel like the personalization aspect

383
15:08.550 --> 15:10.650
of storytelling is absolutely something

384
15:10.650 --> 15:15.180
that is doable today through the technology

385
15:15.180 --> 15:19.650
that we have to be able to go through a library of content

386
15:19.650 --> 15:21.480
and to be able to stitch together

387
15:21.480 --> 15:25.320
or very easily clip to make a lot of different versions

388
15:25.320 --> 15:28.230
of stories that speak to each person very personally.

389
15:28.230 --> 15:31.110
So that's one thing personally I feel like

390
15:31.110 --> 15:33.210
that would impact me as a consumer personally.

391
15:33.210 --> 15:37.110
And from my Twelve Labs hat, I know as technology wise

392
15:37.110 --> 15:39.390
it is possible, very very possible.

393
15:39.390 --> 15:41.460
And then of course, search is the other thing

394
15:41.460 --> 15:42.630
that we were discussing earlier,

395
15:42.630 --> 15:47.400
which is why is it that video today, as ubiquitous as it is,

396
15:47.400 --> 15:49.620
is still very difficult to search across.

397
15:49.620 --> 15:52.290
And so if you're trying to find moments in videos,

398
15:52.290 --> 15:54.540
just like the example that Cody was sharing,

399
15:54.540 --> 15:56.190
you actually have to scroll through

400
15:56.190 --> 15:58.740
and watch every moment of it.

401
15:58.740 --> 16:00.900
Or we do have technologies so that allow

402
16:00.900 --> 16:02.160
you to like extract frames

403
16:02.160 --> 16:05.430
and like do simple computer vision to extract objects.

404
16:05.430 --> 16:07.020
But we know that that's not sufficient

405
16:07.020 --> 16:10.860
to extract meaningful human-like context that understands

406
16:10.860 --> 16:14.007
what I am looking for and understands the content

407
16:14.007 --> 16:16.950
and to be able to find exact moments.

408
16:16.950 --> 16:19.590
So basically those tools that allow us to do all

409
16:19.590 --> 16:22.200
of these things, I feel like would enrich my personal

410
16:22.200 --> 16:24.330
and consumer experiences.

411
16:24.330 --> 16:26.130
<v ->That seems like we got anybody else on the panel</v>

412
16:26.130 --> 16:27.720
that actually thinks that personalization

413
16:27.720 --> 16:29.460
or search would help the consumer experience

414
16:29.460 --> 16:31.060
and what that's gonna look like?

415
16:32.280 --> 16:34.830
<v ->Well, I actually have a fun example of this.</v>

416
16:34.830 --> 16:38.970
So with my Coactive hat on, we were super fortunate to work

417
16:38.970 --> 16:42.390
with NBC during the Olympics

418
16:42.390 --> 16:43.860
and it was actually quite a funny problem.

419
16:43.860 --> 16:45.900
So with the Olympics, they have to produce,

420
16:45.900 --> 16:49.200
you know, the show that you and I see week over week

421
16:49.200 --> 16:53.700
or day over day in case it's, oh my gosh,

422
16:53.700 --> 16:56.370
he's gonna steal my punchline with this, this is great.

423
16:56.370 --> 16:59.070
So what happened was they sent us primetime footage

424
16:59.070 --> 17:01.200
and they wanted to be able to find, you know, moments.

425
17:01.200 --> 17:04.590
So for example, Snoop Dogg like being patriotic

426
17:04.590 --> 17:06.630
rather than having to scroll through content,

427
17:06.630 --> 17:09.390
they could just type in Snoop Dogg being patriotic.

428
17:09.390 --> 17:11.760
Now another thing, when we think about consumers,

429
17:11.760 --> 17:15.390
they wanna create the most engaging content for all of you.

430
17:15.390 --> 17:17.490
And every single year it's different.

431
17:17.490 --> 17:18.960
You know, it might be a different sport

432
17:18.960 --> 17:20.850
or it might be a different athlete

433
17:20.850 --> 17:23.280
that really resonates with audiences.

434
17:23.280 --> 17:26.040
And when you are like the production company,

435
17:26.040 --> 17:28.620
when you're NBC trying to produce this, you know,

436
17:28.620 --> 17:32.190
you have information about what minute people are watching,

437
17:32.190 --> 17:34.080
but you don't know what they're watching.

438
17:34.080 --> 17:36.300
So with us, they can actually generate metadata

439
17:36.300 --> 17:39.240
about what sport and what athlete was on screen

440
17:39.240 --> 17:41.580
and be able to improve their content day over day.

441
17:41.580 --> 17:43.830
So for example, synchronized swimming was very,

442
17:43.830 --> 17:45.480
very popular this year.

443
17:45.480 --> 17:47.100
So they could actually give more airtime

444
17:47.100 --> 17:47.970
to synchronize swimming.

445
17:47.970 --> 17:49.710
<v ->And now we know why. 'cause I mean</v>

446
17:49.710 --> 17:51.480
who wouldn't wanna watch this?

447
17:51.480 --> 17:53.010
I mean, this is really fantastic.

448
17:53.010 --> 17:55.260
Look at this, look at you.
<v Cody>Yeah.</v>

449
17:55.260 --> 17:56.220
<v Eric>That's really amazing.</v>

450
17:56.220 --> 17:57.053
<v Cody>Exactly.</v>

451
17:57.053 --> 17:57.886
<v Eric>Well done, well done.</v>

452
17:57.886 --> 18:00.060
<v Cody>They cut me outta the finals though.</v>

453
18:00.060 --> 18:01.440
<v ->This really actually surprised me though,</v>

454
18:01.440 --> 18:03.270
but when it came to kind of understanding

455
18:03.270 --> 18:04.200
the analytics behind this,

456
18:04.200 --> 18:06.330
how many people in here like are surprised

457
18:06.330 --> 18:08.370
that synchronized swimming became really popular

458
18:08.370 --> 18:09.630
at the Olympics this year?

459
18:09.630 --> 18:11.190
Yeah, it's pretty, I was actually really surprised

460
18:11.190 --> 18:12.090
when we were doing the homework on that.

461
18:12.090 --> 18:14.940
So anyway, thank you for helping to understand this.

462
18:14.940 --> 18:17.460
Simon, what do you think?

463
18:17.460 --> 18:18.510
I better take this off

464
18:18.510 --> 18:21.090
or this is gonna confuse everybody. Here we go.

465
18:21.090 --> 18:23.280
<v ->Well, I think to be honest, right,</v>

466
18:23.280 --> 18:25.470
for personalization, as you said, right?

467
18:25.470 --> 18:26.640
I might go the oth other way

468
18:26.640 --> 18:29.490
and say over personalization is a bad thing.

469
18:29.490 --> 18:30.630
I miss a lot of stuff.

470
18:30.630 --> 18:33.120
I'm gonna go and say during the election for example,

471
18:33.120 --> 18:35.460
it became so personalized that I missed the stories

472
18:35.460 --> 18:37.170
that were really relevant to me, right?

473
18:37.170 --> 18:38.550
I missed a different narrative

474
18:38.550 --> 18:40.980
that I would've liked to have gotten.

475
18:40.980 --> 18:45.930
I think so while personalization I do think is critical,

476
18:45.930 --> 18:47.370
we wanna see what we like to see.

477
18:47.370 --> 18:49.570
We wanna be engaged by that type of content.

478
18:50.700 --> 18:52.680
I also wanna be challenged, I wanna be able

479
18:52.680 --> 18:55.890
to search a streaming platform in a very different way.

480
18:55.890 --> 18:59.107
For example, for sports, I sent it earlier, I wanted to say,

481
18:59.107 --> 19:01.620
"Give me the three pointers that mattered in this game.

482
19:01.620 --> 19:03.480
Stitch it together in a narrative that I care about.

483
19:03.480 --> 19:04.313
'cause I missed the whole game."

484
19:04.313 --> 19:06.450
I don't want your highlights, I want my highlights, right?

485
19:06.450 --> 19:09.180
And so that I think is important.

486
19:09.180 --> 19:11.370
But also, right, for streaming platforms

487
19:11.370 --> 19:13.620
or for other platforms, I want to understand

488
19:13.620 --> 19:15.600
how I can reach different types of people on that platform

489
19:15.600 --> 19:18.450
because my highlights are not the same as anybody else's

490
19:18.450 --> 19:20.040
because I may not know, for example,

491
19:20.040 --> 19:22.440
if I'm watching basketball, what a pick and roll might be

492
19:22.440 --> 19:24.660
and why it's an important move in a game, right?

493
19:24.660 --> 19:27.450
Tell me why it's important, a highlight of what

494
19:27.450 --> 19:29.640
that might look like and then that makes me more engaged

495
19:29.640 --> 19:30.780
in that platform, for example.

496
19:30.780 --> 19:32.520
So personalization can be take many

497
19:32.520 --> 19:33.750
different forms from my perspective.

498
19:33.750 --> 19:35.910
<v ->I love those double down examples.</v>

499
19:35.910 --> 19:38.730
So Microsoft, you guys are thinking about that a lot.

500
19:38.730 --> 19:40.530
Maybe give you some examples of some things

501
19:40.530 --> 19:42.810
where you've been focused a little bit on personalization

502
19:42.810 --> 19:44.670
because we're looking into the future,

503
19:44.670 --> 19:45.960
but some of the future's starting

504
19:45.960 --> 19:47.640
to happen now in the back room, right?

505
19:47.640 --> 19:49.680
<v ->So we do a lot already.</v>

506
19:49.680 --> 19:51.270
I think one thing that I shared with you right,

507
19:51.270 --> 19:54.000
is the AI yeah, it's been a big deal over the past two

508
19:54.000 --> 19:56.010
years, but it's been around for a very long time, right?

509
19:56.010 --> 19:57.630
We've used it for advertising

510
19:57.630 --> 20:00.540
and personalization for the last decade almost

511
20:00.540 --> 20:02.640
to some degree and some have invested more than others

512
20:02.640 --> 20:05.640
on the Microsoft side, yes, we spend time with the NBA,

513
20:05.640 --> 20:08.400
the NFL, you know, the soccer leagues

514
20:08.400 --> 20:10.650
around the world talking about how to leverage it, right?

515
20:10.650 --> 20:12.570
From data to different plays,

516
20:12.570 --> 20:15.000
to how do we make the right content, how do you find

517
20:15.000 --> 20:16.530
and search the right content?

518
20:16.530 --> 20:18.780
But it all comes back to data, right? For example.

519
20:18.780 --> 20:21.600
So what we've found is that to create those experiences

520
20:21.600 --> 20:22.650
or things that those leagues

521
20:22.650 --> 20:26.610
or organizations want to do, huge amounts of data analysis,

522
20:26.610 --> 20:29.610
data stability, you know, foundational models

523
20:29.610 --> 20:31.623
and what does that look like?

524
20:32.490 --> 20:35.010
We've done everything from thinking about augmented reality

525
20:35.010 --> 20:37.230
experiences to the different ways content needs

526
20:37.230 --> 20:39.243
to be displayed on different devices.

527
20:40.590 --> 20:42.465
I think you mentioned it really well,

528
20:42.465 --> 20:45.350
a lot of the content that has been in some cases

529
20:45.350 --> 20:48.780
never even digitized has now been reindexed.

530
20:48.780 --> 20:50.700
And there's different ways to think about that frame

531
20:50.700 --> 20:52.080
by frame or what's in a frame

532
20:52.080 --> 20:54.780
or how to find certain things that all has been required

533
20:54.780 --> 20:56.440
to be redone to some degree

534
20:57.930 --> 20:59.430
and that results in a heck of a lot

535
20:59.430 --> 21:00.960
of compute required to do it right?

536
21:00.960 --> 21:04.560
And so I think all of these groups, all of these teams,

537
21:04.560 --> 21:07.170
organizations we work with, they want to go much faster,

538
21:07.170 --> 21:08.730
but there's work to be done to get there.

539
21:08.730 --> 21:11.310
So I dunno if that's answering your question per se.

540
21:11.310 --> 21:12.990
<v ->Yeah, yeah, no, I think that's a that's a great answer.</v>

541
21:12.990 --> 21:14.820
No, I like it. David?

542
21:14.820 --> 21:16.350
<v ->Yeah, Eric? No, I was gonna say, you asked a question,</v>

543
21:16.350 --> 21:17.880
you said, "What's that gonna look like?"

544
21:17.880 --> 21:19.890
And I think, you know, we're starting to see hints

545
21:19.890 --> 21:22.710
of what it might look like even at this year's CES.

546
21:22.710 --> 21:24.390
And I agree with you guys, like I think the index

547
21:24.390 --> 21:25.950
and the personalization is super important,

548
21:25.950 --> 21:27.120
but you made a comment around sort

549
21:27.120 --> 21:28.770
of generating your own content

550
21:28.770 --> 21:30.900
and you're generating content that you want to see.

551
21:30.900 --> 21:31.980
You know, if we look at what Jensen

552
21:31.980 --> 21:34.230
and Nvidia presented a couple days ago,

553
21:34.230 --> 21:36.720
they announced their new consumer graphics card.

554
21:36.720 --> 21:38.880
And what's interesting, if you really look at the technology

555
21:38.880 --> 21:40.800
behind that, they're moving from a system

556
21:40.800 --> 21:43.170
where they had this GP, which runs all the graphics

557
21:43.170 --> 21:44.610
and even in these graphics cards,

558
21:44.610 --> 21:46.500
they're moving over to having more AI engine

559
21:46.500 --> 21:48.300
in the graphics card to put it simply.

560
21:48.300 --> 21:51.240
And what that means is the expectation is that the games

561
21:51.240 --> 21:52.920
that you play, maybe starting with the games

562
21:52.920 --> 21:54.750
and then to more traditional media,

563
21:54.750 --> 21:57.330
won't be deterministic in terms

564
21:57.330 --> 21:59.070
of how here's the program, go run the game.

565
21:59.070 --> 22:01.260
It'll actually be using that AI hardware on the card

566
22:01.260 --> 22:03.150
to generate the game on the fly.

567
22:03.150 --> 22:04.650
And that could be, I think, a leading indicator

568
22:04.650 --> 22:06.840
into what we'll see in the media space.

569
22:06.840 --> 22:09.930
<v ->I brought this back up on screen here real quick a second.</v>

570
22:09.930 --> 22:12.750
You skipped this, this is a super interesting point.

571
22:12.750 --> 22:14.730
I'd like everyone to kind of like you think about

572
22:14.730 --> 22:16.620
for a quick second you know, this is kind

573
22:16.620 --> 22:18.090
of the way kind of things work, right?

574
22:18.090 --> 22:19.560
You know, we have creator distribution

575
22:19.560 --> 22:22.740
and have some creators go direct to exhibition,

576
22:22.740 --> 22:24.510
but what you're actually talking about is actually

577
22:24.510 --> 22:27.510
the compression of creators into exhibition.

578
22:27.510 --> 22:29.640
And that is a super interesting thing

579
22:29.640 --> 22:30.810
that I think we're starting to see.

580
22:30.810 --> 22:31.643
So I think that's a great point.

581
22:31.643 --> 22:32.820
<v David>I love that point too.</v>

582
22:32.820 --> 22:33.810
I think it's super critical.

583
22:33.810 --> 22:36.030
And bring that technology closer to the device,

584
22:36.030 --> 22:37.440
right? Understood.

585
22:37.440 --> 22:41.730
<v ->Yeah. So great, great call out. Okay, next topic.</v>

586
22:41.730 --> 22:45.540
We're gonna talk a little bit about supply chains, right?

587
22:45.540 --> 22:48.000
So if we went back to our magical picture here,

588
22:48.000 --> 22:50.130
this is where we're trying to get, there's a lot

589
22:50.130 --> 22:52.860
of work getting from the point we create something,

590
22:52.860 --> 22:55.290
getting it to distribution, getting it out to everyone,

591
22:55.290 --> 22:56.460
getting out to different exhibition.

592
22:56.460 --> 22:58.170
It's just think of like if you were

593
22:58.170 --> 22:59.460
in the movie business, right?

594
22:59.460 --> 23:01.200
You have to worry about getting into a theater

595
23:01.200 --> 23:03.330
is completely different than getting it out to broadcast,

596
23:03.330 --> 23:04.470
which is different than getting it out

597
23:04.470 --> 23:05.880
to a streaming platform.

598
23:05.880 --> 23:07.440
And there's different kinds of streaming platforms

599
23:07.440 --> 23:09.900
and clips out to for promos and a bunch of other things.

600
23:09.900 --> 23:11.730
There's a lot that happens in here.

601
23:11.730 --> 23:13.770
Cody, tell us a little bit about kind

602
23:13.770 --> 23:16.170
of what are some of the things that you're seeing here

603
23:16.170 --> 23:18.393
that are kind of ripe for AI?

604
23:19.350 --> 23:20.350
<v ->Yeah, thanks Eric.</v>

605
23:21.360 --> 23:22.500
You know, as you kind of allude to,

606
23:22.500 --> 23:26.100
it's a really long complicated process to go from a piece

607
23:26.100 --> 23:28.440
of content being created to actually something

608
23:28.440 --> 23:30.090
that you and I are viewing.

609
23:30.090 --> 23:32.580
You have to go through the production process,

610
23:32.580 --> 23:37.580
the licensing process, you know, marketing, distribution

611
23:37.800 --> 23:40.350
and advertising for that piece of content

612
23:40.350 --> 23:41.940
to actually get to you.

613
23:41.940 --> 23:46.290
And, you know, rather than go into like excruciating detail,

614
23:46.290 --> 23:48.120
I actually wanna talk about an example.

615
23:48.120 --> 23:51.210
So consider Thomson Reuters.

616
23:51.210 --> 23:55.950
Thomson Reuters is a major news signal to the entire world.

617
23:55.950 --> 23:59.160
They have reporters all around the world capturing

618
23:59.160 --> 24:02.370
the latest news story, breaking news 24/7.

619
24:02.370 --> 24:04.740
And then they take that content that's being captured

620
24:04.740 --> 24:07.830
by those reporters and they sell it to news networks all

621
24:07.830 --> 24:11.850
around the world, both globally and local content.

622
24:11.850 --> 24:14.453
Now they have a platform called Reuters Connect.

623
24:14.453 --> 24:16.440
This is the interface for journalists

624
24:16.440 --> 24:19.530
and for editors to find the content that they need.

625
24:19.530 --> 24:21.330
And now in order to tell stories,

626
24:21.330 --> 24:24.300
in order to tell you about the breaking news

627
24:24.300 --> 24:28.350
and if you go into to Reuters Connect,

628
24:28.350 --> 24:31.200
the old way that you did it was based off of keywords,

629
24:31.200 --> 24:34.950
which was an incredibly manual process where the creator had

630
24:34.950 --> 24:37.110
to go and actually enter in the keyword

631
24:37.110 --> 24:39.390
for every single piece of content.

632
24:39.390 --> 24:42.000
But what just happened there is you click the button

633
24:42.000 --> 24:45.510
for AI search and you can see the difference.

634
24:45.510 --> 24:48.750
We went from one piece of content that was loosely relevant

635
24:48.750 --> 24:53.750
to this search of Boeing Union deal negotiations.

636
24:54.240 --> 24:57.450
We went from one piece of content to now pages

637
24:57.450 --> 25:00.390
and pages of content that is super relevant

638
25:00.390 --> 25:01.860
for the topic at hand.

639
25:01.860 --> 25:05.070
And this AI search is powered by Coactive.

640
25:05.070 --> 25:06.480
So we can actually enable this night

641
25:06.480 --> 25:08.670
and day difference where you can find the pieces of content

642
25:08.670 --> 25:10.950
that you're looking for with no tags,

643
25:10.950 --> 25:13.827
no metadata whatsoever. Now with that example.

644
25:13.827 --> 25:15.330
<v ->And we should pause on that for a second,</v>

645
25:15.330 --> 25:16.740
Simon, you and I have been in this industry

646
25:16.740 --> 25:18.420
for a really long time.

647
25:18.420 --> 25:21.930
The no tags whatsoever part, is that like a big deal?

648
25:21.930 --> 25:25.350
<v ->It's huge, I don't know any organization,</v>

649
25:25.350 --> 25:26.910
especially the Walt Disney Company where I used to work

650
25:26.910 --> 25:28.740
for would just kill for something like that, right?

651
25:28.740 --> 25:29.990
Because finding content was one

652
25:29.990 --> 25:31.380
of the hardest things we need to do.

653
25:31.380 --> 25:34.440
Even if we found it, could we even open it? Right.

654
25:34.440 --> 25:35.640
It's a fascinating problem.

655
25:35.640 --> 25:37.500
<v ->Yeah, for sure, and just put a context,</v>

656
25:37.500 --> 25:39.840
I did a project a really long time ago, about 15 years ago

657
25:39.840 --> 25:42.450
where we went, if people watch "Seinfeld",

658
25:42.450 --> 25:44.190
any "Seinfeld" fans out there?

659
25:44.190 --> 25:45.240
we wanted to go back

660
25:45.240 --> 25:47.520
and people wanted to go look at all "The Soup Nazi"

661
25:47.520 --> 25:48.450
scenes, right?

662
25:48.450 --> 25:51.720
And so we had to go manually tag for one show

663
25:51.720 --> 25:55.380
and it was a multi, multi month project

664
25:55.380 --> 25:56.970
to go manually tagged.

665
25:56.970 --> 25:59.280
And we actually used like Adobe Premier to go in

666
25:59.280 --> 26:01.037
and like do frame level metadata on it.

667
26:01.037 --> 26:03.360
And it took a really, really long time.

668
26:03.360 --> 26:05.550
How many people think that scales?

669
26:05.550 --> 26:07.890
We like, the output didn't scale.

670
26:07.890 --> 26:10.240
So yeah.

671
26:10.240 --> 26:11.280
<v ->Yeah, exactly.</v>

672
26:11.280 --> 26:12.690
And now you can do it in less than a second.

673
26:12.690 --> 26:16.590
And it's been amazing to partner with Reuters to really kind

674
26:16.590 --> 26:18.840
of push it forward in terms of supply chain.

675
26:18.840 --> 26:21.330
So now with Coactive you can find those clips that you need

676
26:21.330 --> 26:24.210
as a journalist or an editor in a matter of seconds.

677
26:24.210 --> 26:25.920
That means as a consumer,

678
26:25.920 --> 26:28.830
the story gets out to you faster than ever before.

679
26:28.830 --> 26:31.650
You can keep a pulse on what's happening around the world,

680
26:31.650 --> 26:35.130
be notified of breaking news faster than ever before.

681
26:35.130 --> 26:37.230
And not only are you getting it faster,

682
26:37.230 --> 26:38.550
but you're getting it better.

683
26:38.550 --> 26:42.480
You're getting more content that is more relevant,

684
26:42.480 --> 26:46.710
more visually appealing for the story at hand.

685
26:46.710 --> 26:49.710
And as well as we're also enabling creators, you know,

686
26:49.710 --> 26:51.930
the people that are creating this content to be able

687
26:51.930 --> 26:54.690
to surface their content more easily

688
26:54.690 --> 26:56.970
and actually create more incentives

689
26:56.970 --> 26:58.740
for creators to create this content.

690
26:58.740 --> 27:00.030
And now you don't have to worry about

691
27:00.030 --> 27:02.430
that SEO optimization game

692
27:02.430 --> 27:06.480
and instead the best content for consumers gets out there.

693
27:06.480 --> 27:08.910
<v ->Yeah, and I think it's a good example, Simon go ahead.</v>

694
27:08.910 --> 27:11.010
<v ->So I'm gonna talk a little bit about Hollywood, Eric,</v>

695
27:11.010 --> 27:13.770
because that's the world I know

696
27:13.770 --> 27:16.860
and from a distribution perspective,

697
27:16.860 --> 27:19.890
I have never seen an ability now to do things

698
27:19.890 --> 27:22.267
I've never done those processes of creating content,

699
27:22.267 --> 27:24.930
you know, whether it be storing it, finding it.

700
27:24.930 --> 27:27.930
I worked a lot on versions of visual effects

701
27:27.930 --> 27:29.490
for example, like even finding versions

702
27:29.490 --> 27:32.250
of the Millennium Falcon that was done in 1977.

703
27:32.250 --> 27:34.650
Even if I could find it, I couldn't even open it, right?

704
27:34.650 --> 27:36.000
But those distribution processes

705
27:36.000 --> 27:37.620
that you talked about, Eric, right?

706
27:37.620 --> 27:39.960
You know, whether it's spitting stuff out

707
27:39.960 --> 27:40.997
for dailies for example,

708
27:40.997 --> 27:44.250
or I'm setting stuff out to a post house for example,

709
27:44.250 --> 27:47.340
or you know, even if I'm looking for actors

710
27:47.340 --> 27:48.600
or actresses to play certain roles

711
27:48.600 --> 27:50.610
or script analysis for example,

712
27:50.610 --> 27:52.470
all of these things are now changing

713
27:52.470 --> 27:54.900
and I wanna bring a a bit of nomenclature

714
27:54.900 --> 27:57.270
to the conversation, which is agentic AI.

715
27:57.270 --> 28:00.180
So those workflows, right, that we might have

716
28:00.180 --> 28:02.761
and do 10, 15 times a day, those are going

717
28:02.761 --> 28:04.620
to become automated through

718
28:04.620 --> 28:06.870
what we call agent-based workflows, right?

719
28:06.870 --> 28:11.190
So not just AI but a workflow that can be called

720
28:11.190 --> 28:13.860
through a maybe a smart bot, whatever else it might be

721
28:13.860 --> 28:14.970
or processes can kick off

722
28:14.970 --> 28:17.070
and it will move the content from A to B,

723
28:17.070 --> 28:19.410
do the color correction, do the, you know,

724
28:19.410 --> 28:20.730
whatever deep fake analysis,

725
28:20.730 --> 28:22.290
whatever else it might be that's on there.

726
28:22.290 --> 28:24.120
Those things are real.

727
28:24.120 --> 28:26.910
And we're talking about taking content time delivery down

728
28:26.910 --> 28:28.980
from like almost 90%, right?

729
28:28.980 --> 28:32.310
Because there is no question that studios have to go faster,

730
28:32.310 --> 28:34.680
need to keep the quality good as we've talked about,

731
28:34.680 --> 28:35.940
but they've got to go faster

732
28:35.940 --> 28:37.740
and those processes are going to be key, right?

733
28:37.740 --> 28:40.620
And we're seeing most studios now think about how to derive

734
28:40.620 --> 28:42.300
that kind of value from distribution.

735
28:42.300 --> 28:45.060
<v ->I like it. Do you think it improves quality?</v>

736
28:45.060 --> 28:48.330
<v ->I think in the hands of the right people? Yes it does.</v>

737
28:48.330 --> 28:49.860
I think there is obviously some people

738
28:49.860 --> 28:52.380
who care a lot about quality and some that don't.

739
28:52.380 --> 28:53.880
I think for consumers, right?

740
28:53.880 --> 28:55.290
Sometimes I care about quality

741
28:55.290 --> 28:57.330
and sometimes I don't, I just wanna see it.

742
28:57.330 --> 28:59.100
But then at a certain point I do care about quality,

743
28:59.100 --> 29:00.450
I think it's gonna be in the hands of whoever's

744
29:00.450 --> 29:01.860
gonna be creating that content.

745
29:01.860 --> 29:04.230
<v ->Yeah, I love it, but hopefully it's starting</v>

746
29:04.230 --> 29:05.220
to make sense a little bit.

747
29:05.220 --> 29:07.020
Whether it's like the Thomson Reuters example

748
29:07.020 --> 29:09.690
or in Hollywood there's so much content

749
29:09.690 --> 29:12.423
coming in that it has to get funneled into the people

750
29:12.423 --> 29:13.500
that are moving with it.

751
29:13.500 --> 29:14.750
If they could do a better job of that,

752
29:14.750 --> 29:17.310
an example I might use is if you were doing

753
29:17.310 --> 29:19.800
like an unscripted reality show,

754
29:19.800 --> 29:22.200
imagine all the footage that's being shot,

755
29:22.200 --> 29:24.060
you can only look at so much of it, right?

756
29:24.060 --> 29:26.220
So if there's better ways of doing something like this,

757
29:26.220 --> 29:27.540
you're actually gonna get a better show.

758
29:27.540 --> 29:30.150
<v ->I mean, even automated metadata, right?</v>

759
29:30.150 --> 29:30.983
For example, right?

760
29:30.983 --> 29:33.360
Because as soon as it comes in you gotta rely on someone

761
29:33.360 --> 29:35.370
else to potentially put it on a spreadsheet somewhere.

762
29:35.370 --> 29:38.160
Well no more, right? We can't have any more of those types

763
29:38.160 --> 29:40.230
of processes that just doesn't work.

764
29:40.230 --> 29:43.740
<v ->Yeah, no, for sure, Soyoung, you also have an example,</v>

765
29:43.740 --> 29:47.673
I think that's kind of right up this alley as well.

766
29:48.570 --> 29:51.390
<v ->So I think there are like, I agree with it,</v>

767
29:51.390 --> 29:53.280
obviously everything here.

768
29:53.280 --> 29:54.960
I think two things that I can share is,

769
29:54.960 --> 29:57.600
one is on the media supply chain.

770
29:57.600 --> 30:00.210
And this is something that one of our customers kind

771
30:00.210 --> 30:02.130
of like presented last year,

772
30:02.130 --> 30:05.670
which is it used to take them and there are sports,

773
30:05.670 --> 30:07.800
there are very large sports franchise

774
30:07.800 --> 30:10.530
that owns multiple teams across different leagues

775
30:10.530 --> 30:14.310
and sports categories for every single game

776
30:14.310 --> 30:17.820
after that game, you have to manually tag

777
30:17.820 --> 30:20.580
and log what's happening in every given moment

778
30:20.580 --> 30:21.413
within that game.

779
30:21.413 --> 30:24.180
And this is to be able to know when to clip

780
30:24.180 --> 30:25.500
and create highlights

781
30:25.500 --> 30:27.930
and also to may be able to make that piece

782
30:27.930 --> 30:31.710
of content accessible in the future for any licensing

783
30:31.710 --> 30:35.730
or fan content creation processes for fans.

784
30:35.730 --> 30:39.180
And in that you're not only taking one piece of video,

785
30:39.180 --> 30:42.060
you're actually taking so many different camera angles,

786
30:42.060 --> 30:44.430
the game press conferences, documentaries,

787
30:44.430 --> 30:47.790
imagine how many hours of footage you have

788
30:47.790 --> 30:50.880
and it takes about 30 hours to log one game

789
30:50.880 --> 30:52.890
or one piece of footage for one game.

790
30:52.890 --> 30:54.810
And with AI what you're able to do today

791
30:54.810 --> 30:56.250
and with Twelve Labs, what they were able

792
30:56.250 --> 30:58.560
to do is actually cut that down to eight minutes.

793
30:58.560 --> 31:01.709
And it does take AI time today out of the box to be able

794
31:01.709 --> 31:04.770
to understand it's almost create a human-like memory

795
31:04.770 --> 31:07.590
of everything contextual that's happening.

796
31:07.590 --> 31:09.120
But you're not just limited

797
31:09.120 --> 31:10.770
to a predefined taxonomy,

798
31:10.770 --> 31:12.690
today what you're able to do with AI

799
31:12.690 --> 31:14.520
is almost ha it's almost like

800
31:14.520 --> 31:16.290
you've already watched the content before.

801
31:16.290 --> 31:18.480
So you could describe things like maybe there's a heated

802
31:18.480 --> 31:20.070
moment during that game.

803
31:20.070 --> 31:21.990
Maybe there's a player engaging with a fan

804
31:21.990 --> 31:23.733
in a very unexpected way,

805
31:24.865 --> 31:28.260
maybe there's, you know, a very interesting shot happening.

806
31:28.260 --> 31:30.840
All of those things, if you describe it in human language,

807
31:30.840 --> 31:33.540
you'd be able to find exactly that moment.

808
31:33.540 --> 31:35.640
So you're cutting down that time for retrieval

809
31:35.640 --> 31:37.680
and hence the time to reach fans

810
31:37.680 --> 31:39.540
and hence you're able to create highlights

811
31:39.540 --> 31:43.470
and content at scale that speaks to particular audiences.

812
31:43.470 --> 31:44.490
<v Eric>And that's the context, right?</v>

813
31:44.490 --> 31:45.557
<v Soyoung>Exactly.</v>
<v ->That's so important</v>

814
31:45.557 --> 31:48.360
that you don't get in or you haven't had in the past.

815
31:48.360 --> 31:51.120
<v ->Yes, exactly, and then the second part</v>

816
31:51.120 --> 31:54.570
is what you said was just agentic AI is incredibly exciting

817
31:54.570 --> 31:58.380
because these are some examples of Twelve Labs

818
31:58.380 --> 32:00.960
where you're actually just using language to be able

819
32:00.960 --> 32:03.150
to search and generate summaries

820
32:03.150 --> 32:05.430
and descriptions of what's happening in content.

821
32:05.430 --> 32:07.830
But agentic AI actually allows you to solve

822
32:07.830 --> 32:11.550
for much more complex tasks now leveraging maybe one model,

823
32:11.550 --> 32:12.810
maybe multiple models

824
32:12.810 --> 32:16.260
and you can say, "Hey, create 10 highlight reels

825
32:16.260 --> 32:20.040
of something specific, this mood happening across all

826
32:20.040 --> 32:21.960
these series or across this game."

827
32:21.960 --> 32:23.520
And it would be able to perform that task

828
32:23.520 --> 32:27.270
and provide the creatives with drafts.

829
32:27.270 --> 32:29.250
And that's a much more complex task

830
32:29.250 --> 32:31.890
and agentic AI that combines a lot

831
32:31.890 --> 32:33.330
of different model capabilities

832
32:33.330 --> 32:35.370
and also combines the knowledge of creatives

833
32:35.370 --> 32:37.110
would be able to solve for that.

834
32:37.110 --> 32:39.720
And it can be customized specifically

835
32:39.720 --> 32:40.830
to different organizations,

836
32:40.830 --> 32:43.320
to different units within organizations and workflows.

837
32:43.320 --> 32:44.910
So definitely super exciting.

838
32:44.910 --> 32:45.743
<v ->Can I add one thing?</v>

839
32:45.743 --> 32:47.280
So to point on what you said, right?

840
32:47.280 --> 32:49.650
It's not just, you know, 10 different versions, right?

841
32:49.650 --> 32:51.360
But it could be creating different versions

842
32:51.360 --> 32:52.350
for different formats.

843
32:52.350 --> 32:54.750
For example, having those EDLs already ready

844
32:54.750 --> 32:57.030
to go out the door, they're ready for TikTok,

845
32:57.030 --> 32:59.250
whatever else it might be, right? That's huge, right?

846
32:59.250 --> 33:01.110
And even if you wanna replace one click with another,

847
33:01.110 --> 33:03.990
just doing it super easy 'cause it didn't max your kind

848
33:03.990 --> 33:05.341
of fit the narrative that you had.

849
33:05.341 --> 33:06.507
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Yeah. That's great.</v>

850
33:06.507 --> 33:08.910
<v ->Now Eric, if I may, you know it, I just listening</v>

851
33:08.910 --> 33:10.380
to everyone talk and it makes perfect sense

852
33:10.380 --> 33:12.030
and I think there's a common thread going through it.

853
33:12.030 --> 33:13.620
You know, I'm coming at it from the hardware space

854
33:13.620 --> 33:16.290
and it's powering this technology, be it the models

855
33:16.290 --> 33:17.700
or be it, you know, what's actually happening.

856
33:17.700 --> 33:19.800
But you know, Simon I think brought it up

857
33:19.800 --> 33:22.860
and Soyoung mentioned the agentic, you know, workflows

858
33:22.860 --> 33:26.190
and what we've seen is, you know, when AI kind of started,

859
33:26.190 --> 33:28.170
a lot of the hardware was designed around the need

860
33:28.170 --> 33:30.627
for training and I dunno if you're familiar with it,

861
33:30.627 --> 33:32.093
you know, training and inference,

862
33:32.093 --> 33:32.926
but training is, let's say the creation of the model

863
33:32.926 --> 33:34.350
and inferences poking the model

864
33:34.350 --> 33:37.680
or getting the results out of it, just to oversimplify it.

865
33:37.680 --> 33:39.990
But you know, this hardware was developed with this idea

866
33:39.990 --> 33:41.520
that training was gonna be the workload

867
33:41.520 --> 33:42.360
that everyone was gonna use

868
33:42.360 --> 33:44.160
and that's what the hardware needed to be designed around.

869
33:44.160 --> 33:45.660
You saw all these graphs that said, you know,

870
33:45.660 --> 33:49.650
the market will be 90% training and 10% inference or 70-30.

871
33:49.650 --> 33:51.030
When you get to agentic workflows,

872
33:51.030 --> 33:53.370
what you're really doing is instead of just asking the model

873
33:53.370 --> 33:56.550
or the model is one thing, you're asking a series

874
33:56.550 --> 33:58.770
of repeated queries over and over again

875
33:58.770 --> 34:01.230
and the amount of inference compute you're using,

876
34:01.230 --> 34:04.890
the model explodes in terms of how much compute is needed.

877
34:04.890 --> 34:07.620
And that's why I think to power all of these experiences

878
34:07.620 --> 34:11.160
and to enable the sort of agentic workflow future,

879
34:11.160 --> 34:13.590
having hardware that's ultra expensive

880
34:13.590 --> 34:15.450
or takes a nuclear reactor

881
34:15.450 --> 34:18.120
to go power in a data center somewhere doesn't make sense.

882
34:18.120 --> 34:20.280
And when you start to talk about the personalization,

883
34:20.280 --> 34:21.810
you know, do you really want that in the cloud

884
34:21.810 --> 34:23.850
or do you want to have hardware that's affordable

885
34:23.850 --> 34:26.340
that can do all the inference that you need it to do,

886
34:26.340 --> 34:28.170
that can do some training where needed,

887
34:28.170 --> 34:31.050
but also be on premise in your house or in your studio

888
34:31.050 --> 34:33.210
or in your production labs.

889
34:33.210 --> 34:35.010
And I think that's gonna be more and more important.

890
34:35.010 --> 34:37.620
So, I look forward to when I hear all these examples

891
34:37.620 --> 34:39.520
of what, you know, this team here

892
34:39.520 --> 34:40.770
is doing with AI that, you know, being able

893
34:40.770 --> 34:43.260
to provide a hardware that can go, you know,

894
34:43.260 --> 34:44.280
do the workloads of the future,

895
34:44.280 --> 34:45.900
I think is gonna be crucial moving forward,

896
34:45.900 --> 34:46.860
so super interesting.

897
34:46.860 --> 34:48.960
<v ->I love it. Alright, so we have five minutes left.</v>

898
34:48.960 --> 34:50.430
I know that we could keep talking for a while,

899
34:50.430 --> 34:52.770
but Simon, we have to hit what creators are doing

900
34:52.770 --> 34:54.150
and I know you've been spending a lot of time

901
34:54.150 --> 34:56.100
on that, not only in your Disney time,

902
34:56.100 --> 35:00.840
but right now where do we have use cases that are ripe

903
35:00.840 --> 35:03.810
for AI in the creator space?

904
35:03.810 --> 35:05.910
Not that it's not a touchy subject.

905
35:05.910 --> 35:08.820
<v ->So all power to the creator.</v>
<v ->All power to the creator.</v>

906
35:08.820 --> 35:11.400
We all say that "All power to the creator".

907
35:11.400 --> 35:13.060
Are we gonna have creators here?

908
35:13.060 --> 35:14.700
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

909
35:14.700 --> 35:16.110
And I believe that with all my heart

910
35:16.110 --> 35:17.370
and soul and I also believe in AI.

911
35:17.370 --> 35:18.203
So let's talk a little bit about this.

912
35:18.203 --> 35:21.180
<v ->Okay, it is a touchy subject for many, right?</v>

913
35:21.180 --> 35:22.710
Because I think there's a protective nature

914
35:22.710 --> 35:23.910
around being a creator,

915
35:23.910 --> 35:26.700
but I think it's really key to kinda share,

916
35:26.700 --> 35:29.550
Microsoft has a perspective that AI is not creative, right?

917
35:29.550 --> 35:32.248
You are to some degree, but you have amazing.

918
35:32.248 --> 35:33.090
<v ->You are all creative, aren't you?</v>

919
35:33.090 --> 35:34.710
You feel you're creative out there? Yeah, I think so.

920
35:34.710 --> 35:36.750
<v ->But you have amazing tools at your fingertips</v>

921
35:36.750 --> 35:38.880
and things couldn't do before, right?

922
35:38.880 --> 35:41.070
And platforms you couldn't post on before in ways

923
35:41.070 --> 35:42.903
that were just unimaginable, right?

924
35:43.740 --> 35:46.530
I was working on some stuff for our leadership recently

925
35:46.530 --> 35:48.150
and there's an amazing statistic,

926
35:48.150 --> 35:49.050
I shared it with you ahead of time.

927
35:49.050 --> 35:50.430
I'm gonna say it out here.

928
35:50.430 --> 35:54.270
You know, the creator economy is 14% of the entire

929
35:54.270 --> 35:56.550
M and E industry, $250 billion.

930
35:56.550 --> 35:59.250
But it is responsible for half of the growth

931
35:59.250 --> 36:01.320
of the entire industry, right?

932
36:01.320 --> 36:02.670
So creators are doing things

933
36:02.670 --> 36:05.010
with this technology in a way we don't truly

934
36:05.010 --> 36:06.090
realize right now, right?

935
36:06.090 --> 36:08.887
They are changing workflows in amazing ways

936
36:08.887 --> 36:11.610
and from a large studio perspective, right?

937
36:11.610 --> 36:14.730
They are grappling with how to leverage the technology

938
36:14.730 --> 36:17.610
in a workflows that have existed for 10, 20 years.

939
36:17.610 --> 36:18.840
'cause most people don't understand

940
36:18.840 --> 36:20.700
that workflows in the media space have existed

941
36:20.700 --> 36:23.700
for a very long time and they tend to have to, right?

942
36:23.700 --> 36:25.590
Because you need to rely on them day after day.

943
36:25.590 --> 36:26.880
But from a creative perspective,

944
36:26.880 --> 36:29.370
whether you're using one model or others, right?

945
36:29.370 --> 36:31.380
For animation or for short form content

946
36:31.380 --> 36:32.640
or long form content,

947
36:32.640 --> 36:35.580
we're seeing it everywhere from storyboarding to ideation,

948
36:35.580 --> 36:37.950
to saving money on sets, design,

949
36:37.950 --> 36:40.700
who's gonna be the best actor for this particular role?

950
36:41.970 --> 36:43.380
There's a lot of exploration in this area.

951
36:43.380 --> 36:46.290
So from a creative perspective, I could not be more excited

952
36:46.290 --> 36:48.360
because I think it's just the power at their fingertips

953
36:48.360 --> 36:49.980
to do things that have been in their minds

954
36:49.980 --> 36:51.450
for a very long time, right?

955
36:51.450 --> 36:54.000
And but the importance of the human element of storytelling

956
36:54.000 --> 36:55.920
is still the most fundamental thing to me.

957
36:55.920 --> 36:57.300
<v ->Yeah, no, I totally agree with it.</v>

958
36:57.300 --> 36:58.290
You gonna make a comment?

959
36:58.290 --> 37:00.750
<v ->Yeah, you know, I think that's so true, you know,</v>

960
37:00.750 --> 37:05.430
and I think that AI is going to democratize the creation

961
37:05.430 --> 37:08.430
of content in the way that the internet

962
37:08.430 --> 37:10.650
democratize the distribution of content.

963
37:10.650 --> 37:15.030
It's going to allow new people to tell stories,

964
37:15.030 --> 37:16.650
to actually tell stories like never before.

965
37:16.650 --> 37:18.990
For example, I'm dyslexic

966
37:18.990 --> 37:22.800
so I have always hated writing essays and dread it,

967
37:22.800 --> 37:24.750
but that doesn't mean that I haven't had good ideas

968
37:24.750 --> 37:27.270
or been able to like, have stories I want to tell,

969
37:27.270 --> 37:29.700
now I can be enabled because of AI to be able

970
37:29.700 --> 37:30.533
to tell these stories.

971
37:30.533 --> 37:32.280
And I've been using Grammarly,

972
37:32.280 --> 37:34.590
which was like an AI software to help with editing

973
37:34.590 --> 37:36.000
for years now.

974
37:36.000 --> 37:38.160
And then I also think about the fact that like,

975
37:38.160 --> 37:40.590
not only will new people be able to tell stories,

976
37:40.590 --> 37:42.660
but we'll also be able to reach people like we weren't able

977
37:42.660 --> 37:44.880
to before where now you can actually go

978
37:44.880 --> 37:48.150
and have translation to like other languages

979
37:48.150 --> 37:51.677
around the world and you can actually speak to someone

980
37:51.677 --> 37:54.240
that speaks a completely different language

981
37:54.240 --> 37:58.440
whether they are in Italy or China or India.

982
37:58.440 --> 38:00.720
And I think that that is so amazing when I think

983
38:00.720 --> 38:03.180
about the creative power of AI.

984
38:03.180 --> 38:07.050
And I really think that the human storytelling aspect,

985
38:07.050 --> 38:11.310
you know, the fact of how to create a great story

986
38:11.310 --> 38:12.630
that is uniquely human.

987
38:12.630 --> 38:15.630
And I believe that more strongly now than ever

988
38:15.630 --> 38:18.120
after going to a generative AI film festival

989
38:18.120 --> 38:21.000
and seeing that firsthand, that the best ones were the ones

990
38:21.000 --> 38:23.340
where you had someone that knew storytelling

991
38:23.340 --> 38:25.770
and then they used AI as a toolkit

992
38:25.770 --> 38:29.520
just as what happened when computer graphics came,

993
38:29.520 --> 38:30.870
people were afraid that, you know,

994
38:30.870 --> 38:34.170
set builders went on strike when computer graphics came out.

995
38:34.170 --> 38:35.970
But you know, it take over the world.

996
38:35.970 --> 38:40.110
We're not all watching CGI, it actually became a new toolkit

997
38:40.110 --> 38:41.820
for creators and for storytelling.

998
38:41.820 --> 38:43.830
And I think we're gonna see the same thing with GenAI.

999
38:43.830 --> 38:44.970
<v ->Yeah, I love it, how many people</v>

1000
38:44.970 --> 38:45.960
out there have created something?

1001
38:45.960 --> 38:48.189
And by the way, I'm a composer so I grew up doing that

1002
38:48.189 --> 38:49.830
and the example I always love

1003
38:49.830 --> 38:52.890
to give is if you went way back in time Js Bach,

1004
38:52.890 --> 38:54.360
there wasn't computers and all of that

1005
38:54.360 --> 38:57.360
and when they needed all the parts for all of the musicians

1006
38:57.360 --> 38:58.950
to play, guess what they had to do

1007
38:58.950 --> 39:00.810
and copy it out of the score.

1008
39:00.810 --> 39:04.140
Is that a good use of a creator's time? No.

1009
39:04.140 --> 39:07.110
So that's a creators have been creating tools

1010
39:07.110 --> 39:09.330
to help them create for the beginning

1011
39:09.330 --> 39:10.770
of the time we've had creation.

1012
39:10.770 --> 39:12.660
It's how we use them, who are using them.

1013
39:12.660 --> 39:15.240
I agree with you guys both a hundred percent.

1014
39:15.240 --> 39:17.160
Alright, so we're running a little short on time,

1015
39:17.160 --> 39:20.730
but David, I wanted to ask you a question capabilities wise

1016
39:20.730 --> 39:23.700
and Simon real quick power round on this,

1017
39:23.700 --> 39:26.130
the capabilities to support a lot of these things

1018
39:26.130 --> 39:28.920
we're talking about are advancing pretty quick.

1019
39:28.920 --> 39:29.880
Tell us a little bit about that.

1020
39:29.880 --> 39:32.160
<v ->Yeah, no, like I said, I think if you look at the amount</v>

1021
39:32.160 --> 39:33.750
of compute required, it's exploding

1022
39:33.750 --> 39:35.310
and I think there's been shift from this training

1023
39:35.310 --> 39:37.200
to inference and I think what we're seeing now

1024
39:37.200 --> 39:39.840
is that, you know, the video game example

1025
39:39.840 --> 39:41.280
I gave was a great one, right?

1026
39:41.280 --> 39:43.740
There's no question that the video games coming out,

1027
39:43.740 --> 39:46.230
maybe even this year, definitely next year are gonna

1028
39:46.230 --> 39:47.370
be developed on the fly.

1029
39:47.370 --> 39:49.380
You know, we were looking at CES, who was it?

1030
39:49.380 --> 39:51.000
It was either Nvidia or Razor,

1031
39:51.000 --> 39:52.290
one of the gaming companies, they came out

1032
39:52.290 --> 39:53.123
and they showed that, you know,

1033
39:53.123 --> 39:55.610
you could have a second player being powered by AI,

1034
39:55.610 --> 39:59.910
or play alongside you just like a real player.

1035
39:59.910 --> 40:00.743
Even in the media space,

1036
40:00.743 --> 40:02.400
we're working with a company called Riff,

1037
40:02.400 --> 40:03.540
which is super interesting

1038
40:03.540 --> 40:05.490
and they're able to do visualization, product placement.

1039
40:05.490 --> 40:07.350
So if you are an advertiser

1040
40:07.350 --> 40:09.300
and you have like a bottle of coke in a movie,

1041
40:09.300 --> 40:10.887
in a different market where they don't sell coke

1042
40:10.887 --> 40:13.530
and that could be changed out on the fly

1043
40:13.530 --> 40:14.820
to a different brand

1044
40:14.820 --> 40:16.680
or a different product or even a different item.

1045
40:16.680 --> 40:18.120
You know, these kind of things are all happening

1046
40:18.120 --> 40:19.350
and I think whether it's generative

1047
40:19.350 --> 40:21.600
or whether it's sort of support tools

1048
40:21.600 --> 40:24.360
or whatever, the technology is there,

1049
40:24.360 --> 40:27.060
the amount of compute required is growing

1050
40:27.060 --> 40:28.680
and I think it's gonna be interesting to see

1051
40:28.680 --> 40:31.920
that the capabilities driven by this hardware,

1052
40:31.920 --> 40:34.650
can you do it without having to use all the power

1053
40:34.650 --> 40:35.483
that's available.

1054
40:35.483 --> 40:37.680
Not, you know, run outta power, run outta compute,

1055
40:37.680 --> 40:39.330
but have have that sort of, like I said,

1056
40:39.330 --> 40:41.190
wherever you are on premise without having to go

1057
40:41.190 --> 40:42.870
to the cloud and having enough of it.

1058
40:42.870 --> 40:44.340
That's all happening now and that build out

1059
40:44.340 --> 40:45.897
is happening in time for these workflows

1060
40:45.897 --> 40:47.277
and these new things to happen, so yeah.

1061
40:47.277 --> 40:49.620
<v ->But the cloud is still cool Simon,</v>

1062
40:49.620 --> 40:51.150
so that's part of the capability set too.

1063
40:51.150 --> 40:52.590
And you guys at Microsoft are working

1064
40:52.590 --> 40:53.880
on tons of different capabilities.

1065
40:53.880 --> 40:55.560
Just give us maybe two really good ones.

1066
40:55.560 --> 40:58.160
<v ->Well, I mean we're buying on nuclear power plants.</v>

1067
40:59.190 --> 41:01.140
<v ->You could talk with Simon out in the hall</v>

1068
41:01.140 --> 41:02.610
about that particular topic.

1069
41:02.610 --> 41:04.260
<v ->But yeah, I mean the cloud is really important.</v>

1070
41:04.260 --> 41:06.480
Look, we need to bring the data closer to the cloud

1071
41:06.480 --> 41:08.130
for real time rendering and everything else.

1072
41:08.130 --> 41:09.420
It's super critical.

1073
41:09.420 --> 41:11.340
The on-prem components are gonna be huge.

1074
41:11.340 --> 41:13.470
You're gonna need to re-architect workflows time

1075
41:13.470 --> 41:14.760
and time again over a little bit

1076
41:14.760 --> 41:16.866
because yes, you might use something for AI today,

1077
41:16.866 --> 41:19.230
but you're gonna be able to do it differently in six months

1078
41:19.230 --> 41:21.000
from now and you're gonna save yourself a ton of compute

1079
41:21.000 --> 41:22.800
TPUs, GPUs and others.

1080
41:22.800 --> 41:25.200
And we see that, right, because the cost will go continually

1081
41:25.200 --> 41:27.780
down, but those workflows are gonna become more important.

1082
41:27.780 --> 41:30.510
So I just see a lot of capabilities needed in the cloud

1083
41:30.510 --> 41:32.580
and you're gonna need the tools when you need them, right?

1084
41:32.580 --> 41:36.090
And gonna rely on stuff in the cloud from a security based

1085
41:36.090 --> 41:38.520
perspective as well that are gonna become super critical.

1086
41:38.520 --> 41:42.480
So it's really important we've doubled down on all of that

1087
41:42.480 --> 41:43.800
and I think for our perspective,

1088
41:43.800 --> 41:46.140
the power piece is gonna be huge to understand.

1089
41:46.140 --> 41:46.973
<v ->I love it. All right.</v>

1090
41:46.973 --> 41:48.780
So we're gonna summarize a couple things.

1091
41:48.780 --> 41:50.160
We're gonna go through two power rounds

1092
41:50.160 --> 41:51.960
and then we're gonna wrap it up.

1093
41:51.960 --> 41:54.090
But so what have we heard so far?

1094
41:54.090 --> 41:58.740
We've got more personalization, better on search.

1095
41:58.740 --> 42:01.950
We're gonna be bringing the consumer closer from the creator

1096
42:01.950 --> 42:03.390
all the way straight to the consumer,

1097
42:03.390 --> 42:05.280
which I think is gonna be super interesting.

1098
42:05.280 --> 42:06.780
On the workflow side, we're gonna see

1099
42:06.780 --> 42:10.470
I think a renaissance of workflow reinvention,

1100
42:10.470 --> 42:13.260
which is a enormous, a part of what happens

1101
42:13.260 --> 42:17.370
behind the scenes to get any major films created.

1102
42:17.370 --> 42:20.040
Example I love to give is 10,000 visual effects shots

1103
42:20.040 --> 42:22.800
on the "Lord of the Rings" when I was at Amazon Studios.

1104
42:22.800 --> 42:25.770
That's a lot of content to get orchestrated.

1105
42:25.770 --> 42:28.050
We're gonna see that with the agentic AI.

1106
42:28.050 --> 42:29.100
We're gonna be able to find

1107
42:29.100 --> 42:31.890
and search through the troves of content for the people

1108
42:31.890 --> 42:32.820
that are putting it all together,

1109
42:32.820 --> 42:34.770
much better that's gonna be approved.

1110
42:34.770 --> 42:37.830
And then the tool sets are actually gonna improve taking

1111
42:37.830 --> 42:39.900
away things that actually don't add value

1112
42:39.900 --> 42:43.150
and it's gonna help others be able to kind of create

1113
42:44.190 --> 42:46.260
some content, whether it's in the writing space

1114
42:46.260 --> 42:47.670
or it's in the video space,

1115
42:47.670 --> 42:49.230
and allow that to commit catch up.

1116
42:49.230 --> 42:50.910
And Simon and I agree with you, hold a sec,

1117
42:50.910 --> 42:54.210
it doesn't change the fact that you still need novel ideas

1118
42:54.210 --> 42:56.670
coming from amazingly creative humans

1119
42:56.670 --> 42:58.080
and it's still gonna make us want to kind

1120
42:58.080 --> 42:59.400
of sharpen our skills in other areas.

1121
42:59.400 --> 43:01.590
You have catch up so far we're well good.

1122
43:01.590 --> 43:02.640
Alright, so let's do this

1123
43:02.640 --> 43:04.800
and I'm just gonna go straight down the row.

1124
43:04.800 --> 43:08.940
All right, so first question, 2030 CES,

1125
43:08.940 --> 43:10.890
what's the crazy thing we're gonna be talking about

1126
43:10.890 --> 43:12.440
with AI and entertainment then?

1127
43:15.780 --> 43:18.030
<v ->So I think the amazing thing that's happening right now</v>

1128
43:18.030 --> 43:20.100
in AI that's unique is that machines

1129
43:20.100 --> 43:23.430
can finally see the world like we do.

1130
43:23.430 --> 43:26.070
And I think technology's gonna be increasingly transparent.

1131
43:26.070 --> 43:28.260
We're gonna, and especially when you think about AR,VR ,

1132
43:28.260 --> 43:31.230
at the same time you're gonna be able to talk to machines,

1133
43:31.230 --> 43:34.740
talk to computers like you would like a human being

1134
43:34.740 --> 43:36.030
with glasses or whatever.

1135
43:36.030 --> 43:38.760
And I think we'll see a whole new set of devices that kind

1136
43:38.760 --> 43:41.490
of are an evolution from our phone that are transparent

1137
43:41.490 --> 43:43.740
and that's how we interact with a digital world

1138
43:43.740 --> 43:45.900
as the digital and physical worlds blur together.

1139
43:45.900 --> 43:47.640
<v ->I actually fully agree with you on that one.</v>

1140
43:47.640 --> 43:50.220
It's really cool. It's gonna be a really fun time, Simon.

1141
43:50.220 --> 43:52.260
<v ->I'm just gonna say artificial general intelligence</v>

1142
43:52.260 --> 43:53.490
is basically what you just said.

1143
43:53.490 --> 43:55.380
I think we're gonna engage much more differently,

1144
43:55.380 --> 43:57.870
Quantum computing, Moore's law, right?

1145
43:57.870 --> 44:00.090
We go faster, we're, we're gonna go much quicker.

1146
44:00.090 --> 44:02.100
This is a hype cycle of innovation.

1147
44:02.100 --> 44:06.060
I think we're gonna see the next couple years just explode

1148
44:06.060 --> 44:08.520
and I think it's gonna be a thrilling ride

1149
44:08.520 --> 44:09.353
where we're gonna try

1150
44:09.353 --> 44:10.770
and make sense of everything that's going on.

1151
44:10.770 --> 44:12.720
But I would say artificial general intelligence for me.

1152
44:12.720 --> 44:15.115
<v ->Okay, excellent, excellent. Alright, Soyoung.</v>

1153
44:15.115 --> 44:18.150
<v ->Two things, one, totally interactive</v>

1154
44:18.150 --> 44:20.370
and immersive content worlds.

1155
44:20.370 --> 44:23.740
I would love to live in The Shire or in Hogwarts

1156
44:23.740 --> 44:27.510
and to be actually to be able to interact

1157
44:27.510 --> 44:31.170
with these all the things in that story in real time.

1158
44:31.170 --> 44:34.260
And I think storytelling will become incredibly personalized

1159
44:34.260 --> 44:36.750
and you'll be able to create your own story as you go.

1160
44:36.750 --> 44:38.700
The second thing is that same capability

1161
44:38.700 --> 44:41.280
that we're talking about for storytelling is actually very

1162
44:41.280 --> 44:42.930
applicable across different industries,

1163
44:42.930 --> 44:45.180
whether it's healthcare or robotics or automotive.

1164
44:45.180 --> 44:47.580
And so if you have AI that can truly understand

1165
44:47.580 --> 44:48.840
and interact with the world,

1166
44:48.840 --> 44:51.611
it means we can power incredible things in healthcare,

1167
44:51.611 --> 44:55.230
patient monitoring and safety and so on.

1168
44:55.230 --> 44:58.460
So I feel like there's a very clear path to merge all

1169
44:58.460 --> 45:00.660
of these worlds together through AI.

1170
45:00.660 --> 45:01.800
<v ->Alright, David.</v>

1171
45:01.800 --> 45:03.720
<v ->Easy, 2030, maybe even earlier,</v>

1172
45:03.720 --> 45:06.960
Tenstorrent, next generation AI processor is gonna design

1173
45:06.960 --> 45:08.610
itself and manufacture itself.

1174
45:08.610 --> 45:11.130
<v ->All right, boom. There you go. All right, here we go.</v>

1175
45:11.130 --> 45:13.080
Last thing, we're gonna help everybody out here.

1176
45:13.080 --> 45:15.480
It's the beginning of the year, everybody's got goal setting

1177
45:15.480 --> 45:17.393
and we're gonna help you with your goal setting.

1178
45:18.300 --> 45:19.920
Cody, tell us like the audience,

1179
45:19.920 --> 45:21.450
one thing that they should put on their goals

1180
45:21.450 --> 45:24.543
here for 2025 to get ready for all of this.

1181
45:25.620 --> 45:27.630
<v ->Play around with AI. Have fun.</v>

1182
45:27.630 --> 45:29.520
<v ->Alright, play around with AI and have fun, Simon?</v>

1183
45:29.520 --> 45:30.990
<v ->Data</v>
<v ->Data.</v>

1184
45:30.990 --> 45:33.450
<v ->Figure out data really quickly.</v>

1185
45:33.450 --> 45:34.650
<v ->All right.</v>

1186
45:34.650 --> 45:36.143
<v ->I should use AI. Try it. Yeah.</v>

1187
45:37.239 --> 45:38.310
<v ->Try it. All right, more play?</v>

1188
45:38.310 --> 45:40.110
<v ->No, I gotta reinforce it, you gotta use the tools</v>

1189
45:40.110 --> 45:42.240
to know them and I'm shocked at how many people

1190
45:42.240 --> 45:43.470
aren't using all the tools available.

1191
45:43.470 --> 45:46.230
So go try something, whatever it is, and tell a friend.

1192
45:46.230 --> 45:47.670
<v ->I love it. So get the hell outta here.</v>

1193
45:47.670 --> 45:49.950
Stop listening to us, it's time to go use this stuff.

1194
45:49.950 --> 45:52.650
Have a great rest of your CES, thank you for listening.

1195
45:52.650 --> 45:54.540
And then our presenters are gonna be out here

1196
45:54.540 --> 45:55.620
in the hall if you wanna talk to them.

1197
45:55.620 --> 45:56.453
Thanks.

1198
45:56.453 --> 45:59.006
(upbeat music)
