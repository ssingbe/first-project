1
00:00.262 --> 00:02.929
(bright music)

2
00:11.446 --> 00:13.440
<v ->Good morning, everyone.</v>

3
00:13.440 --> 00:14.640
Alright, the clock's running.

4
00:14.640 --> 00:15.720
I see people,

5
00:15.720 --> 00:18.360
we'll give 'em like 30 seconds to get in here.

6
00:18.360 --> 00:20.280
I'll start my introduction.

7
00:20.280 --> 00:22.500
I'm Brian Markwalter, I'm with CTA,

8
00:22.500 --> 00:23.700
I'm a senior vice president.

9
00:23.700 --> 00:25.230
I oversee market research

10
00:25.230 --> 00:27.270
in our technology and standards group.

11
00:27.270 --> 00:29.857
It's an honor to be here moderating this panel,

12
00:29.857 --> 00:32.130
"Spatial Computing and State of the Union."

13
00:32.130 --> 00:33.540
We have some awesome guests.

14
00:33.540 --> 00:36.720
I'm gonna let them say a little bit about who they are.

15
00:36.720 --> 00:38.010
Everything's available.

16
00:38.010 --> 00:39.420
You've probably seen it in the app

17
00:39.420 --> 00:40.830
or on our website

18
00:40.830 --> 00:45.060
so you can find the background on our speakers.

19
00:45.060 --> 00:46.530
We're gonna do a little tour de force

20
00:46.530 --> 00:49.770
on spatial computing today.

21
00:49.770 --> 00:52.230
And again, welcome to CES.

22
00:52.230 --> 00:53.820
First thing, we just got underway.

23
00:53.820 --> 00:54.870
You've had two keynotes.

24
00:54.870 --> 00:56.400
I hope you're having a good time.

25
00:56.400 --> 00:58.140
There's a lot to do.

26
00:58.140 --> 01:01.230
So let me just get underway and we'll start.

27
01:01.230 --> 01:05.010
First question, we've had a lot of terms kicked around,

28
01:05.010 --> 01:06.300
so I want to, for the panel,

29
01:06.300 --> 01:08.820
if you guys could tell me your thoughts

30
01:08.820 --> 01:11.280
on what spatial computing,

31
01:11.280 --> 01:14.010
how's it different from XR and Metaverse?

32
01:14.010 --> 01:15.540
We've seen kind of a migration

33
01:15.540 --> 01:18.540
of terms over the last few years at CES.

34
01:18.540 --> 01:23.100
Would somebody like to jump in and frame this up for us?

35
01:23.100 --> 01:24.893
<v ->Sure,</v>
<v ->Go for it.</v>

36
01:24.893 --> 01:26.790
<v ->I mean, I think of spatial computing</v>

37
01:26.790 --> 01:29.160
as the overarching term that includes everything.

38
01:29.160 --> 01:34.160
So we can just now have 3D volumetric interactive content

39
01:34.500 --> 01:38.520
across all sorts of devices that interact with you

40
01:38.520 --> 01:39.870
and interact with the real world,

41
01:39.870 --> 01:43.233
whether that's on web, mobile, headsets,

42
01:44.610 --> 01:47.010
and that's basically it. (chuckles)

43
01:47.010 --> 01:49.680
<v ->Okay.</v>
<v ->Yeah, I agree, I agree.</v>

44
01:49.680 --> 01:52.410
Special computing is like the key term,

45
01:52.410 --> 01:55.710
but if you, for me to keep things straight in my head,

46
01:55.710 --> 01:58.440
I kind of look at it as concentric circles.

47
01:58.440 --> 02:03.210
So XR is kind of talking around the display devices

48
02:03.210 --> 02:06.570
that you wear can be augmented or virtual reality

49
02:06.570 --> 02:08.770
and the controllers to kind of the hardware.

50
02:09.850 --> 02:12.420
And then spatial computing is when those devices

51
02:12.420 --> 02:15.300
start understanding and scanning their environment,

52
02:15.300 --> 02:16.800
including you.

53
02:16.800 --> 02:20.490
And that lets you do spatial computing type applications

54
02:20.490 --> 02:22.110
and solutions.

55
02:22.110 --> 02:24.629
And the metaverse, I think is actually

56
02:24.629 --> 02:28.620
a even larger outer circle where it's open platform,

57
02:28.620 --> 02:31.080
maybe the evolution of the web

58
02:31.080 --> 02:33.780
where you let multiple spatial computing apps

59
02:33.780 --> 02:38.780
and users interact in an open standard, accessible way.

60
02:40.500 --> 02:41.670
<v ->Let me jump in here,</v>

61
02:41.670 --> 02:44.490
so when y'all speak, say who you are,

62
02:44.490 --> 02:45.540
so we'll get everybody.

63
02:45.540 --> 02:47.010
Neil, you wanna do

64
02:47.010 --> 02:48.090
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->quick intro?</v>

65
02:48.090 --> 02:49.230
<v ->Yes. Sorry, I dumped in.</v>

66
02:49.230 --> 02:51.990
So, Neil Trevett, my day job is at NVIDIA.

67
02:51.990 --> 02:53.970
I spend a lot of my time on open standards.

68
02:53.970 --> 02:55.560
I'm the president of the Khronos Group,

69
02:55.560 --> 02:57.150
which is a standards organization

70
02:57.150 --> 02:59.070
and the Metaverse Standards Forum.

71
02:59.070 --> 03:01.410
<v ->Yeah, Ashley?</v>
<v ->And I'm Ashley Crowder,</v>

72
03:01.410 --> 03:03.565
the co-founder and CEO of VNTANA,

73
03:03.565 --> 03:06.870
3D asset management platform used by manufacturers.

74
03:06.870 --> 03:08.820
I've been working in the spatial computing space

75
03:08.820 --> 03:10.290
for about 15 years.

76
03:10.290 --> 03:12.360
Work with Neil and Khronos Group

77
03:12.360 --> 03:15.330
and help manufacturers deploy 3D

78
03:15.330 --> 03:17.073
and XR across their business.

79
03:18.330 --> 03:22.680
<v ->Okay. Anybody else wanna jump in on the definitional?</v>

80
03:22.680 --> 03:23.550
<v ->Yeah, maybe I'll add in.</v>

81
03:23.550 --> 03:24.810
My name is Ziad Asghar, by the way,

82
03:24.810 --> 03:28.410
I lead the XR division at Qualcomm.

83
03:28.410 --> 03:30.630
So I'm general manager for AR and VR group.

84
03:30.630 --> 03:32.490
But I think maybe the additional part

85
03:32.490 --> 03:34.950
to what these people have already said is,

86
03:34.950 --> 03:36.945
it's also the technologies that allow you

87
03:36.945 --> 03:39.450
to be able to melt together the digital

88
03:39.450 --> 03:42.330
and basically the visual world,

89
03:42.330 --> 03:44.550
in such a way, that it's basically seamless.

90
03:44.550 --> 03:46.260
And those technologies that come together

91
03:46.260 --> 03:48.120
are basically computer vision.

92
03:48.120 --> 03:51.030
It's artificial intelligence increasingly as it's happening.

93
03:51.030 --> 03:52.650
And then perception technologies,

94
03:52.650 --> 03:53.910
all the ones that come together,

95
03:53.910 --> 03:56.280
whether it's eye tracking and hand tracking

96
03:56.280 --> 03:58.560
and 3D deconstruction and all those techniques,

97
03:58.560 --> 04:02.070
to be able to really melt those two worlds together.

98
04:02.070 --> 04:04.410
And just to add a little bit more nuance there,

99
04:04.410 --> 04:07.800
I mean XR is probably the core term, like Neil said,

100
04:07.800 --> 04:09.750
and then a superset of that is MR

101
04:09.750 --> 04:12.480
because now it does visual video see through

102
04:12.480 --> 04:13.320
and you're able to get the real world.

103
04:13.320 --> 04:15.900
And then above that you could say is metaverse.

104
04:15.900 --> 04:18.240
And above that, probably is where spatial computing

105
04:18.240 --> 04:19.470
is that which is the overarching term

106
04:19.470 --> 04:21.240
that covers everything.

107
04:21.240 --> 04:24.150
<v ->I mean, I will also say that people often use</v>

108
04:24.150 --> 04:25.890
many of these terms interchangeably,

109
04:25.890 --> 04:27.630
even if they're not exactly the same thing.

110
04:27.630 --> 04:30.330
But they may mean to the person who's speaking,

111
04:30.330 --> 04:32.100
they may be talking about the same thing.

112
04:32.100 --> 04:35.010
But certain, some terms have come in and out of fashion

113
04:35.010 --> 04:36.990
with investors and with the market.

114
04:36.990 --> 04:39.840
And so some people very feel very strongly

115
04:39.840 --> 04:43.740
that we use this term now and not that term despite

116
04:43.740 --> 04:46.590
they might be essentially be meaning the same thing.

117
04:46.590 --> 04:48.870
But as technology continues to improve,

118
04:48.870 --> 04:52.477
you can more and more can be encompassed in the,

119
04:54.090 --> 04:55.350
what we're talking about,

120
04:55.350 --> 04:57.450
even if that was also the intention

121
04:57.450 --> 04:59.397
in some of the earlier terms as well.

122
04:59.397 --> 05:01.440
And I'm Joanna Popper.

123
05:01.440 --> 05:03.750
I've held executive roles at HP

124
05:03.750 --> 05:07.110
and NBC Universal Singularity University.

125
05:07.110 --> 05:09.750
Most recently I was chief metaverse officer,

126
05:09.750 --> 05:12.720
not to use that term, at CAA,

127
05:12.720 --> 05:14.700
which is a Hollywood talent agency.

128
05:14.700 --> 05:16.050
And now I've been advising

129
05:16.050 --> 05:17.820
a number of companies in this space.

130
05:17.820 --> 05:19.380
I've also executive produced a lot

131
05:19.380 --> 05:22.710
of content in this space.

132
05:22.710 --> 05:23.543
<v ->Awesome.</v>

133
05:23.543 --> 05:28.410
So I mentioned part of my job is our standards team.

134
05:28.410 --> 05:30.330
So we did standards early in this space.

135
05:30.330 --> 05:31.830
So one of the things that happens

136
05:31.830 --> 05:35.940
when a new wave of technology comes out,

137
05:35.940 --> 05:38.550
the industry companies will run sort of

138
05:38.550 --> 05:39.930
with their version of it.

139
05:39.930 --> 05:43.590
We had it in the TV space, like with Ultra HD

140
05:43.590 --> 05:45.507
and there's 4K (indistinct).

141
05:45.507 --> 05:47.190
And so sometimes we'll jump in

142
05:47.190 --> 05:50.487
and we'll just so that we can communicate with the industry.

143
05:50.487 --> 05:54.570
And so we'll say like we did for 4K Ultra HD,

144
05:54.570 --> 05:57.750
here's what we mean when we say 4K Ultra HD.

145
05:57.750 --> 05:59.070
Like here's the bar.

146
05:59.070 --> 06:00.630
That one's a little more,

147
06:00.630 --> 06:02.370
this is such a big space here.

148
06:02.370 --> 06:05.010
I don't think we're ever gonna like completely tackle

149
06:05.010 --> 06:06.270
the nomenclature problem,

150
06:06.270 --> 06:10.260
but, so I think we'll see more changes,

151
06:10.260 --> 06:12.145
but it is good I think to get that

152
06:12.145 --> 06:17.145
that's sort of spatial computing umbrella over all this,

153
06:17.160 --> 06:19.760
you know, which gives us a lot of room to work here.

154
06:21.108 --> 06:26.108
Okay, CES is fundamentally a business to business event.

155
06:27.009 --> 06:28.290
It's a trade show.

156
06:28.290 --> 06:31.200
So I wanna dive into use cases

157
06:31.200 --> 06:34.650
'cause these things ultimately have to make money,

158
06:34.650 --> 06:35.850
to be a little blunt about it,

159
06:35.850 --> 06:37.260
but you know, they have to work

160
06:37.260 --> 06:39.063
and do useful things for people.

161
06:39.990 --> 06:44.040
Can some of you speak to our key use cases today?

162
06:44.040 --> 06:46.380
I don't know that what we thought we'd be doing,

163
06:46.380 --> 06:48.930
you know, three years ago is necessarily what's turning out

164
06:48.930 --> 06:52.770
to be the most effective uses in spatial computing.

165
06:52.770 --> 06:55.653
So can somebody talk to what they're seeing as use cases?

166
06:57.210 --> 06:59.820
<v ->I guess I'll start again. (chuckles)</v>

167
06:59.820 --> 07:02.700
I mean we work with lots of manufacturing clients

168
07:02.700 --> 07:04.410
who are finding huge benefits

169
07:04.410 --> 07:06.300
in using spatial computing technology.

170
07:06.300 --> 07:09.093
So you know, Aztec Industries is one of our clients.

171
07:10.058 --> 07:11.760
They manufacture massive heavy equipment

172
07:11.760 --> 07:13.320
for manufacturing plants

173
07:13.320 --> 07:16.710
and they design in AutoCAD, which is 3D software,

174
07:16.710 --> 07:20.610
they upload that to VNTANA to instantly share on web

175
07:20.610 --> 07:24.180
and XR to train employees

176
07:24.180 --> 07:27.360
and use for sales to explain to a new customer

177
07:27.360 --> 07:30.390
exactly how this machine will fit in their plant.

178
07:30.390 --> 07:34.110
They then run simulation models in NVIDIA Omniverse

179
07:34.110 --> 07:36.660
and Unreal Engine to do predictive maintenance.

180
07:36.660 --> 07:40.050
So that's huge because if you run a factory

181
07:40.050 --> 07:41.460
and you're down for an hour,

182
07:41.460 --> 07:43.830
that can be hundreds of thousands of dollars.

183
07:43.830 --> 07:46.140
So not only are they helping their clients,

184
07:46.140 --> 07:48.390
but they're selling new parts sooner

185
07:48.390 --> 07:51.330
and they've actually developed a whole new revenue stream

186
07:51.330 --> 07:53.490
for real time maintenance.

187
07:53.490 --> 07:55.530
And I am so excited, you know,

188
07:55.530 --> 07:58.500
they've been experimenting a lot with Oculus.

189
07:58.500 --> 08:02.820
Their whole sales team and training team now uses them

190
08:02.820 --> 08:04.020
and brings them to sites

191
08:04.020 --> 08:06.120
and they're looking at, okay, what is the next step

192
08:06.120 --> 08:09.090
and how do we do remote maintenance support

193
08:09.090 --> 08:10.290
with XR headsets?

194
08:10.290 --> 08:13.350
And so they're seeing huge value in driving efficiency

195
08:13.350 --> 08:14.820
in manufacturing.

196
08:14.820 --> 08:17.490
And then I'm sure all of you have been shopping on Amazon

197
08:17.490 --> 08:20.280
and seeing you in your space.

198
08:20.280 --> 08:22.050
You know, clients, like Kohler,

199
08:22.050 --> 08:24.150
design in AutoCAD for manufacturing

200
08:24.150 --> 08:25.530
and then are now leveraging

201
08:25.530 --> 08:29.670
that same 3D asset across their entire sales channel

202
08:29.670 --> 08:33.780
on e-comm for view in your space publishing to Amazon,

203
08:33.780 --> 08:35.700
starting to publish in Google.

204
08:35.700 --> 08:38.880
So 3D is in search for Google and North America

205
08:38.880 --> 08:41.430
and they're expanding to more countries this year.

206
08:41.430 --> 08:45.690
So you know, we're seeing it across various consumer

207
08:45.690 --> 08:47.763
and B2B businesses.

208
08:50.220 --> 08:51.053
<v ->I can go next.</v>

209
08:51.053 --> 08:54.300
I think there's quite a lot of very interesting use cases

210
08:54.300 --> 08:55.740
that have already come through

211
08:55.740 --> 08:56.760
and there are others that are coming.

212
08:56.760 --> 08:59.730
So we work with a very interesting partner on education,

213
08:59.730 --> 09:00.720
for example.

214
09:00.720 --> 09:03.660
You can actually talk about a particular type of rock

215
09:03.660 --> 09:05.550
in geology to students all day long.

216
09:05.550 --> 09:07.350
We can actually show them in VR

217
09:07.350 --> 09:08.910
and actually they're able to walk around it

218
09:08.910 --> 09:10.380
and feel how it looks like

219
09:10.380 --> 09:12.390
and that's a whole different experience.

220
09:12.390 --> 09:14.070
So that's like an educational angle.

221
09:14.070 --> 09:16.950
But the other interesting part that we are seeing now

222
09:16.950 --> 09:19.320
is that especially with the advent of AI,

223
09:19.320 --> 09:22.800
you can actually add in and create real content using AI.

224
09:22.800 --> 09:24.900
And I think that's gonna really change the way

225
09:24.900 --> 09:26.790
we basically look at MR, right?

226
09:26.790 --> 09:28.020
So now today what you can say,

227
09:28.020 --> 09:30.360
is you can actually say, I'm playing this game

228
09:30.360 --> 09:32.520
and you want to create a new content in that game.

229
09:32.520 --> 09:34.380
You can actually go in and use something like,

230
09:34.380 --> 09:36.330
a stable diffusion like model

231
09:36.330 --> 09:37.740
and be able to create that content.

232
09:37.740 --> 09:40.170
But that content now gets personalized

233
09:40.170 --> 09:41.610
to each and every user

234
09:41.610 --> 09:44.040
rather than being something that's generic

235
09:44.040 --> 09:45.600
and create it for everybody, right?

236
09:45.600 --> 09:47.190
And that personalization,

237
09:47.190 --> 09:50.250
especially when you can do some degree of this AI processing

238
09:50.250 --> 09:52.710
on the device can be extremely powerful.

239
09:52.710 --> 09:54.570
And then also very interesting to me also

240
09:54.570 --> 09:56.550
is what we are seeing with smart glasses.

241
09:56.550 --> 09:59.190
And I think there is a realm of MR and VR

242
09:59.190 --> 10:01.260
and then there is the realm of smart glasses.

243
10:01.260 --> 10:02.490
And I think smart glasses,

244
10:02.490 --> 10:04.770
especially with their ability to see what you see with,

245
10:04.770 --> 10:06.810
you know, cameras on the glasses

246
10:06.810 --> 10:10.500
and being able to actually really not just talk back

247
10:10.500 --> 10:12.510
to you using LLMs, but also be able to understand

248
10:12.510 --> 10:13.830
what you're looking at,

249
10:13.830 --> 10:15.720
really changes the experience in many different ways.

250
10:15.720 --> 10:19.530
So if you take the example of medical, you know,

251
10:19.530 --> 10:21.540
people or doctors always have this problem

252
10:21.540 --> 10:24.150
where they have to transcribe so much, you know,

253
10:24.150 --> 10:25.680
material after their visit

254
10:25.680 --> 10:27.450
that it takes them forever to do it.

255
10:27.450 --> 10:29.220
Well, now your glasses could be listening in,

256
10:29.220 --> 10:30.510
transcribing all of that,

257
10:30.510 --> 10:32.700
taking pictures of the prescription that you wrote,

258
10:32.700 --> 10:34.710
being able to bring up the results of an X-ray

259
10:34.710 --> 10:37.380
that was just done for the patient in front of you.

260
10:37.380 --> 10:38.550
So I think those applications,

261
10:38.550 --> 10:40.110
especially with smart glasses

262
10:40.110 --> 10:43.080
that have displays in them and AI built in,

263
10:43.080 --> 10:45.120
I think it really is going to change

264
10:45.120 --> 10:46.860
the way people do a lot of this work.

265
10:46.860 --> 10:49.920
And there are similar, you know, verticals in retail,

266
10:49.920 --> 10:52.380
there are verticals in industrial side,

267
10:52.380 --> 10:54.720
there are verticals on the, you know,

268
10:54.720 --> 10:57.210
on, for example, elderly care.

269
10:57.210 --> 10:58.050
That's a very big one.

270
10:58.050 --> 10:59.580
There are multiple countries

271
10:59.580 --> 11:02.250
where there is a huge part of the population that's aging

272
11:02.250 --> 11:04.770
and something like a glasses excellent for, you know,

273
11:04.770 --> 11:06.300
agentic sort of AI as well

274
11:06.300 --> 11:09.330
that's running on the glass at all the points in time

275
11:09.330 --> 11:10.857
such that you can converse with it.

276
11:10.857 --> 11:12.930
And I think those are the use cases

277
11:12.930 --> 11:15.090
that are really going to, I think, light up the space,

278
11:15.090 --> 11:17.040
especially this at the crux

279
11:17.040 --> 11:20.563
or at the intersection of XR and AI, in my opinion.

280
11:20.563 --> 11:22.853
<v ->Yeah, I agree with both of what you said.</v>

281
11:22.853 --> 11:26.880
I think spatial computing comes into its own with AR,

282
11:26.880 --> 11:28.950
I think because you are interacting with the environment,

283
11:28.950 --> 11:31.380
you want to see through a transparent display,

284
11:31.380 --> 11:33.900
I think that's the ideal form factor.

285
11:33.900 --> 11:35.400
And I agree with Ashley.

286
11:35.400 --> 11:39.480
I mean right now the AR use cases with a short path

287
11:39.480 --> 11:42.030
to money, no, it's in the business sector,

288
11:42.030 --> 11:45.090
the enterprise manufacturing guided task,

289
11:45.090 --> 11:47.400
remote expert use cases, you know,

290
11:47.400 --> 11:49.567
they're delivering real benefits, real dollars,

291
11:49.567 --> 11:52.560
you know, today it's not high hypothetical.

292
11:52.560 --> 11:54.960
It's interesting to see, to kind of figure out

293
11:54.960 --> 11:56.880
how it's going to make its,

294
11:56.880 --> 12:00.360
what use cases are gonna make their way into consumer.

295
12:00.360 --> 12:01.590
And I agree with you,

296
12:01.590 --> 12:05.025
I think it's the smart glasses, kinda the Google glass,

297
12:05.025 --> 12:07.170
you know, the glass whole experience kind of proves

298
12:07.170 --> 12:09.660
that society isn't going

299
12:09.660 --> 12:12.390
to accept anything much weirder than this.

300
12:12.390 --> 12:13.950
And so it really does comes down

301
12:13.950 --> 12:15.690
to what use cases are we gonna be able

302
12:15.690 --> 12:17.250
to pack into this form factor.

303
12:17.250 --> 12:20.310
And that is going to be the wavefront of use cases.

304
12:20.310 --> 12:23.100
And it is, as you say, it's interesting,

305
12:23.100 --> 12:24.150
it doesn't need to be visual

306
12:24.150 --> 12:25.980
'cause the visual part is hard

307
12:25.980 --> 12:27.750
for the physics point of view.

308
12:27.750 --> 12:32.340
So no, the audio translation, you know,

309
12:32.340 --> 12:34.953
logging trans, you know, transcription,

310
12:35.790 --> 12:37.410
they're already happening.

311
12:37.410 --> 12:39.600
And soon I think we are gonna get, you know,

312
12:39.600 --> 12:43.080
really usable smart glasses with displays.

313
12:43.080 --> 12:45.450
You know, the use case I'm looking forward

314
12:45.450 --> 12:47.910
to is like Google Translate, but on my glasses,

315
12:47.910 --> 12:50.370
I'm in Japan and it's translating all the signs

316
12:50.370 --> 12:51.780
and menus for me,

317
12:51.780 --> 12:53.280
without me having to get my phone out

318
12:53.280 --> 12:55.260
and like a dork. (chuckles)

319
12:55.260 --> 12:58.590
I mean that to me and doing audio translation,

320
12:58.590 --> 13:00.930
I mean that would be a killer use case, I think.

321
13:00.930 --> 13:02.853
And it's almost within reach, I think.

322
13:03.690 --> 13:06.420
<v ->So you all covered a lot of the primary,</v>

323
13:06.420 --> 13:08.310
industrial, manufacturing, retail,

324
13:08.310 --> 13:09.990
healthcare, education,

325
13:09.990 --> 13:12.210
I think product design architecture

326
13:12.210 --> 13:13.530
are some of the other ones.

327
13:13.530 --> 13:15.420
And then you touched on consumer, so,

328
13:15.420 --> 13:16.770
but from the consumer side,

329
13:17.980 --> 13:20.790
I think gaming of course has been one of the ones

330
13:20.790 --> 13:24.029
that has done well and there, you know,

331
13:24.029 --> 13:24.862
there's certain companies

332
13:24.862 --> 13:27.080
that have certainly made a lot of money.

333
13:27.080 --> 13:28.950
To Brian's question,

334
13:28.950 --> 13:30.720
and I think one of the other areas in there

335
13:30.720 --> 13:32.580
is fitness and wellness

336
13:32.580 --> 13:36.750
and you know, some of those use cases have continued

337
13:36.750 --> 13:38.370
to improve, you know,

338
13:38.370 --> 13:40.620
whether it's FitXR or Supernatural.

339
13:40.620 --> 13:43.050
And now you have multi-users,

340
13:43.050 --> 13:45.420
so you can be across the country

341
13:45.420 --> 13:47.673
from somebody working out together with them,

342
13:48.510 --> 13:51.573
with Jane Fonda and Ludacris as well,

343
13:52.410 --> 13:54.600
what I really did over the holiday. (chuckles)

344
13:54.600 --> 13:58.140
And then I know as those move into smart glasses,

345
13:58.140 --> 14:01.140
we'll be able to bring that level

346
14:01.140 --> 14:03.840
of wellness and fitness into our everyday lives

347
14:03.840 --> 14:07.833
and not just have it be a specific moment in time.

348
14:09.150 --> 14:10.770
<v ->Yep, that's great.</v>

349
14:11.787 --> 14:13.170
We do a lot.

350
14:13.170 --> 14:16.593
CTA does a lot on accessibility, so I'm looking forward to,

351
14:17.850 --> 14:20.520
you know, I think these new capabilities

352
14:20.520 --> 14:22.650
at spatial computing and AR

353
14:22.650 --> 14:25.740
and other technologies bring help a lot of people

354
14:25.740 --> 14:29.520
that includes people who may need extra help.

355
14:29.520 --> 14:32.190
You mentioned the audio part, EssilorLuxottica,

356
14:32.190 --> 14:35.250
this isn't in the spatial computing space,

357
14:35.250 --> 14:36.450
but they're doing the glasses

358
14:36.450 --> 14:38.700
with integrated over the counter hearing aids.

359
14:38.700 --> 14:39.930
So a lot of companies are working

360
14:39.930 --> 14:44.930
on these challenges of like getting good audio

361
14:45.240 --> 14:46.110
right here to our head

362
14:46.110 --> 14:49.410
and having microphones and cameras in place.

363
14:49.410 --> 14:52.150
Speaking of challenges, I wanna address that,

364
14:52.150 --> 14:55.100
this is hard technology, so there are certainly challenges.

365
14:56.010 --> 15:01.010
Can you guys address what you see as the big challenges

366
15:01.410 --> 15:04.650
and maybe more importantly, what are the solutions to 'em?

367
15:04.650 --> 15:06.270
Which things have we kind of dispensed?

368
15:06.270 --> 15:08.763
What else can we riff on that a little bit?

369
15:11.100 --> 15:12.930
Oh, no challenges?

370
15:12.930 --> 15:14.544
<v ->I didn't wanna go first again.</v>

371
15:14.544 --> 15:16.890
(panelists chuckling)

372
15:16.890 --> 15:17.723
Did you wanna go?

373
15:17.723 --> 15:19.320
<v ->Go ahead.</v>
<v ->Okay.</v>

374
15:19.320 --> 15:21.600
I think one of the challenge, I mean it's content, right?

375
15:21.600 --> 15:25.350
It's creation of of 3D interactive content

376
15:25.350 --> 15:26.790
can be difficult and expensive.

377
15:26.790 --> 15:28.710
AI is really helping that,

378
15:28.710 --> 15:32.070
I just listened to Siemens talk earlier

379
15:32.070 --> 15:33.690
who released some amazing AI

380
15:33.690 --> 15:36.330
that will help get, you know, 80% of the way there

381
15:36.330 --> 15:39.870
with CAD designs, which is huge,

382
15:39.870 --> 15:43.200
excited about LLaMA-Mesh released by NVIDIA,

383
15:43.200 --> 15:44.850
which is a huge step forward

384
15:44.850 --> 15:49.850
so that it translates vertices and faces of 3D models

385
15:50.010 --> 15:53.010
to text for an LLM to understand.

386
15:53.010 --> 15:56.490
So now not only can you do text to 3D,

387
15:56.490 --> 16:00.720
but you can alter and adjust the 3D model

388
16:00.720 --> 16:03.267
and do way better training with 3D

389
16:03.267 --> 16:05.820
and volumetric content with LLM.

390
16:05.820 --> 16:06.840
So that's huge.

391
16:06.840 --> 16:09.630
And then standards are incredibly important

392
16:09.630 --> 16:12.060
because there are hundreds of 3D file formats (chuckles)

393
16:12.060 --> 16:14.010
and everybody wants something different,

394
16:14.010 --> 16:16.800
which is why, you know, with Neil and the Khronos Group

395
16:16.800 --> 16:19.230
pushing GLB, which is a very efficient,

396
16:19.230 --> 16:21.630
great publishing format

397
16:21.630 --> 16:25.410
and now OpenUSD, which is really great for

398
16:25.410 --> 16:30.410
more more complex and kind of working files.

399
16:30.480 --> 16:33.360
But there's always gonna be different formats

400
16:33.360 --> 16:35.010
and different types is why, you know,

401
16:35.010 --> 16:39.000
at VNTANA we focus on how do we seamlessly convert

402
16:39.000 --> 16:43.590
and optimize a 3D asset to meet whatever specs you need.

403
16:43.590 --> 16:44.610
But yeah, that's why I'm so excited

404
16:44.610 --> 16:47.763
about all the stuff NVIDIA's just released.

405
16:50.091 --> 16:51.330
<v ->I'll go next in order,</v>

406
16:51.330 --> 16:53.860
but basically
(panelists chuckling)

407
16:53.860 --> 16:54.823
<v ->It's not required.
(panelists chuckling)</v>

408
16:54.823 --> 16:56.250
It's good.
<v ->It's official.</v>

409
16:56.250 --> 16:57.382
It's official.
<v ->There you go.</v>

410
16:57.382 --> 16:58.215
<v ->It's official order, right there.</v>

411
16:58.215 --> 16:59.550
<v ->I think the challenge has really come</v>

412
16:59.550 --> 17:00.990
from the fact that, you know,

413
17:00.990 --> 17:03.547
humans are used to very good quality, right,

414
17:03.547 --> 17:04.890
what they see in the world around them.

415
17:04.890 --> 17:05.910
When you go into MR,

416
17:05.910 --> 17:07.290
it really is that the experience

417
17:07.290 --> 17:09.330
has to meet a certain threshold.

418
17:09.330 --> 17:12.030
That threshold then drives immense compute capabilities

419
17:12.030 --> 17:14.070
that you need in an MR like device, right?

420
17:14.070 --> 17:16.320
You need to be able to get this pristine quality.

421
17:16.320 --> 17:18.780
So what I see from a trends perspective

422
17:18.780 --> 17:21.600
is you have 4K displays coming into these devices,

423
17:21.600 --> 17:24.810
at the same time we are doing chip sets here at Qualcomm

424
17:24.810 --> 17:26.580
that are far more capable

425
17:26.580 --> 17:29.430
such that we can do full foveation from end to end.

426
17:29.430 --> 17:30.870
Such that, you know, you're only able

427
17:30.870 --> 17:33.570
to give the highest quality on where your fovea

428
17:33.570 --> 17:35.190
or the center of your retina eyes at

429
17:35.190 --> 17:37.680
and everything else, you actually reduce the quality

430
17:37.680 --> 17:38.670
to be able to make sure

431
17:38.670 --> 17:41.190
you're able to fit the compute capability

432
17:41.190 --> 17:43.200
within the envelope of the device.

433
17:43.200 --> 17:44.670
Then at the same time what we are doing is,

434
17:44.670 --> 17:47.310
we have been working on all these perception technologies

435
17:47.310 --> 17:49.140
and working with the perception technologies,

436
17:49.140 --> 17:52.620
we have hardened certain algorithms into silicon.

437
17:52.620 --> 17:54.840
And by doing that we can actually do them at, you know,

438
17:54.840 --> 17:56.610
like a fraction of the power

439
17:56.610 --> 17:59.220
if you would have to do them on general purpose engine.

440
17:59.220 --> 18:02.160
And by virtue of that, you're able to actually even do more

441
18:02.160 --> 18:04.080
and more pristine quality

442
18:04.080 --> 18:05.580
because literally a little bit

443
18:05.580 --> 18:07.200
above a certain milliseconds,

444
18:07.200 --> 18:08.940
your eyes and your brain notices it.

445
18:08.940 --> 18:10.860
So if you remember the older MR devices,

446
18:10.860 --> 18:13.440
people used to get vertigo and a bad experience,

447
18:13.440 --> 18:14.490
a lot of that has gone away

448
18:14.490 --> 18:16.530
because we improved motion to photon,

449
18:16.530 --> 18:17.940
by such a level

450
18:17.940 --> 18:20.520
that people who don't have that problem anymore,

451
18:20.520 --> 18:23.820
the challenges in AR are totally different.

452
18:23.820 --> 18:26.040
In AR it's really about power, power, power

453
18:26.040 --> 18:28.260
because you can have this great device

454
18:28.260 --> 18:29.190
and if you guys have tried,

455
18:29.190 --> 18:30.930
like for example the Meta Ray-Bans,

456
18:30.930 --> 18:32.520
it uses one of our solutions,

457
18:32.520 --> 18:35.280
but people want to have longer battery life.

458
18:35.280 --> 18:36.510
And the gentleman just took my picture

459
18:36.510 --> 18:37.710
using the Meta Ray-Ban.

460
18:37.710 --> 18:38.910
But the key point essentially
(panelist chuckling)

461
18:38.910 --> 18:40.500
is that to be able to use that,

462
18:40.500 --> 18:42.750
people wanna be able to do more translations,

463
18:42.750 --> 18:44.070
more transcriptions,

464
18:44.070 --> 18:46.500
being able to see what the world is around them

465
18:46.500 --> 18:48.900
and then leverage that with agents.

466
18:48.900 --> 18:51.150
But to be able to do all of that processing,

467
18:51.150 --> 18:54.390
you have very limited space in an AR glass,

468
18:54.390 --> 18:56.730
which means the battery's tiny, which means, again,

469
18:56.730 --> 18:58.710
it comes back to power, power, power.

470
18:58.710 --> 19:00.300
So what we have been doing at Qualcomm

471
19:00.300 --> 19:03.180
is almost like three kind of legs to this tool,

472
19:03.180 --> 19:04.500
which is all our solutions.

473
19:04.500 --> 19:06.990
We are basically number one pushing the technology

474
19:06.990 --> 19:11.730
to the best in class sort of transistor technology,

475
19:11.730 --> 19:13.770
but also best in class IPs.

476
19:13.770 --> 19:16.020
Which means the camera, the graphics,

477
19:16.020 --> 19:17.640
the AI engine that we have built in

478
19:17.640 --> 19:19.380
for on device AI processing,

479
19:19.380 --> 19:22.080
all of them are able to literally sip on power.

480
19:22.080 --> 19:24.810
We have the best in class performance per watt

481
19:24.810 --> 19:26.190
of any AI engine out there

482
19:26.190 --> 19:28.380
because that's what you need in AR glass

483
19:28.380 --> 19:31.320
to be able to have it last for that period of time.

484
19:31.320 --> 19:34.320
And then the third angle then becomes really architecture.

485
19:34.320 --> 19:35.820
What I mean by architecture is,

486
19:35.820 --> 19:37.590
there are a certain number of devices

487
19:37.590 --> 19:39.120
that are around a person.

488
19:39.120 --> 19:40.320
You will have your smart glass,

489
19:40.320 --> 19:41.670
you will have your smartphone,

490
19:41.670 --> 19:43.980
you might have a smartwatch, you might have earbuds.

491
19:43.980 --> 19:46.080
And to really get to that full day of use,

492
19:46.080 --> 19:48.600
I envision that you need to almost be able to use

493
19:48.600 --> 19:49.650
all of these devices,

494
19:49.650 --> 19:52.620
which means you need to do smart offloading

495
19:52.620 --> 19:55.800
from that smart glass to the smartphone to the smartwatch.

496
19:55.800 --> 19:57.030
And you can maybe run,

497
19:57.030 --> 19:58.650
let's say half a billion parameter model

498
19:58.650 --> 20:00.600
natively on the smart glass.

499
20:00.600 --> 20:02.760
You wanna run a 10 billion parameter model,

500
20:02.760 --> 20:03.750
you go to the smartphone,

501
20:03.750 --> 20:05.190
you wanna run a hundred billion parameter model,

502
20:05.190 --> 20:06.960
you go to the cloud, right?

503
20:06.960 --> 20:09.870
You are able to actually do it in that, you know,

504
20:09.870 --> 20:13.230
abstracted multiple different levels, fashion.

505
20:13.230 --> 20:16.860
And I think that's the way we make this problem.

506
20:16.860 --> 20:18.923
That's how we solve this problem essentially.

507
20:20.310 --> 20:22.140
<v ->Yeah, I agree with all of that.</v>

508
20:22.140 --> 20:25.560
The another problem I think on a slightly different axis,

509
20:25.560 --> 20:27.510
you know, the virtual elephant in the room

510
20:27.510 --> 20:31.050
is privacy and security

511
20:31.050 --> 20:35.220
because by its very definition spatial computing,

512
20:35.220 --> 20:37.680
it's scanning you and everyone else

513
20:37.680 --> 20:39.630
and the environment constantly,

514
20:39.630 --> 20:41.480
if you can get the batteries to last.

515
20:42.570 --> 20:47.160
And of course that means there's huge potential

516
20:47.160 --> 20:49.620
for bad things to happen.

517
20:49.620 --> 20:52.050
To the extent that I think that if,

518
20:52.050 --> 20:53.190
unless we can really come up

519
20:53.190 --> 20:56.640
with robust solutions for privacy,

520
20:56.640 --> 20:59.490
society won't accept spatial computing.

521
20:59.490 --> 21:02.790
It's almost a gating function.

522
21:02.790 --> 21:04.650
We need to get this figured out.

523
21:04.650 --> 21:06.603
And it's not trivial either.

524
21:07.500 --> 21:10.383
You know, the Meta Ray-Bans today, you know,

525
21:11.430 --> 21:13.470
when it's active, a little light comes on, that's good.

526
21:13.470 --> 21:14.550
You can't disable it

527
21:14.550 --> 21:17.010
and if you try to cover it doesn't work.

528
21:17.010 --> 21:18.900
So they've obviously put some thought into it,

529
21:18.900 --> 21:21.270
but that's a fairly weak protection.

530
21:21.270 --> 21:24.270
We need to go much further.

531
21:24.270 --> 21:26.880
There are some technical solutions.

532
21:26.880 --> 21:29.670
I mean it's when you beam all the data to the cloud

533
21:29.670 --> 21:30.870
for the AI processing,

534
21:30.870 --> 21:33.480
that's obviously a big potential loophole.

535
21:33.480 --> 21:36.360
So can we do a more AI processing on device,

536
21:36.360 --> 21:39.510
such as you're saying, that raises other challenges.

537
21:39.510 --> 21:41.460
But that's obviously a good thing.

538
21:41.460 --> 21:44.760
I think, you know, at the down at the hardware API level,

539
21:44.760 --> 21:47.340
which is, you know, I spent a lot of time down there,

540
21:47.340 --> 21:50.040
I think we're about to be asked,

541
21:50.040 --> 21:54.840
just like we had to do DRM for playing back DVDs

542
21:54.840 --> 21:57.420
and you can't grab that movie frame.

543
21:57.420 --> 22:00.000
I think we're gonna be asked for camera APIs

544
22:00.000 --> 22:00.963
that are secure.

545
22:01.980 --> 22:06.120
You can grab the camera into a localized AI engine

546
22:06.120 --> 22:08.190
and you just can't get that data out,

547
22:08.190 --> 22:09.360
even if you want to

548
22:09.360 --> 22:12.960
and send it to some nefarious agent on the cloud,

549
22:12.960 --> 22:14.430
that kind of solution.

550
22:14.430 --> 22:15.960
But even that's not gonna be enough.

551
22:15.960 --> 22:19.830
I think we're gonna need regulation and legislation

552
22:19.830 --> 22:21.420
to really put some firewalls

553
22:21.420 --> 22:24.690
around what people can do with data.

554
22:24.690 --> 22:26.670
There's so much data gonna be collected.

555
22:26.670 --> 22:29.490
We have to really be careful

556
22:29.490 --> 22:32.340
and it's gonna take some legal firewalls,

557
22:32.340 --> 22:34.090
I think to help us figure that out.

558
22:35.190 --> 22:39.347
<v ->I think you (indistinct) leading in that this point.</v>

559
22:39.347 --> 22:41.160
(Neil chuckling)

560
22:41.160 --> 22:45.060
And, you know, another challenge just

561
22:45.060 --> 22:47.040
is the perceived value

562
22:47.040 --> 22:50.250
and benefit for the end user.

563
22:50.250 --> 22:52.620
I think, you know, those of us who are deep in the industry

564
22:52.620 --> 22:54.810
and who use these devices

565
22:54.810 --> 22:56.490
and this type of computing all the time,

566
22:56.490 --> 22:59.670
feel very strongly about them

567
22:59.670 --> 23:00.990
and very strongly about it,

568
23:00.990 --> 23:03.480
about, you know, how much benefit we get out of it.

569
23:03.480 --> 23:07.560
But I think that hasn't translated yet

570
23:07.560 --> 23:10.890
into the mass numbers and the mass adoption.

571
23:10.890 --> 23:14.940
So I think continuing to have, you know,

572
23:14.940 --> 23:17.070
and then that results in sometimes people feeling

573
23:17.070 --> 23:18.920
that these devices are too expensive,

574
23:19.920 --> 23:23.283
which is really about the perceived benefit.

575
23:24.311 --> 23:25.830
Whether that's in an enterprise environment

576
23:25.830 --> 23:29.790
or an B2C environment, you know,

577
23:29.790 --> 23:33.570
to move entire workforces, you know,

578
23:33.570 --> 23:36.450
from, it's very easy to bring people along for POC

579
23:36.450 --> 23:38.610
but then moving them to large scale,

580
23:38.610 --> 23:41.100
I think we still have some challenges in that

581
23:41.100 --> 23:42.377
in the industry.

582
23:42.377 --> 23:46.140
<v ->And do you think that's just like a combination of things?</v>

583
23:46.140 --> 23:49.890
Is it like hardware comfort and stuff

584
23:49.890 --> 23:51.810
or is it like just, you know,

585
23:51.810 --> 23:54.300
some people just don't like change, honestly, you know,

586
23:54.300 --> 23:56.050
you gotta do stuff a different way.

587
23:56.954 --> 23:57.787
Are there any-

588
23:57.787 --> 23:58.620
<v ->I think it's a combo.</v>

589
23:58.620 --> 24:01.020
I also think that, you know, that there are continue

590
24:01.020 --> 24:04.095
to be more players coming into the market,

591
24:04.095 --> 24:04.928
which is a really good thing

592
24:04.928 --> 24:06.240
that which drives more competition,

593
24:06.240 --> 24:11.240
which drives improved devices and additional content.

594
24:11.270 --> 24:14.550
So I think that is a positive as well.

595
24:14.550 --> 24:17.643
But yes to your question.

596
24:19.320 --> 24:21.330
<v ->Yeah, I know Zimmer Biomet,</v>

597
24:21.330 --> 24:23.460
I just did an interview with,

598
24:23.460 --> 24:25.920
'cause they initially deployed VR

599
24:25.920 --> 24:26.910
and everybody hated it.

600
24:26.910 --> 24:27.743
It was terrible.

601
24:27.743 --> 24:29.345
They couldn't figure it out

602
24:29.345 --> 24:31.590
and they realized they needed like device management,

603
24:31.590 --> 24:34.110
just like a huge enterprise has device management

604
24:34.110 --> 24:35.280
for laptops,

605
24:35.280 --> 24:37.680
well they needed that for the XR devices.

606
24:37.680 --> 24:40.590
So the next year when they implemented that,

607
24:40.590 --> 24:43.170
and if someone needed help, they could remote in,

608
24:43.170 --> 24:45.030
see what they were seeing, help them.

609
24:45.030 --> 24:46.590
Now it's incredible

610
24:46.590 --> 24:49.560
and they're using it to train all these surgeons

611
24:49.560 --> 24:50.640
before they go in

612
24:50.640 --> 24:53.010
and you know, use their new knee replacement.

613
24:53.010 --> 24:55.560
And so some of it is just looking at like,

614
24:55.560 --> 24:57.180
how do we deal with computers today?

615
24:57.180 --> 25:00.060
It's just a face computer, you know? (chuckles)

616
25:00.060 --> 25:03.360
So I thought that was a really interesting case study.

617
25:03.360 --> 25:05.310
<v ->Yeah. And which, I'm sorry, which company was that?</v>

618
25:05.310 --> 25:06.270
<v ->Zimmer Biomet.</v>

619
25:06.270 --> 25:10.320
They are a huge medical device company

620
25:10.320 --> 25:13.650
that uses VR to train all their surgeons now.

621
25:13.650 --> 25:14.483
<v ->Oh yeah, that's awesome.</v>

622
25:14.483 --> 25:17.010
So yeah, one of our board members did a startup on

623
25:17.010 --> 25:19.680
is specifically for orthopedic surgery,

624
25:19.680 --> 25:23.040
but he gave a great talk at one of our events.

625
25:23.040 --> 25:25.470
It's, you know, sort of scary seeing their training,

626
25:25.470 --> 25:28.794
their live training, how quickly they go from like,

627
25:28.794 --> 25:30.900
you know, do it a few times to surgery.

628
25:30.900 --> 25:33.030
So, you know, these are really-

629
25:33.030 --> 25:35.790
<v ->Yeah, I'm asking any surgeon if they've done VR</v>

630
25:35.790 --> 25:38.135
before I get surgery. (chuckles)

631
25:38.135 --> 25:39.373
(panelist chuckling)
<v ->There you go.</v>

632
25:39.373 --> 25:40.983
All right, that's great.

633
25:42.480 --> 25:45.960
Neil, thanks for bringing up the privacy question.

634
25:45.960 --> 25:47.400
This isn't a policy track.

635
25:47.400 --> 25:51.120
We have a great policy track at CES,

636
25:51.120 --> 25:54.240
but CTA has advocated for federal privacy legislation

637
25:54.240 --> 25:58.380
and we just need it, you know, so there's not a whole bunch

638
25:58.380 --> 25:59.850
of different state regulations.

639
25:59.850 --> 26:01.320
We just need a framework

640
26:01.320 --> 26:03.390
and it's clear we're gonna need it in more spaces

641
26:03.390 --> 26:07.320
and thanks for drawing that analogy that also historically,

642
26:07.320 --> 26:09.000
I've worked in video a long time,

643
26:09.000 --> 26:11.280
so through the whole content protection

644
26:11.280 --> 26:13.890
and DRM wars, we figured it out.

645
26:13.890 --> 26:18.070
We kind of know how to keep data safe

646
26:20.100 --> 26:21.360
in place and in transit,

647
26:21.360 --> 26:22.530
you know, the rules are there.

648
26:22.530 --> 26:27.530
So I look forward to figuring out those issues too.

649
26:29.100 --> 26:31.200
Alright, let's look ahead a little bit,

650
26:31.200 --> 26:33.780
unless there's anything else we wanna say.

651
26:33.780 --> 26:35.310
Well, so nobody really talked,

652
26:35.310 --> 26:37.020
we talked a little bit about standards.

653
26:37.020 --> 26:38.700
Neil, can I just say,

654
26:38.700 --> 26:41.220
do you feel like we're kind of on a track?

655
26:41.220 --> 26:43.923
We, you're involved in one of our standards forum.

656
26:45.000 --> 26:46.200
Do we have all the venues?

657
26:46.200 --> 26:48.240
Do we have a way to get the standards to,

658
26:48.240 --> 26:51.810
at least be able to move things around and interoperate?

659
26:51.810 --> 26:55.710
<v ->I think we're making good, actually making good progress.</v>

660
26:55.710 --> 26:58.350
We just started a multi-year,

661
26:58.350 --> 27:00.720
potentially multi-decade journey,

662
27:00.720 --> 27:05.383
but I think a lot of the standards bodies are engaged.

663
27:06.420 --> 27:09.930
They realize the role that they can play in this big thing,

664
27:09.930 --> 27:11.670
we're calling spatial computing

665
27:11.670 --> 27:15.000
and we have the forum, Metaverse Standards Forum,

666
27:15.000 --> 27:16.560
where they can come and cooperate,

667
27:16.560 --> 27:19.230
which we haven't had before, which is great.

668
27:19.230 --> 27:20.250
And you know,

669
27:20.250 --> 27:22.140
I think we are definitely gonna need standards.

670
27:22.140 --> 27:25.470
'cause by its nature spatial computing is bringing together

671
27:25.470 --> 27:27.087
a bunch of different technologies

672
27:27.087 --> 27:29.040
and we need to make those technologies

673
27:29.040 --> 27:31.980
as they become proven pervasively and cheaply

674
27:31.980 --> 27:33.540
and efficiently available

675
27:33.540 --> 27:36.210
to people putting together solutions

676
27:36.210 --> 27:38.910
and know standards are the way to do that.

677
27:38.910 --> 27:40.830
The standards that we need,

678
27:40.830 --> 27:42.390
we need like runtime standards,

679
27:42.390 --> 27:44.400
no devices talking to servers

680
27:44.400 --> 27:48.510
and software talking to hardware through APIs

681
27:48.510 --> 27:51.150
and you know, we are making good, good progress on that.

682
27:51.150 --> 27:54.750
I think spatial computing needs some new types or standards

683
27:54.750 --> 27:58.710
or at least standards to be used in new ways,

684
27:58.710 --> 28:02.580
kind of like private cameras is a good example, you know,

685
28:02.580 --> 28:05.520
that we haven't had to do that kind of thinking before.

686
28:05.520 --> 28:08.910
I think that's going to be a new wave of activity.

687
28:08.910 --> 28:12.180
And on the content side, as Ashley says,

688
28:12.180 --> 28:15.630
Ashley's the expert here on 3D content,

689
28:15.630 --> 28:18.390
we are making progress lots more to do,

690
28:18.390 --> 28:20.610
but there's new types of content too.

691
28:20.610 --> 28:22.800
But the geospatial guides actually have been thinking

692
28:22.800 --> 28:26.910
about for a long time, you know, environment scans,

693
28:26.910 --> 28:28.170
you know, we need to have them standardized

694
28:28.170 --> 28:30.450
so we can send them between applications,

695
28:30.450 --> 28:32.730
geo markers, anchors,

696
28:32.730 --> 28:35.160
the geospatial guides have been thinking about this a lot

697
28:35.160 --> 28:39.780
that the gaming guys not so much typically.

698
28:39.780 --> 28:42.480
So again, there's more, there's corporation,

699
28:42.480 --> 28:45.510
we need to kind of bridge some of these silos

700
28:45.510 --> 28:48.030
and bring these standard solutions to market.

701
28:48.030 --> 28:52.423
But I'm cautiously optimistic. (laughs)

702
28:54.930 --> 28:57.760
<v ->Okay, all right, let's look ahead a little bit</v>

703
28:58.830 --> 28:59.970
since it is CES

704
28:59.970 --> 29:02.010
and we do a lot of that, you know, we think about like,

705
29:02.010 --> 29:05.280
it sort of kicks off the year for the tech industry,

706
29:05.280 --> 29:08.400
so what's next for spatial computing?

707
29:08.400 --> 29:09.840
We've talked a little bit about AI,

708
29:09.840 --> 29:12.808
but what things do you see coming together?

709
29:12.808 --> 29:13.641
What are you looking forward

710
29:13.641 --> 29:15.453
to seeing over the next year or two?

711
29:18.103 --> 29:19.480
<v ->I have to first again (chuckles)</v>

712
29:19.480 --> 29:21.900
(panelists chuckling)
<v ->Don't fight it, Ashley.</v>

713
29:21.900 --> 29:23.760
<v ->I know. (chuckles)</v>

714
29:23.760 --> 29:26.520
<v ->You're the panel leader now.</v>
<v ->So I mean,</v>

715
29:26.520 --> 29:28.950
I talked a little bit about AI, everything,

716
29:28.950 --> 29:30.720
you know, with LLaMA-Mesh with NVIDIA,

717
29:30.720 --> 29:32.163
helping create content.

718
29:33.720 --> 29:37.560
Meta published a paper earlier this year using AI

719
29:37.560 --> 29:41.010
to automatically add textures and materials to CAD files.

720
29:41.010 --> 29:43.230
Again, just like helping create this content

721
29:43.230 --> 29:45.570
faster and quicker.

722
29:45.570 --> 29:48.060
And then everything, you know, that Qualcomm

723
29:48.060 --> 29:51.300
and others are doing with making devices so much better

724
29:51.300 --> 29:55.020
and more functional within the workspace and environment,

725
29:55.020 --> 29:56.973
I think we will start to see them more.

726
29:58.470 --> 30:00.243
And, you know, adoption,

727
30:01.088 --> 30:03.120
it really comes down to the people problem.

728
30:03.120 --> 30:05.400
And I thought it was really interesting too.

729
30:05.400 --> 30:09.330
I was talking with one of the leaders at Northrop Grumman

730
30:09.330 --> 30:13.350
and they use the HoloLens

731
30:13.350 --> 30:16.950
to actually like do these wiring of complex, the F35.

732
30:16.950 --> 30:21.270
It's a, and the, I think 276 tanker, I don't know,

733
30:21.270 --> 30:24.510
lots of crazy equipment there that's extremely complex.

734
30:24.510 --> 30:25.440
So they wear the headsets,

735
30:25.440 --> 30:27.330
know exactly where to put the wires.

736
30:27.330 --> 30:30.660
And what was interesting was,

737
30:30.660 --> 30:32.520
it wasn't the age of the person.

738
30:32.520 --> 30:34.290
'cause most people think it's young people

739
30:34.290 --> 30:35.580
will adopt this stuff sooner.

740
30:35.580 --> 30:37.710
It was if they were new to the company

741
30:37.710 --> 30:40.050
and they were just told, hey, this is how we do it.

742
30:40.050 --> 30:42.420
They're like, oh, this is great.

743
30:42.420 --> 30:44.220
But if they had been there for 20 years

744
30:44.220 --> 30:46.440
and they had been doing it a certain way for 20 years,

745
30:46.440 --> 30:49.230
they were the hard people to switch over.

746
30:49.230 --> 30:51.000
So I just thought that was really interesting

747
30:51.000 --> 30:54.390
as we think about change within an organization

748
30:54.390 --> 30:56.280
and getting people to adopt,

749
30:56.280 --> 30:57.210
just hire all new people,

750
30:57.210 --> 30:59.460
but no, just get, you know, (chuckles)

751
30:59.460 --> 31:00.576
maybe

752
31:00.576 --> 31:01.409
<v ->Move them around a little bit.</v>

753
31:01.409 --> 31:02.550
<v ->Yeah, but just start, you know,</v>

754
31:02.550 --> 31:03.520
maybe start
<v ->Physical chairs.</v>

755
31:03.520 --> 31:04.560
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

756
31:04.560 --> 31:07.170
Start with people that are gonna be receptive,

757
31:07.170 --> 31:08.280
I guess, to get, you know,

758
31:08.280 --> 31:09.990
and then people see it working well

759
31:09.990 --> 31:11.940
and them doing their job faster, easier

760
31:11.940 --> 31:13.323
and start to adopt.

761
31:14.550 --> 31:16.590
<v ->Yeah, I think I add some more, right,</v>

762
31:16.590 --> 31:17.850
especially on the MR side.

763
31:17.850 --> 31:19.950
I really think one of the big challenges

764
31:19.950 --> 31:21.180
that an industry has had

765
31:21.180 --> 31:23.190
is just the availability of content.

766
31:23.190 --> 31:25.200
So if you guys have been following what's happening

767
31:25.200 --> 31:27.570
with Nerf and with Gaussian Splatting,

768
31:27.570 --> 31:29.730
I think you get to a point where you actually able

769
31:29.730 --> 31:32.160
to create 3D content very easily.

770
31:32.160 --> 31:34.230
And I think that will really, really change

771
31:34.230 --> 31:35.580
the way MR gets used.

772
31:35.580 --> 31:36.510
That's one.

773
31:36.510 --> 31:37.343
I think secondly,

774
31:37.343 --> 31:40.380
what we are also seeing is models like text to 3D models

775
31:40.380 --> 31:42.450
that are becoming actually extremely good.

776
31:42.450 --> 31:44.370
So like the example that I gave in earlier,

777
31:44.370 --> 31:46.740
you could be in a game where you say, hey, make me a sword.

778
31:46.740 --> 31:48.450
And it makes a sword for you,

779
31:48.450 --> 31:50.850
but it knows the kind of textures that you like

780
31:50.850 --> 31:53.037
and the colors that you like and themes that you like

781
31:53.037 --> 31:55.500
and it makes a sword in the style that you like

782
31:55.500 --> 32:00.330
and some "Lord of the Rings" sort of style or whatever.

783
32:00.330 --> 32:01.800
But that's kind of the way

784
32:01.800 --> 32:05.280
that XR gets augmented with the great AI.

785
32:05.280 --> 32:06.330
And then what also happens

786
32:06.330 --> 32:08.670
is you can have multiple NPCs in a game

787
32:08.670 --> 32:11.970
and you could actually have a model like a Llama 3.2

788
32:11.970 --> 32:13.740
or you know, 8 billion parameter model

789
32:13.740 --> 32:16.440
that's running entirely on that MR headset.

790
32:16.440 --> 32:17.850
And you could be having a conversation

791
32:17.850 --> 32:20.310
with that NPC in the game, right?

792
32:20.310 --> 32:23.130
I think that's how it enhances experiences like gaming

793
32:23.130 --> 32:25.440
in a very, very interesting fashion.

794
32:25.440 --> 32:27.263
And then if you look at what you can do on the AR

795
32:27.263 --> 32:29.520
and the smart glass side,

796
32:29.520 --> 32:31.290
I think that's where it really blows it up.

797
32:31.290 --> 32:33.210
And in the case that Neil talked about,

798
32:33.210 --> 32:35.490
we have one of our partners, at TCL,

799
32:35.490 --> 32:37.560
they actually launched their device today

800
32:37.560 --> 32:39.330
and it actually does exactly that.

801
32:39.330 --> 32:40.980
I was with them in China

802
32:40.980 --> 32:42.360
where the whole meeting was in Mandarin

803
32:42.360 --> 32:45.330
and I could see the full translation the display, right?

804
32:45.330 --> 32:46.980
Very simple use case in some ways,

805
32:46.980 --> 32:48.840
but very practical, I think.

806
32:48.840 --> 32:51.200
But what happens also in addition to that

807
32:51.200 --> 32:53.490
is really multimodal AI coming together.

808
32:53.490 --> 32:54.930
You have full agents that are able

809
32:54.930 --> 32:57.810
to actually stitch together multiple tasks for you.

810
32:57.810 --> 32:59.910
So it's not just saying, hey, you know,

811
32:59.910 --> 33:01.860
write me a poem about whatever.

812
33:01.860 --> 33:03.120
But it's much more about saying,

813
33:03.120 --> 33:06.090
hey, I wanna schedule a trip to Vegas for CES

814
33:06.090 --> 33:09.360
and hey, it's gonna break that down into multiple tasks.

815
33:09.360 --> 33:10.230
It's going to have rag,

816
33:10.230 --> 33:12.150
it's gonna snoop into your calendar,

817
33:12.150 --> 33:13.470
it's going to look into your emails,

818
33:13.470 --> 33:15.360
it's going to look into all of the things

819
33:15.360 --> 33:16.193
that you need to do

820
33:16.193 --> 33:18.810
and basically do that very complex task for you.

821
33:18.810 --> 33:20.700
And what better device to do that on

822
33:20.700 --> 33:22.230
than a smart glass, right?

823
33:22.230 --> 33:25.260
This is the device which you go and sit into your car

824
33:25.260 --> 33:27.060
and basically it can connect to your car

825
33:27.060 --> 33:29.730
rather than having a heads up display, for example, right?

826
33:29.730 --> 33:31.380
Those are the kinds of experiences

827
33:31.380 --> 33:33.300
that I think they are here.

828
33:33.300 --> 33:36.360
And I think I'll venture to predict that this year,

829
33:36.360 --> 33:37.920
we will have devices,

830
33:37.920 --> 33:40.500
very good form factor smart glasses

831
33:40.500 --> 33:43.140
that will have displays in them, binocular displays.

832
33:43.140 --> 33:44.520
And I think it'll completely change

833
33:44.520 --> 33:46.590
the way that we interact with a lot of devices

834
33:46.590 --> 33:47.763
that are on our body.

835
33:49.980 --> 33:52.320
<v ->So I agree with the comments, saying AI,</v>

836
33:52.320 --> 33:53.676
<v ->Disagree for once.</v>

837
33:53.676 --> 33:55.013
<v ->yeah, I know it's boring, right?</v>

838
33:55.013 --> 33:56.010
(all chuckling)

839
33:56.010 --> 33:58.200
But AI is gonna be key.

840
33:58.200 --> 33:59.670
I mean, sometimes you hear people say,

841
33:59.670 --> 34:00.820
which is gonna be the hottest technologies,

842
34:00.820 --> 34:03.805
is it AI or is it spatial computing

843
34:03.805 --> 34:06.180
or, I think that they are so closely linked,

844
34:06.180 --> 34:07.860
they're symbiotic

845
34:07.860 --> 34:09.930
because spatial computing,

846
34:09.930 --> 34:12.630
know understanding your environment and your users

847
34:12.630 --> 34:16.860
that AI is the fundamentally enabling technology.

848
34:16.860 --> 34:18.000
I mean, that stuff is magic.

849
34:18.000 --> 34:19.830
We couldn't even contemplate doing that,

850
34:19.830 --> 34:22.200
3, 4, 5 years ago.

851
34:22.200 --> 34:25.410
Now it's all suddenly becoming possible.

852
34:25.410 --> 34:28.800
And spatial computing, I think in many case, not all,

853
34:28.800 --> 34:33.270
but in many cases will become the user interface for AI.

854
34:33.270 --> 34:35.980
No, agentic spatial computing

855
34:37.230 --> 34:40.200
is gonna be the way lots of us interact

856
34:40.200 --> 34:43.950
with our computing machinery in a much more natural ways

857
34:43.950 --> 34:45.780
than we've ever been able to do before.

858
34:45.780 --> 34:47.640
And this is a real revolution.

859
34:47.640 --> 34:49.320
I think that that's coming.

860
34:49.320 --> 34:52.410
But another, and the final, you know,

861
34:52.410 --> 34:53.610
really interesting thing,

862
34:53.610 --> 34:54.870
which is really just starting

863
34:54.870 --> 34:58.710
is actuated spatial computing

864
34:58.710 --> 35:00.840
where it's not necessarily a human

865
35:00.840 --> 35:04.080
but some smart machine or vehicle

866
35:04.080 --> 35:06.540
that's also using spatial computing.

867
35:06.540 --> 35:10.440
And again, it's so symbiotic using spatial computing

868
35:10.440 --> 35:13.290
to train these smart devices

869
35:13.290 --> 35:16.830
that then go out into the real world using spatial computing

870
35:16.830 --> 35:19.260
to interact with their environments.

871
35:19.260 --> 35:21.927
So spatial computing and AI, you know,

872
35:21.927 --> 35:24.360
are just so tightly bound together.

873
35:24.360 --> 35:26.943
It's a very, but it's very powerful combination.

874
35:28.200 --> 35:31.050
<v ->I mentioned earlier that the competition</v>

875
35:31.050 --> 35:32.910
that we are seeing,

876
35:32.910 --> 35:35.790
interesting announcements from Google before the holidays,

877
35:35.790 --> 35:39.090
both on the AI side, well as on the XR side,

878
35:39.090 --> 35:41.340
Sony here at CES,

879
35:41.340 --> 35:44.520
Sony's for a long time had the ability to work

880
35:44.520 --> 35:47.910
across all of these but hasn't always brought it together.

881
35:47.910 --> 35:50.442
But their latest announcements looks like

882
35:50.442 --> 35:53.580
they are bringing a lot of their capabilities together.

883
35:53.580 --> 35:56.370
All of big tech with the LLM models

884
35:56.370 --> 35:59.700
plus so many small startups

885
35:59.700 --> 36:01.650
or I don't even know if you can call them startups

886
36:01.650 --> 36:03.870
'cause at the levels that they're at in the funding,

887
36:03.870 --> 36:05.700
but, you know, small companies,

888
36:05.700 --> 36:09.153
still new companies creating powerful models.

889
36:10.050 --> 36:13.740
And hopefully we'll see more and more of these companies

890
36:13.740 --> 36:16.800
also getting in working hand in hand with creators,

891
36:16.800 --> 36:18.690
hand in hand with developers

892
36:18.690 --> 36:22.050
and putting funding to make the market

893
36:22.050 --> 36:23.070
continue to move forward

894
36:23.070 --> 36:27.330
until they can be profitable on their own.

895
36:27.330 --> 36:29.100
But, so I think that the,

896
36:29.100 --> 36:32.100
so many more companies jumping back in

897
36:32.100 --> 36:35.160
to spaces that many had exited,

898
36:35.160 --> 36:37.500
but you know, they're seeing that now is the time

899
36:37.500 --> 36:40.468
and now is the time to come back to the market,

900
36:40.468 --> 36:41.670
that makes me really excited.

901
36:41.670 --> 36:42.510
And then there's of course

902
36:42.510 --> 36:44.190
those companies that have been there the whole time.

903
36:44.190 --> 36:46.447
So we have to give them credit,

904
36:46.447 --> 36:48.000
(panelists chuckling)

905
36:48.000 --> 36:49.413
such the ones on this panel.

906
36:50.700 --> 36:54.060
<v ->Awesome, related, so how about other senses</v>

907
36:54.060 --> 36:55.467
like haptics and other stuff?

908
36:55.467 --> 36:57.180
Are you guys doing anything in that?

909
36:57.180 --> 37:00.960
I mean is it all, is it primarily video?

910
37:00.960 --> 37:02.580
I know that's what we've been thinking about,

911
37:02.580 --> 37:04.710
mostly talking about here, but other?

912
37:04.710 --> 37:06.270
<v ->No, haptics is really key.</v>

913
37:06.270 --> 37:08.490
I mean just like,

914
37:08.490 --> 37:10.230
just like in games you don't have good audio,

915
37:10.230 --> 37:12.390
it's like 80% of the experience has gone.

916
37:12.390 --> 37:15.060
I mean when we get to real spatial computing

917
37:15.060 --> 37:16.290
and immersive experiences,

918
37:16.290 --> 37:18.030
I think haptics is gonna be key.

919
37:18.030 --> 37:20.460
There lots of the low level standards like OpenXR,

920
37:20.460 --> 37:22.803
they're not just focused on, you know,

921
37:22.803 --> 37:24.960
just the video part and the audio part.

922
37:24.960 --> 37:28.380
They're absolutely focusing in on the haptics as well.

923
37:28.380 --> 37:30.230
Make making sure that's standardized.

924
37:31.260 --> 37:33.030
<v ->Yeah, and we were chatting,</v>

925
37:33.030 --> 37:35.280
I was here for the "World of Concrete" last year,

926
37:35.280 --> 37:37.470
which is a enormous conference

927
37:37.470 --> 37:40.530
with the heavy machinery and I was so surprised

928
37:40.530 --> 37:41.580
and happy to see

929
37:41.580 --> 37:46.580
how many simulations the different companies had,

930
37:46.680 --> 37:51.680
where you could sit and it was a 360 video of you in a field

931
37:52.470 --> 37:53.700
and it was a haptic chair

932
37:53.700 --> 37:56.430
and you were actually trying to do the crane

933
37:56.430 --> 37:58.770
and everything and I was horrible. (chuckles)

934
37:58.770 --> 38:03.057
So, but it was a very realistic experience

935
38:03.057 --> 38:04.830
and the haptics were essential

936
38:04.830 --> 38:07.170
to make that mixed reality experience.

937
38:07.170 --> 38:10.260
And you know, there's HaptX that is still around

938
38:10.260 --> 38:12.210
and part of a bigger company now,

939
38:12.210 --> 38:15.120
which is more of like, you know, gloves that you can wear.

940
38:15.120 --> 38:16.770
So when you talk about surgeon training

941
38:16.770 --> 38:20.430
and understanding what is that amount of pressure to put,

942
38:20.430 --> 38:22.080
so it's incredibly essential.

943
38:22.080 --> 38:25.200
I just think it's been lagging a bit.

944
38:25.200 --> 38:27.720
'cause you know, we gotta create the content first

945
38:27.720 --> 38:30.660
and then everything else. (chuckles)

946
38:30.660 --> 38:32.250
<v ->And mechanically it's a challenge, right?</v>

947
38:32.250 --> 38:33.570
You can understand why it's lagging.

948
38:33.570 --> 38:34.684
It's a hard,

949
38:34.684 --> 38:35.517
<v ->It's expensive.</v>
<v ->It's a hard problem.</v>

950
38:35.517 --> 38:37.203
<v ->Hardware is a difficult business.</v>

951
38:38.340 --> 38:39.173
<v ->Yes.</v>

952
38:39.173 --> 38:41.190
So this is true.

953
38:41.190 --> 38:43.800
I'm reminded by people on the robotics side,

954
38:43.800 --> 38:47.430
you know, robotics have been at CES many, many years.

955
38:47.430 --> 38:51.090
Things that move actuators are just hard to do,

956
38:51.090 --> 38:52.920
really hard to do well.

957
38:52.920 --> 38:55.440
We got just like a minute or so left,

958
38:55.440 --> 38:58.710
so you guys wanna say anything?

959
38:58.710 --> 39:00.270
Oh, oh, I should mention like, by the way,

960
39:00.270 --> 39:02.040
we have our own bigger equipment over here,

961
39:02.040 --> 39:04.020
so right here in West Hall, you know,

962
39:04.020 --> 39:08.793
we've got big mining equipment, so check it out.

963
39:10.862 --> 39:11.695
What do you see,

964
39:11.695 --> 39:13.236
or like what would you like to see,

965
39:13.236 --> 39:15.000
what do you see as success this year,

966
39:15.000 --> 39:15.990
just kind of quickly,

967
39:15.990 --> 39:18.873
or what would you like to see at CES next year?

968
39:19.980 --> 39:23.253
What's your like, optimistic vision for spatial computing?

969
39:25.410 --> 39:28.080
<v ->I'd personally like to see</v>

970
39:28.080 --> 39:30.900
steady progress on more use case

971
39:30.900 --> 39:33.690
being packed into the smart glasses

972
39:33.690 --> 39:36.690
and them being genuinely useful.

973
39:36.690 --> 39:39.688
Not gimmicks or just something for its own sake.

974
39:39.688 --> 39:41.490
I think if we can stay on that track,

975
39:41.490 --> 39:43.713
then interesting things are gonna happen.

976
39:45.191 --> 39:47.760
<v ->I think I kind of follow what Neil said.</v>

977
39:47.760 --> 39:49.980
I think next year, by this time,

978
39:49.980 --> 39:52.410
we will have multiple companies

979
39:52.410 --> 39:55.380
that would have glasses with displays

980
39:55.380 --> 39:58.950
and I think with agents that are actually able to do

981
39:58.950 --> 40:00.360
a lot of the tasks for us, right?

982
40:00.360 --> 40:02.430
That's, I mean that's a use case

983
40:02.430 --> 40:04.380
that's ready, it's available.

984
40:04.380 --> 40:06.060
And I think what will make that also possible

985
40:06.060 --> 40:09.090
is people are now looking at more domain specific models

986
40:09.090 --> 40:10.860
such that you can actually train it,

987
40:10.860 --> 40:12.330
only on that specific use case,

988
40:12.330 --> 40:13.530
whether it's medical triage

989
40:13.530 --> 40:15.480
or it's a particular use case.

990
40:15.480 --> 40:17.550
And that model can now be much smaller,

991
40:17.550 --> 40:18.870
does not hallucinate.

992
40:18.870 --> 40:21.000
And I think those are going to be the things

993
40:21.000 --> 40:22.140
that make it happen.

994
40:22.140 --> 40:24.810
And the experience has to be seamless, right?

995
40:24.810 --> 40:27.330
It cannot be that you need to wait for a sentence to finish

996
40:27.330 --> 40:29.250
and then the person starts speaking.

997
40:29.250 --> 40:31.470
It needs to be the same conversational style

998
40:31.470 --> 40:33.030
that you have with other humans.

999
40:33.030 --> 40:34.813
Otherwise it comes very restrictive.

1000
40:34.813 --> 40:36.963
And I think that will happen in my opinion.

1001
40:38.696 --> 40:40.496
<v ->Well, I'm looking forward to when,</v>

1002
40:41.700 --> 40:43.140
you know, if you think back,

1003
40:43.140 --> 40:46.110
whether it was 15 or 20 or so years ago

1004
40:46.110 --> 40:48.330
and digital was something separate,

1005
40:48.330 --> 40:50.070
digital was like its own department.

1006
40:50.070 --> 40:52.230
It was like there were certain people that were, you know,

1007
40:52.230 --> 40:53.700
the digital people in your company

1008
40:53.700 --> 40:55.140
and other people were not.

1009
40:55.140 --> 40:56.640
But I'm looking forward

1010
40:56.640 --> 41:00.330
to when both AI and spatial computing

1011
41:00.330 --> 41:02.370
just become like the water.

1012
41:02.370 --> 41:04.410
It's just how we interact

1013
41:04.410 --> 41:06.810
and it's less focused on the technology

1014
41:06.810 --> 41:10.028
and more just focused on how you do things

1015
41:10.028 --> 41:11.430
and your experience.

1016
41:11.430 --> 41:13.050
And I think that that's when we'll know

1017
41:13.050 --> 41:14.763
we're truly at mass adoption.

1018
41:16.920 --> 41:19.170
<v ->Okay. Ashley, you wanna bring us home or you...</v>

1019
41:19.170 --> 41:20.003
<v ->Oh, sure.</v>

1020
41:20.003 --> 41:21.390
I mean I completely agree that,

1021
41:21.390 --> 41:24.480
I'd say the use cases on the headsets,

1022
41:24.480 --> 41:26.220
but I'm hoping to see

1023
41:26.220 --> 41:28.740
that people think about having content

1024
41:28.740 --> 41:31.050
across all different types of devices

1025
41:31.050 --> 41:31.883
when they create it

1026
41:31.883 --> 41:35.760
because that's how you're gonna get more use cases

1027
41:35.760 --> 41:37.350
and usage in the software.

1028
41:37.350 --> 41:38.340
And if people can use it

1029
41:38.340 --> 41:41.103
on a desktop, tablet and a headset,

1030
41:42.090 --> 41:43.830
I think you're gonna get faster adoption

1031
41:43.830 --> 41:47.613
and be able to bring in more people to adopt it faster.

1032
41:48.930 --> 41:51.450
<v ->I agree.
(panelists laughing)</v>

1033
41:51.450 --> 41:54.769
<v ->Ah, Joanne, do you have a rebuttal for it?</v>

1034
41:54.769 --> 41:55.602
(panelists laughing)

1035
41:55.602 --> 41:58.800
Okay, so, alright, we are at time.

1036
41:58.800 --> 42:00.060
I'm sure if you have questions,

1037
42:00.060 --> 42:02.820
our panelists would chat with you afterwards.

1038
42:02.820 --> 42:05.190
So join me in thanking our panelists

1039
42:05.190 --> 42:07.052
for this great session, "Spatial Computing."

1040
42:07.052 --> 42:08.766
(audience applauding)

1041
42:08.766 --> 42:11.433
(bright music)
