00:00.254 --> 00:02.837
(bright music)

00:10.620 --> 00:11.970
<v Kristen>Good afternoon, everyone,</v>

00:11.970 --> 00:13.380
and welcome to our session

00:13.380 --> 00:15.510
on navigating the multifamily IoT markets.

00:15.510 --> 00:18.210
We're very excited to have you all here with us today.

00:19.260 --> 00:21.030
If you haven't met me before, I'm Kristen Hanich,

00:21.030 --> 00:23.040
research director here at Parks Associates.

00:23.040 --> 00:25.680
I lead our coverage of multifamily housing,

00:25.680 --> 00:27.480
really guiding our research efforts,

00:27.480 --> 00:29.853
both syndicated and custom throughout the year.

00:31.890 --> 00:33.360
Before we get started, I would like to give

00:33.360 --> 00:35.220
a special thank you to all of our sponsors

00:35.220 --> 00:37.080
for helping to make this event possible,

00:37.080 --> 00:38.880
as well as our other events as well.

00:40.920 --> 00:43.170
So this is our 2:00 PM session, as I mentioned,

00:43.170 --> 00:44.880
really taking a look at navigating

00:44.880 --> 00:46.590
the multifamily IoT markets.

00:46.590 --> 00:47.790
Special thank you to SmartRent

00:47.790 --> 00:49.290
for highlighting this session.

00:50.190 --> 00:52.530
So we are gonna be taking the next 40 minutes or so

00:52.530 --> 00:54.660
to really dive into this topic.

00:54.660 --> 00:56.760
So understanding what is going on on this markets,

00:56.760 --> 00:58.650
why it is appealing to folks,

00:58.650 --> 01:01.380
as well as diving into some additional details.

01:01.380 --> 01:03.960
The topics of note are really taking a look

01:03.960 --> 01:06.240
at how IoT is serving this role,

01:06.240 --> 01:08.850
both as an operational tool as an amenity,

01:08.850 --> 01:11.640
and also looking at connectivity as a key enabler

01:11.640 --> 01:13.950
for deploying all of these different solutions.

01:13.950 --> 01:16.860
We're also gonna be taking a look at what to expect in 2025.

01:16.860 --> 01:19.160
So there are some major developments underway.

01:21.420 --> 01:24.240
A little bit of context, again before I get started,

01:24.240 --> 01:26.220
so we've seen in multi-family housing,

01:26.220 --> 01:28.080
there is this pendulum that tends to swing

01:28.080 --> 01:32.370
from one way to the other every few years.

01:32.370 --> 01:33.450
The last couple of years,

01:33.450 --> 01:35.970
we have been in an operational efficiency mode.

01:35.970 --> 01:38.280
So really focusing on reducing costs,

01:38.280 --> 01:40.500
improving efficiencies,

01:40.500 --> 01:44.070
we do expect to see this historic amount

01:44.070 --> 01:45.900
of new inventory hits the markets

01:45.900 --> 01:48.570
and renewed focus on resident satisfaction,

01:48.570 --> 01:51.540
especially bringing in these new amenities.

01:51.540 --> 01:54.480
So a lot of times, IoT has served

01:54.480 --> 01:58.650
kinda this operational role, but also resident satisfaction.

01:58.650 --> 02:00.480
The most interesting solutions are of course

02:00.480 --> 02:02.610
those that really hit both of those needs.

02:02.610 --> 02:04.590
So serving the needs of both the owners

02:04.590 --> 02:06.903
and operators as well as the residents.

02:08.280 --> 02:09.360
I mentioned wifi.

02:09.360 --> 02:12.360
It is really this key enabling technology,

02:12.360 --> 02:15.210
making a lot of these IoT deployments possible.

02:15.210 --> 02:18.750
A lot of owners and operators are deploying managed wifi

02:18.750 --> 02:20.220
really throughout their properties,

02:20.220 --> 02:22.020
both inside of residential units

02:22.020 --> 02:24.360
and throughout the property as a whole.

02:24.360 --> 02:27.600
I will say that with a lot of retrofitting going on,

02:27.600 --> 02:31.770
we are seeing increased demand, not just for wifi networks

02:31.770 --> 02:35.100
but also solutions that will work without wifi.

02:35.100 --> 02:37.710
So sparing them the expense of having to retrofit

02:37.710 --> 02:39.453
in a lot of complex connectivity.

02:41.310 --> 02:43.860
To discuss all of this and more, I have an excellent lineup

02:43.860 --> 02:46.500
of panelists here today, so very excited

02:46.500 --> 02:48.540
to dig into this conversation.

02:48.540 --> 02:50.850
Let's go through and do a round of introductions.

02:50.850 --> 02:53.013
Maybe a couple of minutes for each of us.

02:54.450 --> 02:55.440
Let's see.

02:55.440 --> 02:56.910
John, you are first up in the lineup.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.290
Can you tell us a little bit about yourself,

02:58.290 --> 03:00.210
your work at ADT?

03:00.210 --> 03:01.384
<v John>Thanks.</v>

03:01.384 --> 03:02.520
The headshot's a little bit old.

03:02.520 --> 03:05.370
I guess I gotta add a few pounds and eight years to that.

03:07.230 --> 03:08.670
Thanks for everybody for joining.

03:08.670 --> 03:11.070
John Butrim, I oversee the Builder

03:11.070 --> 03:16.070
Multifamily and Community Association division at ADT.

03:16.110 --> 03:19.560
Basically, anything that is a commercial relationship

03:19.560 --> 03:22.380
but ends with a residential user

03:22.380 --> 03:25.503
in front of that panel or phone for the app.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.680
<v Kristen>Very excited to have you here with us today</v>

03:28.680 --> 03:30.750
and kinda looking again to dive a little bit more

03:30.750 --> 03:32.340
into the subject.

03:32.340 --> 03:34.290
Eric, so you and I were talking a little bit

03:34.290 --> 03:36.120
not too long ago about kind of Kwikset

03:36.120 --> 03:37.920
and some of it's movement there.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.050
So excited to hear a bit more.

03:40.050 --> 03:41.910
<v Eric>Yeah, great to be here.</v>

03:41.910 --> 03:43.200
My name's Eric Harnischfeger.

03:43.200 --> 03:45.780
I'm a senior product manager with Kwikset

03:45.780 --> 03:49.500
as part of the ASSA ABLOY Americas residential group.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.780
I'm particularly responsible for Kwikset's

03:51.780 --> 03:54.450
multifamily electronic organization

03:54.450 --> 03:57.540
for the access control market for multifamily.

03:57.540 --> 03:59.010
We're in a really interesting place right now,

03:59.010 --> 04:00.930
because Kwikset is relatively new

04:00.930 --> 04:04.320
to electronic multifamily access control,

04:04.320 --> 04:05.670
but we're now part of ASSA ABLOY,

04:05.670 --> 04:07.860
which is obviously a market leader here.

04:07.860 --> 04:09.390
So I'm excited to be here and have the opportunity

04:09.390 --> 04:11.100
to talk through how we're navigating that

04:11.100 --> 04:13.950
as both part of a kind of a new entrant into the field,

04:13.950 --> 04:17.220
but also with the backing of the ASSA ABLOY establishment.

04:17.220 --> 04:19.290
<v Kristen>Very happy to have you here with us today, Eric,</v>

04:19.290 --> 04:20.910
and of course Greg Mora,

04:20.910 --> 04:23.700
longtime mainstay here at our Parks events.

04:23.700 --> 04:25.770
So Greg, can you tell us maybe a little bit about yourself,

04:25.770 --> 04:28.080
your work at Johnson Controls?

04:28.080 --> 04:29.070
<v Greg>Alright, thank you everybody.</v>

04:29.070 --> 04:30.180
My name is Greg Mora,

04:30.180 --> 04:33.720
and I'm with the Global Product Security

04:33.720 --> 04:35.580
Division within Johnson Controls.

04:35.580 --> 04:37.830
We have about 10 different business units,

04:37.830 --> 04:39.720
and global product security is one of them

04:39.720 --> 04:43.680
where we focus on everything from access control,

04:43.680 --> 04:47.520
video services to a business that we call Intrusion,

04:47.520 --> 04:51.693
which ties closely to our relationship with parks.

04:52.650 --> 04:55.170
A large percentage of the smart homes

04:55.170 --> 04:59.910
or connected homes today feature monitored security.

04:59.910 --> 05:03.480
And so we support the multifamily businesses,

05:03.480 --> 05:06.900
like ADT and others through an extension

05:06.900 --> 05:11.040
of our products that are primarily based around security

05:11.040 --> 05:12.570
and now increasingly are expanding

05:12.570 --> 05:14.403
into the market for builder,

05:15.360 --> 05:18.630
build to rent and multifamily.

05:18.630 --> 05:19.500
<v Kristen>Thanks so much, Greg.</v>

05:19.500 --> 05:22.350
Very happy to have you here with us again also.

05:22.350 --> 05:24.270
And Braeden Scheer, joining us from SmartRent.

05:24.270 --> 05:25.890
Braeden, can tell us a little bit about yourself,

05:25.890 --> 05:27.150
your role at SmartRent?

05:27.150 --> 05:29.010
<v Braeden>Absolutely, well, great to be here.</v>

05:29.010 --> 05:29.843
Thank you, everybody.

05:29.843 --> 05:31.650
I'm Braeden, vice president of product.

05:31.650 --> 05:35.700
I oversee our hardware and software product strategy.

05:35.700 --> 05:38.310
SmartRent, we're a leading provider of smart community

05:38.310 --> 05:41.490
and smart operations software in multifamily.

05:41.490 --> 05:44.100
Our vision is to help everyone live and work smarter

05:44.100 --> 05:46.380
and we do that through a purpose-built ecosystem

05:46.380 --> 05:48.390
of our own hardware and software,

05:48.390 --> 05:50.460
but we also have a great network of partners

05:50.460 --> 05:54.300
to help us deliver that mission, provide asset protection,

05:54.300 --> 05:57.570
operational efficiency, and a premium residence experience.

05:57.570 --> 05:58.890
<v Speaker>You look like you're a headshot.</v>

05:58.890 --> 06:00.180
That's good.

06:00.180 --> 06:01.013
<v Braeden>Thank you.</v>

06:01.013 --> 06:03.900
Although I need to get a new one, probably. (laughs)

06:03.900 --> 06:05.280
<v Kristen>I think we all need to update</v>

06:05.280 --> 06:06.680
our headshots at some point.

06:08.190 --> 06:10.440
But yes, very happy to have you here with us.

06:10.440 --> 06:11.910
Also joining us, Hagan Kappler,

06:11.910 --> 06:13.350
co-founder and CEO of Daisy.

06:13.350 --> 06:15.060
Hagan, can I ask a little bit about yourself,

06:15.060 --> 06:17.460
your role at Daisy, kind of what you guys do?

06:17.460 --> 06:19.620
<v Hagan>Great, yeah, thanks so much for having me.</v>

06:19.620 --> 06:23.520
Hagan Kappler, I'm the co-founder and CEO of Daisy.

06:23.520 --> 06:27.060
Daisy is the first national installer

06:27.060 --> 06:30.600
and service provider of all the technology

06:30.600 --> 06:32.160
that you need in your home.

06:32.160 --> 06:35.820
Small business, apartment, everything from TV,

06:35.820 --> 06:39.243
speakers, lighting, home security cameras,

06:40.260 --> 06:43.470
also motorized shades, the control systems

06:43.470 --> 06:45.090
that tie them all together.

06:45.090 --> 06:48.300
One day, we'll be installing the robots in your home

06:48.300 --> 06:51.810
and then coming around to service them when they break,

06:51.810 --> 06:55.533
because at the end of the day, it is technology after all.

06:56.400 --> 06:59.250
So our points of differentiation are, one,

06:59.250 --> 07:03.840
being a national provider and having that brand awareness.

07:03.840 --> 07:08.520
We are the one and only national brand in that space.

07:08.520 --> 07:11.520
And then two, we have an ongoing service

07:11.520 --> 07:14.610
so we're not just installing the technology

07:14.610 --> 07:16.710
and then kind of leaving the resident

07:16.710 --> 07:19.260
or the homeowner to their own devices,

07:19.260 --> 07:21.570
because, again, technology breaks.

07:21.570 --> 07:26.070
Also, the consumer needs evolve and change over time.

07:26.070 --> 07:29.520
And technology evolves, pricing changes.

07:29.520 --> 07:31.140
I mean, we're all here at CES

07:31.140 --> 07:35.190
and it's amazing how technology changes over time

07:35.190 --> 07:37.830
or even in just a few months or in a year.

07:37.830 --> 07:42.830
And so we're there every quarter to help our consumers

07:42.990 --> 07:46.350
as we listen to them, help them with their needs,

07:46.350 --> 07:48.420
fix things when they break,

07:48.420 --> 07:50.520
but then install things over time.

07:50.520 --> 07:53.010
Anyway, so that's Daisy and that's who we are.

07:53.010 --> 07:55.710
And I think I look exactly like my Photoshopped-

07:55.710 --> 07:57.543
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
<v ->Headshot.</v>

07:59.040 --> 08:01.230
<v ->But yeah, I'm very happy to have you here</v>

08:01.230 --> 08:02.940
with us today to discuss this topic.

08:02.940 --> 08:05.160
I think it's extremely timely.

08:05.160 --> 08:07.080
We're seeing a lot of exciting momentum

08:07.080 --> 08:09.060
in multifamily housing, especially kind of when it comes

08:09.060 --> 08:11.070
to retrofitting, what's going on there.

08:11.070 --> 08:14.130
But let's first take a little bit of a step backwards.

08:14.130 --> 08:16.410
So our audience here at CES is maybe a bit different

08:16.410 --> 08:20.490
than our usual, so I would like to, first,

08:20.490 --> 08:22.650
kind of dive into the topic of demand

08:22.650 --> 08:25.380
for smart living and multifamily.

08:25.380 --> 08:29.130
So what are you guys seeing that makes multifamily

08:29.130 --> 08:32.160
kind of a great market to get into when it comes to IoT?

08:32.160 --> 08:33.840
Like what kind of smart solutions

08:33.840 --> 08:35.610
are these owners and operators asking for?

08:35.610 --> 08:36.990
And Hagan, maybe you can kick us off

08:36.990 --> 08:38.583
and we can go kind of this way.

08:39.420 --> 08:43.050
<v ->Sure, I think there's two kind of customers, right?</v>

08:43.050 --> 08:44.940
There's the property manager

08:44.940 --> 08:47.520
and then there's the resident herself.

08:47.520 --> 08:50.640
And so from a property manager perspective,

08:50.640 --> 08:52.530
they're looking for kind of the basics.

08:52.530 --> 08:54.780
And probably, this panel is best suited

08:54.780 --> 08:56.640
to those kinds of questions.

08:56.640 --> 09:00.360
And from our perspective, we can help with those basics.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.310
Then when it comes down to the resident,

09:02.310 --> 09:05.610
that's no different from what the average

09:05.610 --> 09:07.140
homeowner and consumer now.

09:07.140 --> 09:10.380
Daisy today skews more towards the luxury

09:10.380 --> 09:12.000
higher end consumer,

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
but you're seeing everything from television, speaker,

09:17.250 --> 09:21.180
human-centric lighting, the security cameras,

09:21.180 --> 09:24.840
again, which a number of folks on this panel can speak to.

09:24.840 --> 09:27.720
And then something that kind of ties it all together.

09:27.720 --> 09:29.910
The stuff is super complicated.

09:29.910 --> 09:32.190
What we're seeing on average is that,

09:32.190 --> 09:34.350
well, from the Parks research,

09:34.350 --> 09:36.930
and again, these guys can speak to it better than I could.

09:36.930 --> 09:39.840
Jason in the back could speak to it very well,

09:39.840 --> 09:43.200
but is that on average, 22 connected devices

09:43.200 --> 09:46.170
in a customer's home, but that people are more frustrated

09:46.170 --> 09:48.210
and overwhelmed than ever.

09:48.210 --> 09:51.720
So they're really looking not just for the device themself,

09:51.720 --> 09:53.520
but for an ongoing service.

09:53.520 --> 09:57.630
And so those are two of the drivers that we're seeing.

09:57.630 --> 09:59.850
And then from a multifamily perspective,

09:59.850 --> 10:03.300
if you think about who's really drawn to multifamily,

10:03.300 --> 10:07.230
it's going to be a consumer who skews a bit younger,

10:07.230 --> 10:10.260
and those younger consumers are gonna be looking

10:10.260 --> 10:13.890
for kind of the latest and greatest in technology,

10:13.890 --> 10:18.890
the cool television to watch sports on the weekend,

10:19.200 --> 10:20.100
they're gonna be looking

10:20.100 --> 10:23.040
for the latest and greatest in speakers,

10:23.040 --> 10:25.410
something simple on their app.

10:25.410 --> 10:29.100
They're typically gonna be a do-it-for-me type of consumer.

10:29.100 --> 10:33.060
No offense, I don't know if anybody's in this generation,

10:33.060 --> 10:37.290
but they're not really used to installing stuff themselves.

10:37.290 --> 10:38.760
They kind of came out of the womb

10:38.760 --> 10:41.580
with the technology working like for them.

10:41.580 --> 10:45.060
And so they're not going to be installing it for themselves.

10:45.060 --> 10:49.140
There's human-centric technology that's at play here.

10:49.140 --> 10:54.030
So lighting that is working and evolving

10:54.030 --> 10:57.930
with their kind of needs as a human.

10:57.930 --> 11:01.226
And then motorized shades that's in tune

11:01.226 --> 11:03.450
with what's happening outside.

11:03.450 --> 11:07.230
And then if you think about kind of the older consumer,

11:07.230 --> 11:10.830
there's technology that's helping with aging in place

11:10.830 --> 11:12.000
and that's actually working

11:12.000 --> 11:13.620
with kind of their family and friends.

11:13.620 --> 11:16.050
So those are the types of technologies

11:16.050 --> 11:18.720
and the needs of our clients that we're seeing.

11:18.720 --> 11:19.740
<v ->Yes, and certainly,</v>

11:19.740 --> 11:22.050
a lot of different potential use cases,

11:22.050 --> 11:23.550
a lot of different values,

11:23.550 --> 11:26.340
and especially as you're saying with the younger generation

11:26.340 --> 11:30.630
kind of looking for this as an amenity specifically.

11:30.630 --> 11:31.833
<v ->Yeah, so I'd like to,</v>

11:33.090 --> 11:37.140
I'd like to share Hagan's comments a bit

11:37.140 --> 11:41.160
in terms of the buyer types or the customer types.

11:41.160 --> 11:44.100
And certainly, you see that is twofold,

11:44.100 --> 11:48.810
but then behind the customer,

11:48.810 --> 11:52.530
that is the resident, the person that's going

11:52.530 --> 11:55.650
to be living with the technology

11:55.650 --> 11:58.680
and then the property manager

11:58.680 --> 12:01.830
that will be making decisions and installing

12:01.830 --> 12:04.440
and living with the result of that.

12:04.440 --> 12:07.530
I think we have to include the ecosystem

12:07.530 --> 12:09.240
of partnerships that it takes

12:09.240 --> 12:12.930
to be successful in this marketplace.

12:12.930 --> 12:16.383
And so there are challenges on all three sides.

12:18.360 --> 12:19.623
For the consumer,

12:20.790 --> 12:23.730
smart home tech is now becoming somewhat

12:23.730 --> 12:26.520
of an amenity for properties,

12:26.520 --> 12:29.070
they can differentiate with and compete with.

12:29.070 --> 12:33.990
Years ago, it was stainless steel type,

12:33.990 --> 12:36.720
appliances or the flooring

12:36.720 --> 12:38.430
or finishes and things like that.

12:38.430 --> 12:40.560
And now, I agree with you a hundred percent,

12:40.560 --> 12:42.240
the demographic is shifting a little bit more

12:42.240 --> 12:45.600
around the expectation around lifestyle and amenity

12:45.600 --> 12:48.960
and it becomes a show point, it becomes an expectation

12:48.960 --> 12:52.680
and the connectedness to the app and the phone

12:52.680 --> 12:55.800
and what they can do and how it makes their life easier,

12:55.800 --> 12:57.390
they identify with that a little bit more.

12:57.390 --> 12:59.400
Now, I don't know that we're at a tipping point yet,

12:59.400 --> 13:01.533
but certainly, we are,

13:02.700 --> 13:04.260
I heard it mentioned earlier,

13:04.260 --> 13:07.950
we're like on the threshold to the mass market,

13:07.950 --> 13:09.630
and I would agree with that comment.

13:09.630 --> 13:14.040
Now, the challenge for manufacturers like us that sets up

13:14.040 --> 13:17.070
is that for the property manager

13:17.070 --> 13:21.090
and for those customers that that Hagan's team is servicing

13:21.090 --> 13:26.090
and others, what value do we provide then?

13:27.090 --> 13:30.903
Well, again, we're coming at it from an established,

13:32.850 --> 13:34.470
established long-term businesses

13:34.470 --> 13:39.470
as portfolios of products that have been reliably installed

13:39.660 --> 13:42.240
and operating over generations.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.070
So there's higher confidence.

13:44.070 --> 13:47.760
We are a global brand, not just a national brand.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.820
So for these partners, a lot of these big property managers

13:50.820 --> 13:54.150
who are more than regional, they're national and beyond,

13:54.150 --> 13:55.440
they need a partner.

13:55.440 --> 13:58.290
They need a single throat to choke, so to speak,

13:58.290 --> 14:00.090
when it comes to that selection.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.950
And they know that they're gonna be serviced

14:01.950 --> 14:04.680
and there are gonna be minimal callbacks.

14:04.680 --> 14:06.480
In a traditional security market,

14:06.480 --> 14:10.710
we refer to a quality metric known as a truck roll.

14:10.710 --> 14:13.593
Once I do the installation, do I have to go back?

14:14.520 --> 14:19.520
And one of our KPIs is to basically allow that install

14:20.250 --> 14:24.990
to go very fast with high reliability and not have to churn,

14:24.990 --> 14:26.160
not have to get called back.

14:26.160 --> 14:28.710
And so I think one of the property management

14:28.710 --> 14:32.010
challenges today is they're short staffed,

14:32.010 --> 14:35.100
and they have to learn some smart tech.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.810
So how do we make their life easier?

14:36.810 --> 14:38.490
I think that's a second layer.

14:38.490 --> 14:41.400
And third, again, I said is backed up by this ecosystem.

14:41.400 --> 14:44.310
We all have to work together

14:44.310 --> 14:46.710
and partner in a more effective way

14:46.710 --> 14:51.240
to help keep that cost of operation in line

14:51.240 --> 14:54.910
and make it attractive to then

14:55.770 --> 14:59.010
deploy to more sites smart tech, okay?

14:59.010 --> 15:02.214
So it's not just about what the protocol is

15:02.214 --> 15:04.980
or what the device is itself.

15:04.980 --> 15:07.500
It's how it all plays together.

15:07.500 --> 15:10.170
<v ->Yes, and I think one throat to choke is underrated</v>

15:10.170 --> 15:12.030
as a measure of importance.

15:12.030 --> 15:13.860
So we've been hearing from a lot of companies

15:13.860 --> 15:15.510
that that helps them quite a bit.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.420
<v ->Yep, yeah, maybe I'll pivot a little bit</v>

15:18.420 --> 15:21.420
to the market itself, since we have this wider audience.

15:21.420 --> 15:25.770
You saw enterprise smart home in the multifamily industry

15:25.770 --> 15:29.760
really take off in 2019 and into 2020

15:29.760 --> 15:32.880
as COVID really forced adoption

15:32.880 --> 15:35.160
for self-guided tours, right?

15:35.160 --> 15:38.010
Apartment complexes wouldn't need a leasing agent

15:38.010 --> 15:41.280
to show a prospective resident a vacant unit.

15:41.280 --> 15:43.680
They could have technology help 'em out with that.

15:43.680 --> 15:45.060
So we saw it soar, right?

15:45.060 --> 15:47.550
Also during that time, as we all know, low interest rates,

15:47.550 --> 15:50.340
so more properties were bought and sold,

15:50.340 --> 15:52.140
and when properties are bought and sold,

15:52.140 --> 15:55.020
that's a time when investment happens in that property.

15:55.020 --> 15:57.150
As the new investors, the buyer

15:57.150 --> 15:58.500
wants to drive additional revenue,

15:58.500 --> 16:01.260
wants to decrease operational expenses.

16:01.260 --> 16:03.360
And so adoption was soaring.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.640
I would say it's tempered a bit more

16:05.640 --> 16:10.640
because of the size of the market today compared to 2020.

16:11.490 --> 16:15.390
The new construction is hitting records.

16:15.390 --> 16:16.497
However, what, is it half a million,

16:16.497 --> 16:19.290
600,000 new units being built like

16:19.290 --> 16:21.360
compared to the total multifamily market

16:21.360 --> 16:23.280
of 42 million units?

16:23.280 --> 16:25.020
Like you can't match that

16:25.020 --> 16:26.640
by getting adoption up high enough

16:26.640 --> 16:27.473
in new construction.

16:27.473 --> 16:29.040
A new construction, we'll adopt it

16:29.040 --> 16:33.120
at close to the high 80s, 90% range.

16:33.120 --> 16:35.700
But those retrofits, those existing properties

16:35.700 --> 16:39.690
are really the next area of expansion that we see.

16:39.690 --> 16:41.820
<v ->Yes, and I think we've heard rumblings</v>

16:41.820 --> 16:43.440
that with this historic amount

16:43.440 --> 16:44.970
of new inventory hitting the market,

16:44.970 --> 16:48.360
I think it was like a half million in 2024

16:48.360 --> 16:50.940
and then another million expected in 2025,

16:50.940 --> 16:53.760
that is gonna change some of the competitive landscape.

16:53.760 --> 16:56.130
So a lot of companies are looking to retrofits

16:56.130 --> 16:57.150
and kind of different ways

16:57.150 --> 17:00.540
of making this make financial sense for them.

17:00.540 --> 17:02.220
<v ->Yeah, and interest rates changing, right?</v>

17:02.220 --> 17:03.540
So interest rates changing,

17:03.540 --> 17:06.690
those that got low interest rates in 2020 are gonna be,

17:06.690 --> 17:08.640
some of those are variable that are being forced out here

17:08.640 --> 17:09.960
in the next couple years.

17:09.960 --> 17:12.150
You'll have more transactionings happening

17:12.150 --> 17:14.450
that'll drive that increased adoption as well.

17:17.760 --> 17:18.810
<v ->Eric, any thoughts?</v>

17:18.810 --> 17:20.910
<v ->Yeah, I mean, so to jump off of that as well,</v>

17:20.910 --> 17:23.490
I mean, it's interesting what you say about retrofit.

17:23.490 --> 17:25.320
Kwikset Unite, which is our new electronic

17:25.320 --> 17:27.840
access control platform, was designed primarily

17:27.840 --> 17:30.180
for new construction, because Kwikset first and foremost

17:30.180 --> 17:33.420
really is a company built on its relationships,

17:33.420 --> 17:35.250
from the largest builders in the country

17:35.250 --> 17:38.190
to a lot of the kind of successful local businessmen.

17:38.190 --> 17:39.210
But what we're seeing more and more

17:39.210 --> 17:40.950
is even with interest rates coming down,

17:40.950 --> 17:43.170
housing markets in the single family are still wild.

17:43.170 --> 17:45.600
So it's one of those things of how are they able

17:45.600 --> 17:49.230
to justify rents in these multifamily units,

17:49.230 --> 17:51.000
given that there are so many out there now?

17:51.000 --> 17:53.070
So renovations are definitely increasing,

17:53.070 --> 17:54.810
and to kind of pivot as well

17:54.810 --> 17:57.570
to the overarching market and demand,

17:57.570 --> 17:59.370
one of the biggest things I say about multifamily

17:59.370 --> 18:03.030
and multifamily access control as a solution,

18:03.030 --> 18:04.560
really the differentiation point

18:04.560 --> 18:08.010
between a commercial access control system and multifamily,

18:08.010 --> 18:09.000
it's just the level of training

18:09.000 --> 18:10.830
that the users are going to have coming into it.

18:10.830 --> 18:13.800
So for us, really, the focus is on ease of use

18:13.800 --> 18:15.840
and understanding how it kind of meets the market

18:15.840 --> 18:17.100
and meets our customers,

18:17.100 --> 18:18.930
both on the property management side

18:18.930 --> 18:21.570
and as Hagan was saying, on the resident side as well

18:21.570 --> 18:23.190
and how it kind of fits into their life.

18:23.190 --> 18:24.810
So that level of training

18:24.810 --> 18:25.980
and kind of understanding

18:25.980 --> 18:28.230
where multifamily access control sits

18:28.230 --> 18:31.470
within this wider realm of commercial enterprise

18:31.470 --> 18:34.050
all the way down to multifamily is really something

18:34.050 --> 18:36.000
that we've been focusing on as well.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.590
<v ->Yes, and then kind of like you were saying,</v>

18:37.590 --> 18:41.220
like Hagan was saying, there is a lot of learning, I think,

18:41.220 --> 18:42.390
on the part of property staff

18:42.390 --> 18:43.980
and how to actually manage these things

18:43.980 --> 18:45.540
and get them to work properly.

18:45.540 --> 18:46.980
So how do you navigate that

18:46.980 --> 18:49.320
and how do you make it like dead simple for somebody

18:49.320 --> 18:51.600
who might have only had a week of training to-

18:51.600 --> 18:53.580
<v ->Yeah, there's this continued trade off</v>

18:53.580 --> 18:56.549
between all the security in the world versus ease of use.

18:56.549 --> 19:00.090
The more customization, then the more options you have.

19:00.090 --> 19:02.280
And inherently, the more security you have,

19:02.280 --> 19:03.420
the harder it is to use.

19:03.420 --> 19:06.300
So opening it up and understanding at what level

19:06.300 --> 19:09.180
within that user hierarchy do you expose functionality

19:09.180 --> 19:10.590
has really been a big focus for us,

19:10.590 --> 19:12.390
and it's something that we've really seen

19:12.390 --> 19:14.610
people struggle with as a barrier of entry

19:14.610 --> 19:16.230
within multifamily as well.

19:16.230 --> 19:17.580
<v ->And you add to that, the turnover</v>

19:17.580 --> 19:18.780
is high on property, right?

19:18.780 --> 19:20.130
So leasing staff to agents,

19:20.130 --> 19:21.660
the maintenance team members are turning over,

19:21.660 --> 19:23.610
so training becomes even more paramount.

19:23.610 --> 19:27.000
<v ->Yeah, our bread and butter is suburbanized garden style,</v>

19:27.000 --> 19:28.890
and what we'll see is within the first 10 years,

19:28.890 --> 19:31.090
that site may trade hand four or five times.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.970
<v ->So there's a lot of headwinds in this dynamic market</v>

19:35.970 --> 19:37.380
for multifamily right now.

19:37.380 --> 19:40.770
Used to underwrite this smart home technology

19:40.770 --> 19:42.270
maybe as an amenity,

19:42.270 --> 19:44.310
maybe it's a technology fee, right?

19:44.310 --> 19:45.960
For the lease, for the residents.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.960
Retention is an issue in multifamily site.

19:48.960 --> 19:50.970
Teams are churning over at a higher rate

19:50.970 --> 19:53.880
than they've seen in the last 10, 15 years.

19:53.880 --> 19:57.480
Fed rates are high, more supply in the market.

19:57.480 --> 20:00.750
So if you're an owner in a multifamily environment

20:00.750 --> 20:03.330
trying to compete, trying to be successful,

20:03.330 --> 20:06.027
it's a new paradigm as we look into 2025,

20:06.027 --> 20:08.430
and the paradigm comes full circle

20:08.430 --> 20:11.490
into how well am I operating this community

20:11.490 --> 20:13.200
from an efficiency standpoint?

20:13.200 --> 20:16.020
Am I delivering a premium resident experience?

20:16.020 --> 20:20.823
Am I being efficient on the tackling and blocking on site?

20:22.320 --> 20:24.120
Sort of the natural conclusion

20:24.120 --> 20:26.070
of this thought process isn't,

20:26.070 --> 20:27.630
is it Matter or Z-Wave,

20:27.630 --> 20:30.840
or these standards that all of us talk about

20:30.840 --> 20:31.960
from a smart home perspective.

20:31.960 --> 20:35.490
It's more about the magic of what is this technology

20:35.490 --> 20:38.190
delivering to me from an enablement standpoint?

20:38.190 --> 20:40.530
Is it working well in my ecosystem

20:40.530 --> 20:42.060
of my business stack as an owner.

20:42.060 --> 20:46.260
I may be working with 15 different vendors at this property.

20:46.260 --> 20:48.690
How seamless does this access control?

20:48.690 --> 20:52.560
Does this security, does this in-home IoT

20:52.560 --> 20:56.460
allow me to sort of leverage as a differentiation point?

20:56.460 --> 20:59.130
It has become an expectation for residents, I think,

20:59.130 --> 21:02.190
to have these type of technologies onsite,

21:02.190 --> 21:03.660
but it's also becoming an expectation

21:03.660 --> 21:06.420
for the onsite staff as well.

21:06.420 --> 21:08.970
Why go to the key track when I can use my phone?

21:08.970 --> 21:11.400
If I can save one to two minutes,

21:11.400 --> 21:12.660
you know what this industry really needs

21:12.660 --> 21:14.940
is scalability in their solutions.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.040
If I save the one to two minutes, that one work order,

21:17.040 --> 21:19.260
I can do that across a hundred thousand units

21:19.260 --> 21:21.000
and a million work orders.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.173
That's where this technology's gonna be

21:23.173 --> 21:24.330
transformational in 2025.

21:24.330 --> 21:27.060
<v ->I think, Braeden, you've raised a very interesting point.</v>

21:27.060 --> 21:30.630
So how are these companies measuring the effectiveness

21:30.630 --> 21:32.310
of these solutions and kind of what is driving

21:32.310 --> 21:33.143
the interest there?

21:33.143 --> 21:34.800
So you mentioned kinda with access control,

21:34.800 --> 21:36.960
looking at kind of reducing the time it takes

21:36.960 --> 21:39.027
to get work orders, and of course there's benefits there

21:39.027 --> 21:42.780
and not have to have maintenance go pickup keys.

21:42.780 --> 21:43.950
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

21:43.950 --> 21:46.830
The level of detail this industry pays

21:46.830 --> 21:50.070
to the most minute operational things on site

21:50.070 --> 21:52.140
is honestly impressive.

21:52.140 --> 21:53.790
We have customers of ours

21:53.790 --> 21:55.620
that look at their entire field structure

21:55.620 --> 21:58.410
and they will be tracking the time it takes for you

21:58.410 --> 22:00.783
just to re-key a lock on move out.

22:01.770 --> 22:04.620
That one task, they're tracking that across

22:04.620 --> 22:07.350
potentially 120,000 apartment homes.

22:07.350 --> 22:08.700
Why do they track that?

22:08.700 --> 22:11.580
Well, again, it comes back to this position they're in

22:11.580 --> 22:13.890
trying to compete in a local market

22:13.890 --> 22:16.350
where maybe there's brand new supply,

22:16.350 --> 22:17.820
they can't raise their rents.

22:17.820 --> 22:20.730
And so the way they're looking at the underwriting

22:20.730 --> 22:23.520
and the performance of the smart technology

22:23.520 --> 22:26.430
boils down to NOI, it boils down to OPEX,

22:26.430 --> 22:28.320
and it's gonna come back to how much time

22:28.320 --> 22:31.230
and efficiency are we creating through these programs.

22:31.230 --> 22:32.520
And that's not just on the back

22:32.520 --> 22:33.720
of house maintenance side of things.

22:33.720 --> 22:36.540
You're gonna see that in leasing as well.

22:36.540 --> 22:38.430
How fast can we get from where we're at

22:38.430 --> 22:41.760
to that prospect and that prospect go around that community,

22:41.760 --> 22:44.220
engage with us, ask us questions efficiently?

22:44.220 --> 22:47.190
These are little metrics that they're gonna be exposing

22:47.190 --> 22:49.860
not just at a property level, but at a regional level.

22:49.860 --> 22:51.060
And they're gonna be looking back

22:51.060 --> 22:53.827
at the technology partners of theirs to say,

22:53.827 --> 22:55.650
"Okay, are you doing what you need to do

22:55.650 --> 22:58.590
to pass me the right data from one partner to another,

22:58.590 --> 23:01.860
so that way, we can look at this information and assess,

23:01.860 --> 23:04.860
do we have the right investment thesis with you

23:04.860 --> 23:08.400
from one property to potentially the entire portfolio?"

23:08.400 --> 23:09.990
<v ->Yes, and from what we've been hearing,</v>

23:09.990 --> 23:12.870
they do like to run these pilot projects,

23:12.870 --> 23:15.217
so really measuring as much data as they can and say,

23:15.217 --> 23:16.980
"Okay, does it make financial sense for me

23:16.980 --> 23:18.810
to take this solution and roll it out

23:18.810 --> 23:20.880
maybe across my whole portfolio?"

23:20.880 --> 23:21.713
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

23:21.713 --> 23:25.560
I think the barrier to entry for technologies

23:25.560 --> 23:27.900
to sort of get adoption in multifamily

23:27.900 --> 23:29.700
is gonna continue to increase.

23:29.700 --> 23:32.520
The scrutiny that you have in the first one

23:32.520 --> 23:35.160
to two to three properties is gonna be higher

23:35.160 --> 23:37.560
because they're trying to sort of

23:37.560 --> 23:38.760
put you in different environments.

23:38.760 --> 23:41.310
You're gonna be maybe at a mid-rise,

23:41.310 --> 23:43.020
looking at different problem statements there,

23:43.020 --> 23:44.970
and they're gonna expose you to that garden style

23:44.970 --> 23:47.040
in completely different part of the country.

23:47.040 --> 23:48.270
They're gonna expose you to the high rise.

23:48.270 --> 23:49.410
And the reason why they wanna do that

23:49.410 --> 23:51.840
is to see the versatility of your solution,

23:51.840 --> 23:53.670
how you work from an integration standpoint

23:53.670 --> 23:56.880
with your partners, how well you can go and meet the needs,

23:56.880 --> 23:59.910
the go-to market perspective of what's happening on site

23:59.910 --> 24:01.920
with their residents and their site teams.

24:01.920 --> 24:05.130
And if they can model that well in a small echo chamber

24:05.130 --> 24:08.100
and it takes them perhaps three, maybe four quarters,

24:08.100 --> 24:10.740
I mean, this is a little bit of a lengthy process.

24:10.740 --> 24:12.360
Once they can feel confident

24:12.360 --> 24:15.090
that this is a scalable solution,

24:15.090 --> 24:16.470
then the turnkey happens,

24:16.470 --> 24:18.390
and now there may be an underwriting decision

24:18.390 --> 24:19.567
at the corporate level to say,

24:19.567 --> 24:22.260
"Let's bring this at a broader adoption point."

24:22.260 --> 24:24.300
<v ->That's a great point because this is the first time</v>

24:24.300 --> 24:25.620
that most of these clients

24:25.620 --> 24:27.510
are adopting this kind of technology, right?

24:27.510 --> 24:29.730
And to your point, they measure everything

24:29.730 --> 24:31.230
to the minute detail.

24:31.230 --> 24:33.210
And so if it's something that they've done in the past,

24:33.210 --> 24:35.160
they've got processes at the wazoo

24:35.160 --> 24:36.300
that they're gonna follow.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.010
They know exactly what play to run

24:38.010 --> 24:39.690
and how to run it and who to run it with.

24:39.690 --> 24:41.130
With this, it's brand new.

24:41.130 --> 24:42.480
It's something that they haven't used before.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.520
So you see that through the sales process,

24:44.520 --> 24:45.510
through the install process,

24:45.510 --> 24:47.610
through the account management process,

24:47.610 --> 24:50.160
that there's so many different departments involved,

24:50.160 --> 24:53.550
whether it's HR, IT, operations, sales

24:53.550 --> 24:55.620
from your client that I think it's up to the integrators

24:55.620 --> 24:57.870
to help provide a lot of this as well, right?

24:57.870 --> 24:59.250
Help providing the data that they need

24:59.250 --> 25:01.320
to make decisions for future properties.

25:01.320 --> 25:03.210
<v ->Being able to get it right from the beginning</v>

25:03.210 --> 25:04.410
has been really essential for us.

25:04.410 --> 25:05.310
One of the things that we've seen

25:05.310 --> 25:06.600
is most of our customer base

25:06.600 --> 25:08.340
is coming from mechanical mindset.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.500
So once they make that switch,

25:10.500 --> 25:12.240
if they don't get it right in the first few months,

25:12.240 --> 25:14.010
they're just gonna go back to mechanical.

25:14.010 --> 25:15.060
They don't wanna roll trucks,

25:15.060 --> 25:16.230
they don't wanna pay for keying,

25:16.230 --> 25:19.320
but they also have to be comfortable right off the bat.

25:19.320 --> 25:21.330
And to your point, scalability is one of the biggest things

25:21.330 --> 25:22.590
that we've been seeing as well.

25:22.590 --> 25:25.140
I mean, relatively basic on the garden style,

25:25.140 --> 25:27.150
but as you scale up, the costs scale up,

25:27.150 --> 25:28.230
the complexity scales up,

25:28.230 --> 25:30.480
and that's something you need to meet for as well.

25:30.480 --> 25:32.550
<v ->And Greg, what are you seeing at Johnson Controls</v>

25:32.550 --> 25:33.540
in terms of kind of how

25:33.540 --> 25:35.400
people are evaluating these solutions

25:35.400 --> 25:36.950
and what they're interested in?

25:37.890 --> 25:39.660
<v ->You're saying automating solutions?</v>

25:39.660 --> 25:41.370
<v ->How are they evaluating?</v>

25:41.370 --> 25:43.320
<v ->Oh, the value add, for sure.</v>

25:43.320 --> 25:46.500
Well, certainly, I think the perceived value

25:46.500 --> 25:49.590
of having a secured home and then extending that out

25:49.590 --> 25:51.900
into automated services

25:51.900 --> 25:54.750
and being able to do that within a common ecosystem

25:54.750 --> 25:56.430
and having a great selection to do that

25:56.430 --> 25:58.620
from a partnering standpoint,

25:58.620 --> 26:02.640
that, to us, is a very obvious immediate adjacent market.

26:02.640 --> 26:04.500
They already have confidence in the brand,

26:04.500 --> 26:09.500
they have confidence in the viability of the solution

26:10.410 --> 26:12.840
and the market segments that we cover.

26:12.840 --> 26:17.840
So for us adding locks, adding some of the other features

26:18.060 --> 26:20.550
are an extension of that.

26:20.550 --> 26:22.260
We consider that more automation

26:22.260 --> 26:27.260
so that you can control more of the climate and other items.

26:27.840 --> 26:31.410
Beyond that, perimeter security's big.

26:31.410 --> 26:33.330
Access control out at the perimeter.

26:33.330 --> 26:38.220
So we have a specialized technology that can address that.

26:38.220 --> 26:41.760
And again, being a multinational brand

26:41.760 --> 26:45.580
that can provide that for us has been

26:46.980 --> 26:50.550
probably one of the more attractive elements

26:50.550 --> 26:52.650
that we have in these conversations

26:52.650 --> 26:55.263
in terms of delivering value as a manufacturer.

26:56.100 --> 26:57.630
<v ->Yes, and I think we've been hearing</v>

26:57.630 --> 26:59.640
a ton of demand for access control,

26:59.640 --> 27:02.850
and access control oftentimes is the tip of the sphere

27:02.850 --> 27:05.943
for kind of a more widespread deployment of technologies.

27:07.080 --> 27:09.990
So Hagan, so we've been talking a little bit about

27:09.990 --> 27:12.660
kind of what companies are looking for

27:12.660 --> 27:14.010
when it comes to deploying solutions,

27:14.010 --> 27:15.960
but when it comes to like actually deploying them,

27:15.960 --> 27:17.790
so rolling them out, what are some things

27:17.790 --> 27:19.410
that kind of companies should keep in mind

27:19.410 --> 27:21.180
and kinda product makers should think about

27:21.180 --> 27:22.743
when designing the solutions?

27:24.810 --> 27:29.430
<v ->Yeah, I think it's just about meeting the needs</v>

27:29.430 --> 27:31.320
of that end consumer.

27:31.320 --> 27:34.260
I don't think that we should necessarily

27:34.260 --> 27:37.023
dumb down the solutions necessarily.

27:38.190 --> 27:40.530
What we advise property managers,

27:40.530 --> 27:43.950
or if we're developing a new build,

27:43.950 --> 27:47.130
is just to think about simplifying

27:47.130 --> 27:52.130
or working on boiler plate, kind of standard templates,

27:52.200 --> 27:54.720
and then we can work with the resident.

27:54.720 --> 27:56.610
And for us, it's a gift.

27:56.610 --> 28:00.690
So we can have residents who we can partner with

28:00.690 --> 28:03.450
to develop customized solutions.

28:03.450 --> 28:07.260
And so that way, we can develop wire,

28:07.260 --> 28:09.420
partner with OEMs to make sure

28:09.420 --> 28:13.200
that there is a whole integrated solution

28:13.200 --> 28:17.700
that's going to work really well for the property manager.

28:17.700 --> 28:21.120
And then just because of we're a national brand

28:21.120 --> 28:26.120
and because we have the backing of our brand behind Daisy,

28:26.700 --> 28:29.040
they know that they can count on us

28:29.040 --> 28:32.610
to be there for not just the lifetime of the build project,

28:32.610 --> 28:35.370
but the lifetime of each resident

28:35.370 --> 28:40.143
and the residents that come after, as there's turnover.

28:41.400 --> 28:44.820
Our company actually loves truck rolls,

28:44.820 --> 28:47.580
so we're very different, I think,

28:47.580 --> 28:52.580
from how probably companies before us in home services

28:54.900 --> 28:59.520
and also in some of the supply chain side

28:59.520 --> 29:00.660
or manufacturer side

29:00.660 --> 29:03.210
has probably thought about this industry.

29:03.210 --> 29:06.930
And so if you think about multifamily, even better.

29:06.930 --> 29:09.390
So we're building out route density,

29:09.390 --> 29:10.770
we're building out density

29:10.770 --> 29:12.660
as we build out this brand nationally.

29:12.660 --> 29:14.820
So in the single family side,

29:14.820 --> 29:16.530
we can go from home to home to home

29:16.530 --> 29:19.200
and do kind of a 30-minute system checkup.

29:19.200 --> 29:20.340
We do this for free.

29:20.340 --> 29:23.460
It's 30 minutes just to checkup and see,

29:23.460 --> 29:25.350
how is your system performing?

29:25.350 --> 29:28.260
And from there, there may be a service call,

29:28.260 --> 29:30.540
there just may be a broken remote control,

29:30.540 --> 29:32.460
babies step on remote controls,

29:32.460 --> 29:35.010
and those need to be troubleshooted,

29:35.010 --> 29:38.280
but there also could be some speakers

29:38.280 --> 29:41.493
that you need to be installed by a putting green.

29:42.510 --> 29:45.153
Don't we all have those challenges in life?

29:46.050 --> 29:47.850
So that happens as well.

29:47.850 --> 29:50.940
Well, as we look at the multifamily space,

29:50.940 --> 29:54.540
talk about density, we park a truck,

29:54.540 --> 29:58.710
we can certainly work on servicing a whole building

29:58.710 --> 30:03.710
and help our OEMs and improve kind of the NPS scores

30:05.370 --> 30:10.140
and kind of the satisfaction and the brand awareness

30:10.140 --> 30:13.650
and make sure that there's good quality

30:13.650 --> 30:16.740
just from the fact that they're maintained over time.

30:16.740 --> 30:20.310
We can also ensure that customers

30:20.310 --> 30:22.980
have good knowledge and education

30:22.980 --> 30:25.680
over the time of the lifetime of those brands.

30:25.680 --> 30:28.720
So those are some of the trends that we're seeing

30:30.551 --> 30:33.483
from residents and also from property managers.

30:36.660 --> 30:38.040
<v ->Right, and then Eric,</v>

30:38.040 --> 30:40.470
I'm gonna pick on you a little bit more.

30:40.470 --> 30:43.350
So you were mentioning, I think the way Kwikset

30:43.350 --> 30:44.850
was looking at kind of retrofitting

30:44.850 --> 30:48.210
and deploying its smart locks into different properties,

30:48.210 --> 30:51.450
so making sure that they would work even without wifi.

30:51.450 --> 30:53.040
We've been hearing from a lot of properties

30:53.040 --> 30:55.080
that wifi has been a big challenge

30:55.080 --> 30:56.010
when it comes to retrofitting

30:56.010 --> 30:58.350
just because it can be very costly

30:58.350 --> 30:59.580
to build out those networks

30:59.580 --> 31:02.460
depending on how the property was constructed.

31:02.460 --> 31:04.830
<v ->Yeah, it's been interesting as we've gone out,</v>

31:04.830 --> 31:08.370
and with ASSA ABLOY, we have the advantage of having

31:08.370 --> 31:10.890
a pretty thorough spec writing team

31:10.890 --> 31:13.710
in addition to what we have with our sales team at Kwikset.

31:13.710 --> 31:15.720
As we've gone out and we've interacted with customers,

31:15.720 --> 31:19.620
kind of understanding what their needs are from the offset,

31:19.620 --> 31:22.170
if you're coming into a retrofit situation, it's challenging

31:22.170 --> 31:25.200
because the networks are there, the infrastructure's there,

31:25.200 --> 31:26.580
and convincing people to upgrade

31:26.580 --> 31:28.470
that can be quite challenging.

31:28.470 --> 31:31.380
Our solution is offline-based, so we are able to have

31:31.380 --> 31:34.200
a cloud based infrastructure that passes data through

31:34.200 --> 31:35.430
from the phone down to the lock,

31:35.430 --> 31:37.680
and the lock is independent of the network.

31:37.680 --> 31:39.720
But what we're seeing in a lot of new construction

31:39.720 --> 31:42.810
is this demand for these full service,

31:42.810 --> 31:46.650
the SmartRents, the ADTs, these recurring revenue services

31:46.650 --> 31:49.020
that offer this value that justifies that.

31:49.020 --> 31:51.510
And being able for us to integrate with them

31:51.510 --> 31:53.130
has been very helpful for us.

31:53.130 --> 31:55.560
But understanding and kind of communicating

31:55.560 --> 31:58.500
to the sites that, depending on the network

31:58.500 --> 32:01.710
connectivity you need, some of the expectations

32:01.710 --> 32:03.330
that you have for what you're gonna deliver

32:03.330 --> 32:04.560
may not be realistic.

32:04.560 --> 32:07.230
So understanding that for the suburbanized garden style

32:07.230 --> 32:08.820
that we really compete in,

32:08.820 --> 32:10.440
do you really want a router on every floor?

32:10.440 --> 32:11.460
Are you really gonna pay for this

32:11.460 --> 32:13.170
when your rents may not offset it,

32:13.170 --> 32:14.340
versus a mixed use

32:14.340 --> 32:16.830
or a mid-rise where you really can have that?

32:16.830 --> 32:18.750
It's all education and working with the customers

32:18.750 --> 32:22.200
and understanding really what their needs are as well.

32:22.200 --> 32:23.460
<v ->Yeah, so those needs, yeah,</v>

32:23.460 --> 32:25.440
as you're saying, can be different depending on

32:25.440 --> 32:27.510
certainly the building type, how old the building is,

32:27.510 --> 32:30.543
what it's made of, all those factor in.

32:32.340 --> 32:35.514
<v ->Also, what problems are they trying to solve?</v>

32:35.514 --> 32:39.480
What is their overall goal in the experience

32:39.480 --> 32:40.590
and the brand they're trying to have

32:40.590 --> 32:41.670
to their residents on site.

32:41.670 --> 32:44.370
And I think that's where you have to absolutely just meet

32:44.370 --> 32:47.250
that customer where they're at that community.

32:47.250 --> 32:49.290
It's community by community.

32:49.290 --> 32:51.120
And when you think about it in those terms,

32:51.120 --> 32:53.370
what you ultimately want to create is just optionality.

32:53.370 --> 32:54.750
You wanna be flexible.

32:54.750 --> 32:57.480
Perhaps at a certain community, you will be using wifi.

32:57.480 --> 32:59.670
If that's there, that's a goal they have,

32:59.670 --> 33:01.860
but perhaps you'll be using different technology

33:01.860 --> 33:04.290
that rolls back on cell or Bluetooth.

33:04.290 --> 33:06.390
The point is to have versatility.

33:06.390 --> 33:07.890
And when you're thinking about deployment

33:07.890 --> 33:09.840
into this multifamily environment,

33:09.840 --> 33:11.520
if you have that versatility,

33:11.520 --> 33:13.440
then it comes down to what's the experience

33:13.440 --> 33:15.930
ultimately to the end user.

33:15.930 --> 33:17.670
And that's where, at the end of the day,

33:17.670 --> 33:20.700
all of this technology is just an enabler

33:20.700 --> 33:24.090
to the software experiences you create for the resident,

33:24.090 --> 33:25.440
for the site team.

33:25.440 --> 33:28.020
You can have a white glove around how you train them,

33:28.020 --> 33:30.270
how you set certain expectations,

33:30.270 --> 33:31.710
but you never want to be in a position

33:31.710 --> 33:33.540
where to solve a problem,

33:33.540 --> 33:36.180
you have to now spear horn into this conversation

33:36.180 --> 33:38.970
a 'let's go and run' in a really expensive circuit

33:38.970 --> 33:41.910
to your community because it has to be wifi.

33:41.910 --> 33:43.770
Well, it doesn't have to be that.

33:43.770 --> 33:46.980
If their problem was I just wanna deliver

33:46.980 --> 33:48.870
a moving experience so my residents

33:48.870 --> 33:52.140
can have smart thermostats, have versatility

33:52.140 --> 33:53.490
and meet them where they're at.

33:53.490 --> 33:54.810
<v ->It's like you've talked about,</v>

33:54.810 --> 33:56.970
the customer base out there is not asking

33:56.970 --> 33:58.890
for specific technologies most of the time.

33:58.890 --> 34:00.570
It's what they're able to enable.

34:00.570 --> 34:02.970
And what you were talking about, Hagan, as well,

34:02.970 --> 34:05.580
that demand pole generation from the resident base,

34:05.580 --> 34:07.050
we get a lot of the inverse at Kwikset

34:07.050 --> 34:09.360
where our property management and our system integrators

34:09.360 --> 34:11.430
kind of tell us what they need for the residents.

34:11.430 --> 34:13.080
It's one of the unique things with multifamily

34:13.080 --> 34:14.520
that just has to be planned for.

34:14.520 --> 34:17.130
You have this dynamic customer client model

34:17.130 --> 34:19.440
where the people who are using it every day may

34:19.440 --> 34:20.610
not be the people who are buying it.

34:20.610 --> 34:22.800
I mean, the purchasing decision for multifamily

34:22.800 --> 34:24.120
is not on the residents.

34:24.120 --> 34:26.310
And even though the residents are using it every day,

34:26.310 --> 34:28.020
they're not the ones that are paying for it.

34:28.020 --> 34:30.570
So being able to meet both sides of that market

34:30.570 --> 34:32.640
with a single solution, it's inherently challenged,

34:32.640 --> 34:35.130
but it's the thing we're all kind of going around here.

34:35.130 --> 34:35.963
<v ->Yeah, and I think you notice</v>

34:35.963 --> 34:38.370
that we've all kind of talked about in some way

34:38.370 --> 34:41.070
a multi customer that we're approaching, right?

34:41.070 --> 34:43.800
Whether it's the resident, the property staff, the owner,

34:43.800 --> 34:45.570
there's one that we've kind of left off the list,

34:45.570 --> 34:48.210
I feel like, which is the technician.

34:48.210 --> 34:49.980
And so for those that are designing products,

34:49.980 --> 34:52.050
like this needs to be a fast install, right?

34:52.050 --> 34:54.900
This can't be something that you're on site in a unit

34:54.900 --> 34:57.600
for eight hours trying to learn in a device

34:57.600 --> 35:00.870
or program a hub, like the expense of doing this

35:00.870 --> 35:03.000
for both the property and the integrator,

35:03.000 --> 35:06.390
they need to be able to turn over units rather quickly.

35:06.390 --> 35:09.030
And so be able to create that experience for the technician

35:09.030 --> 35:10.170
to be able to install quickly,

35:10.170 --> 35:12.270
move on to the next unit is very important.

35:12.270 --> 35:14.970
<v ->Yeah, that's where that kind of boilerplate,</v>

35:14.970 --> 35:17.010
having kind of the basic template

35:17.010 --> 35:19.950
for every unit would really work well.

35:19.950 --> 35:23.190
And then I'm just thinking of one example

35:23.190 --> 35:24.690
just out of my hat.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.880
Like Daisy, for example, could come in

35:26.880 --> 35:28.828
and then customize.
<v ->I've heard of Daisy.</v>

35:28.828 --> 35:31.261
<v ->Well. (laughs)</v>

35:31.261 --> 35:33.510
<v ->Yeah, so we have one question left</v>

35:33.510 --> 35:34.680
in just a couple of minutes.

35:34.680 --> 35:37.320
Maybe we could do kinda like Daniel did in our last session,

35:37.320 --> 35:39.180
just a lightning round.

35:39.180 --> 35:43.050
So what do you think is on the roadmap for 2025?

35:43.050 --> 35:44.490
What are you most excited about?

35:44.490 --> 35:46.260
And maybe two sentences each.

35:46.260 --> 35:48.090
Hagan, if you can kick us off again.

35:48.090 --> 35:49.980
<v ->Oh, I'm really excited.</v>

35:49.980 --> 35:54.240
I think I've already talked about services,

35:54.240 --> 35:58.080
and so kind of being there for the customer,

35:58.080 --> 36:03.060
helping kind of the OEMs out in terms of brand

36:03.060 --> 36:05.640
and ensuring that we're there for customers

36:05.640 --> 36:10.290
when they need us and having that ongoing services.

36:10.290 --> 36:12.180
And whether they're a multi-family resident,

36:12.180 --> 36:14.430
I think most of the innovation

36:14.430 --> 36:16.260
is actually probably coming from residents

36:16.260 --> 36:17.880
of these multifamily businesses.

36:17.880 --> 36:22.110
So listening them and going back to manufacturers

36:22.110 --> 36:25.773
and saying, "Hey, we've got some pretty cool ideas here."

36:25.773 --> 36:27.723
I'm really excited about that.

36:28.860 --> 36:32.370
<v ->Yeah, I think for us, it's gonna be a very exciting year,</v>

36:32.370 --> 36:34.270
and I'll try to keep this super brief.

36:38.250 --> 36:39.570
It's kind of our mainstream panel.

36:39.570 --> 36:44.280
We have restyled, if you will, for the multifamily market.

36:44.280 --> 36:47.040
We're coming out with a brand new line of automation

36:47.040 --> 36:49.500
to allow additional lighting control

36:49.500 --> 36:51.300
and several other things.

36:51.300 --> 36:54.420
So we've got a portfolio that's been under development

36:54.420 --> 36:55.890
that's begun deploying,

36:55.890 --> 36:58.800
and we're super excited about that.

36:58.800 --> 37:02.730
And we're talking about protocols and everything else.

37:02.730 --> 37:04.590
This thing is a rock concert of radios.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.420
It is dual path connected to the cloud.

37:06.420 --> 37:10.140
I could go on and on and on, but that's it.

37:10.140 --> 37:13.200
Now, the other thing and kind of the compliment to it

37:13.200 --> 37:15.810
is the customer experience.

37:15.810 --> 37:18.960
And I was gonna piggyback onto John's comment a moment ago,

37:18.960 --> 37:20.970
but the technician, the person that's installing

37:20.970 --> 37:23.760
and servicing the CX

37:23.760 --> 37:27.720
that they experienced for a fast install,

37:27.720 --> 37:29.940
and there were some very unique challenges

37:29.940 --> 37:31.890
in the multifamily space,

37:31.890 --> 37:34.080
with mesh devices and everything else.

37:34.080 --> 37:37.770
We've poured a lot of effort into that to make it

37:37.770 --> 37:41.430
very, very cool and very fast

37:41.430 --> 37:42.840
to keep that operating cost low.

37:42.840 --> 37:45.003
So just plenty.

37:45.990 --> 37:49.620
Hopefully, we'll be able to connect with folks at the,

37:49.620 --> 37:52.530
everybody's gonna be coming to the happy hour later,

37:52.530 --> 37:53.730
but we could go on.

37:53.730 --> 37:55.230
I'll leave it at that, yeah.

37:55.230 --> 37:56.063
It's good to hear.

37:56.063 --> 37:57.090
<v ->So is the happy hour the thing</v>

37:57.090 --> 37:59.520
you're looking forward to most in 2025?

37:59.520 --> 38:00.993
<v ->Certainly, yeah.</v>

38:02.160 --> 38:03.780
Every journey begins with one step,

38:03.780 --> 38:06.693
and that step begins at about, what, 6:00 PM tonight.

38:09.540 --> 38:13.230
<v ->Look, macroeconomically, I'm just excited for the market,</v>

38:13.230 --> 38:15.240
going back to kind of the way it was in the past

38:15.240 --> 38:18.660
with interest from just transactions overall increasing.

38:18.660 --> 38:20.313
From an ADT standpoint,

38:21.570 --> 38:25.140
we're relaunching our own multifamily platform.

38:25.140 --> 38:28.530
It's dedicated directly to multifamily users.

38:28.530 --> 38:31.230
And so it's not just the traditional ADT product

38:31.230 --> 38:34.080
with a paint of multifamily slab on it.

38:34.080 --> 38:36.000
It's built for this client base

38:36.000 --> 38:37.590
that we've been discussing today.

38:37.590 --> 38:39.870
And it includes a level of mobile security.

38:39.870 --> 38:41.820
So it's a security that can go with you

38:41.820 --> 38:44.490
if you're a leasing agent or if you're a resident,

38:44.490 --> 38:46.500
and you have an SOS button that'll connect you

38:46.500 --> 38:48.930
to an ADT monitoring agent.

38:48.930 --> 38:51.660
So it's a stability for us to connect

38:51.660 --> 38:54.720
and protect folks wherever they are, not just on site,

38:54.720 --> 38:57.120
and build that sense of community for that resident

38:57.120 --> 38:58.530
through that service that we provide.

38:58.530 --> 39:01.200
So shout out to Ashley Etwine who runs our product

39:01.200 --> 39:03.450
and engineering team for all that good stuff.

39:04.290 --> 39:06.690
<v ->Yeah, and selfishly from our side,</v>

39:06.690 --> 39:08.880
I mean, Kwikset's a lock company, right?

39:08.880 --> 39:12.090
But our Kwikset Unite portfolio, we developed this

39:12.090 --> 39:15.120
with a very thorough software and cloud ecosystem

39:15.120 --> 39:17.520
that we only expose a little bit of it.

39:17.520 --> 39:21.450
So as we come into '25, understanding from the market

39:21.450 --> 39:23.340
what they're actually looking for with regards

39:23.340 --> 39:24.900
to that trade off between

39:24.900 --> 39:27.330
that customization versus that ease of use,

39:27.330 --> 39:28.650
we think we have it right right now,

39:28.650 --> 39:33.650
but opening that up, particularly from a more macro sense,

39:33.690 --> 39:35.640
we are seeing many, many more renovations

39:35.640 --> 39:36.660
than we thought we would.

39:36.660 --> 39:38.700
And I think that's really gonna influence

39:38.700 --> 39:41.970
where the feature set goes and kind of what track we follow.

39:41.970 --> 39:43.380
So understanding where that goes,

39:43.380 --> 39:46.080
and as you're saying, kind of some leveling out

39:46.080 --> 39:47.400
of some of the interest rates as well too,

39:47.400 --> 39:49.200
that construction is gonna be picking up again

39:49.200 --> 39:50.040
in the next couple years.

39:50.040 --> 39:51.810
So just excited to see where that goes

39:51.810 --> 39:54.693
and kind of continue to build upon that for Kwikset.

39:56.070 --> 39:58.890
<v ->Well, as we turn the corner in 2025,</v>

39:58.890 --> 40:01.980
from a SmartRent perspective, for many of our customers,

40:01.980 --> 40:04.350
this is no longer a novelty and amenity.

40:04.350 --> 40:07.290
This is becoming infrastructure at the community.

40:07.290 --> 40:08.670
What I'm really looking forward to seeing,

40:08.670 --> 40:11.280
I mean, among many other things, is just the stories

40:11.280 --> 40:13.530
that we can tell and the insights that we can share,

40:13.530 --> 40:16.830
namely around energy and sustainability.

40:16.830 --> 40:18.690
There's so many of these customers of ours

40:18.690 --> 40:21.240
that have their reports around this topic be,

40:21.240 --> 40:23.280
how many trees do we plant this year?

40:23.280 --> 40:24.840
But the underlying value,

40:24.840 --> 40:27.480
what the SmartRent technology can deliver is insight

40:27.480 --> 40:29.730
into that perspective of what is happening around

40:29.730 --> 40:32.580
energy behavior and usage in this community

40:32.580 --> 40:34.650
across the units and how can we make sure

40:34.650 --> 40:37.713
that we find ways to influence that in a positive manner.

40:38.940 --> 40:40.740
<v ->Well, thank you so very much everyone</v>

40:40.740 --> 40:43.950
for joining us today and for that wonderful discussion.

40:43.950 --> 40:46.320
Please join me, audience, in a round of applause

40:46.320 --> 40:47.505
in thanking our panelists.

40:47.505 --> 40:49.074
(audience applauding)

40:49.074 --> 40:51.574
