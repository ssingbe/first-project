1
00:01.127 --> 00:04.544
(bright energetic music)

2
00:10.680 --> 00:15.680
<v ->Well, welcome, everyone, to the Postprandial CES session.</v>

3
00:16.020 --> 00:19.380
I know folks' glucose might be challenged.

4
00:19.380 --> 00:21.330
We've talked a lot about glucose monitors

5
00:21.330 --> 00:22.770
the past couple of days,

6
00:22.770 --> 00:27.117
but we promise to keep this session spicy so

7
00:27.117 --> 00:28.052
(group laughing)

8
00:28.052 --> 00:28.885
you all stay awake.

9
00:29.736 --> 00:32.425
<v Guest>That's good news.</v>
<v ->It's about tech</v>

10
00:32.425 --> 00:33.360
on the front lines

11
00:33.360 --> 00:37.590
and how we adapt technology for healthcare.

12
00:37.590 --> 00:40.530
So the premise that we're gonna go with is

13
00:40.530 --> 00:44.400
that utilizing tech for healthcare is

14
00:44.400 --> 00:45.960
different than other industries.

15
00:45.960 --> 00:47.250
And people may disagree,

16
00:47.250 --> 00:49.650
but that's the premise that we're gonna go with,

17
00:49.650 --> 00:52.926
and that we haven't even really tapped

18
00:52.926 --> 00:56.730
the true potential of tech and health,

19
00:56.730 --> 01:01.170
given all that we've seen in the various exhibit booths.

20
01:01.170 --> 01:02.880
And then finally, we're gonna learn

21
01:02.880 --> 01:07.380
what can other industries learn from health and wellness

22
01:07.380 --> 01:09.870
in terms of how we're adopting tech?

23
01:09.870 --> 01:13.617
I'm John Whyte. I'm the Chief Medical Officer at WebMD.

24
01:13.617 --> 01:15.580
Many of you know it and have come to it.

25
01:15.580 --> 01:17.493
It is a huge online platform.

26
01:17.493 --> 01:21.270
It's our 30th anniversary this year.

27
01:21.270 --> 01:23.935
So we have survived.

28
01:23.935 --> 01:25.080
(audience clapping)

29
01:25.080 --> 01:26.894
That's a long time-
<v Guest>Wow, that's</v>

30
01:26.894 --> 01:28.970
a long time.
<v ->For the tech industry.</v>

31
01:28.970 --> 01:31.630
And we have a great panel today to talk

32
01:31.630 --> 01:34.290
about what this session is all about.

33
01:34.290 --> 01:37.410
So I'm gonna allow them to introduce themselves.

34
01:37.410 --> 01:39.210
<v ->Hey, friends, I am Jen Gardy.</v>

35
01:39.210 --> 01:41.640
I'm with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

36
01:41.640 --> 01:44.280
It is our first time at CES.

37
01:44.280 --> 01:46.970
We are incredibly excited to be here.

38
01:46.970 --> 01:50.100
My role at the foundation, I'm a Deputy Director

39
01:50.100 --> 01:52.680
on two teams within our Global Health Division.

40
01:52.680 --> 01:54.000
One is the Malaria Team,

41
01:54.000 --> 01:56.460
and one is our Institute for Disease Modeling.

42
01:56.460 --> 01:58.170
And at the end of the day, most of my work

43
01:58.170 --> 02:00.570
at the foundations rolls up under the umbrella

44
02:00.570 --> 02:03.181
of how do we use data, including digital data

45
02:03.181 --> 02:05.163
for better decision making.

46
02:06.780 --> 02:08.760
<v ->Hello, everyone. My name's Karen Finger.</v>

47
02:08.760 --> 02:11.520
I'm with Verizon Business, and I'm our Global Lead

48
02:11.520 --> 02:15.543
for our Connected Health Strategy and Innovation Ecosystem.

49
02:15.543 --> 02:19.320
And what that really means is we,

50
02:19.320 --> 02:21.930
if you think about Verizon at a macro level,

51
02:21.930 --> 02:25.349
we, our vision is to build connected experiences

52
02:25.349 --> 02:28.770
and have an impeccable consumer experience,

53
02:28.770 --> 02:32.190
and also an impeccable enterprise employee experience.

54
02:32.190 --> 02:34.235
So what our team does is

55
02:34.235 --> 02:37.080
literally we adapt that for healthcare.

56
02:37.080 --> 02:39.660
So we take a look at all the assets

57
02:39.660 --> 02:42.300
and capabilities that Verizon can bring forward

58
02:42.300 --> 02:46.680
around the transformative nature of our 5G network

59
02:46.680 --> 02:48.641
and platforms, edge computing,

60
02:48.641 --> 02:51.870
our security portfolio.

61
02:51.870 --> 02:55.380
Verizon, little known fact, we see

62
02:55.380 --> 02:58.050
over 70% of the world's traffic.

63
02:58.050 --> 03:01.200
So as we think about healthcare, to John's point,

64
03:01.200 --> 03:03.510
security plays a big role.

65
03:03.510 --> 03:05.850
And so we help, you know,

66
03:05.850 --> 03:08.250
figure out and bring expertise forward

67
03:08.250 --> 03:10.890
around building those secure platforms.

68
03:10.890 --> 03:15.180
We've got, we look across our IOT platforms

69
03:15.180 --> 03:18.765
as well, and then our CX platforms.

70
03:18.765 --> 03:21.780
And if you, we also look inward at Verizon,

71
03:21.780 --> 03:26.130
and how are we leveraging for our own company around?

72
03:26.130 --> 03:29.719
We run one of the largest retail organizations

73
03:29.719 --> 03:31.860
and supply chains in the world,

74
03:31.860 --> 03:33.750
so, and consumer channels.

75
03:33.750 --> 03:36.660
So what learnings can we adapt from that

76
03:36.660 --> 03:38.400
to bring into healthcare?

77
03:38.400 --> 03:43.230
We deploy vast technologies into venues,

78
03:43.230 --> 03:45.930
retail, hospitality, financial services.

79
03:45.930 --> 03:50.190
And so we, part of my role is

80
03:50.190 --> 03:52.920
to look at across all those technologies

81
03:52.920 --> 03:57.000
and leverage that to help solve complex problems

82
03:57.000 --> 03:59.700
in healthcare around how do we extend patient access

83
03:59.700 --> 04:01.380
to underserved communities?

84
04:01.380 --> 04:03.840
How do we personalize the experience?

85
04:03.840 --> 04:07.136
How do we capture, secure, collect, move the data

86
04:07.136 --> 04:10.890
around the ecosystem between the workforce,

87
04:10.890 --> 04:14.151
the med tech devices into the home,

88
04:14.151 --> 04:16.290
you know, building that

89
04:16.290 --> 04:19.080
smart connected hospital ecosystem, if you will?

90
04:19.080 --> 04:20.610
I'll be quiet now 'cause I gotta let Zach,

91
04:20.610 --> 04:23.310
but one quick thing is we always get,

92
04:23.310 --> 04:25.050
which is I still find very interesting

93
04:25.050 --> 04:27.507
after all this time, is what's Verizon do in healthcare?

94
04:27.507 --> 04:29.370
So hopefully, you know, we'll shed

95
04:29.370 --> 04:30.203
a little bit of light then.

96
04:30.203 --> 04:33.480
But I think Uber now, you've superseded us

97
04:33.480 --> 04:34.313
and topped us in.

98
04:34.313 --> 04:36.570
When I've mentioned you were gonna be on the panel with me,

99
04:36.570 --> 04:37.890
what's Uber do in healthcare.

100
04:37.890 --> 04:38.850
So that's a good segue.
<v ->Okay, there's</v>

101
04:38.850 --> 04:40.726
one moderator here.
<v ->To turn...</v>

102
04:40.726 --> 04:42.090
(group laughing)

103
04:42.090 --> 04:44.157
<v ->That was a fantastic segue. Thank you.</v>

104
04:44.157 --> 04:47.240
Zach Clark. I'm the Global GM for Uber Health.

105
04:47.240 --> 04:49.800
To your comments, what is Uber doing in health?

106
04:49.800 --> 04:52.410
So we are a platform that extends access

107
04:52.410 --> 04:53.880
to non-emergent medical transport

108
04:53.880 --> 04:55.080
as well as delivery into the home.

109
04:55.080 --> 04:57.960
We work directly with medical providers,

110
04:57.960 --> 05:00.660
health systems, payers, and states

111
05:00.660 --> 05:02.460
to extend the underlying network

112
05:02.460 --> 05:04.470
that Uber curates and bring it to healthcare.

113
05:04.470 --> 05:09.060
So our customers leverage us in every day to move patients

114
05:09.060 --> 05:11.338
to their homes and into clinical settings.

115
05:11.338 --> 05:13.350
And then we also do the reverse, right?

116
05:13.350 --> 05:15.000
So we then bring things to the home,

117
05:15.000 --> 05:17.430
whether those are prescriptions, healthy items,

118
05:17.430 --> 05:19.113
OTC, grocery items, et cetera.

119
05:21.540 --> 05:23.610
<v ->All right, good afternoon. I'm Mattias Lange.</v>

120
05:23.610 --> 05:25.860
I'm from NXP Semiconductor.

121
05:25.860 --> 05:29.160
I'm running, I'm Vice President of the Industrial Systems

122
05:29.160 --> 05:30.480
with a special focus on health.

123
05:30.480 --> 05:33.030
And I've been running our personal health business

124
05:33.030 --> 05:35.520
that had a specific focus on portable

125
05:35.520 --> 05:37.470
and personal medical devices.

126
05:37.470 --> 05:40.020
And we all know that all technology, right?

127
05:40.020 --> 05:43.080
It runs on semiconductor, it runs on chips.

128
05:43.080 --> 05:44.720
So we are one of those who provide all

129
05:44.720 --> 05:47.580
of the fundamental technology that enables

130
05:47.580 --> 05:48.990
all of these great applications

131
05:48.990 --> 05:50.671
and everything that we will talk about.

132
05:50.671 --> 05:53.934
<v ->So the premise of this session, again, is that</v>

133
05:53.934 --> 05:58.934
tech and health is different than in other industries,

134
05:59.130 --> 06:01.740
and everyone likes to think that they're different.

135
06:01.740 --> 06:06.019
So I'm gonna start off last first and start with Mattias

136
06:06.019 --> 06:09.462
and ask how is tech and health

137
06:09.462 --> 06:11.010
different than other industries?

138
06:11.010 --> 06:13.140
And if you disagree, let's hear it..

139
06:13.140 --> 06:14.610
<v ->Because you promised to keep it spicy, right?</v>

140
06:14.610 --> 06:15.637
So I'll say-
<v John>Yeah, you are</v>

141
06:15.637 --> 06:16.871
the one that keeps it spicy.
<v ->Right outta the gate.</v>

142
06:16.871 --> 06:19.110
(group laughing)

143
06:19.110 --> 06:23.012
So for us, and you're right,

144
06:23.012 --> 06:25.620
all industries say, "We are special," okay?

145
06:25.620 --> 06:30.090
And we work at our company, we are in cars,

146
06:30.090 --> 06:32.700
we are in medical, we are in consumer applications,

147
06:32.700 --> 06:34.290
all kinds of industrial.

148
06:34.290 --> 06:38.010
I would say fundamentally, most of the technologies have

149
06:38.010 --> 06:39.420
a lot of commonalities.

150
06:39.420 --> 06:43.770
You want more compute power, you want AI capabilities,

151
06:43.770 --> 06:46.770
you want security, you want connectivity,

152
06:46.770 --> 06:48.240
wireless and so on.

153
06:48.240 --> 06:50.727
So for us, the fundamental building blocks are

154
06:50.727 --> 06:52.680
very much the same.

155
06:52.680 --> 06:54.990
The instantiation of them are different.

156
06:54.990 --> 06:56.460
And I would say actually one

157
06:56.460 --> 07:00.690
of the biggest differences is the ecosystem.

158
07:00.690 --> 07:03.840
What do I need to actually build a complete system solution?

159
07:03.840 --> 07:05.460
So the fundamental technologies

160
07:05.460 --> 07:07.230
I would argue are not very different,

161
07:07.230 --> 07:08.401
but it's the ecosystem

162
07:08.401 --> 07:11.149
and what actually creates opportunities

163
07:11.149 --> 07:13.830
and willingness for people to invest and go

164
07:13.830 --> 07:15.753
and develop the final applications.

165
07:16.890 --> 07:19.590
<v ->Yeah, I would say for Uber and for Uber Health</v>

166
07:19.590 --> 07:21.390
in particular, I would agree with you.

167
07:21.390 --> 07:23.310
I think the fundamental building blocks need

168
07:23.310 --> 07:24.600
to remain the same.

169
07:24.600 --> 07:26.910
Certainly there are requirements about data security,

170
07:26.910 --> 07:29.490
HIPAA security, et cetera, that make the way that we manage

171
07:29.490 --> 07:32.190
that data or the way that we can leverage that data

172
07:32.190 --> 07:34.380
differentiated from a true consumer experience.

173
07:34.380 --> 07:36.820
But I would also say that if we're doing our jobs right,

174
07:36.820 --> 07:38.160
we're bringing the magic

175
07:38.160 --> 07:41.160
of what a consumer experience is to the space.

176
07:41.160 --> 07:43.590
And that's something that we think really critically about,

177
07:43.590 --> 07:46.829
which is in an environment that is notoriously difficult

178
07:46.829 --> 07:49.350
to navigate, it is complex.

179
07:49.350 --> 07:51.390
When's the last time anybody in this room understood

180
07:51.390 --> 07:54.093
what their EOB was, let alone an EOP?

181
07:55.230 --> 07:57.000
And I use that as an example only

182
07:57.000 --> 08:00.570
because the reality around the complexity

183
08:00.570 --> 08:02.760
of navigating the system is already really challenging.

184
08:02.760 --> 08:06.300
And so we want to take the best of that consumer experience

185
08:06.300 --> 08:08.430
and those building blocks and then impart them

186
08:08.430 --> 08:10.672
and hopefully shed value, create value

187
08:10.672 --> 08:13.980
and shed a light on what can be made easy.

188
08:13.980 --> 08:15.150
And I would say the second piece

189
08:15.150 --> 08:18.080
of that is there are few experiences

190
08:18.080 --> 08:20.340
in healthcare that are always the same.

191
08:20.340 --> 08:21.780
There's not a lot of redundancy,

192
08:21.780 --> 08:24.150
there's not a lot of scalability in some cases.

193
08:24.150 --> 08:25.350
That's why it's so fragmented,

194
08:25.350 --> 08:27.150
particularly here in the US.

195
08:27.150 --> 08:29.550
And so I think there's something to be said around,

196
08:29.550 --> 08:32.310
at least for Uber, the repeatability and durability

197
08:32.310 --> 08:34.470
of knowing exactly what's gonna happen every time I get

198
08:34.470 --> 08:37.410
into that vehicle and I get to a hospital and I get back.

199
08:37.410 --> 08:39.810
And I, knowing that and having that,

200
08:39.810 --> 08:42.390
that to me is kind of the building block

201
08:42.390 --> 08:45.714
by which we think about where there's differentiation, so.

202
08:45.714 --> 08:48.213
<v ->Yeah, that's a big question.</v>

203
08:49.290 --> 08:53.190
So we come at it, our point of view is,

204
08:53.190 --> 08:55.350
and again, we, I've had the privilege

205
08:55.350 --> 08:57.720
of working really in, across all the different kind

206
08:57.720 --> 08:58.800
of vertical industries,

207
08:58.800 --> 09:00.465
and they all have their own personality

208
09:00.465 --> 09:02.900
and nuances and regulations, but healthcare, as we all know,

209
09:02.900 --> 09:04.380
is just complex and hard.

210
09:04.380 --> 09:07.303
So as we think about adapting the technology,

211
09:07.303 --> 09:10.350
I mean, foremost as we're building

212
09:10.350 --> 09:14.610
those network connectivity, strategic platforms is

213
09:14.610 --> 09:18.060
starting from the ground up and building it right.

214
09:18.060 --> 09:20.638
And then once you build out the proper platform

215
09:20.638 --> 09:22.650
that's strategic, it becomes

216
09:22.650 --> 09:26.010
an innovation utility platform, if you will.

217
09:26.010 --> 09:29.809
We think about how do we make sure it's secure and trusted

218
09:29.809 --> 09:34.260
and then frictionless for the end users,

219
09:34.260 --> 09:36.910
for the consumers, for the patients, for the members.

220
09:37.830 --> 09:40.437
And also how do we make it easy to use

221
09:40.437 --> 09:43.200
for the clinicians?

222
09:43.200 --> 09:46.230
And there's such a vast shortage of clinicians.

223
09:46.230 --> 09:48.480
And so how do we, and you know, we find, like,

224
09:48.480 --> 09:51.930
our team ends up working with and talking to

225
09:51.930 --> 09:53.580
and collaborating with clinicians

226
09:53.580 --> 09:54.720
and we say, "You bring the clinical,

227
09:54.720 --> 09:55.710
we'll bring the technical."

228
09:55.710 --> 09:58.173
But we've gotta have their buy-in upfront.

229
09:59.400 --> 10:01.290
You know, where and what can we automate

230
10:01.290 --> 10:02.850
across that ecosystem?

231
10:02.850 --> 10:06.294
But I'd say secure, you know, thinking mostly about security

232
10:06.294 --> 10:10.020
and the user friendliness of the experience,

233
10:10.020 --> 10:11.790
both for the providers and the patients

234
10:11.790 --> 10:12.660
so they won't use it.

235
10:12.660 --> 10:15.960
And patients or consumers really, they don't wanna have

236
10:15.960 --> 10:17.040
to use their healthcare,

237
10:17.040 --> 10:19.833
but when they use it, it's gotta be, like, easy to use.

238
10:20.670 --> 10:23.160
<v ->And I'll answer it from a different perspective.</v>

239
10:23.160 --> 10:24.300
You know, at the Gates Foundation,

240
10:24.300 --> 10:26.550
we work in the Global Health and Development space.

241
10:26.550 --> 10:29.489
So bring a different lens than my fellow panelists.

242
10:29.489 --> 10:33.060
I think the first thing that I would mention is that

243
10:33.060 --> 10:37.260
in that space, developing technology for health isn't

244
10:37.260 --> 10:39.870
a nice to have or a need to have.

245
10:39.870 --> 10:41.970
It's, like, a moral imperative.

246
10:41.970 --> 10:44.634
If there is technology that has the potential

247
10:44.634 --> 10:48.180
to improve health outcomes around the world,

248
10:48.180 --> 10:49.410
to save people's lives,

249
10:49.410 --> 10:52.694
we have to be developing this technology.

250
10:52.694 --> 10:54.450
It's a must.

251
10:54.450 --> 10:56.070
And then part of that, you know,

252
10:56.070 --> 10:57.671
Karen talked about designing systems

253
10:57.671 --> 10:59.850
right from the ground up.

254
10:59.850 --> 11:02.610
And part of that is designing for access too,

255
11:02.610 --> 11:04.431
because health technology is nothing

256
11:04.431 --> 11:06.930
without access to that technology.

257
11:06.930 --> 11:09.330
You can have the most incredible product,

258
11:09.330 --> 11:10.770
the most incredible offering,

259
11:10.770 --> 11:14.237
but if it can't get to the communities where it is needed

260
11:14.237 --> 11:16.170
and if it's not taken up,

261
11:16.170 --> 11:18.360
if the community's not receptive to that,

262
11:18.360 --> 11:21.210
you're sort of innovating into a void.

263
11:21.210 --> 11:22.590
And the last point I'd make

264
11:22.590 --> 11:25.148
from the global health perspective too, is that for us,

265
11:25.148 --> 11:28.200
technology encompasses innovation

266
11:28.200 --> 11:30.060
at a range of different scales.

267
11:30.060 --> 11:30.930
I mean, yes, some of it

268
11:30.930 --> 11:33.690
to Mattias's point includes semiconductors,

269
11:33.690 --> 11:35.550
but some of it can be, you know, as simple as

270
11:35.550 --> 11:38.010
a plastic sheet or a color changing sticker.

271
11:38.010 --> 11:41.190
So our view of health technology might be

272
11:41.190 --> 11:43.785
a little different than my fellow panelists.

273
11:43.785 --> 11:45.807
<v ->Well, actually, can I add on to that?</v>

274
11:45.807 --> 11:46.640
<v ->Sure.</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>

275
11:46.640 --> 11:49.500
So great points around, I'm thinking about delivery

276
11:49.500 --> 11:51.678
to the point of care, or the point of need.

277
11:51.678 --> 11:54.030
So we spend a lot of time thinking

278
11:54.030 --> 11:56.910
about how do we extend our network and our capabilities

279
11:56.910 --> 11:59.489
and our vast partner ecosystem together

280
11:59.489 --> 12:02.520
to deliver care into, you know,

281
12:02.520 --> 12:03.870
the rural parts of the world?

282
12:03.870 --> 12:07.710
So some examples are,

283
12:07.710 --> 12:10.710
you know, we've stood up private networks out

284
12:10.710 --> 12:12.750
in, like, an Indian reservation in Alaska

285
12:12.750 --> 12:14.460
to bring healthcare out there.

286
12:14.460 --> 12:17.670
We are looking at how do we connect

287
12:17.670 --> 12:19.690
the home as a smart patient room

288
12:20.580 --> 12:22.200
and really become that care,

289
12:22.200 --> 12:25.020
that assistant to the care team

290
12:25.020 --> 12:27.630
through intelligent automation into the home

291
12:27.630 --> 12:29.670
or within the four walls of the hospital.

292
12:29.670 --> 12:34.290
And we look at even, I mean, I could walk around...

293
12:34.290 --> 12:36.480
I mean, I had to be, this is my first CES.

294
12:36.480 --> 12:38.517
I'd have to be here, like, a month to probably even,

295
12:38.517 --> 12:40.157
and I don't even know if I'd see everything.

296
12:40.157 --> 12:45.116
But you know, when I walk through the halls,

297
12:45.116 --> 12:47.670
whether it's a healthcare company or not,

298
12:47.670 --> 12:50.130
it's, like, how can we adapt that for healthcare?

299
12:50.130 --> 12:51.780
And we, you know, there's even interesting

300
12:51.780 --> 12:53.400
strategic partnerships we've done with,

301
12:53.400 --> 12:55.230
around banks as an example,

302
12:55.230 --> 12:57.360
to put health station kiosks at banks

303
12:57.360 --> 13:02.360
to deliver point of care, you know, access there.

304
13:02.460 --> 13:03.420
So there's a lot of interesting...

305
13:03.420 --> 13:06.030
We just have to experiment and try different things

306
13:06.030 --> 13:07.890
and some things work and some things don't work.

307
13:07.890 --> 13:10.290
But you know, we really, because we're connecting

308
13:10.290 --> 13:14.640
that entire ecosystem, we see kind of,

309
13:14.640 --> 13:17.850
we get a perspective from all the different endpoints,

310
13:17.850 --> 13:19.530
if you will, of the point of care.

311
13:19.530 --> 13:22.470
<v ->Much of the conference is about the future, right?</v>

312
13:22.470 --> 13:23.520
The future of tech.

313
13:23.520 --> 13:26.910
And, Jennifer, you and I were talking before we came in,

314
13:26.910 --> 13:31.500
that does tech and health have to be different

315
13:31.500 --> 13:34.170
than tech and other industries in the future?

316
13:34.170 --> 13:37.504
What do you see that and what needs to change for us

317
13:37.504 --> 13:38.520
to get there?

318
13:38.520 --> 13:42.630
Is it regulation? Is it workflow?

319
13:42.630 --> 13:46.800
Why are we different, and how do we become less different?

320
13:46.800 --> 13:48.002
<v ->Yeah, well, I think one of the things</v>

321
13:48.002 --> 13:50.340
that we really have to lean into is looking

322
13:50.340 --> 13:54.031
for multi-sectoral solutions in the health space.

323
13:54.031 --> 13:56.939
You know, Karen just spoke of how

324
13:56.939 --> 14:00.990
it's about the entire ecosystem to get innovation out there.

325
14:00.990 --> 14:02.880
And that's really what we're seeing at the foundation.

326
14:02.880 --> 14:04.390
It's not enough for us to invest

327
14:04.390 --> 14:06.117
in a really amazing product,

328
14:06.117 --> 14:08.047
but we have to be thinking about things like,

329
14:08.047 --> 14:11.520
you know, what does the future of the market

330
14:11.520 --> 14:13.650
for this look, what does that look like?

331
14:13.650 --> 14:15.960
And how can we help that to evolve

332
14:15.960 --> 14:17.400
in the way that it needs to?

333
14:17.400 --> 14:21.450
What does the future of the regulatory ecosystem look like?

334
14:21.450 --> 14:24.849
And can we be supporting entities that help set the policy

335
14:24.849 --> 14:27.960
or, you know, accelerate time to market

336
14:27.960 --> 14:29.310
for some of these innovations?

337
14:29.310 --> 14:32.160
So for us, a lot of it is thinking about how do we just go

338
14:32.160 --> 14:35.970
beyond the health sector to leverage, you know,

339
14:35.970 --> 14:38.850
other sector's expertise and past experience?

340
14:38.850 --> 14:40.560
And I think one of the other things that we need

341
14:40.560 --> 14:43.320
to look at too, and that I'd love to see represented

342
14:43.320 --> 14:46.920
in future CES's is changing the geographic focus

343
14:46.920 --> 14:48.930
of tech in health as well.

344
14:48.930 --> 14:51.960
'Cause as I go out and look around the CES exhibit floor,

345
14:51.960 --> 14:54.467
you know, I see a lot of stuff coming from North America,

346
14:54.467 --> 14:56.160
from Asia, from Europe,

347
14:56.160 --> 14:58.410
and I would love to come to this event in, you know,

348
14:58.410 --> 15:01.005
two or three years and see tech innovations

349
15:01.005 --> 15:03.762
that are coming from say, the African continent,

350
15:03.762 --> 15:08.580
because you do have there an incredibly fast growing market

351
15:08.580 --> 15:11.580
and incredibly young population is gonna be really receptive

352
15:11.580 --> 15:14.700
to both using and developing these sorts of technologies.

353
15:14.700 --> 15:17.491
So for me, the future is both multi-sectoral

354
15:17.491 --> 15:21.990
and, you know, a dramatically expanded geographic footprint.

355
15:21.990 --> 15:23.550
<v ->Zach has leaned forward.</v>

356
15:23.550 --> 15:26.420
So I feel like there's something you wanna say.

357
15:26.420 --> 15:28.433
Is it payers? Is it regulators?

358
15:28.433 --> 15:33.180
What needs to change so it's more uniform?

359
15:33.180 --> 15:34.560
<v ->There's quite a bit that needs to change.</v>

360
15:34.560 --> 15:35.529
I think we all know that.

361
15:35.529 --> 15:39.960
What I would say though, John, is it's different.

362
15:39.960 --> 15:41.340
Let's use my business for example,

363
15:41.340 --> 15:43.860
which is non-emergent medical transport,

364
15:43.860 --> 15:46.050
which many of you may not have experienced before.

365
15:46.050 --> 15:47.120
But if you're not familiar with it,

366
15:47.120 --> 15:48.720
it is essentially a benefit that

367
15:48.720 --> 15:52.080
every Medicaid beneficiary of the United States has.

368
15:52.080 --> 15:56.280
And the requirement, effectively going back to 1971, is that

369
15:56.280 --> 15:57.870
if you're going to take federal dollars

370
15:57.870 --> 15:59.790
to perform, or not perform,

371
15:59.790 --> 16:02.970
but to serve Medicaid beneficiaries in a state scenario,

372
16:02.970 --> 16:04.560
you have to offer transport

373
16:04.560 --> 16:06.360
for those who are transportation insecure.

374
16:06.360 --> 16:07.980
So this is something that's been going on now

375
16:07.980 --> 16:10.350
for multiple decades.

376
16:10.350 --> 16:13.470
In that construct, there are still 24 states

377
16:13.470 --> 16:17.160
in the United States that don't allow rides hare companies

378
16:17.160 --> 16:20.426
like Uber or Lyft to participate in those programs.

379
16:20.426 --> 16:23.036
Still today there are states that say

380
16:23.036 --> 16:26.820
taxis have preference over ride share

381
16:26.820 --> 16:31.223
or ambulatory entities have

382
16:31.223 --> 16:33.180
preference over ride share, et cetera.

383
16:33.180 --> 16:34.080
And why is this?

384
16:34.080 --> 16:35.820
There's a whole lot of regulatory capture

385
16:35.820 --> 16:36.810
that's kind of embedded in it.

386
16:36.810 --> 16:40.260
But the reality is these are technologies that have been,

387
16:40.260 --> 16:41.790
that have diffused around the world.

388
16:41.790 --> 16:43.650
They are low cost, they're redundant,

389
16:43.650 --> 16:45.510
they create magical experiences

390
16:45.510 --> 16:48.775
for both the driver and for the patient.

391
16:48.775 --> 16:52.050
And they're still not allowed in several states, right?

392
16:52.050 --> 16:53.760
And so in many states,

393
16:53.760 --> 16:55.800
even when there's a low cost requirement,

394
16:55.800 --> 16:58.380
which requires the entity that's managing that program

395
16:58.380 --> 17:00.942
to choose the lowest cost provider for that beneficiary,

396
17:00.942 --> 17:03.967
we would be the lowest cost provider by 20%.

397
17:03.967 --> 17:06.750
But we're not even in that market today

398
17:06.750 --> 17:08.584
because of the historical constructs

399
17:08.584 --> 17:10.650
and the protectionism that exists

400
17:10.650 --> 17:12.420
in the marketplace today in that scenario.

401
17:12.420 --> 17:15.922
And I leaned in because that challenge doesn't exist

402
17:15.922 --> 17:18.120
in the Medicare Advantage program, right?

403
17:18.120 --> 17:20.811
Medicare Advantage is adjudicated at a federal basis,

404
17:20.811 --> 17:23.269
it's funded through taxpayer dollars directly.

405
17:23.269 --> 17:24.860
It is a federal program.

406
17:24.860 --> 17:29.130
And in that scenario, we have no barriers to access.

407
17:29.130 --> 17:31.441
So seniors are taking rides now at historical rates

408
17:31.441 --> 17:33.030
and transportation programs

409
17:33.030 --> 17:35.310
that their health plans have been offering now,

410
17:35.310 --> 17:36.960
really since the advent of SSBCI,

411
17:36.960 --> 17:38.820
but even a little bit before that.

412
17:38.820 --> 17:41.550
So you're looking at five or six year window of time,

413
17:41.550 --> 17:43.320
and in those cases the proliferation

414
17:43.320 --> 17:45.900
of access has been really demonstrable.

415
17:45.900 --> 17:47.836
So patients get where they need to be,

416
17:47.836 --> 17:50.763
they get there efficiently, it's cost effective,

417
17:50.763 --> 17:53.370
and it's an experience that I think has

418
17:53.370 --> 17:56.310
a lot of empathy for that patient and the user.

419
17:56.310 --> 17:58.320
And so to your, why are we different?

420
17:58.320 --> 18:03.060
That's a great example where the complexity of regulation

421
18:03.060 --> 18:05.040
that are sometimes completely in conflict

422
18:05.040 --> 18:06.690
with each other create really strong,

423
18:06.690 --> 18:08.670
I think, barriers to access that I think we need

424
18:08.670 --> 18:09.930
to think about changing, so.

425
18:09.930 --> 18:12.420
<v ->Yeah, I think we can't get out of our own way here</v>

426
18:12.420 --> 18:13.440
in the US sometimes.

427
18:13.440 --> 18:15.381
I mean, I've been to the first,

428
18:15.381 --> 18:18.706
the telemedicine conference that was in China

429
18:18.706 --> 18:21.095
and they were doing things that, you know,

430
18:21.095 --> 18:25.020
early, I mean, this was 12 years ago in telemedicine

431
18:25.020 --> 18:29.400
that we had yet to do here, because, you know,

432
18:29.400 --> 18:31.050
see more of a single payer system,

433
18:31.050 --> 18:32.820
which can simplify things.

434
18:32.820 --> 18:35.850
But to your point in other geographies, right,

435
18:35.850 --> 18:37.095
what can we learn?

436
18:37.095 --> 18:39.330
I think out of a necessity, they're doing things right.

437
18:39.330 --> 18:41.910
They're innovating and have a more sense

438
18:41.910 --> 18:45.750
of urgency towards it than I think we're...

439
18:45.750 --> 18:48.750
I do feel a perfect storm coming here for 2025

440
18:48.750 --> 18:50.251
with just the massive amounts of data

441
18:50.251 --> 18:53.010
that everybody wants to harness

442
18:53.010 --> 18:54.564
and deliver in real time to clinicians

443
18:54.564 --> 18:57.158
for faster clinical decision support,

444
18:57.158 --> 19:01.410
for better patient experience, you know, care anywhere.

445
19:01.410 --> 19:03.390
But the prior panel,

446
19:03.390 --> 19:05.250
the Chief Medical Officer for ResMed said,

447
19:05.250 --> 19:07.371
you know, I think the best quote I've heard so far was,

448
19:07.371 --> 19:08.998
you know, "We have to get over ourselves

449
19:08.998 --> 19:12.300
and embrace the disruption,

450
19:12.300 --> 19:14.250
maybe not take ourselves so seriously

451
19:14.250 --> 19:16.320
and just start doing things and executing."

452
19:16.320 --> 19:19.530
And I think, you know, it's time to really start executing.

453
19:19.530 --> 19:21.720
It does not have to be different than the other verticals,

454
19:21.720 --> 19:23.400
other than we are dealing with life and death.

455
19:23.400 --> 19:25.850
But I think there's ways to right solve for that.

456
19:26.760 --> 19:30.120
<v ->I think that you asked, John, what is different</v>

457
19:30.120 --> 19:31.500
between healthcare and other places,

458
19:31.500 --> 19:33.558
because we also know that we have the technology

459
19:33.558 --> 19:35.540
to solve a lot of the problems.

460
19:35.540 --> 19:38.694
So we know that nurses are overworked.

461
19:38.694 --> 19:40.050
They're overstressed.

462
19:40.050 --> 19:42.240
There are horrific numbers actually showing

463
19:42.240 --> 19:44.146
how many nurses actually want to quit and so on.

464
19:44.146 --> 19:47.618
There are solutions that can release their burden,

465
19:47.618 --> 19:50.430
but because of how things are budgeted

466
19:50.430 --> 19:52.020
and who's paying for what,

467
19:52.020 --> 19:53.730
the technology doesn't get accessed.

468
19:53.730 --> 19:55.130
So I'll give you one example is

469
19:55.130 --> 19:58.140
something that we have solutions for is

470
19:58.140 --> 19:59.730
smart wound care.

471
19:59.730 --> 20:02.430
70%, we have numbers showing that 70%

472
20:02.430 --> 20:05.100
of wounds in hospitals are not treated correctly.

473
20:05.100 --> 20:07.980
And you could get to the terms of that

474
20:07.980 --> 20:12.270
to a high degree if you had intelligence in those dressings

475
20:12.270 --> 20:15.990
that could measure pH, pressure and a bunch of other things.

476
20:15.990 --> 20:17.604
So that technology is actually available,

477
20:17.604 --> 20:19.860
and it's pretty cost effective,

478
20:19.860 --> 20:23.070
but there's inertia in the system to get those kind

479
20:23.070 --> 20:24.930
of things deployed and get those things out,

480
20:24.930 --> 20:27.234
because of the way things are structured and budgeted

481
20:27.234 --> 20:28.680
and paid for and so on.

482
20:28.680 --> 20:32.190
So these are key things I think that the industry will need

483
20:32.190 --> 20:34.533
to work at to get access to the technology.

484
20:35.760 --> 20:38.670
<v ->You know, much of healthcare success is</v>

485
20:38.670 --> 20:40.530
based on partnerships.

486
20:40.530 --> 20:41.963
It's very hard to have a technology

487
20:41.963 --> 20:45.000
in and of itself to be successful.

488
20:45.000 --> 20:46.140
I mean, we've heard about this.

489
20:46.140 --> 20:47.370
You know, wearables

490
20:47.370 --> 20:50.820
without including healthcare providers is not

491
20:50.820 --> 20:52.290
gonna be successful,

492
20:52.290 --> 20:55.034
which is a little different than some other industries.

493
20:55.034 --> 20:59.520
So where have you seen partnerships

494
20:59.520 --> 21:03.000
in health tech be successful,

495
21:03.000 --> 21:05.793
and where have they might have failed?

496
21:06.750 --> 21:08.403
Who wants to take that one first?

497
21:13.800 --> 21:15.060
<v ->I would say another thing.</v>

498
21:15.060 --> 21:18.120
I know where I want to see it go, okay, more so.

499
21:18.120 --> 21:20.280
So because we are showing things here

500
21:20.280 --> 21:23.190
where I think we can take things to the next level

501
21:23.190 --> 21:25.230
of providing a much, much better care,

502
21:25.230 --> 21:29.185
and I think the partnerships are absolutely essential.

503
21:29.185 --> 21:31.080
The way things are going now

504
21:31.080 --> 21:32.550
with everything getting connected,

505
21:32.550 --> 21:35.245
more data and everything is getting more available is

506
21:35.245 --> 21:37.080
it's all about systems.

507
21:37.080 --> 21:39.660
It's about not how does this thing work,

508
21:39.660 --> 21:40.860
this individual thing.

509
21:40.860 --> 21:44.343
How does this thing work together with other things?

510
21:45.600 --> 21:47.970
So we have one example that we are showing here

511
21:47.970 --> 21:50.970
at the show is a in-home care system

512
21:50.970 --> 21:53.460
where I can provide a different level

513
21:53.460 --> 21:57.000
of surveillance or care over somebody in a home

514
21:57.000 --> 21:58.800
by combining things,

515
21:58.800 --> 22:01.380
by combining different type of sensors,

516
22:01.380 --> 22:04.170
blood glucose sensors together

517
22:04.170 --> 22:05.735
with other things like fall detectors

518
22:05.735 --> 22:10.590
connected to a caretaker, connected to a home

519
22:10.590 --> 22:15.393
and even to 911 or alarm systems.

520
22:16.530 --> 22:19.405
An example is that you can find somebody unresponsive,

521
22:19.405 --> 22:21.390
somebody trips or falls over,

522
22:21.390 --> 22:23.850
and becomes unresponsive in their home.

523
22:23.850 --> 22:27.540
A system that connects multiple different application can

524
22:27.540 --> 22:30.750
draw an analysis and say, "Hey, something happened.

525
22:30.750 --> 22:34.279
The blood glucose levels became low,

526
22:34.279 --> 22:37.620
the person fell over, is now unresponsive,

527
22:37.620 --> 22:39.690
I'm calling the caretaker."

528
22:39.690 --> 22:43.488
So through the network caretaker might or might not respond,

529
22:43.488 --> 22:47.160
the system can connect to 911,

530
22:47.160 --> 22:49.232
get the emergency responders out there,

531
22:49.232 --> 22:52.770
open the door, let them in,

532
22:52.770 --> 22:55.230
and actually even guide through the house,

533
22:55.230 --> 22:57.030
the person to the right place.

534
22:57.030 --> 23:00.120
To get these things to work, it's a whole network of system

535
23:00.120 --> 23:02.190
and things that needs to work together.

536
23:02.190 --> 23:04.470
And I don't think, we are not there yet today,

537
23:04.470 --> 23:06.540
but these are the kinds of things that we need to drive for

538
23:06.540 --> 23:09.120
and the collaborations that needs to happen.

539
23:09.120 --> 23:11.910
<v ->Jennifer?</v>
<v ->Yeah, I was gonna add</v>

540
23:11.910 --> 23:13.020
a perspective that again,

541
23:13.020 --> 23:14.430
from the Gates Foundation perspective,

542
23:14.430 --> 23:17.880
our work is entirely done through partnerships.

543
23:17.880 --> 23:19.500
We're not doing this work ourselves.

544
23:19.500 --> 23:21.870
It's our partners that are out there having this impact.

545
23:21.870 --> 23:24.090
And the partnerships exist across many scales.

546
23:24.090 --> 23:25.380
It could be, you know, working

547
23:25.380 --> 23:28.141
with an individual researcher, innovator somewhere,

548
23:28.141 --> 23:32.430
private sector, academic labs, regulatory bodies,

549
23:32.430 --> 23:33.840
all the way up to these big entities.

550
23:33.840 --> 23:36.810
Things like GAVI, the vaccine procurement distributor

551
23:36.810 --> 23:40.590
or the Global Fund for Commodities for HIV, TB and malaria.

552
23:40.590 --> 23:43.230
But no matter the scale of that partnership,

553
23:43.230 --> 23:45.060
one of the things, you know, you ask what makes

554
23:45.060 --> 23:47.059
for a successful partnership or when that fails

555
23:47.059 --> 23:48.660
can tell you time and time again,

556
23:48.660 --> 23:50.730
is if that partnership does not include

557
23:50.730 --> 23:53.940
community representation and the people that you are trying

558
23:53.940 --> 23:58.465
to design that tech for, it will fail.

559
23:58.465 --> 24:01.380
So to go back to my earlier point about the importance

560
24:01.380 --> 24:05.250
of access to innovation, that community engagement

561
24:05.250 --> 24:08.310
and having people with lived experience being part

562
24:08.310 --> 24:10.890
of the design process from day zero is,

563
24:10.890 --> 24:14.310
I personally think the single best ingredient

564
24:14.310 --> 24:17.583
to set a partnership up for success and impact.

565
24:18.510 --> 24:21.300
<v ->Yeah, I think I'm not so sure, like, failure would be</v>

566
24:21.300 --> 24:22.500
the right way to think about it,

567
24:22.500 --> 24:24.600
but versus, you know, challenges.

568
24:24.600 --> 24:26.700
And I'm seeing it's kind of evolving

569
24:26.700 --> 24:27.990
in an iterative process,

570
24:27.990 --> 24:32.550
but we in our role at, you know, our team at Verizon,

571
24:32.550 --> 24:34.320
we end up talking to and working with

572
24:34.320 --> 24:36.630
and partnering with retail health providers.

573
24:36.630 --> 24:40.050
So all the, you know, the CVSs, Walgreens, Walmarts, right?

574
24:40.050 --> 24:42.600
All that channel if you will, which is kind

575
24:42.600 --> 24:45.600
of going direct to consumer threatening some

576
24:45.600 --> 24:47.340
of the healthcare systems.

577
24:47.340 --> 24:49.260
So then we work with the healthcare systems who want

578
24:49.260 --> 24:52.860
to protect their turf and build, you know,

579
24:52.860 --> 24:55.470
their own smart connected hospital ecosystems

580
24:55.470 --> 24:58.380
out into the communities and extend their brand and reach.

581
24:58.380 --> 24:59.910
And then we work with the health plans

582
24:59.910 --> 25:03.180
that are also have their own actually physician providers

583
25:03.180 --> 25:05.340
and some of 'em their own hospitals.

584
25:05.340 --> 25:09.810
So it often looks very siloed,

585
25:09.810 --> 25:12.030
and we're like, why aren't you guys all talking

586
25:12.030 --> 25:13.830
to each other and come together?

587
25:13.830 --> 25:15.840
We are starting to see that now

588
25:15.840 --> 25:18.840
where the health systems are starting to work

589
25:18.840 --> 25:23.010
with the retailers to kind of build more of that

590
25:23.010 --> 25:24.000
hub and spoke or collaborative

591
25:24.000 --> 25:27.790
community engagement and platform

592
25:29.940 --> 25:31.680
and really figuring out,

593
25:31.680 --> 25:33.690
you know, as a patient starts out

594
25:33.690 --> 25:36.870
on their healthcare journey from their home,

595
25:36.870 --> 25:41.700
how do you get 'em to the right place, at the right time

596
25:41.700 --> 25:44.160
for the right need for their, you know,

597
25:44.160 --> 25:46.950
healthcare moment in time, if you will.

598
25:46.950 --> 25:50.550
So it's just a complex, right,

599
25:50.550 --> 25:53.970
relationship ecosystem and we are starting to see

600
25:53.970 --> 25:57.780
a lot more collaboration there, you know?

601
25:57.780 --> 26:00.093
'Cause it all has a role to play.

602
26:02.130 --> 26:04.350
And yeah, that's, yeah...

603
26:04.350 --> 26:05.438
<v ->I think from my lens, John,</v>

604
26:05.438 --> 26:07.350
when partnerships don't go well,

605
26:07.350 --> 26:08.970
they don't go well because the objectives

606
26:08.970 --> 26:10.530
between those two organizations are not

607
26:10.530 --> 26:12.420
really clearly defined and aligned

608
26:12.420 --> 26:14.490
right out through the relationship.

609
26:14.490 --> 26:16.740
And so, we see that a lot where there's

610
26:16.740 --> 26:19.320
a lot of interest in brand equity,

611
26:19.320 --> 26:21.630
or there's a lot of interest in research,

612
26:21.630 --> 26:23.250
or there's a lot of interest in other aspects

613
26:23.250 --> 26:24.810
of things that we may be able to contribute.

614
26:24.810 --> 26:27.780
But if the organizations, the ethos aren't aligned,

615
26:27.780 --> 26:29.815
and the objectives aren't aligned to begin with,

616
26:29.815 --> 26:32.820
I think it becomes a really challenging environment

617
26:32.820 --> 26:34.920
to get to define really what success looks like.

618
26:34.920 --> 26:36.883
And then you end up in a scenario where failure is

619
26:36.883 --> 26:40.470
a really obvious kind of next door, so to speak.

620
26:40.470 --> 26:43.550
So I know that's a comment more around when we don't,

621
26:43.550 --> 26:47.370
when it doesn't work, but I think that has been the kind

622
26:47.370 --> 26:49.980
of the ethos of the industry in the last couple of years.

623
26:49.980 --> 26:52.440
I think Rock Health a couple of days ago announced

624
26:52.440 --> 26:56.370
there were 400 digital health or other partnerships

625
26:56.370 --> 27:00.226
that were announced in some form or fashion in 2024 alone.

626
27:00.226 --> 27:03.540
Like, it's an enormous amount of activity.

627
27:03.540 --> 27:06.409
Like, what that activity is creating, I'm not sure.

628
27:06.409 --> 27:08.119
Not sure yet, so.

629
27:08.119 --> 27:11.010
<v ->I'm gonna turn to the issue</v>

630
27:11.010 --> 27:13.170
of frontline workers in health.

631
27:13.170 --> 27:15.240
All of you have spent a fair amount

632
27:15.240 --> 27:17.505
of time talking about the impact on patients,

633
27:17.505 --> 27:19.620
and that's a good thing.

634
27:19.620 --> 27:22.559
But understanding the healthcare workforce,

635
27:22.559 --> 27:25.170
which we've heard over the past couple of days

636
27:25.170 --> 27:29.460
globally is challenged by the number

637
27:29.460 --> 27:30.660
of healthcare professionals,

638
27:30.660 --> 27:32.695
and the belief that there will be shortages

639
27:32.695 --> 27:35.700
this year, end of the decade.

640
27:35.700 --> 27:40.417
So how can AI, other tech tools help

641
27:41.790 --> 27:43.620
address this issue with frontline workers?

642
27:43.620 --> 27:45.750
Some could argue sometimes it makes

643
27:45.750 --> 27:47.313
their lives more difficult.

644
27:49.438 --> 27:50.520
<v ->Oh, go ahead.</v>

645
27:50.520 --> 27:53.640
<v ->Yeah, this is very dear to my heart,</v>

646
27:53.640 --> 27:57.179
because I think we have a responsibility as an industry here

647
27:57.179 --> 28:00.210
actually not only in healthcare but across the board.

648
28:00.210 --> 28:03.570
And I think also first we need to realize we are

649
28:03.570 --> 28:06.150
at about the level of hello, world,

650
28:06.150 --> 28:07.397
of what the capabilities are.

651
28:07.397 --> 28:09.510
We are just starting.

652
28:09.510 --> 28:14.070
So the AI capabilities are really enabling things

653
28:14.070 --> 28:16.110
to become more intelligent.

654
28:16.110 --> 28:18.660
So far, when people have mentioned smart,

655
28:18.660 --> 28:22.320
it's been, it's meant connected and not much more.

656
28:22.320 --> 28:25.500
But with the AI capabilities, we can make things

657
28:25.500 --> 28:29.403
more real smart, provide some real intelligence,

658
28:29.403 --> 28:31.235
and this will change completely

659
28:31.235 --> 28:33.540
how we interact with technology.

660
28:33.540 --> 28:36.030
<v ->Like, genius. I'm thinking of a better word.</v>

661
28:36.030 --> 28:38.460
Really smart.
<v ->Yes, very smart,</v>

662
28:38.460 --> 28:40.260
intelligent, I dunno what's the next.

663
28:40.260 --> 28:42.570
We have to find another word for smart.

664
28:42.570 --> 28:44.564
Okay? We've passed smart.

665
28:44.564 --> 28:47.970
And I think it has the possibility

666
28:47.970 --> 28:51.000
to completely, fundamentally change how we do it.

667
28:51.000 --> 28:53.520
But then the people who develop the technology,

668
28:53.520 --> 28:56.520
we have to put the user at the central focus.

669
28:56.520 --> 29:00.030
We have to make it friendly, we have to make it easy to use

670
29:00.030 --> 29:02.880
and we have to clean out a lot of those issues that we have.

671
29:02.880 --> 29:04.174
So all of the potential

672
29:04.174 --> 29:05.128
is there.
<v John>Who's the user?</v>

673
29:05.128 --> 29:06.081
That's part of the question.

674
29:06.081 --> 29:08.850
<v ->The healthcare worker. Okay?</v>

675
29:08.850 --> 29:11.010
So the nurse, whoever's using it,

676
29:11.010 --> 29:13.230
because if I spend all my time doing a setup

677
29:13.230 --> 29:15.119
or trying to make the thing connect or get the...

678
29:15.119 --> 29:16.410
We can't have that.

679
29:16.410 --> 29:18.090
Okay. We need to get past those things.

680
29:18.090 --> 29:20.490
But if we do, it can really provide

681
29:20.490 --> 29:23.537
that next level of help, so it can really change things.

682
29:23.537 --> 29:24.370
<v ->Can I-</v>
<v ->Let's go down the line.</v>

683
29:24.370 --> 29:27.240
<v ->Can I just get my clinician to look me in the face</v>

684
29:27.240 --> 29:29.049
while I'm out in an actual clinical room

685
29:29.049 --> 29:31.320
and actually look at me instead of the EMR?

686
29:31.320 --> 29:32.730
'Cause that's step one, right?

687
29:32.730 --> 29:34.042
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

688
29:34.042 --> 29:34.875
<v ->Like, that's, I think that, like,</v>

689
29:34.875 --> 29:38.550
I say it just because, like, incrementalism is okay here

690
29:38.550 --> 29:39.840
to me at least, right?

691
29:39.840 --> 29:41.940
Like, whether that's because ambient listening then,

692
29:41.940 --> 29:43.950
and AI-generated ambient listening then allows you

693
29:43.950 --> 29:45.120
to be more proactive

694
29:45.120 --> 29:47.319
around in the patient experience in a clinical setting,

695
29:47.319 --> 29:49.263
those types of things.

696
29:50.747 --> 29:52.620
I think we forget a lot of times though,

697
29:52.620 --> 29:54.570
it is horrible to be a patient

698
29:54.570 --> 29:56.310
in the system that we've generated today.

699
29:56.310 --> 29:59.760
So all of this needs to be geared

700
29:59.760 --> 30:01.627
towards improvement of that experience.

701
30:01.627 --> 30:03.330
And a patient's experience is going

702
30:03.330 --> 30:05.010
to be better when you have a liberated provider

703
30:05.010 --> 30:06.780
and a provider that feels like they can operate

704
30:06.780 --> 30:09.000
at the top of their license, that they can bring the empathy

705
30:09.000 --> 30:11.070
that is the origination of why they're in this industry

706
30:11.070 --> 30:14.070
to begin with, to the experience

707
30:14.070 --> 30:15.120
that that patient is having.

708
30:15.120 --> 30:20.040
So my hope is that we're okay with incrementalism,

709
30:20.040 --> 30:22.890
as long as there is a really clear focus

710
30:22.890 --> 30:24.900
on the improvement of those two experiences.

711
30:24.900 --> 30:25.770
'Cause it's broken right now.

712
30:25.770 --> 30:28.105
That relationship is fundamentally broken.

713
30:28.105 --> 30:31.259
<v ->Right, so part of our vision is</v>

714
30:31.259 --> 30:34.542
we've got to make the hospital smart

715
30:34.542 --> 30:39.542
so it is literally a member of the clinical care team.

716
30:39.600 --> 30:42.579
Feeding, delivering information over, you know,

717
30:42.579 --> 30:47.579
seamless, reliable connectivity platforms to the clinicians.

718
30:47.640 --> 30:50.370
So if you think about just, you know, use case example

719
30:50.370 --> 30:51.889
around the smart patient room,

720
30:51.889 --> 30:55.410
lots of things going on inside that patient room.

721
30:55.410 --> 30:56.580
Lots of data being collected

722
30:56.580 --> 31:01.230
around remote patient monitoring, fall detection,

723
31:01.230 --> 31:03.840
patient, you know, patient even controls

724
31:03.840 --> 31:05.760
around controlling the environments

725
31:05.760 --> 31:07.650
within the patient room around, you know,

726
31:07.650 --> 31:10.080
the lighting, the temperature.

727
31:10.080 --> 31:12.000
I need a blanket or I need my food.

728
31:12.000 --> 31:15.780
So instead of AI, we think of it as intelligent automation

729
31:15.780 --> 31:18.360
and automating that, that's relieving the burden

730
31:18.360 --> 31:20.840
on the nurses from running around doing non-essential tasks

731
31:20.840 --> 31:23.160
so they can then operate at the top of their license,

732
31:23.160 --> 31:24.270
but have a view.

733
31:24.270 --> 31:27.090
You have virtual nurses that can offload

734
31:27.090 --> 31:29.536
the nurses that are on site at the hospital

735
31:29.536 --> 31:32.010
where they can be monitoring patients

736
31:32.010 --> 31:34.683
in real time predictively.

737
31:36.090 --> 31:40.080
And then, also thinking about okay, you know,

738
31:40.080 --> 31:42.720
moving that now, you know, virtual discharge is

739
31:42.720 --> 31:45.150
another big low hanging fruit use case we're seeing

740
31:45.150 --> 31:48.270
where nurses can do that virtually inside the patient room.

741
31:48.270 --> 31:50.895
And then really taking that smart patient room,

742
31:50.895 --> 31:53.760
when we think about it, it's not just

743
31:53.760 --> 31:56.340
inside the four walls, but now into the home.

744
31:56.340 --> 31:59.430
And that's just another node, an endpoint

745
31:59.430 --> 32:02.820
on a, you know, unified, cohesive,

746
32:02.820 --> 32:06.300
connected network platform that's really becomes

747
32:06.300 --> 32:08.306
the care delivery platform.

748
32:08.306 --> 32:11.520
But if, you know, we make it smart, then it literally is,

749
32:11.520 --> 32:13.260
it's talking to those clinicians

750
32:13.260 --> 32:15.340
and doing a lot of their

751
32:17.040 --> 32:22.040
manual or you know, non-complex tasks.

752
32:22.050 --> 32:22.883
That offloads them.

753
32:22.883 --> 32:25.290
That's the number one thing we're seeing

754
32:25.290 --> 32:26.970
and having conversations around right now

755
32:26.970 --> 32:28.440
to relieve the burden

756
32:28.440 --> 32:30.633
and address the shortage of clinicians.

757
32:31.560 --> 32:35.038
<v ->Frontline health where we work looks very different.</v>

758
32:35.038 --> 32:38.280
And if folks haven't had the chance

759
32:38.280 --> 32:41.010
to visit Gates Foundation booth in Hall D,

760
32:41.010 --> 32:45.000
there's actually a really cool immersive experience there.

761
32:45.000 --> 32:45.833
You can put on

762
32:45.833 --> 32:46.770
a little helmet-
<v John>Tell us the number</v>

763
32:46.770 --> 32:47.790
of the section.

764
32:47.790 --> 32:50.510
<v ->It's D something five.</v>
<v John>Oh, sorry. Nevermind.</v>

765
32:50.510 --> 32:51.900
<v ->Something, something,</v>

766
32:51.900 --> 32:53.391
54735.
<v ->Okay, all right.</v>

767
32:53.391 --> 32:54.780
It's a big booth. I've seen it.

768
32:54.780 --> 32:56.310
<v ->It's a big one.</v>

769
32:56.310 --> 32:58.537
Turn right at the robot dog and you'll find us.

770
32:58.537 --> 33:01.505
But there's this really cool immersive experience there

771
33:01.505 --> 33:02.790
where you can put on these goggles

772
33:02.790 --> 33:05.520
and travel to a village in Zambia

773
33:05.520 --> 33:08.790
where you're following polio immunization workers.

774
33:08.790 --> 33:10.380
And this thing, I tried it out yesterday.

775
33:10.380 --> 33:12.270
I have traveled to these locations myself.

776
33:12.270 --> 33:15.270
It is incredibly evocative,

777
33:15.270 --> 33:18.840
and what you'll see is what the lived experience

778
33:18.840 --> 33:21.210
of a community healthcare worker in a setting like

779
33:21.210 --> 33:23.880
sub-Saharan Africa looks like.

780
33:23.880 --> 33:28.020
And so for us, AI is really transformative for those,

781
33:28.020 --> 33:30.289
call them CHWs, community healthcare workers

782
33:30.289 --> 33:32.310
in so many different ways.

783
33:32.310 --> 33:35.340
I mean, yes, there's the opportunity to have chat bots,

784
33:35.340 --> 33:38.209
especially chat bots done in local languages

785
33:38.209 --> 33:40.990
that they can use to sort of access information,

786
33:40.990 --> 33:44.070
review a patient's concerns,

787
33:44.070 --> 33:45.957
get some suggestions as to what's happening.

788
33:45.957 --> 33:48.720
And you have to remember these community healthcare workers,

789
33:48.720 --> 33:51.210
these are typically volunteers from the community.

790
33:51.210 --> 33:53.100
They're not nurses, they're not doctors,

791
33:53.100 --> 33:55.080
they're just individuals who might have

792
33:55.080 --> 33:57.105
no more than a grade school education.

793
33:57.105 --> 33:59.970
But through training courses

794
33:59.970 --> 34:03.750
and through essentially kind of decision tree algorithms,

795
34:03.750 --> 34:07.320
we have equipped this workforce with the ability to diagnose

796
34:07.320 --> 34:09.593
and treat some of the most common things that you'll see,

797
34:09.593 --> 34:11.280
you know, out there in these settings.

798
34:11.280 --> 34:13.407
Things like malaria, diarrheal diseases.

799
34:13.407 --> 34:16.590
And so with AI, you then have this opportunity

800
34:16.590 --> 34:19.170
to expand really by orders of magnitude,

801
34:19.170 --> 34:22.200
the ability of conditions that these CHWs are

802
34:22.200 --> 34:25.650
really equipped to diagnose and manage.

803
34:25.650 --> 34:28.328
So tremendous opportunity for improving sort

804
34:28.328 --> 34:31.530
of the footprint of care that they're able to offer.

805
34:31.530 --> 34:33.660
And the other thing that we see a lot of happening

806
34:33.660 --> 34:36.360
in the front lines isn't just patient level care

807
34:36.360 --> 34:38.010
but population level care.

808
34:38.010 --> 34:40.800
Global health is about population and public health.

809
34:40.800 --> 34:42.660
So how can you take AI tools

810
34:42.660 --> 34:44.760
and use them to improve service delivery

811
34:44.760 --> 34:47.010
for population level interventions?

812
34:47.010 --> 34:48.630
And you know, I could talk for hours

813
34:48.630 --> 34:50.542
about some of the things we do in the malaria

814
34:50.542 --> 34:53.100
and the polio and the immunization space,

815
34:53.100 --> 34:56.150
but things like using AI to process satellite imagery

816
34:56.150 --> 34:59.490
and identify what is likely a residential structure

817
34:59.490 --> 35:01.319
versus a non-residential structure

818
35:01.319 --> 35:03.597
so that a community healthcare worker can go out there

819
35:03.597 --> 35:06.390
with a smartphone, know which structures they have

820
35:06.390 --> 35:08.340
to visit to administer vaccines,

821
35:08.340 --> 35:10.420
they can quickly on that smartphone platform,

822
35:10.420 --> 35:12.660
mark a house as visited.

823
35:12.660 --> 35:15.210
That same cell phone platform can be used

824
35:15.210 --> 35:17.760
to issue a micropayment to that healthcare worker

825
35:17.760 --> 35:19.350
for their services.

826
35:19.350 --> 35:22.890
So we see AI as an incredibly enabling technology

827
35:22.890 --> 35:25.410
on the front lines, but also as something that's plugged

828
35:25.410 --> 35:28.200
into this larger digital health ecosystem.

829
35:28.200 --> 35:31.890
A lot of which boils down to one device in your hand.

830
35:31.890 --> 35:33.510
<v ->We only have a few minutes left.</v>

831
35:33.510 --> 35:37.080
So I wanna end with hearing from each of you.

832
35:37.080 --> 35:41.640
We talked about how tech and healthcare is different,

833
35:41.640 --> 35:45.627
but what can other tech industries learn

834
35:45.627 --> 35:47.910
from the health and wellness space

835
35:47.910 --> 35:52.890
that maybe they should adopt to be successful?

836
35:52.890 --> 35:54.340
Who wants to start with that?

837
35:57.660 --> 36:00.840
What are the lessons learned in the health space

838
36:00.840 --> 36:02.853
that others can benefit from?

839
36:05.160 --> 36:06.755
<v ->I'll start.</v>

840
36:06.755 --> 36:09.000
I think patience is something that we've had

841
36:09.000 --> 36:10.860
to learn in this industry.

842
36:10.860 --> 36:12.870
<v John>P-A-T-I-E-N-C-E.</v>

843
36:12.870 --> 36:14.242
<v ->Patience.</v>
<v ->T-I-E-N-C-E. (laughs)</v>

844
36:14.242 --> 36:15.840
<v ->No, P-A-T-I-I-E-N-C-E.</v>

845
36:15.840 --> 36:17.094
<v John>Okay, as opposed to-</v>

846
36:17.094 --> 36:18.837
<v ->Patience, not patients, but patience.</v>

847
36:18.837 --> 36:22.740
And I say that because the time it takes

848
36:22.740 --> 36:24.990
for innovation to proliferate in healthcare is

849
36:24.990 --> 36:27.590
probably three to four times as slow as it is

850
36:27.590 --> 36:28.650
in other sectors, right?

851
36:28.650 --> 36:33.540
And so when it happens, its scale, in that scalability,

852
36:33.540 --> 36:36.000
that moment comes, it's transformative,

853
36:36.000 --> 36:37.770
but it takes a lot of energy

854
36:37.770 --> 36:40.050
and a lot of patience to get there.

855
36:40.050 --> 36:42.150
And I think that for organizations

856
36:42.150 --> 36:44.790
that are thinking about coming into this space

857
36:44.790 --> 36:47.040
and even looking at things like commercial terms

858
36:47.040 --> 36:48.870
and you go, well, it takes 2 1/2 years,

859
36:48.870 --> 36:50.550
like, effectively to sell to a health system,

860
36:50.550 --> 36:51.457
and somebody looks at you like,

861
36:51.457 --> 36:53.280
"My sales cycle's 2 1/2 years?"

862
36:53.280 --> 36:58.117
Right, like, so I think there's a a degree of acceptance

863
36:58.117 --> 37:00.872
of, like, of the speed by which we operate

864
37:00.872 --> 37:02.640
and make decisions.

865
37:02.640 --> 37:04.202
And I think you have to be able

866
37:04.202 --> 37:07.590
to really address that meaningfully

867
37:07.590 --> 37:09.450
if you're going to make a change in this industry.

868
37:09.450 --> 37:11.274
<v ->That's a great point, 'cause the field often seems</v>

869
37:11.274 --> 37:15.843
very much in a rush to get something done.

870
37:17.850 --> 37:22.620
<v ->There's also in all industries that require things</v>

871
37:22.620 --> 37:25.110
to really, really work, you have to pay attention

872
37:25.110 --> 37:27.270
and have to have a higher level of quality.

873
37:27.270 --> 37:29.790
You don't want to have a pacemaker that's gonna give up

874
37:29.790 --> 37:30.840
at a certain amount of time.

875
37:30.840 --> 37:32.490
And so we have actually learned

876
37:32.490 --> 37:34.290
from a semiconductor point of view

877
37:34.290 --> 37:37.260
a lot on how to ensure certain levels of quality

878
37:37.260 --> 37:38.430
and so on in the devices.

879
37:38.430 --> 37:40.410
So that is something actually that

880
37:40.410 --> 37:42.270
other industries are taking great benefit

881
37:42.270 --> 37:45.150
from the work that we do together with them.

882
37:45.150 --> 37:48.085
<v ->Yeah, it's about the evidentiary threshold required</v>

883
37:48.085 --> 37:51.510
to get a technology to uptake.

884
37:51.510 --> 37:54.690
And I think as you're developing technology for health

885
37:54.690 --> 37:56.520
or developing it in other sectors,

886
37:56.520 --> 37:59.286
paying attention to the rest of that enabling ecosystem

887
37:59.286 --> 38:03.630
and what needs to be done in that regulatory space.

888
38:03.630 --> 38:04.890
Who are the policy makers?

889
38:04.890 --> 38:06.180
Who are the decision makers

890
38:06.180 --> 38:09.090
that will ultimately help your tech to get to market?

891
38:09.090 --> 38:11.610
I think there's a lot that other sectors can learn

892
38:11.610 --> 38:14.130
from how we in health manage what can be

893
38:14.130 --> 38:18.120
fairly complex stakeholder dynamics in that regulatory space

894
38:18.120 --> 38:20.696
to actually get things over that evidentiary threshold

895
38:20.696 --> 38:22.710
and into market.

896
38:22.710 --> 38:25.290
<v ->And, Karen, we'll give you the final word.</v>

897
38:25.290 --> 38:27.420
<v ->You know, it's funny, I spend so much time thinking</v>

898
38:27.420 --> 38:29.393
about what we can learn from the other industries

899
38:29.393 --> 38:30.750
to adopt for healthcare.

900
38:30.750 --> 38:32.250
<v ->I mixed it up at the end.</v>
<v ->So you're really</v>

901
38:32.250 --> 38:33.612
flipping the switch here.

902
38:33.612 --> 38:37.163
You know, I would say really what I'm most, you know,

903
38:37.163 --> 38:40.330
learnings and impressed by is

904
38:41.387 --> 38:45.120
the number of people

905
38:45.120 --> 38:47.460
and different stakeholders that truly want

906
38:47.460 --> 38:49.500
to try to figure it out and solve problems.

907
38:49.500 --> 38:51.942
And just working with, I spent a lot of time,

908
38:51.942 --> 38:54.240
surprisingly, I mean, really spending

909
38:54.240 --> 38:56.010
a lot of time talking to the clinicians,

910
38:56.010 --> 38:57.210
and like, what are they trying to...

911
38:57.210 --> 38:58.996
So really having access to that,

912
38:58.996 --> 39:03.450
the people that have the ideas and that are using it,

913
39:03.450 --> 39:06.510
and have to use the technology so that,

914
39:06.510 --> 39:08.250
you know, I know we've talked about people need

915
39:08.250 --> 39:10.920
to collaborate more, but there is a lot of, you know,

916
39:10.920 --> 39:12.720
brain, I think thoughts and ideas

917
39:12.720 --> 39:14.070
and collaboration going on.

918
39:14.070 --> 39:15.750
It's just a matter of now, like,

919
39:15.750 --> 39:17.790
how do we really actually execute, you know,

920
39:17.790 --> 39:20.610
stop talking about it and executing it?

921
39:20.610 --> 39:21.780
I do wanna do a shout out

922
39:21.780 --> 39:23.820
to a colleague, Fred Moltz, out there.

923
39:23.820 --> 39:27.000
I see you. Yeah, so interestingly enough, he's with Verizon.

924
39:27.000 --> 39:30.780
We met for the first time yesterday.

925
39:30.780 --> 39:32.160
We didn't know each other, but he leads

926
39:32.160 --> 39:35.910
our Accessibility Programs at Verizon,

927
39:35.910 --> 39:39.120
which is a huge thing in healthcare.

928
39:39.120 --> 39:40.650
But what we were talking about yesterday,

929
39:40.650 --> 39:42.840
and we're excited to collaborate more

930
39:42.840 --> 39:44.414
to figure out how do we bring that forward

931
39:44.414 --> 39:46.500
to solve really problems

932
39:46.500 --> 39:48.450
across all our verticals at Verizon.

933
39:48.450 --> 39:51.780
But if you solve it for, you know,

934
39:51.780 --> 39:54.720
what he shared with me which resonated is

935
39:54.720 --> 39:57.810
if you solve accessibility problems, you're really elevating

936
39:57.810 --> 40:01.830
and improving that experience for everybody,

937
40:01.830 --> 40:03.480
not just people with disabilities.

938
40:03.480 --> 40:05.940
So that's, like, a win-win across the board.

939
40:05.940 --> 40:08.670
So I think we can get some learnings from that

940
40:08.670 --> 40:11.520
and apply it, you know, to all aspects

941
40:11.520 --> 40:14.850
of different industries and life and verticals.

942
40:14.850 --> 40:16.500
<v ->Well, our red light is flashing,</v>

943
40:16.500 --> 40:18.180
so that means our time is up.

944
40:18.180 --> 40:19.343
I want to thank the panelists

945
40:19.343 --> 40:21.812
for sharing their insights this afternoon.

946
40:21.812 --> 40:26.812
