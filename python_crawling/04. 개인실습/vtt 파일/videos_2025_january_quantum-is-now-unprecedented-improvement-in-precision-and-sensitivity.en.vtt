00:00.200 --> 00:02.783
(upbeat music)

00:10.590 --> 00:11.423
- If you could take our seats,

00:11.423 --> 00:13.893
we'll get going with the
third session for the day.

00:15.450 --> 00:17.790
Again, for those of you that
are new, thank you for coming.

00:17.790 --> 00:19.140
This is the third segment

00:19.140 --> 00:22.230
of the Quantum Means
Business track at CES.

00:22.230 --> 00:23.880
And this segment,

00:23.880 --> 00:26.910
we're gonna talk about
devices and sensing.

00:26.910 --> 00:28.110
The first segment, if you remember,

00:28.110 --> 00:29.190
for those of you that we are in the room,

00:29.190 --> 00:31.170
we talked about computers and computing.

00:31.170 --> 00:34.230
The second segment was how
industry is gonna get engaged

00:34.230 --> 00:35.760
as we build the ecosystem,

00:35.760 --> 00:37.830
and this is going to be the bookend of it,

00:37.830 --> 00:40.560
talk about a completely
different part of quantum,

00:40.560 --> 00:42.060
which is the sensing side of it.

00:42.060 --> 00:44.370
And with that, it gives
me great, great pleasure

00:44.370 --> 00:45.930
to introduce a dear friend

00:45.930 --> 00:48.591
and somebody who sits
on my sitting committee,

00:48.591 --> 00:51.480
Celia Merzbacher who is the
Executive Director of QEDC,

00:51.480 --> 00:54.120
which is the Quantum Economic
Development Consortium,

00:54.120 --> 00:56.220
which is a group of quantum

00:56.220 --> 00:58.980
and related companies
that are working together

00:58.980 --> 01:00.840
to move the needle forward on industry.

01:00.840 --> 01:01.673
Celia?

01:02.826 --> 01:06.444
(audience applauding)

01:06.444 --> 01:08.280
That was front and back.

01:08.280 --> 01:10.470
- Thank you. Thank you
George, it's great to be here.

01:10.470 --> 01:12.900
And nice to see all of you

01:12.900 --> 01:16.620
and all of the interest in quantum at CES.

01:16.620 --> 01:19.500
When George told me that this
session was being planned,

01:19.500 --> 01:21.390
I said, "George, we
gotta do a good job here.

01:21.390 --> 01:23.520
We don't wanna fall on our face at CES."

01:23.520 --> 01:26.400
But obviously the word is out,

01:26.400 --> 01:28.380
it's the International Year of Quantum.

01:28.380 --> 01:31.530
And I'm really pleased to
be kicking off this part

01:31.530 --> 01:33.810
of the program talking
about quantum sensing,

01:33.810 --> 01:35.880
which as many of you may know,

01:35.880 --> 01:39.210
and I think was sort of alluded to,

01:39.210 --> 01:43.230
is some of the nearest term
use cases and applications.

01:43.230 --> 01:45.240
In fact, there are quantum-based sensors

01:45.240 --> 01:47.370
that are being made and sold today.

01:47.370 --> 01:50.970
So I run the Quantum Economic
Development Consortium.

01:50.970 --> 01:54.090
This is a consortium that
was created by Congress

01:54.090 --> 01:56.580
here in the US who directed the government

01:56.580 --> 01:59.370
to establish a consortium of stakeholders.

01:59.370 --> 02:00.990
But we're really industry-driven

02:00.990 --> 02:04.440
and our purpose is to enable
and grow the quantum ecosystem.

02:04.440 --> 02:07.350
And notice the word
computing is not in our name,

02:07.350 --> 02:08.430
it's not in our mission.

02:08.430 --> 02:10.830
We are helping to advance
quantum technologies

02:10.830 --> 02:12.810
for all use cases.

02:12.810 --> 02:14.610
And our membership spans everything

02:14.610 --> 02:18.030
from very fundamental component suppliers

02:18.030 --> 02:21.360
up to the big system integrators
that you've heard of,

02:21.360 --> 02:23.190
startup pure play companies

02:23.190 --> 02:25.320
that are building everything
from quantum computers

02:25.320 --> 02:28.050
and sensors and other technologies.

02:28.050 --> 02:29.220
So check us out.

02:29.220 --> 02:32.670
I'm not gonna talk about
QEDC anymore though today.

02:32.670 --> 02:35.613
So let's see. Ah, yeah.

02:38.077 --> 02:40.110
What I thought I would cover today

02:40.110 --> 02:42.840
in my 10 minutes are
the following questions.

02:42.840 --> 02:44.190
What is a quantum sensor?

02:44.190 --> 02:45.990
I'm assuming that there
are some in the audience,

02:45.990 --> 02:48.510
and I can't see very well
because of the lights,

02:48.510 --> 02:50.730
who don't know a lot about quantum

02:50.730 --> 02:52.830
and what a quantum sensor is.

02:52.830 --> 02:55.323
What is it good for? What can it measure?

02:56.310 --> 02:59.340
When will it be so good that
it beats what we have today?

02:59.340 --> 03:00.570
There are a lot of sensors out there.

03:00.570 --> 03:02.250
You can walk around the show floor here

03:02.250 --> 03:04.290
and see tons of sensors.

03:04.290 --> 03:07.140
So obviously a quantum-based sensor's

03:07.140 --> 03:10.110
gotta be better than the
incumbent technology.

03:10.110 --> 03:12.030
What is the current state of the art?

03:12.030 --> 03:13.260
So how close are we

03:13.260 --> 03:16.800
to when quantum sensors
will beat classical?

03:16.800 --> 03:20.430
And where will consumers
start seeing quantum sensors

03:20.430 --> 03:21.570
impacting their lives?

03:21.570 --> 03:23.040
Which again, because we're at CES,

03:23.040 --> 03:25.680
I thought, let's think about that.

03:25.680 --> 03:27.090
Okay, let me just start,

03:27.090 --> 03:28.920
I'll back up if I can figure out how.

03:28.920 --> 03:32.250
Well never mind. What is a quantum sensor?

03:32.250 --> 03:34.770
A quantum sensor, just like any sensor,

03:34.770 --> 03:37.953
is some system that can,

03:39.355 --> 03:40.770
through interaction with its environment,

03:40.770 --> 03:42.930
have some kind of a change
that you can measure.

03:42.930 --> 03:44.370
It's as simple as that.

03:44.370 --> 03:46.080
And of course there are
many different kinds

03:46.080 --> 03:48.360
of temperature sensors for instance,

03:48.360 --> 03:50.850
you could say a stick of
butter is a temperature sensor,

03:50.850 --> 03:52.920
gets too hot, it melts.

03:52.920 --> 03:57.750
So there are a lot of
quantum systems out there,

03:57.750 --> 04:01.740
and a sort of feature which
is problematic frankly

04:01.740 --> 04:03.600
in the quantum computing space,

04:03.600 --> 04:06.120
but it's help in the sensing space,

04:06.120 --> 04:09.150
is that quantum states are very fragile

04:09.150 --> 04:10.890
and very sensitive to the environment.

04:10.890 --> 04:12.420
And that's why of course some

04:12.420 --> 04:14.490
of the quantum computing systems have

04:14.490 --> 04:16.380
to be kept at very low temperatures

04:16.380 --> 04:20.790
because even just thermal
noise causes errors.

04:20.790 --> 04:24.780
And so for this is the
definition of a good sensor.

04:24.780 --> 04:26.940
And so there are, as I said,

04:26.940 --> 04:29.880
many different kinds of quantum systems.

04:29.880 --> 04:31.380
They need to be stable,

04:31.380 --> 04:34.590
they need to be
initializable and measurable.

04:34.590 --> 04:38.580
There are some criteria
for taking a quantum system

04:38.580 --> 04:40.230
and making it into a sensor.

04:40.230 --> 04:43.260
But there are many
different kinds of devices

04:43.260 --> 04:46.083
that are at the heart of quantum sensors.

04:47.310 --> 04:49.290
In terms of what can a sensor measure,

04:49.290 --> 04:52.035
so if you asked a physicist

04:52.035 --> 04:54.360
or somebody who sort of
is a quantum technologist

04:54.360 --> 04:58.110
what a sensor can measure, they
might give a list like this,

04:58.110 --> 05:00.000
it can measure chemicals,

05:00.000 --> 05:03.180
is there a presence of some
particular chemical agent,

05:03.180 --> 05:04.560
magnetic field,

05:04.560 --> 05:07.980
they're very good at detecting
changes in magnetic field

05:07.980 --> 05:10.080
or electromagnetic fields.

05:10.080 --> 05:12.990
They can detect gravity
change very sensitively.

05:12.990 --> 05:14.340
You can have a sensor

05:14.340 --> 05:16.530
that can detect the change in gravity

05:16.530 --> 05:18.600
just by moving it up one centimeter,

05:18.600 --> 05:20.850
the sort of change in the attraction

05:20.850 --> 05:24.423
with the earth can be
detected so precisely.

05:25.500 --> 05:26.580
Temperature is something

05:26.580 --> 05:29.550
that can be measured by quantum sensors,

05:29.550 --> 05:32.340
location and velocity and time.

05:32.340 --> 05:35.250
And those are all critical to positioning

05:35.250 --> 05:37.950
and navigation type of applications.

05:37.950 --> 05:42.060
So that brings me to sort of what someone

05:42.060 --> 05:44.250
who is really in the
development of a sensor

05:44.250 --> 05:46.437
for some purpose might say,

05:46.437 --> 05:48.540
what can a quantum sensor measure?

05:48.540 --> 05:49.950
Well, there are companies

05:49.950 --> 05:52.470
that are making quantum
sensor-based technologies

05:52.470 --> 05:56.583
for measuring methane leaks
in oil wells or gas wells.

05:57.540 --> 05:59.790
They could also be used
for measuring breath,

05:59.790 --> 06:02.040
doing breath analysis for instance.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.470
So lots of different applications

06:04.470 --> 06:07.293
might take advantage of
quantum measurements.

06:08.600 --> 06:09.480
Magnetic field detection,

06:09.480 --> 06:11.220
and we were gonna hear a
little bit more about that

06:11.220 --> 06:13.560
from one of the speakers later,

06:13.560 --> 06:15.930
could be used to measure brain signals

06:15.930 --> 06:17.940
and make images of the brain.

06:17.940 --> 06:20.940
Gravity can be used to
detect underground anomalies,

06:20.940 --> 06:24.933
that might be a submarine
undersea or a tunnel underground.

06:26.093 --> 06:27.840
And and you can see the
list here and position

06:27.840 --> 06:29.760
and navigation are two areas

06:29.760 --> 06:33.570
where quantum sensing is
potentially gonna be very useful

06:33.570 --> 06:37.050
in being able to do
navigation without GPS,

06:37.050 --> 06:38.340
and the government and military

06:38.340 --> 06:40.350
are particularly interested in that.

06:40.350 --> 06:42.750
So when will a quantum
sensor beat classical?

06:42.750 --> 06:45.423
Well, it depends, as is often the answer.

06:46.380 --> 06:48.660
It depends on what the requirements are.

06:48.660 --> 06:51.870
Here's a picture of the
most precise atomic clock,

06:51.870 --> 06:55.080
it's at NIST and it takes
up pretty much a room.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.640
But a lot of times,

06:56.640 --> 07:00.630
you don't really wanna put
something that big on a platform.

07:00.630 --> 07:01.890
It's not very practical.

07:01.890 --> 07:05.610
So the defense department ran a program

07:05.610 --> 07:07.980
to create a chip scale atomic clock

07:07.980 --> 07:09.330
and it was a successful program.

07:09.330 --> 07:10.163
And this is a technology,

07:10.163 --> 07:11.853
this is a product you can buy today,

07:14.826 --> 07:16.890
so the largest market for
these chip scale atomic clocks

07:16.890 --> 07:19.950
outside of government is
in oil and gas exploration,

07:19.950 --> 07:21.390
which I don't think they anticipated

07:21.390 --> 07:23.370
when they did the program.

07:23.370 --> 07:25.710
So a lot of things depend on size, weight,

07:25.710 --> 07:28.410
and power requirements,
but also of course cost.

07:28.410 --> 07:30.165
And if you wanna put it on every car

07:30.165 --> 07:35.165
or in every home, it's
gotta be more affordable.

07:35.910 --> 07:38.910
And even these chip scale atomic clocks

07:38.910 --> 07:41.310
are still relatively expensive.

07:41.310 --> 07:42.870
There are, in some industries,

07:42.870 --> 07:45.240
regulations that you're
gonna have to clear

07:45.240 --> 07:48.210
for biomedical applications for instance.

07:48.210 --> 07:49.755
Standards could be very important.

07:49.755 --> 07:52.050
It's a little early still in some cases,

07:52.050 --> 07:53.940
but there are organizations starting

07:53.940 --> 07:55.080
to think about standards.

07:55.080 --> 07:57.210
And then ultimately adoption,

07:57.210 --> 07:59.820
and there sort of is a
chicken and egg problem.

07:59.820 --> 08:01.470
For some of these technologies,

08:01.470 --> 08:04.620
the market isn't as big as it could be,

08:04.620 --> 08:07.960
and so suppliers don't always
wanna make the investments

08:08.915 --> 08:11.760
to support the industry.

08:11.760 --> 08:13.470
This is just a really quick example

08:13.470 --> 08:15.780
and I'll go through it
quickly on brain imaging.

08:15.780 --> 08:17.580
Right now, the state of the art involves

08:17.580 --> 08:20.160
sitting in a big cryo cooled MRI machine

08:20.160 --> 08:22.140
in a magnetically shielded room.

08:22.140 --> 08:23.280
All that's very expensive.

08:23.280 --> 08:25.893
There are about 200 in the whole world.

08:27.120 --> 08:30.150
There are companies who
are building brain scanning

08:30.150 --> 08:33.360
technology into these
wearable helmets that children

08:33.360 --> 08:36.180
or people who are being studied

08:36.180 --> 08:37.500
while they're doing something

08:37.500 --> 08:40.200
and not just sitting still in a machine.

08:40.200 --> 08:43.100
So this is opening up, this
is really enabling technology.

08:44.280 --> 08:47.910
The company I work for, SRI International,

08:47.910 --> 08:49.730
Stanford Research Institute,

08:49.730 --> 08:53.310
partnered with Twinleaf, a
startup in Princeton University

08:53.310 --> 08:56.670
to do a version of this that is standoff.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.080
So you don't even have to wear a helmet.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.340
This panel that's next

08:59.340 --> 09:02.310
to the head can measure the brain imaging,

09:02.310 --> 09:05.040
and that's, you can see,
still very researchy,

09:05.040 --> 09:07.053
but is showing a lot of promise.

09:07.980 --> 09:10.680
And this is just a
illustration of a gravimeter,

09:10.680 --> 09:11.580
it's available now.

09:11.580 --> 09:14.490
You can buy this and take
it out into the environment

09:14.490 --> 09:16.170
and make measurements of gravity.

09:16.170 --> 09:18.450
On the right hand side is sort of a map

09:18.450 --> 09:20.940
of what you might detect.

09:20.940 --> 09:24.090
And you have to of course
be able to map the signals

09:24.090 --> 09:26.250
onto what it is you're looking at.

09:26.250 --> 09:28.140
So there's work to be done.

09:28.140 --> 09:30.600
So where will consumers,
I'm just wrapping up here.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.460
I see I have about 40 seconds left.

09:32.460 --> 09:34.890
Where will consumers first
see quantum technology

09:34.890 --> 09:37.980
and quantum sensors impacting daily life?

09:37.980 --> 09:39.750
Well, okay, I'm gonna take a sort of

09:39.750 --> 09:41.880
tongue in cheek answer to this.

09:41.880 --> 09:43.230
I think I've given you an idea

09:43.230 --> 09:45.660
of some of the applications and use cases.

09:45.660 --> 09:47.790
I don't think we know, frankly,

09:47.790 --> 09:49.920
where quantum is going
to impact our daily life.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.740
And when we come back to CES

09:51.740 --> 09:54.780
in a year or five years and more,

09:54.780 --> 09:56.820
it's gonna be very exciting to see

09:56.820 --> 09:59.520
where quantum is being used.

09:59.520 --> 10:01.473
But it's being used for marketing,

10:02.310 --> 10:04.830
and if you go out and
look on the internet,

10:04.830 --> 10:07.383
and I don't endorse any of these products,

10:08.220 --> 10:11.310
but Quantum is being used to
obviously say this is something

10:11.310 --> 10:16.230
that's new and has some interesting
characteristics perhaps.

10:16.230 --> 10:21.230
On the bottom left is like
ant killer and paint thinner.

10:21.390 --> 10:24.300
Top right, we have Quantum
vodka or something,

10:24.300 --> 10:28.860
and then there are sort of
these health-related products.

10:28.860 --> 10:32.370
So it will be very exciting to see

10:32.370 --> 10:35.700
where quantum technology goes into things,

10:35.700 --> 10:39.330
and I think there's a lot
of positive association.

10:39.330 --> 10:42.180
I think that there's a lot of enthusiasm.

10:42.180 --> 10:45.570
I don't see any roadblocks to progress.

10:45.570 --> 10:48.930
And so I'm excited to be here
at CES for the first time,

10:48.930 --> 10:50.370
and I hope to be back again soon,

10:50.370 --> 10:52.260
and I'm around for the rest of the day.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.090
So if any of you are
interested in learning more

10:54.090 --> 10:56.460
about QEDC or about quantum sensors,

10:56.460 --> 10:57.750
I'd be happy to talk to you.

10:57.750 --> 11:00.330
So with that, I will
turn it over to George

11:00.330 --> 11:02.940
who's gonna introduce the
moderator for the panel.

11:02.940 --> 11:04.073
Thank you very much.

11:04.073 --> 11:07.240
(audience applauding)

11:15.120 --> 11:16.070
- Thank you, Celia.

11:21.900 --> 11:24.270
It gives me great pleasure to introduce,

11:24.270 --> 11:27.180
to reintroduce Philippe
to come back up here

11:27.180 --> 11:30.810
to do a panel discussion
about sensing in the market

11:30.810 --> 11:33.330
with two companies in the
quantum sensing space.

11:33.330 --> 11:34.980
And the one thing I will
mention about Philippe

11:34.980 --> 11:38.400
as he makes his way up
here is from what I know,

11:38.400 --> 11:40.890
he's the first person
who's actually exited

11:40.890 --> 11:43.680
or sold a quantum sensing
company in the world.

11:43.680 --> 11:46.030
So Philippe, thank you
again. Please go for it.

11:49.066 --> 11:51.810
(audience applauding)

11:51.810 --> 11:53.450
- [Philippe] Wow, thank you very much.

11:58.076 --> 12:00.777
- [George] Can you hear me or no?

12:00.777 --> 12:01.610
Oh yeah.

12:01.610 --> 12:03.925
Okay, now it actually works.

12:03.925 --> 12:06.480
- Still no? Oh yeah.

12:06.480 --> 12:08.613
Thank you for the introduction,

12:09.510 --> 12:11.790
and very nice introduction
about quantum sensing.

12:11.790 --> 12:14.310
I'm very happy that you
used like an example

12:14.310 --> 12:17.400
of the product I've been
developing over the past decade,

12:17.400 --> 12:19.260
that's the gravimeter which
was sitting on the top

12:19.260 --> 12:20.613
of the volcano.

12:22.470 --> 12:26.977
So we have the pleasure to have two CEOs

12:29.040 --> 12:31.290
of quantum sensing companies.

12:31.290 --> 12:32.950
And there are more companies

12:33.810 --> 12:36.450
and many more business cases

12:36.450 --> 12:39.630
that have been developed
over the past years

12:39.630 --> 12:41.220
with quantum sensors.

12:41.220 --> 12:43.770
We will spend the next 20 minutes

12:43.770 --> 12:47.440
to discuss a little bit these applications

12:47.440 --> 12:49.290
and maybe raise a few points

12:49.290 --> 12:50.430
or address a few questions

12:50.430 --> 12:52.920
that you raised in your introduction.

12:52.920 --> 12:57.920
But maybe first, if you can
describe in a few words,

12:58.180 --> 12:59.692
what is your company,

12:59.692 --> 13:02.310
what is the quantum
sensor you're so proud of?

13:02.310 --> 13:05.040
- Yeah, so thank you first of all

13:05.040 --> 13:06.540
for this opportunity to
come and talk to you.

13:06.540 --> 13:10.800
So our company is focused
on solving problems

13:10.800 --> 13:12.450
in building electronic systems,

13:12.450 --> 13:16.110
particularly as the
scaling of advanced silicon

13:16.110 --> 13:20.040
is happening from nanometer
to angstrom level,

13:20.040 --> 13:24.060
and more importantly also now
these advanced 3D packages.

13:24.060 --> 13:26.910
And so really building the systems,

13:26.910 --> 13:28.470
it's a large industry you're aware of

13:28.470 --> 13:30.630
heading to trillion dollars,

13:30.630 --> 13:33.930
and there are some very
complex unsolved problems

13:33.930 --> 13:35.850
which offer a discontinuity in terms

13:35.850 --> 13:38.160
of opportunity using quantum sensing.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.810
So that's what we are focused on.

13:41.160 --> 13:42.260
- Thank you, and Noel?

13:43.590 --> 13:45.690
- Thank you, good morning, everyone.

13:45.690 --> 13:48.030
So yeah, it's a pleasure to be here today.

13:48.030 --> 13:49.470
Our company, Neuranics.

13:49.470 --> 13:51.300
we are a relatively new company.

13:51.300 --> 13:53.220
We're based in Scotland,

13:53.220 --> 13:58.110
so we are looking at detecting
very small magnetic activity

13:58.110 --> 13:59.640
of muscles in the body.

13:59.640 --> 14:02.520
So we're very much using quantum sensing

14:02.520 --> 14:06.420
to detect very low picotesla signals

14:06.420 --> 14:08.730
from the muscles and activity in the body.

14:08.730 --> 14:09.960
And what we're looking to do with that is

14:09.960 --> 14:12.540
to develop real world solutions

14:12.540 --> 14:14.970
that will go into human machine interface

14:14.970 --> 14:17.670
where we'll able to detect full movement

14:17.670 --> 14:19.020
of the hands and the fingers

14:19.020 --> 14:22.140
and the hands and produce wrist bands

14:22.140 --> 14:24.270
that will have human machine interface.

14:24.270 --> 14:25.910
So we're looking at
real world applications

14:25.910 --> 14:27.600
on how quantum technologies

14:27.600 --> 14:30.183
can address everyday applications.

14:31.350 --> 14:34.080
- Wow, thank you for this presentation.

14:34.080 --> 14:37.140
So as a physicist, I'm
always thrilled to hear

14:37.140 --> 14:38.220
what a quantum sensor can do,

14:38.220 --> 14:41.520
but that's usually not the
best way to sell it actually.

14:41.520 --> 14:45.480
And so we're here at the
Consumer Electronics Show.

14:45.480 --> 14:48.300
So maybe my question is the product,

14:48.300 --> 14:51.420
the quantum sensor you
have been developing,

14:51.420 --> 14:53.370
very often we speak
about quantum advantage

14:53.370 --> 14:55.920
for quantum computing, but
also for quantum sensing.

14:55.920 --> 14:58.830
So what is the quantum
advantage of your product?

14:58.830 --> 15:01.460
Why should we actually
choose your product,

15:01.460 --> 15:02.700
or why did you choose actually

15:02.700 --> 15:04.440
to develop this specific technology

15:04.440 --> 15:05.760
or to use this specific technology

15:05.760 --> 15:07.890
for this specific application?

15:07.890 --> 15:09.300
- So I think it's a good question.

15:09.300 --> 15:12.420
So really our focus at a
macro level is not necessarily

15:12.420 --> 15:13.620
I would say quantum,

15:13.620 --> 15:16.410
it's really what problem
we are trying to solve.

15:16.410 --> 15:18.810
So our team is a group of physicists

15:18.810 --> 15:22.170
who have been working on the
fundamental quantum solve state

15:22.170 --> 15:23.850
spin sensors.

15:23.850 --> 15:26.280
My background is all semiconductor,

15:26.280 --> 15:27.390
so I think it was a good marriage.

15:27.390 --> 15:30.480
I approached from what
problem we're trying to solve,

15:30.480 --> 15:33.360
and really can we be the order

15:33.360 --> 15:36.180
of magnitude differentiated
being a startup,

15:36.180 --> 15:38.670
and it has to be a couple
of orders of magnitude.

15:38.670 --> 15:42.360
And the problem we are
focused on is particularly

15:42.360 --> 15:43.653
as you're building this,

15:45.030 --> 15:48.090
the more than Moore's law in
terms of advanced packages,

15:48.090 --> 15:49.170
it's very common today

15:49.170 --> 15:51.210
if you look at most of the
companies like Nvidia and all,

15:51.210 --> 15:53.910
their entire product line is a combination

15:53.910 --> 15:57.300
of putting a bunch of silicon
inside this advanced packages

15:57.300 --> 16:00.660
where you are both in
a 2.5D 3D configuration

16:00.660 --> 16:02.610
building these complex systems.

16:02.610 --> 16:06.120
The HBM memory stacks
started from four high

16:06.120 --> 16:09.330
where you're putting these
DRAMs on top of each other,

16:09.330 --> 16:11.520
it's almost like you're
folding the silicon

16:11.520 --> 16:13.350
and going in the third dimension.

16:13.350 --> 16:15.430
While that's a great solution

16:16.410 --> 16:18.750
to continue the semiconductor revolution,

16:18.750 --> 16:21.240
it has some fundamental
challenges to be able

16:21.240 --> 16:25.380
to see magnetic fields between
these layers, so to speak,

16:25.380 --> 16:27.630
the buried current flow.

16:27.630 --> 16:29.640
Today, there is no sensing modality,

16:29.640 --> 16:31.590
literally it does not exist,

16:31.590 --> 16:35.130
which can look at that and
be used in the manufacturing

16:35.130 --> 16:38.847
because as you all know,
this industry, 2024,

16:38.847 --> 16:41.610
600 billion heading to a trillion.

16:41.610 --> 16:43.440
So that's what we focused on.

16:43.440 --> 16:46.170
And the quantum sensing
in terms of being able

16:46.170 --> 16:49.440
to use solid state spin sensors

16:49.440 --> 16:53.220
and detect buried 3D
vector magnetic fields

16:53.220 --> 16:55.980
is a very unique value proposition,

16:55.980 --> 16:59.133
which there is no other
technology which can do today.

17:00.419 --> 17:01.770
And that's the two we are trying to marry,

17:01.770 --> 17:04.830
pick a killer problem and pick a solution.

17:04.830 --> 17:07.860
And in both, that combination,

17:07.860 --> 17:10.950
we are orders of magnitude
better than anything else.

17:10.950 --> 17:12.600
So that's what we are focused on.

17:14.220 --> 17:15.360
- Thank you.

17:15.360 --> 17:19.920
- So yeah, our core
technology is based on TMR,

17:19.920 --> 17:21.810
Tunneling Magnetic Resistance,

17:21.810 --> 17:24.180
which is a quantum
effect where you're able

17:24.180 --> 17:28.620
to detect very small picotesla
levels of magnetic activity.

17:28.620 --> 17:31.890
And our company has spun out
from the University of Glasgow

17:31.890 --> 17:34.680
and the University of
Edinburgh, a joint spin-out.

17:34.680 --> 17:37.770
And we're really looking at
bringing quantum technology

17:37.770 --> 17:42.060
into a semiconductor platform
so that it's addressable,

17:42.060 --> 17:43.560
it's sellable, it's cheap,

17:43.560 --> 17:46.770
it's accessible for everyday applications.

17:46.770 --> 17:50.040
So we're bringing that to the
world of biomedical sensing.

17:50.040 --> 17:53.970
If we look at the solutions
that are available currently

17:53.970 --> 17:56.760
for looking deep inside
the muscles in the body,

17:56.760 --> 17:58.560
you're looking at very expensive equipment

17:58.560 --> 18:00.360
such as squid sensors

18:00.360 --> 18:03.060
or OPM sensors that are tens of thousands

18:03.060 --> 18:05.460
of dollars per resident.

18:05.460 --> 18:08.610
We're trying to bring
this into a few dollar

18:08.610 --> 18:11.460
semiconductor piece
that can be applied then

18:11.460 --> 18:14.220
to consumer electronics
parts in the future.

18:14.220 --> 18:16.230
So we're looking at addressing

18:16.230 --> 18:19.320
how do we look at the activity of muscles

18:19.320 --> 18:22.680
in a consumer electronics product

18:22.680 --> 18:24.870
that gives you new
features and new benefits

18:24.870 --> 18:28.680
and something that could be
tangible for people to use.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.950
So we have a lot of PhD researchers

18:31.950 --> 18:36.150
into quantum effects and how
to build quantum sensors.

18:36.150 --> 18:38.280
I'm interested in how
to commercialize this,

18:38.280 --> 18:40.650
how to bring this to the
real world applications,

18:40.650 --> 18:43.950
looking at what solutions we
can deliver to the market.

18:43.950 --> 18:47.760
And we feel that there
is a lot of emphasis

18:47.760 --> 18:50.490
on new human machine interfaces

18:50.490 --> 18:52.830
using electrical signals from the body.

18:52.830 --> 18:54.630
But that causes a lot of problems

18:54.630 --> 18:56.850
in that you need tight skin contact,

18:56.850 --> 19:01.140
you need really tight
contact onto the skin

19:01.140 --> 19:03.000
to receive those electrical signals.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.040
Whereas if you had a magnetic signal,

19:05.040 --> 19:07.170
you're able to stay
further away from the body,

19:07.170 --> 19:08.640
you're able to monitor those signals,

19:08.640 --> 19:11.340
you're able to get better
spatial resolution.

19:11.340 --> 19:14.370
So quantum gives us a lot
of benefits in the market

19:14.370 --> 19:16.409
that we're trying to address.

19:16.409 --> 19:17.580
- Thank you.

19:17.580 --> 19:21.510
So maybe before diving to another topic,

19:21.510 --> 19:23.490
I would like to elaborate
a little bit on this

19:23.490 --> 19:26.130
and also on this aspect that

19:26.130 --> 19:27.780
Celia mentioned in her introduction

19:27.780 --> 19:30.540
that there is an important step

19:30.540 --> 19:34.500
or an important difficulty
for sensing in general,

19:34.500 --> 19:37.257
which is the SWaP,
size, weight, and power,

19:37.257 --> 19:38.613
and also the price.

19:39.450 --> 19:43.110
And very often I also experienced that

19:43.110 --> 19:45.540
that it's not yet a big market.

19:45.540 --> 19:47.970
So sometimes you need
to do things on your own

19:47.970 --> 19:51.780
because you don't have so
much of a like scalability.

19:51.780 --> 19:56.780
So could you maybe give
us some of the difficulty

19:56.940 --> 20:00.840
you had to overcome in
order to get to a product,

20:00.840 --> 20:02.100
and then we'll maybe address

20:02.100 --> 20:03.570
how this product can go to the market.

20:03.570 --> 20:06.360
But I think it's important
to get the product first.

20:06.360 --> 20:09.240
- And I think that way,
Noel and I kind of represent

20:09.240 --> 20:10.740
a little bit two different spectrums.

20:10.740 --> 20:13.410
So it's very interesting
probably to get that.

20:13.410 --> 20:15.453
So in our case, really,

20:16.346 --> 20:17.730
in terms of the solid state spin sensors

20:17.730 --> 20:21.150
where there's a NV diamond,
which is CVD grown,

20:21.150 --> 20:22.410
actually it's available today

20:22.410 --> 20:25.050
and in a relatively very mature state,

20:25.050 --> 20:28.350
and there are companies
like Element 6 and all

20:28.350 --> 20:32.130
which can grow these diamond CVD insert

20:32.130 --> 20:34.860
at layer in terms of these NV sensors

20:34.860 --> 20:36.960
and they operate both
in extreme environments

20:36.960 --> 20:38.220
and room temp.

20:38.220 --> 20:39.690
And a sensor can cost,

20:39.690 --> 20:42.360
let's say a couple of thousand dollars.

20:42.360 --> 20:44.253
But the application we chose,

20:45.638 --> 20:46.920
really that thousand dollar sensor,

20:46.920 --> 20:49.020
which can be produced reliably

20:49.020 --> 20:51.340
and can operate in extreme environments

20:52.920 --> 20:54.150
is the value proposition.

20:54.150 --> 20:56.310
So because our system we are building

20:56.310 --> 20:59.054
will be in hundreds of
thousands of dollars

20:59.054 --> 21:00.300
or potentially even higher.

21:00.300 --> 21:05.220
So it was more, I think
for us, the quantum sensor

21:05.220 --> 21:07.980
we are using, the fundamental NV sensor,

21:07.980 --> 21:11.460
the manufacturing of that
and a reliable supply chain.

21:11.460 --> 21:12.750
And now there are a number of companies

21:12.750 --> 21:14.550
which are doing that across the globe

21:14.550 --> 21:16.830
in terms of building this fundamental NV.

21:16.830 --> 21:19.630
Today, a lot of users are in
the industrial application,

21:21.090 --> 21:23.700
building some really advanced devices.

21:23.700 --> 21:26.550
So for us, really the barrier of entry

21:26.550 --> 21:29.130
is not necessarily the sensor itself,

21:29.130 --> 21:31.020
it's really sensor is
a piece of the puzzle,

21:31.020 --> 21:34.410
but putting the entire system
solution in terms of sensing,

21:34.410 --> 21:36.000
in terms of imaging,

21:36.000 --> 21:40.830
and then the most important
is to meet the performance

21:40.830 --> 21:42.437
and throughput requirements of the problem

21:42.437 --> 21:44.400
we are trying to solve.

21:44.400 --> 21:46.500
So I think in our case, almost,

21:46.500 --> 21:49.800
and I think both quantum
is a good and a bad thing,

21:49.800 --> 21:52.470
a lot of times when you
talk to the VC investors

21:52.470 --> 21:55.170
and all that, as soon
as you lose the quantum,

21:55.170 --> 21:57.270
you see a little bit of a resistance

21:57.270 --> 21:59.223
because they think the investment is,

22:00.300 --> 22:02.220
let's say five plus years out.

22:02.220 --> 22:04.920
But in our case, I think
we are more limited

22:04.920 --> 22:08.823
by building the entire system stack.

22:09.750 --> 22:12.790
The fundamental sensor, the
fundamental NV technology

22:14.300 --> 22:15.133
is solid today.

22:15.133 --> 22:16.950
So we are focused on the
higher layers of the problem,

22:16.950 --> 22:18.660
the sensing, the imaging,

22:18.660 --> 22:22.560
improving our imaging from ODMR

22:22.560 --> 22:24.600
to let's say going more like Ramsay

22:24.600 --> 22:27.123
and RABI imaging techniques and all.

22:28.281 --> 22:29.490
So bringing all the levels of physics

22:29.490 --> 22:32.703
and then being able to offer
the complete system solution.

22:33.780 --> 22:36.480
So in our case, the
limiter is not the sensor,

22:36.480 --> 22:39.660
the limiter is connecting a problem

22:39.660 --> 22:41.700
and being able to solve and offer

22:41.700 --> 22:44.133
a full system stack solution.

22:47.370 --> 22:49.350
- So we're addressing it

22:49.350 --> 22:52.230
with three technology blocks,

22:52.230 --> 22:55.140
the sensor is obviously a
very important first step

22:55.140 --> 22:56.130
along the way.

22:56.130 --> 22:58.630
We need to get a sensor
that's able to detect

22:59.670 --> 23:03.870
sub-picotesla levels of
sensitivity from the muscles,

23:03.870 --> 23:06.480
that allows to give us the
resolution that we need

23:06.480 --> 23:08.340
and the signal quality
that we need in order

23:08.340 --> 23:12.090
to determine position of
fingers for example in the hand.

23:12.090 --> 23:15.480
We then need to apply custom (indistinct)

23:15.480 --> 23:18.300
to amplify those signals
to make them usable.

23:18.300 --> 23:20.790
We then need to apply machine
learning to those signals

23:20.790 --> 23:22.980
then to interpret those signals as well.

23:22.980 --> 23:25.680
So we've got three
distinct technical blocks

23:25.680 --> 23:28.110
that we need to address as a company,

23:28.110 --> 23:30.060
but we see that we need to do all of that

23:30.060 --> 23:32.100
to provide a solution.

23:32.100 --> 23:34.260
And that the solution then could be closer

23:34.260 --> 23:35.900
to the market requirements.

23:35.900 --> 23:38.430
If we were just to provide
the sensor on its own,

23:38.430 --> 23:40.350
it'll sit on the shelf
and nobody will use it.

23:40.350 --> 23:41.730
But if we can provide a solution,

23:41.730 --> 23:43.050
then people will then be interested

23:43.050 --> 23:44.730
in experimenting with hat solution,

23:44.730 --> 23:48.000
we'd provide a dev kit,
people can play with that,

23:48.000 --> 23:49.920
and it brings the
solution closer to market

23:49.920 --> 23:51.117
and allows people to address that

23:51.117 --> 23:53.913
and to experiment with
the technology quickly.

23:55.560 --> 23:56.393
- Thank you.

23:56.393 --> 24:00.610
So I would like now to
exactly go towards the market

24:01.560 --> 24:04.230
and towards the consumers, of course,

24:04.230 --> 24:06.930
except maybe for the
butter that you mentioned,

24:06.930 --> 24:10.020
those sensors that are not
directly acquired by consumers,

24:10.020 --> 24:13.020
they're part of like more complex systems.

24:13.020 --> 24:18.020
But overall I think we
also addressed it before,

24:18.810 --> 24:20.520
we feel that there is still a lot of work

24:20.520 --> 24:21.360
to be done in order

24:21.360 --> 24:23.430
to penetrate the market
with a quantum sensor.

24:23.430 --> 24:27.417
And I would like to have your
feedback, your experience.

24:27.417 --> 24:29.417
And so how hard was it? What was needed?

24:31.017 --> 24:34.710
Basically what is making
a customer pivot to use

24:34.710 --> 24:38.970
and to engage into a
quantum sensor acquisition?

24:38.970 --> 24:43.170
- Yeah, so again, what we are seeing is

24:43.170 --> 24:45.960
the industry, like
semiconductor, batteries,

24:45.960 --> 24:48.720
I think there was a lot of
discussion around batteries,

24:48.720 --> 24:51.390
are looking for much
more higher sensitivity

24:51.390 --> 24:53.010
and resolution than what can be today

24:53.010 --> 24:54.990
with classical sensors.

24:54.990 --> 24:56.293
So there is a fundamental need.

24:56.293 --> 24:59.850
A good example is much like
semiconductor manufacturing,

24:59.850 --> 25:02.700
battery manufacturing, batteries like,

25:02.700 --> 25:05.910
I almost feel like what
semiconductor was in the '80s.

25:05.910 --> 25:09.573
The hockey stick of the
batteries is ahead of us,

25:10.743 --> 25:12.270
and fundamentally there'll
be all different kind

25:12.270 --> 25:15.300
of chemistries and batteries everywhere.

25:15.300 --> 25:17.400
And today if you look at
battery manufacturing,

25:17.400 --> 25:20.160
they throw away 15, 20% of their yield

25:20.160 --> 25:22.560
because putting these complex
battery cells together

25:22.560 --> 25:24.660
and being able to manufacture this battery

25:25.680 --> 25:27.393
is just very complex.

25:28.560 --> 25:31.020
I gave an example of advanced packages.

25:31.020 --> 25:32.760
There's a security application now

25:32.760 --> 25:36.360
with all these global needs to be able

25:36.360 --> 25:39.930
to securely track some of these things.

25:39.930 --> 25:42.780
So there is a fundamental need

25:42.780 --> 25:47.400
of these sensing capabilities
which are not available today.

25:47.400 --> 25:50.499
And so that's how we are
looking instead of looking,

25:50.499 --> 25:52.020
I have a, so to speak,
a widget or a hammer,

25:52.020 --> 25:54.870
what problem can I try to solve,

25:54.870 --> 25:57.060
we are coming from the other side,

25:57.060 --> 26:00.420
really what is the biggest
problem to go solve?

26:00.420 --> 26:04.647
Can quantum offer an order
of magnitude capability

26:05.520 --> 26:08.640
compared to classical
sensors and marry the two?

26:08.640 --> 26:12.420
To me, I think that is
the way to go versus,

26:12.420 --> 26:15.030
hey, I have this great quantum sensor,

26:15.030 --> 26:18.970
and then trying to convince
the industry or the investors

26:19.980 --> 26:22.110
or the end consumers in terms

26:22.110 --> 26:24.630
of really that it brings value to you.

26:24.630 --> 26:28.473
And that's why we started
from industrial applications,

26:29.340 --> 26:30.480
and then gradually work

26:30.480 --> 26:32.760
because that market is a little bit more,

26:32.760 --> 26:36.390
actually it is cost-insensitive
from a sensor point of view,

26:36.390 --> 26:39.750
provided the entire system
solution meets the bill.

26:39.750 --> 26:42.090
And then I think gradually scale

26:42.090 --> 26:45.510
into high volume
applications, because for us,

26:45.510 --> 26:48.060
the machines we will potentially build

26:48.060 --> 26:52.650
will be basically in terms
of high dollar values,

26:52.650 --> 26:56.010
the sensor is really very reliable.

26:56.010 --> 26:58.110
And to us, I think that's a great way.

26:58.110 --> 27:00.150
And we see consumer applications

27:00.150 --> 27:02.340
like the fundamental modality

27:02.340 --> 27:06.030
where we are offering value
is sensing magnetic fields,

27:06.030 --> 27:08.640
which is a very fundamental modality.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.770
And whether we're applying to muscles

27:10.770 --> 27:12.900
or for security applications

27:12.900 --> 27:15.540
or for manufacturing applications, to us,

27:15.540 --> 27:16.860
the magnetic field,

27:16.860 --> 27:20.040
especially vector magnetic fields buried,

27:20.040 --> 27:21.363
offers immense potential.

27:23.700 --> 27:26.853
- So the the core
technology that we're using,

27:27.750 --> 27:29.430
TMR, Tunnel Magnetic Resistance,

27:29.430 --> 27:32.130
is a quantum effect that
has been known and around

27:32.130 --> 27:34.200
for 20 odd years.

27:34.200 --> 27:36.540
Seagate has been using in hard disk drives

27:36.540 --> 27:37.950
for a long time.

27:37.950 --> 27:40.350
We are using different
properties within that TMR

27:40.350 --> 27:42.240
so that we're using it effectively

27:42.240 --> 27:43.950
as a variable resistor

27:43.950 --> 27:46.320
depending on the magnetic
field that we're seeing.

27:46.320 --> 27:49.170
So we don't go out every
day promoting the fact

27:49.170 --> 27:51.450
that we are a quantum sensing company.

27:51.450 --> 27:53.190
We go out every day promoting the fact

27:53.190 --> 27:54.780
that we are a bio sensing company,

27:54.780 --> 27:57.900
that we are detecting
signals from the body

27:57.900 --> 28:00.180
that cannot be detected any other way.

28:00.180 --> 28:02.640
The sensor that we are trying to produce

28:02.640 --> 28:04.410
is probably a thousand
times more sensitive

28:04.410 --> 28:06.510
than anything else that's on the market.

28:06.510 --> 28:08.430
Today, there's loads of TMR sensors used

28:08.430 --> 28:11.190
within automotive or in industrialization,

28:11.190 --> 28:14.310
but they're in the nanotesla type range.

28:14.310 --> 28:17.520
We're trying to get to single
digit picotesla type range.

28:17.520 --> 28:21.750
So the fact that it is a quantum sensor

28:21.750 --> 28:24.210
is a positive and sometimes a negative.

28:24.210 --> 28:27.390
Our VCs are nervous when
we use the word quantum,

28:27.390 --> 28:29.370
but they are positive when they see

28:29.370 --> 28:32.550
that we are solving real world problems

28:32.550 --> 28:35.040
and that we can address
these things quicker,

28:35.040 --> 28:37.560
we can solve them quicker
by using the effects

28:37.560 --> 28:39.303
of quantum within our solution.

28:40.564 --> 28:45.150
So yeah, we need to address the speed

28:45.150 --> 28:47.820
of which people can
monetize their investment

28:47.820 --> 28:49.353
in quantum technologies.

28:50.490 --> 28:52.980
- Yeah, so maybe to elaborate a bit more,

28:52.980 --> 28:56.250
so in a certain way, yeah,

28:56.250 --> 28:58.620
you really address the consumer market.

28:58.620 --> 29:00.453
So you really offer a solution.

29:01.650 --> 29:04.410
So is the label let's say quantum inside

29:04.410 --> 29:06.420
or I don't know how is,

29:06.420 --> 29:09.450
a label that is giving
confidence to a customer

29:09.450 --> 29:11.430
that it is actually reaching a level

29:11.430 --> 29:13.230
that nothing else can do?

29:13.230 --> 29:15.810
Or do you still need to explain it,

29:15.810 --> 29:18.183
or do we need to explain it more?

29:19.200 --> 29:21.090
- So I think we see different reactions.

29:21.090 --> 29:26.090
So the people with the money
don't like the word quantum.

29:27.150 --> 29:29.580
The people who understand the technology

29:29.580 --> 29:31.440
love the word quantum.

29:31.440 --> 29:34.800
So I think we try to use the word quantum

29:34.800 --> 29:36.780
depending on the audience.

29:36.780 --> 29:39.960
So it's just the reality, right?

29:39.960 --> 29:41.223
End of the day,

29:43.650 --> 29:46.980
a good solution will always find a home,

29:46.980 --> 29:50.130
but the trick is really focus on the home

29:50.130 --> 29:52.440
and then finding the good
solution to get there.

29:52.440 --> 29:55.680
So I think that's the
mindset we are taking

29:55.680 --> 29:59.400
because if we start
with quantum first word,

29:59.400 --> 30:01.143
we are always trying to defend,

30:02.310 --> 30:03.540
and I'm just being honest,

30:03.540 --> 30:05.640
and I think that's one of the things,

30:05.640 --> 30:08.760
we are looking at it, it's a plus,

30:08.760 --> 30:12.393
but provided you frame it
correctly from the audience.

30:14.520 --> 30:16.020
- So I think it's really important

30:16.020 --> 30:19.830
that collectively we
all educate the market

30:19.830 --> 30:21.960
that quantum is there, it's a good thing,

30:21.960 --> 30:24.060
it's real, it's active.

30:24.060 --> 30:27.060
And I think sessions like this
where we're bringing quantum

30:27.060 --> 30:29.970
to CES for the first time

30:29.970 --> 30:32.195
and people are able to talk about it,

30:32.195 --> 30:33.030
they're able to experience it,

30:33.030 --> 30:35.130
they're able to go on to various stands

30:35.130 --> 30:38.130
around the show and
actually see it in action,

30:38.130 --> 30:39.750
I think is a real positive thing.

30:39.750 --> 30:41.180
And I think collectively,

30:41.180 --> 30:43.140
we have a lot more to do as an industry,

30:43.140 --> 30:47.520
as a group to bring quantum
out of 20 years from now

30:47.520 --> 30:51.540
to reality that is here,
is present, it's been used.

30:51.540 --> 30:53.070
People are getting real world benefits

30:53.070 --> 30:54.660
from it as of today.

30:54.660 --> 30:57.630
And obviously we're in the
sensing side of things,

30:57.630 --> 30:59.520
the computing side maybe
is a few years off,

30:59.520 --> 31:01.140
but there is real benefits

31:01.140 --> 31:04.134
from quantum technology as of today.

31:04.134 --> 31:04.967
- Thank you.

31:04.967 --> 31:06.330
So if I understand you well,

31:06.330 --> 31:08.010
we have like a large assembly today,

31:08.010 --> 31:10.710
so they are very courageous
people who were not afraid

31:10.710 --> 31:12.900
to come to a quantum show.

31:12.900 --> 31:16.650
So thank you very much
for this, and maybe,

31:16.650 --> 31:19.383
and we still have left a few minutes,

31:20.640 --> 31:23.250
well you raised the
point, I mean that yes,

31:23.250 --> 31:25.110
we have to educate the market,

31:25.110 --> 31:26.190
we have to educate the people.

31:26.190 --> 31:31.190
We may have also to do
some kind of evangelization

31:31.410 --> 31:33.360
or de-evangelization about quantum

31:33.360 --> 31:36.093
that people think it is
something that it is not.

31:38.010 --> 31:40.920
So what is for you the biggest challenge

31:40.920 --> 31:42.540
that you as a company,

31:42.540 --> 31:45.720
but also let's say as a global industry

31:45.720 --> 31:50.720
in quantum are facing over this year,

31:50.749 --> 31:52.410
the year of quantum or over the next year,

31:52.410 --> 31:54.612
what is for you the most important thing

31:54.612 --> 31:57.600
we need to focus as
government organization,

31:57.600 --> 32:00.090
but also we need to focus as organization

32:00.090 --> 32:03.303
of industry, consortia, and et cetera?

32:04.230 --> 32:06.330
- So I think we being a startup obviously,

32:07.740 --> 32:12.300
really while we have
great ideas are really,

32:12.300 --> 32:15.180
so to speak, survival is
dependent on the money.

32:15.180 --> 32:16.890
So we have to balance the two.

32:16.890 --> 32:19.740
So I think the challenge
as Noel and I were talking

32:19.740 --> 32:24.740
as a startup we face is while
we see a great opportunity

32:25.470 --> 32:27.030
having investors' appetite,

32:27.030 --> 32:30.096
because investors typically think in terms

32:30.096 --> 32:32.280
about three year return,
three to five year.

32:32.280 --> 32:36.150
And so the challenge I
think we face is educating

32:36.150 --> 32:38.580
the investment community

32:38.580 --> 32:40.710
and being able to differentiate

32:40.710 --> 32:43.830
where they see return on
investment in a near term.

32:43.830 --> 32:45.630
So I think that's a near
term challenge we see

32:45.630 --> 32:47.700
because once we get past that

32:47.700 --> 32:49.800
and we get to what value we bring,

32:49.800 --> 32:53.970
we absolutely see a positive response.

32:53.970 --> 32:55.830
But really to get that conversation

32:55.830 --> 33:00.450
to believe that this is here

33:00.450 --> 33:03.690
and this is now is really what I see.

33:03.690 --> 33:08.690
We collectively have to
work, and as a common person,

33:09.180 --> 33:10.650
when people use the word quantum,

33:10.650 --> 33:12.120
they think leap of faith, right?

33:12.120 --> 33:13.230
Quantum jump.

33:13.230 --> 33:15.960
And you use that in the
day-to-day language.

33:15.960 --> 33:18.390
But at the same time, I
think different technologies

33:18.390 --> 33:20.250
between sensing or networking

33:20.250 --> 33:23.490
or computing are evolving
at different speeds

33:23.490 --> 33:25.260
and solving different problems.

33:25.260 --> 33:27.600
I think sensing is real,

33:27.600 --> 33:30.630
and I think we need to focus on the value

33:30.630 --> 33:32.820
we are bringing and focus on that

33:32.820 --> 33:37.080
and connect those dots
for the broad industry

33:37.080 --> 33:39.870
and even adopters of this technology.

33:39.870 --> 33:42.990
And what Noel is doing and what
we are trying to do and all,

33:42.990 --> 33:45.480
I think we are trying to
push in that direction

33:45.480 --> 33:48.240
and in general, like
QEDC and other forums,

33:48.240 --> 33:52.110
even Quantum World Congress and even CES

33:52.110 --> 33:54.270
to give us these opportunities
I think are the exact

33:54.270 --> 33:59.270
kind of things we have to do
to really broaden the horizon.

34:00.190 --> 34:02.670
And for I think companies like us,

34:02.670 --> 34:05.160
we have to go past talking to delivering.

34:05.160 --> 34:08.500
So I think it's a combination
of really we as an industry

34:09.570 --> 34:11.860
have to start delivering killer products

34:12.804 --> 34:13.637
where there's a need,

34:13.637 --> 34:17.412
and then also in parallel
promoting the values.

34:17.412 --> 34:19.260
But in my mind, without a doubt,

34:19.260 --> 34:23.700
order of magnitude sensing
capabilities, we need it.

34:23.700 --> 34:26.970
Whether it's geological,
whether it's security,

34:26.970 --> 34:28.230
whether it's manufacturing,

34:28.230 --> 34:32.067
whether it is human
medical needs and all that,

34:32.067 --> 34:33.570
the market is there.

34:33.570 --> 34:36.420
I think we have to just very focused,

34:36.420 --> 34:38.583
maniacally move forward in that direction.

34:41.400 --> 34:43.470
- [Noel] So yeah, just to add to that,

34:43.470 --> 34:45.723
I agree very much on the VC point.

34:46.560 --> 34:50.580
Our biggest challenge this year
is high scale manufacturing,

34:50.580 --> 34:53.970
so scaling up manufacturing
of quantum sensors.

34:53.970 --> 34:56.580
So we're using a stack which has got

34:56.580 --> 34:58.260
20 different materials in it

34:58.260 --> 35:01.770
and so that is based
on a silicon substrate,

35:01.770 --> 35:06.210
but scaling that up into
high volume manufacturing

35:06.210 --> 35:07.170
is challenging.

35:07.170 --> 35:10.620
And so we need to have
ways of going to market

35:10.620 --> 35:13.350
so we can build high volumes of products

35:13.350 --> 35:15.090
at a very cheap price in order

35:15.090 --> 35:18.147
so we can supply them into the
consumer electronics market,

35:18.147 --> 35:19.830
which is very price conscious.

35:19.830 --> 35:22.233
So they're looking to
buy chips for one to $2.

35:24.090 --> 35:24.923
- Thank you very much.

35:24.923 --> 35:25.756
So I'm looking forward

35:25.756 --> 35:29.733
to see our market flooded
with quantum sensors.

35:30.780 --> 35:32.100
Thank you very much.

35:32.100 --> 35:36.060
I think your input was very
valuable, and also good luck.

35:36.060 --> 35:38.460
I mean it's always that we
should say for a startup,

35:38.460 --> 35:41.631
I mean it's always a race.

35:41.631 --> 35:43.950
And I think I leave the floor

35:43.950 --> 35:47.430
to the last word, and thank you.

35:47.430 --> 35:48.296
- Thank you.

35:48.296 --> 35:51.463
(audience applauding)

35:52.884 --> 35:55.467
(upbeat music)
