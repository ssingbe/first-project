00:00.000 --> 00:03.500
(upbeat electronic music)

00:10.740 --> 00:11.573
<v ->All right, everybody.</v>

00:11.573 --> 00:13.080
I think we're gonna get started here now today.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.390
So, thank you so much for all being here.

00:15.390 --> 00:17.730
I know that it is the Thursday, the third day,

00:17.730 --> 00:18.810
and we're in the last session.

00:18.810 --> 00:21.420
So again, we can't thank you guys enough for being here.

00:21.420 --> 00:23.250
And so today, we're gonna be jumping

00:23.250 --> 00:26.190
into some of the cybersecurity conference panel session.

00:26.190 --> 00:27.600
We're gonna be taking a look

00:27.600 --> 00:30.240
at data breach prevention and protection

00:30.240 --> 00:31.650
within our industry right now.

00:31.650 --> 00:35.280
So, we're gonna kind of break it down into three main parts.

00:35.280 --> 00:38.280
What is the current kind of landscape we are seeing

00:38.280 --> 00:40.470
in the cybersecurity space right now?

00:40.470 --> 00:42.360
What should companies do when they're attacked,

00:42.360 --> 00:43.830
both from a preventative standpoint,

00:43.830 --> 00:46.740
also from an after they get our attack standpoint,

00:46.740 --> 00:49.530
cleaning up the mess, basically, is that one would say.

00:49.530 --> 00:50.363
And then finally,

00:50.363 --> 00:51.900
what are some of the emerging technologies

00:51.900 --> 00:53.160
or different things people are doing

00:53.160 --> 00:56.310
to preventing attacks in the future?

00:56.310 --> 00:58.470
So my name is Kyle Wandel.

00:58.470 --> 01:00.540
I'm a Manager of Business Intelligence

01:00.540 --> 01:03.780
on Consumer Technologies Market Research Team.

01:03.780 --> 01:05.880
I've been with CTA or in this space

01:05.880 --> 01:08.070
for around five, six years now,

01:08.070 --> 01:09.750
and I work on an industry forecast.

01:09.750 --> 01:10.583
So I have a good idea

01:10.583 --> 01:12.930
of what are the main kind of technology trends

01:12.930 --> 01:14.880
that are happening in the space.

01:14.880 --> 01:16.352
So, I'll turn it over to Meredith.

01:16.352 --> 01:17.748
Do you need help to introduce yourself?

01:17.748 --> 01:18.581
<v ->Sure. Hi, everyone.</v>

01:18.581 --> 01:21.720
Thank you so much for being here.

01:21.720 --> 01:22.860
I'm Meredith Griffanti,

01:22.860 --> 01:26.010
I'm the Global head of Cybersecurity

01:26.010 --> 01:30.360
and Data Privacy Communications at FTI Consulting.

01:30.360 --> 01:31.620
So what does that mean?

01:31.620 --> 01:35.580
I lead a team of crisis communications professionals

01:35.580 --> 01:38.070
that sort of swoop in in the middle of an incident

01:38.070 --> 01:41.520
and help companies that are experiencing an attack

01:41.520 --> 01:44.490
figure out what to say to their employees,

01:44.490 --> 01:48.660
to regulators, their customers, the media,

01:48.660 --> 01:51.330
how to say it, when, timing,

01:51.330 --> 01:53.190
and how to protect their reputations

01:53.190 --> 01:55.830
really coming out of the incident

01:55.830 --> 01:58.380
stronger than before it happened.

01:58.380 --> 02:01.890
And when we're not actively fighting cyber crime,

02:01.890 --> 02:02.910
we're helping companies

02:02.910 --> 02:06.420
to really take the best practices we see on the front lines

02:06.420 --> 02:09.300
and apply those into preparedness plans,

02:09.300 --> 02:12.870
crisis communications, resiliency plans,

02:12.870 --> 02:16.710
because it's not a matter of if, but when, these days.

02:16.710 --> 02:18.630
So that is the team I lead,

02:18.630 --> 02:20.100
and really excited to be here

02:20.100 --> 02:22.710
and talk about this exciting subject.

02:22.710 --> 02:25.830
<v Kyle>Thank you. Brendan?</v>
<v ->I guess it's my turn.</v>

02:25.830 --> 02:29.280
My name is Brendan Rooney, I work with Booz Allen Hamilton.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.860
I lead our Incident Response Team globally.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.500
So we have personnel that are in the U.S., the UK,

02:34.500 --> 02:37.590
Netherlands, a number of other countries around the world.

02:37.590 --> 02:42.590
Our team, similar to Meredith at FTI, in terms of the,

02:43.500 --> 02:45.600
I would say, responding to crisis scenarios,

02:45.600 --> 02:47.250
our team assists with a variety

02:47.250 --> 02:49.410
of different digital forensic investigations

02:49.410 --> 02:50.980
and recovery capabilities

02:51.870 --> 02:53.850
with organizations that fall victim

02:53.850 --> 02:55.770
to a variety of different types of incidents,

02:55.770 --> 02:57.450
from ransomware compromise

02:57.450 --> 02:59.520
to more general network intrusions,

02:59.520 --> 03:01.170
insider threat activities.

03:01.170 --> 03:03.990
All of our work on our team is in the private sector,

03:03.990 --> 03:06.300
whereas some of my colleagues operate

03:06.300 --> 03:08.370
with a variety of different federal agencies

03:08.370 --> 03:09.360
or other organizations

03:09.360 --> 03:11.213
that are aligned to the U.S. government.

03:12.570 --> 03:13.437
<v ->Awesome, thank you.</v>

03:13.437 --> 03:15.300
And so let's just kind of dive right into it.

03:15.300 --> 03:17.040
And I mean this kind of a little bit open-ended

03:17.040 --> 03:19.050
to either one of you, you can please respond.

03:19.050 --> 03:21.090
But what are some of the main types of attacks

03:21.090 --> 03:23.280
or companies that are currently facing,

03:23.280 --> 03:25.950
and what type of industries or entities do you see

03:25.950 --> 03:28.500
to be the most vulnerable at the moment right now?

03:28.500 --> 03:29.910
<v ->Ooh, great question.</v>

03:29.910 --> 03:32.580
I'll start and you jump in.
<v ->Yeah, yeah, sure.</v>

03:32.580 --> 03:33.413
<v ->Of course,</v>

03:33.413 --> 03:37.980
ransomware continues to be the sort of incident du jour.

03:37.980 --> 03:40.200
It causes the most operational disruption,

03:40.200 --> 03:41.700
it's highly public.

03:41.700 --> 03:45.120
So, we're seeing a lot of ransomware, data theft,

03:45.120 --> 03:47.730
data extortion type of incidents.

03:47.730 --> 03:49.980
Right now, if you're following the news,

03:49.980 --> 03:51.300
you might have read a little bit

03:51.300 --> 03:55.740
about some of the salt typhoon type of incidents,

03:55.740 --> 03:59.550
so more APT nation-state espionage.

03:59.550 --> 04:02.880
It affected a number of the wireless carriers.

04:02.880 --> 04:06.693
T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Verizon we're hearing a lot about.

04:07.590 --> 04:09.000
So we are working on a number

04:09.000 --> 04:11.733
of those types of incidents as well.

04:13.609 --> 04:16.350
I think those are kind of top of mind hot topics

04:16.350 --> 04:17.183
for us right now.

04:17.183 --> 04:19.200
What about you guys? What you're seeing.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.060
<v ->Yeah, I mean I think ransomware is easy</v>

04:21.060 --> 04:25.710
'cause it draws headlines for...

04:25.710 --> 04:28.590
Been kind of in the, in some ways,

04:28.590 --> 04:32.610
the ransomware world for the last probably 10 to 12 years.

04:32.610 --> 04:34.620
Feels like an eternity.

04:34.620 --> 04:36.660
But there was a point in time

04:36.660 --> 04:38.250
where that wasn't really talked about.

04:38.250 --> 04:40.620
My wife generally didn't really know a whole lot

04:40.620 --> 04:42.120
about what ransomware was.

04:42.120 --> 04:44.370
And to kind of be in a position now

04:44.370 --> 04:46.050
where it's kind of grabbing global headlines

04:46.050 --> 04:47.350
on a frequent basis

04:48.360 --> 04:52.110
is a little bit of a changing topic of conversation

04:52.110 --> 04:53.820
at our dinner table.

04:53.820 --> 04:56.790
I would say, though, that independent of ransomware,

04:56.790 --> 04:59.220
and in some cases, depending on the situation,

04:59.220 --> 05:00.720
maybe even related,

05:00.720 --> 05:03.300
is the prevalence of insider threat activity.

05:03.300 --> 05:05.460
I would say even certainly so

05:05.460 --> 05:07.810
relative to the technology industry

05:09.180 --> 05:13.410
is the ability for an inside employee to very quickly,

05:13.410 --> 05:17.220
easily, and in many ways in an undetected fashion,

05:17.220 --> 05:19.710
be able to quickly siphon

05:19.710 --> 05:22.170
highly-sensitive intellectual property

05:22.170 --> 05:26.490
and potentially even really substantial trade secrets

05:26.490 --> 05:29.010
that could impact the future of an organization.

05:29.010 --> 05:29.843
<v ->And in terms of,</v>

05:29.843 --> 05:33.360
you asked about the most vulnerable industries and sectors,

05:33.360 --> 05:35.700
I think we skipped that part of your question.

05:35.700 --> 05:40.700
I would say healthcare, hospitals,

05:40.710 --> 05:45.570
they tend to have very interconnected systems,

05:45.570 --> 05:49.020
a lot of dependencies on third-party vendors,

05:49.020 --> 05:50.460
and generally speaking,

05:50.460 --> 05:53.550
are under-resourced and under-prepared

05:53.550 --> 05:57.810
when it comes to their cybersecurity defenses.

05:57.810 --> 06:01.380
So, quick way for threat actors to make a buck.

06:01.380 --> 06:03.960
You think about the types of medical information

06:03.960 --> 06:06.750
that hospitals, for example, hold,

06:06.750 --> 06:11.750
as well as the potential disruption to patient care.

06:13.020 --> 06:15.510
Those are easy targets for threat actors

06:15.510 --> 06:17.460
because they're most likely to pay.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.850
So, I would say that industry, in particular,

06:20.850 --> 06:22.383
tends to be a target.

06:23.490 --> 06:28.290
We're reading a lot right now about education systems,

06:28.290 --> 06:31.080
local governments, municipalities,

06:31.080 --> 06:34.470
being quite affected by these ransomware attacks

06:34.470 --> 06:36.990
or nation-state incidents.

06:36.990 --> 06:40.080
The financial services sector tends to be better prepared,

06:40.080 --> 06:42.630
just because of the level of investment,

06:42.630 --> 06:46.380
the sophistication that goes into their controls.

06:46.380 --> 06:49.350
So I would say that's one of the better,

06:49.350 --> 06:51.570
stronger ends of the spectrum.

06:51.570 --> 06:55.500
Whereas you look at healthcare and public entities,

06:55.500 --> 06:58.770
and those tend to be less well-resourced.

06:58.770 --> 07:00.810
<v ->Hmm, yeah, I'd add to that,</v>

07:00.810 --> 07:02.880
that the rapid adoption

07:02.880 --> 07:04.530
of a variety of different technologies

07:04.530 --> 07:06.780
also has a immediate propensity

07:06.780 --> 07:08.340
to increase the digital footprint

07:08.340 --> 07:10.920
or attack surface of many organizations.

07:10.920 --> 07:13.320
And I'd say the insertion

07:13.320 --> 07:16.800
of a substantial amount of updated or new tech

07:16.800 --> 07:19.440
into manufacturing as an example

07:19.440 --> 07:21.450
creates an expanded attack surface

07:21.450 --> 07:23.640
in a way that it gets increasingly more difficult

07:23.640 --> 07:27.090
for many of these organizations, very large and very small,

07:27.090 --> 07:30.420
to not only understand what that footprint looks like,

07:30.420 --> 07:31.830
but also to protect it

07:31.830 --> 07:34.440
and defend against this type of malicious activity.

07:34.440 --> 07:37.320
So, for us manufacturing

07:37.320 --> 07:40.080
and other similarly related industries,

07:40.080 --> 07:41.280
especially the supply chain

07:41.280 --> 07:43.710
up and down the manufacturing sector,

07:43.710 --> 07:46.140
has seen a pretty substantial amount of activity.

07:46.140 --> 07:48.290
And that's certainly a contributing factor.

07:49.616 --> 07:50.790
<v ->And this is actually perfect timing, Mike,</v>

07:50.790 --> 07:52.230
because they just kind of alluded

07:52.230 --> 07:54.240
to one of the biggest themes that I've seen

07:54.240 --> 07:55.710
in the past year or so,

07:55.710 --> 07:58.590
which is the idea of how we are now more connected devices,

07:58.590 --> 07:59.940
more and more wireless devices

07:59.940 --> 08:02.220
are in our industry more than ever before.

08:02.220 --> 08:04.710
So with your expertise in IoT,

08:04.710 --> 08:06.360
how are connected devices contributing

08:06.360 --> 08:08.160
to this vulnerability in cybersecurity?

08:08.160 --> 08:09.000
<v ->That's a great question.</v>

08:09.000 --> 08:10.470
By the way, I'm Mike Bergman,

08:10.470 --> 08:13.020
Vice President of Technology and Standards at CTA.

08:13.020 --> 08:14.270
Apologies for being late.

08:16.110 --> 08:17.550
So, one of the challenges we have

08:17.550 --> 08:20.490
is that there's a sea of connected devices out there.

08:20.490 --> 08:23.820
There's 18 billion connected right now, something like that.

08:23.820 --> 08:27.390
And those devices are all around the world.

08:27.390 --> 08:29.340
And a little more context,

08:29.340 --> 08:34.340
if you look at the huge attack on the United States in 2016,

08:35.220 --> 08:39.050
known as the Mirai botnet attack, that was...

08:40.860 --> 08:42.630
driven by connected devices.

08:42.630 --> 08:46.020
And if you look at where the traffic came from,

08:46.020 --> 08:47.580
91% of that traffic

08:47.580 --> 08:50.490
came from outside the United States' borders.

08:50.490 --> 08:52.020
And so we have a global issue

08:52.020 --> 08:54.210
with these connected devices getting hacked

08:54.210 --> 08:57.843
and then turned into one type of attack vector or another.

08:58.770 --> 09:00.990
And one of the things that they're doing

09:00.990 --> 09:03.240
is they're using these connected devices

09:03.240 --> 09:08.240
to help find openings, to find exploits,

09:08.820 --> 09:12.180
to look for common exploits or known exploits,

09:12.180 --> 09:14.550
and then start working their way into systems.

09:14.550 --> 09:16.620
So once they find a vulnerable system,

09:16.620 --> 09:20.310
drop malware, otherwise infiltrate the system,

09:20.310 --> 09:22.440
and then soon you've got a ransomware problem.

09:22.440 --> 09:26.580
So, we are looking for ways to improve the situation.

09:26.580 --> 09:29.250
In general, there's the new U.S. Cyber Trust Mark

09:29.250 --> 09:30.360
for consumer devices.

09:30.360 --> 09:33.360
The federal government is tightening requirements

09:33.360 --> 09:35.133
on connected devices.

09:36.030 --> 09:41.030
We have similar programs in the EU, UK,

09:41.250 --> 09:45.600
Germany, Finland, Singapore, Malaysia, all over the world.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.240
So, we recognize that there's a problem,

09:48.240 --> 09:52.630
but even if we flipped every manufacturer over right now

09:54.342 --> 09:58.170
to something perfectly secure,

09:58.170 --> 10:00.900
we still have 18 billion devices out there

10:00.900 --> 10:02.490
and a bunch in the pipeline.

10:02.490 --> 10:07.490
And so all of the challenges, and opportunities,

10:08.700 --> 10:13.700
and precautions on data breach are gonna be...

10:15.480 --> 10:18.540
Are still necessary from this perspective

10:18.540 --> 10:20.850
of the connected devices for a long time

10:20.850 --> 10:22.530
because of that legacy base.

10:22.530 --> 10:24.390
<v ->And that kind of brings me kind of in over the next point</v>

10:24.390 --> 10:27.240
because of how many incidents there are have been

10:27.240 --> 10:29.370
and how difficult it is to really protect

10:29.370 --> 10:32.400
every single connected device in our industry.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.860
Meredith, from your perspective, what from a...

10:34.860 --> 10:36.930
What do should companies do to navigate the aftermath

10:36.930 --> 10:39.000
after they do have an incident,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.250
whether it be data breach or any type of other incident

10:41.250 --> 10:43.770
that could occur at the company?

10:43.770 --> 10:47.820
<v ->Sure, I would say one of the biggest pain points</v>

10:47.820 --> 10:50.700
we tend to see with our clients

10:50.700 --> 10:53.043
is the communications work stream.

10:54.270 --> 10:57.090
We tend to, when we respond to incidents,

10:57.090 --> 11:02.090
have forensics, ransom negotiations, recovery, comms, legal,

11:04.410 --> 11:07.170
everyone's kind of divided up into work streams.

11:07.170 --> 11:10.530
And there's an onslaught of inquiries

11:10.530 --> 11:12.300
that come in not just from the media,

11:12.300 --> 11:15.990
not just from regulators, not just from employees,

11:15.990 --> 11:17.910
but really from customers.

11:17.910 --> 11:20.700
And what customers want to know in particular

11:20.700 --> 11:23.220
if the organization is B2B is:

11:23.220 --> 11:26.490
What is the risk to my own network from your incident

11:26.490 --> 11:29.160
if there's points of interconnectedness

11:29.160 --> 11:33.750
or reliance on different systems or platforms?

11:33.750 --> 11:38.010
So, they want assurances that the incident is contained,

11:38.010 --> 11:41.250
they want the CISO or the InfoSec team

11:41.250 --> 11:44.730
to share helpful indicators of compromise,

11:44.730 --> 11:47.070
so that the customer can load those

11:47.070 --> 11:50.490
into their own vulnerability scans

11:50.490 --> 11:54.060
and find points of weaknesses on their own systems.

11:54.060 --> 11:57.720
They want attestation letters from third parties,

11:57.720 --> 11:59.280
and they want a phone call, right,

11:59.280 --> 12:01.020
with the Head of InfoSec, or the CEO,

12:01.020 --> 12:02.940
or their customer sales rep.

12:02.940 --> 12:05.070
So, I would say the biggest pain point

12:05.070 --> 12:10.070
is really equipping the front lines with the right messaging

12:10.350 --> 12:12.570
so that no one's shooting from the hip,

12:12.570 --> 12:15.990
as well as sort of an escalation process.

12:15.990 --> 12:17.480
Everyone feels like their customer

12:17.480 --> 12:19.830
is the most important during an incident.

12:19.830 --> 12:22.560
And of course, all customers are equal.

12:22.560 --> 12:27.560
But, if a top 10 customer that makes up, for example,

12:28.590 --> 12:31.140
a big portion of the revenue

12:31.140 --> 12:33.750
wants a phone call with the CISO,

12:33.750 --> 12:35.640
how do we make that determination,

12:35.640 --> 12:36.690
and what's the process

12:36.690 --> 12:39.330
for getting that customer on the phone

12:39.330 --> 12:41.940
and kind of calming them down?

12:41.940 --> 12:44.460
So you amplify that type of incident

12:44.460 --> 12:46.320
for a Fortune 50 company

12:46.320 --> 12:49.770
that has customers all over the world,

12:49.770 --> 12:51.990
different levels of sophistication,

12:51.990 --> 12:54.780
different language needs, time zones.

12:54.780 --> 12:56.400
I think really thinking

12:56.400 --> 13:00.390
about setting up that command center, if you will,

13:00.390 --> 13:02.340
to triage those inbounds

13:02.340 --> 13:06.360
to have a process in place for tracking everything,

13:06.360 --> 13:09.210
understanding who's been told what when.

13:09.210 --> 13:10.620
I cannot tell you how many times

13:10.620 --> 13:12.990
after the fact we have to turn all of that over

13:12.990 --> 13:15.540
to regulators who wanna sift through it

13:15.540 --> 13:17.970
and make sure that you were being consistent

13:17.970 --> 13:19.890
in your messaging with employees,

13:19.890 --> 13:22.320
with the media, with customers, et cetera.

13:22.320 --> 13:24.780
Especially if you're a publicly traded company,

13:24.780 --> 13:29.780
you now have SEC disclosure obligations to worry about

13:30.120 --> 13:32.370
and Reg FD, of course.

13:32.370 --> 13:35.430
So thinking about all of that stuff in advance

13:35.430 --> 13:37.110
and war-gaming it out,

13:37.110 --> 13:39.300
I mean, we do these high-level tabletops

13:39.300 --> 13:42.690
with our customers or with our clients all the time,

13:42.690 --> 13:47.430
but a couple hours focusing on the whole incident response

13:47.430 --> 13:48.810
is valuable, of course.

13:48.810 --> 13:50.400
But really drilling down

13:50.400 --> 13:53.940
into that communications process, and protocol,

13:53.940 --> 13:58.140
and practicing what it's like to move a couple of inquiries

13:58.140 --> 14:01.530
from one stage gate to another,

14:01.530 --> 14:05.760
I think can be worth its weight all day every day

14:05.760 --> 14:08.820
because that's where we see companies tend to fall down.

14:08.820 --> 14:09.653
<v Kyle>No, perfect.</v>

14:09.653 --> 14:10.980
And this is kind of open to everybody,

14:10.980 --> 14:14.070
but in terms of a clientele, or a recent example,

14:14.070 --> 14:15.630
what did a thorough investigation

14:15.630 --> 14:17.820
that has helped an organization to recover,

14:17.820 --> 14:19.140
and like what was the outcome

14:19.140 --> 14:21.300
of that positive investigation?

14:21.300 --> 14:22.133
I guess Brendan,

14:22.133 --> 14:24.090
you probably might have the most expertise with this one

14:24.090 --> 14:25.980
in terms of your client base.
<v Brendan>Yeah, fortunately,</v>

14:25.980 --> 14:27.270
or unfortunately, I guess.
<v Kyle>Yep.</v>

14:27.270 --> 14:29.430
<v ->Depends on the situation.</v>

14:29.430 --> 14:32.040
I'll maybe spin your question a little bit differently

14:32.040 --> 14:34.620
of what can, in my opinion,

14:34.620 --> 14:36.390
from what we see on a frequent basis,

14:36.390 --> 14:39.180
what can make or break an organization's response

14:39.180 --> 14:40.770
to an incident?

14:40.770 --> 14:45.770
And as ridiculous as this may sound in some ways,

14:45.960 --> 14:48.120
it is very basic security concepts

14:48.120 --> 14:50.730
that ultimately do create the best outcome.

14:50.730 --> 14:52.170
I think very well-known,

14:52.170 --> 14:54.120
even if you have or have not been

14:54.120 --> 14:56.070
in the middle of one of these incidents before,

14:56.070 --> 14:57.840
that time is critical.

14:57.840 --> 14:59.370
And from Meredith's perspective,

14:59.370 --> 15:00.720
time to reach out to clients,

15:00.720 --> 15:02.640
time to reach out to customers,

15:02.640 --> 15:05.010
not only what you're contractually required to do,

15:05.010 --> 15:07.650
but also how do you continue to enable your business

15:07.650 --> 15:09.600
to be successful going forward?

15:09.600 --> 15:11.580
But time to recover.

15:11.580 --> 15:13.800
That's why RTO and RPO calculations

15:13.800 --> 15:15.630
are critical proactively.

15:15.630 --> 15:19.020
But, there is a foundational concept

15:19.020 --> 15:21.030
that if an organization does not have a full

15:21.030 --> 15:22.050
and in-depth understanding

15:22.050 --> 15:24.510
of what assets they're ultimately responsible for,

15:24.510 --> 15:26.550
and this probably dovetails nicely

15:26.550 --> 15:28.200
into Mike's prior comment,

15:28.200 --> 15:32.850
then it is very difficult to be able to go to a client,

15:32.850 --> 15:35.250
customer, partner, however they're defined,

15:35.250 --> 15:38.707
in a circumstance like Meredith described and say that,

15:38.707 --> 15:39.990
"Here's your attestation

15:39.990 --> 15:43.260
that you can reestablish a connection with our organization,

15:43.260 --> 15:45.000
and that that connection, or that channel,

15:45.000 --> 15:47.700
whatever that might be, is ultimately secured."

15:47.700 --> 15:49.350
You can't do that if you don't have a full

15:49.350 --> 15:50.460
and in-depth understanding

15:50.460 --> 15:52.320
of what the connection actually consists of

15:52.320 --> 15:55.680
and what devices are ultimately under your responsibility.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.720
So, asset inventory

15:57.720 --> 16:01.080
and being able to secure the organization at the edge

16:01.080 --> 16:02.820
is absolutely critical

16:02.820 --> 16:05.820
because that is the first question we ask is:

16:05.820 --> 16:07.830
Okay, you're telling us there was an incident,

16:07.830 --> 16:09.210
what was affected?

16:09.210 --> 16:11.658
If you can't answer the question,

16:11.658 --> 16:14.580
then we basically have to then answer the question for you.

16:14.580 --> 16:17.340
And that takes us a far longer period of time

16:17.340 --> 16:20.910
than if we can actually be provided with an answer quickly,

16:20.910 --> 16:22.560
or at least some semblance of an answer.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.060
It'll always change over time.

16:25.110 --> 16:27.810
So, that's what I would say, in my opinion,

16:27.810 --> 16:30.150
makes or breaks a successful response.

16:30.150 --> 16:32.430
And the ripple effect that is created,

16:32.430 --> 16:34.800
whether or not they can answer that question,

16:34.800 --> 16:38.040
is potentially catastrophic

16:38.040 --> 16:39.270
to the organization's long term (indistinct).

16:39.270 --> 16:40.500
<v Meredith>Well, just to tack on,</v>

16:40.500 --> 16:42.900
that also goes for data governance, too.

16:42.900 --> 16:45.000
<v ->Oh, yeah.</v>
<v ->Like, it's asset inventory.</v>

16:45.000 --> 16:48.367
And then I can't tell you how many times we ask a client,

16:48.367 --> 16:50.520
"Okay, well, what's stored on that server?

16:50.520 --> 16:52.110
What's in this?

16:52.110 --> 16:53.820
What does this employee have access to?"

16:53.820 --> 16:55.650
And they're like, "Well, we have no idea."

16:55.650 --> 16:56.483
I'm like, "Well, great."

16:56.483 --> 16:58.710
Well, we don't know what to tell our customers then.

16:58.710 --> 17:01.530
So, same concept there applies.

17:01.530 --> 17:03.390
<v ->Yeah, can we say that to our largest client</v>

17:03.390 --> 17:06.000
or largest customer in the middle of an incident?

17:06.000 --> 17:07.170
Ideally not.

17:07.170 --> 17:09.120
<v ->And what about the smaller customers, too?</v>

17:09.120 --> 17:11.250
I mean, I can't tell you how many times I've heard the story

17:11.250 --> 17:12.840
of, "And then we test our...

17:12.840 --> 17:16.470
And then we tried our backups, but the backups didn't work."

17:16.470 --> 17:21.470
And I think the smaller entities have the data governance,

17:22.290 --> 17:23.700
data governance policies.

17:23.700 --> 17:26.130
Meredith was mentioning the preparation,

17:26.130 --> 17:27.840
being ready for that attack.

17:27.840 --> 17:30.930
It's just not invested in as much.

17:30.930 --> 17:33.270
Frequently, as further you go down the scale

17:33.270 --> 17:34.980
of size of business,

17:34.980 --> 17:39.980
so it becomes a real challenge in being able to recover

17:40.140 --> 17:42.040
when you haven't done the preparation.

17:43.050 --> 17:45.180
And that preparation, unfortunately,

17:45.180 --> 17:47.220
is a cost factor for the small companies

17:47.220 --> 17:49.803
that often they won't invest in.

17:50.760 --> 17:51.870
<v ->I mean, Mike, that kind of...</v>

17:51.870 --> 17:53.520
Sorry to, as you clear your throat there,

17:53.520 --> 17:55.440
but that kind of leads me into my...

17:55.440 --> 17:56.280
Perfect for my next question

17:56.280 --> 17:58.500
in terms of from an industry-wide collaboration,

17:58.500 --> 18:01.170
'cause obviously small businesses can't do it alone.

18:01.170 --> 18:03.720
How can we help organizations recover more effectively

18:03.720 --> 18:05.253
from large-scale incidents?

18:07.230 --> 18:10.170
<v ->So, large...</v>

18:10.170 --> 18:13.140
I mean, one of the more interesting large-scale incidents

18:13.140 --> 18:15.003
was the Microsoft SolarWinds.

18:15.840 --> 18:20.840
And there was not just the individual organizations

18:22.680 --> 18:23.550
working on their own,

18:23.550 --> 18:25.110
they were working with their vendors,

18:25.110 --> 18:28.620
they were bringing in their consultants, and partners,

18:28.620 --> 18:31.713
and companies that helped them with recovery.

18:33.240 --> 18:35.730
And the Department of Homeland Security was involved.

18:35.730 --> 18:37.470
There were phone calls,

18:37.470 --> 18:40.950
CISA hosting phone calls with 150, 200 people.

18:40.950 --> 18:42.690
On the call, most of them CISAs,

18:42.690 --> 18:44.940
most of them saying, "What do we do?"

18:44.940 --> 18:45.773
So,

18:49.110 --> 18:51.783
obviously, the recovery plan goes into effect,

18:53.130 --> 18:55.293
but it's all hands on deck, I would say.

18:56.880 --> 18:59.940
Brendan, Meredith maybe have perspective as well.

18:59.940 --> 19:00.837
It just...

19:00.837 --> 19:03.210
You gotta be firing on all eight cylinders

19:03.210 --> 19:04.200
<v ->That, and I mean,</v>

19:04.200 --> 19:08.790
there's no way around needing to test, develop...

19:08.790 --> 19:12.630
Well, develop, test incident response plans,

19:12.630 --> 19:15.843
disaster recovery, business continuity plans,

19:16.740 --> 19:20.490
even just having, if you're a smaller organization,

19:20.490 --> 19:24.337
a 24, 48, 72-hour checklist of,

19:24.337 --> 19:25.860
"What am I doing first?

19:25.860 --> 19:27.210
Who am I calling?

19:27.210 --> 19:29.370
Who are the vendors I'm gonna need to bring in?

19:29.370 --> 19:30.780
Have I met them?

19:30.780 --> 19:33.090
Am I shaking their hand on day one?

19:33.090 --> 19:35.520
Do I have cybersecurity insurance?"

19:35.520 --> 19:38.640
Those are things that I think smaller organizations

19:38.640 --> 19:40.620
can think about ahead of time

19:40.620 --> 19:44.070
to really ensure that if they do find themselves

19:44.070 --> 19:45.840
in a worst-case scenario,

19:45.840 --> 19:50.070
recovery is as planned out as possible

19:50.070 --> 19:52.415
because they know who they're gonna call.

19:52.415 --> 19:55.230
<v ->Mm-hmm, and you have to allocate the resources</v>

19:55.230 --> 19:56.790
to do that in the first place.
<v ->Sure.</v>

19:56.790 --> 19:58.950
<v ->And I think it's the most challenging piece.</v>

19:58.950 --> 20:01.050
I know a 200-person organization

20:01.050 --> 20:04.710
where the IT manager says he's got 64 items

20:04.710 --> 20:07.710
on his to-do list that are all marked critical.

20:07.710 --> 20:08.670
And then after that,

20:08.670 --> 20:13.670
he can talk about a business continuity plan, response plan,

20:13.680 --> 20:16.143
any of this type of planning for the future.

20:17.191 --> 20:18.210
A lot of the smaller businesses

20:18.210 --> 20:21.390
are just hoping the worst does not happen.

20:21.390 --> 20:22.980
<v Kyle>And I mean, that kind of leads perfect segue</v>

20:22.980 --> 20:24.150
into the next point

20:24.150 --> 20:26.520
in terms of how we can prevent future attacks going forward.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.500
And I think Meredith, I'll start with you,

20:28.500 --> 20:29.490
and everybody please chime in,

20:29.490 --> 20:32.220
but what is the first step,

20:32.220 --> 20:34.140
and what are ways employees can train...

20:34.140 --> 20:37.140
or employers can train their employees and educate them

20:37.140 --> 20:39.540
to prevent future data breaches?

20:39.540 --> 20:40.683
<v ->Ooh, good question.</v>

20:41.880 --> 20:44.700
Look, I think we all probably have at our organizations

20:44.700 --> 20:46.800
the typical like click-through training,

20:46.800 --> 20:50.730
and this a phishing email, spot the insider threat.

20:50.730 --> 20:51.960
I think it's good

20:51.960 --> 20:56.730
that those are part of our regular compliance

20:56.730 --> 20:57.810
and annual trainings,

20:57.810 --> 20:59.910
but do they really move the needle?

20:59.910 --> 21:01.320
Who knows? I think where...

21:01.320 --> 21:03.810
And just to give you this background,

21:03.810 --> 21:06.840
I came from an organization into consulting

21:06.840 --> 21:08.760
that had a massive breach.

21:08.760 --> 21:11.913
How many people have heard of the company Equifax?

21:12.870 --> 21:15.060
Yeah, I was the Head of Crisis Communications

21:15.060 --> 21:17.340
during their 2017 breach.

21:17.340 --> 21:19.230
So, I have a little of experience,

21:19.230 --> 21:21.450
a little bit of experience with this.

21:21.450 --> 21:23.490
And what I would say is the company

21:23.490 --> 21:28.490
really went through a top-down, bottom up shift

21:30.450 --> 21:34.080
in the way that it prioritized cybersecurity.

21:34.080 --> 21:38.310
It became the first thing we talked about at every meeting,

21:38.310 --> 21:41.283
it was on the agenda for every town hall.

21:42.330 --> 21:47.330
The company post-incident tied annual incentive bonuses

21:47.640 --> 21:50.670
to individual security goals

21:50.670 --> 21:53.283
for every employee of the company.

21:54.240 --> 21:59.240
You regularly saw our CISO in your email inbox

21:59.730 --> 22:01.380
reminding you of things.

22:01.380 --> 22:05.460
We became very involved in certain groups

22:05.460 --> 22:07.860
that advocated for consumer privacy

22:07.860 --> 22:11.130
and better cyber awareness training.

22:11.130 --> 22:15.993
So, I think it's more than just doing the bare minimum.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.630
It's really a culture shift,

22:18.630 --> 22:20.970
and we have a program on my team now,

22:20.970 --> 22:24.180
but just because we do think this is so important

22:24.180 --> 22:28.590
where companies can hire us, essentially,

22:28.590 --> 22:33.590
to benchmark their culture of cybersecurity and figure out:

22:33.660 --> 22:34.770
Do I have a good culture?

22:34.770 --> 22:38.460
What are some of the things I need to be doing as a leader

22:38.460 --> 22:39.930
to move the needle,

22:39.930 --> 22:43.140
so that next year, when we do the same benchmarking,

22:43.140 --> 22:45.210
we can see the progress we've made?

22:45.210 --> 22:46.800
Or if we haven't made any progress,

22:46.800 --> 22:51.210
we know what levers to pull to make the score move,

22:51.210 --> 22:53.460
almost like a NIST framework or something like that,

22:53.460 --> 22:55.530
this is specific to culture.

22:55.530 --> 22:57.660
So, I do think training is important,

22:57.660 --> 22:59.760
I do think awareness is important,

22:59.760 --> 23:01.770
but I really think, to sum it up,

23:01.770 --> 23:02.850
it starts at the top

23:02.850 --> 23:06.930
and it has to be an organization-wide priority

23:06.930 --> 23:09.510
for it to really make a difference.

23:09.510 --> 23:11.610
<v ->Mm-hmm, can I just piggyback on that?</v>

23:11.610 --> 23:12.630
I think that is so smart

23:12.630 --> 23:15.660
because the shifting of corporate culture,

23:15.660 --> 23:18.090
regardless of what shift you want,

23:18.090 --> 23:20.790
shifting a corporate culture is an enormous task.

23:20.790 --> 23:23.430
And if you go back to like the '60s and '70s

23:23.430 --> 23:25.530
when the United States' manufacturing industry

23:25.530 --> 23:30.450
was getting hammered by quality...

23:30.450 --> 23:32.070
Sorry, automotive industry was getting hammered

23:32.070 --> 23:33.720
by quality concerns,

23:33.720 --> 23:37.293
as compared to imports.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.110
Companies like Ford

23:40.110 --> 23:43.320
put together massive campaigns internally,

23:43.320 --> 23:45.210
very similar to what you're describing at Equifax,

23:45.210 --> 23:48.090
where it suddenly became job one to do quality,

23:48.090 --> 23:50.370
and that became an actual marketing slogan.

23:50.370 --> 23:54.870
But if you were at Ford, you were part of a quality circle,

23:54.870 --> 23:59.870
you were part of ongoing requirements

24:01.020 --> 24:05.310
to find and remove errors, error cause removal.

24:05.310 --> 24:06.990
Kaizen was the word.

24:06.990 --> 24:08.700
So there's all of this stuff going on

24:08.700 --> 24:11.250
and incentives tied to your pay,

24:11.250 --> 24:12.900
the whole thing, exactly what you're describing,

24:12.900 --> 24:14.250
Ford had to go through that.

24:14.250 --> 24:16.080
And what happened? They did turn it around.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.300
It took them a decade to turn it around,

24:18.300 --> 24:20.130
even with this massive push.

24:20.130 --> 24:24.840
And it's just an enormous effort to shift a culture.

24:24.840 --> 24:29.840
So you can't do it, I believe, without C-suite push.

24:29.940 --> 24:32.550
And I mean CISO is a C-suite office,

24:32.550 --> 24:36.030
but I think a CEO is much-
<v Meredith>And the board.</v>

24:36.030 --> 24:37.260
<v ->And the board, yeah,</v>

24:37.260 --> 24:38.970
it really has to be something

24:38.970 --> 24:41.010
that the corporation considers a priority

24:41.010 --> 24:43.290
because it is an expense, not a revenue opportunity,

24:43.290 --> 24:46.020
not a profit increase opportunity.

24:46.020 --> 24:47.790
It's a cost center element.

24:47.790 --> 24:51.180
It's hard to get that level of commitment and priority.

24:51.180 --> 24:53.100
It's unfortunately where we're at.

24:53.100 --> 24:54.540
<v ->Mike, as a Metro Detroiter,</v>

24:54.540 --> 24:56.340
I'm a big fan of Alan Mulally,

24:56.340 --> 24:58.279
so I appreciate that you made that reference.

24:58.279 --> 24:59.370
(Meredith and Mike laughing)

24:59.370 --> 25:01.590
And I think some of that mind shift

25:01.590 --> 25:06.590
is to see security as a business enabler, right?

25:06.780 --> 25:07.710
I mean, everyone's here

25:07.710 --> 25:10.530
because of the rapid pace of technological innovation

25:10.530 --> 25:12.930
and adoption across a variety of industries

25:12.930 --> 25:14.530
to make all of our lives better.

25:15.750 --> 25:16.950
Pretty safe to say that.

25:18.210 --> 25:20.610
That can't entirely be accomplished

25:20.610 --> 25:22.170
in the way that it's intended,

25:22.170 --> 25:26.250
as far as making the impact to of the lives of a consumer,

25:26.250 --> 25:28.470
the continued operation of a business,

25:28.470 --> 25:30.510
and to keep pace with the level of innovation

25:30.510 --> 25:31.590
that's expected,

25:31.590 --> 25:33.180
and in many ways incumbent upon us

25:33.180 --> 25:36.600
to continue to operate a healthy economy

25:36.600 --> 25:38.403
and a global market.

25:39.930 --> 25:42.330
If what we are implementing

25:42.330 --> 25:44.070
and what we're creating and building

25:44.070 --> 25:47.220
doesn't have security built into its foundation

25:47.220 --> 25:50.910
to either protect the privacy of consumers

25:50.910 --> 25:52.140
or protect, in some cases,

25:52.140 --> 25:55.050
the physical security of those consumers as well.

25:55.050 --> 25:56.610
<v ->And Brendan, I kinda wanna stay with your comment,</v>

25:56.610 --> 25:58.980
going off that right there is:

25:58.980 --> 26:00.210
What type of technologies

26:00.210 --> 26:01.710
are you seeing in this space right now

26:01.710 --> 26:04.260
that are helping kind of make that transformation?

26:04.260 --> 26:05.610
Whether it be from a culture shift

26:05.610 --> 26:09.510
or from a how to basically prevent...

26:09.510 --> 26:10.770
Enhance incident response

26:10.770 --> 26:12.900
or prevent any type of incident from happening?

26:12.900 --> 26:15.570
So maybe a technology like automation or something.

26:15.570 --> 26:18.600
<v ->Yeah, and I think it almost dovetails quite nicely</v>

26:18.600 --> 26:20.070
into some of Mike's prior comments

26:20.070 --> 26:23.610
is relative to resourcing,

26:23.610 --> 26:27.720
that's a challenge that we have in our consulting business.

26:27.720 --> 26:30.060
It's a challenge that every organization around the world,

26:30.060 --> 26:31.380
large or small,

26:31.380 --> 26:33.390
there's a very common thread of resourcing

26:33.390 --> 26:37.200
and resourcing for highly-qualified cyber defense operators

26:37.200 --> 26:41.130
in a way that prevents either nation-state-level adversaries

26:41.130 --> 26:42.375
or criminal adversaries

26:42.375 --> 26:45.900
that are maybe targeting a little bit lower hanging fruit.

26:45.900 --> 26:46.770
It is the ability

26:46.770 --> 26:49.500
to sift through what is actually the most important thing

26:49.500 --> 26:51.060
that they need to respond to.

26:51.060 --> 26:52.920
So, you made the comment about the friend of yours

26:52.920 --> 26:55.590
was 64 critical items on his checklist.

26:55.590 --> 26:57.060
That is a lot of critical items.

26:57.060 --> 26:58.830
And if you were to look at many EDR tools,

26:58.830 --> 27:02.160
or you look at many seams,

27:02.160 --> 27:04.800
or other sort of log aggregators that are gonna tell you

27:04.800 --> 27:06.690
what is the highest level of importance

27:06.690 --> 27:09.210
of what thing you need to respond to,

27:09.210 --> 27:11.160
everything's gonna be red, yellow,

27:11.160 --> 27:13.590
maybe some green, a couple of orange in there,

27:13.590 --> 27:15.090
probably depends on how the product company

27:15.090 --> 27:16.503
presents that information.

27:17.790 --> 27:20.280
But there's a lot of things that you would have to do.

27:20.280 --> 27:24.900
And ultimately, the ability to create higher fidelity alerts

27:24.900 --> 27:27.720
for the analyst to be able to respond faster

27:27.720 --> 27:30.780
and respond in a way that creates a better impact

27:30.780 --> 27:32.730
to preventing malicious activity

27:32.730 --> 27:34.800
is ultimately that's what we look to

27:34.800 --> 27:37.020
and that's what we advise our clients on.

27:37.020 --> 27:38.700
Whether that's AI-enabled,

27:38.700 --> 27:40.860
whether it's machine-learning-operated,

27:40.860 --> 27:43.353
or a variety of other outcomes to achieve that.

27:44.648 --> 27:46.140
<v Kyle>And I mean, perfect segue to the next spot,</v>

27:46.140 --> 27:49.080
but Mike, I mean, you're the emerging technology expert

27:49.080 --> 27:50.940
in terms of at CTA.

27:50.940 --> 27:52.950
How are technologies like AI and quantum

27:52.950 --> 27:54.690
kind of being leveraged proactively

27:54.690 --> 27:57.303
to secure systems against future attacks?

27:58.680 --> 28:00.900
<v ->So, that's kind of a two-pronged question.</v>

28:00.900 --> 28:02.000
It's a great question.

28:02.910 --> 28:04.770
So, starting with quantum.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.420
I think it's not a secret

28:06.420 --> 28:09.535
that we're anticipating that sometime in...

28:09.535 --> 28:12.150
the next decade, the 2030s.

28:12.150 --> 28:17.150
There will be, cryptographically relevant quantum computers,

28:17.951 --> 28:20.310
CRQCs,

28:20.310 --> 28:23.910
and these are computers that are powerful enough

28:23.910 --> 28:26.853
to crack modern public key infrastructure,

28:27.750 --> 28:30.300
public key encryption.

28:30.300 --> 28:35.300
So, what happens then is anybody who is using public key,

28:35.580 --> 28:38.520
the way we use it now with RSA and lift to curve,

28:38.520 --> 28:41.700
anyone who's using that in 2035

28:41.700 --> 28:46.700
is at risk of their data being collected and decrypted,

28:48.300 --> 28:52.080
whether it's financial reports, intellectual property,

28:52.080 --> 28:54.810
sensitive email communications, all of that.

28:54.810 --> 28:57.000
So anything that's protected with TLS,

28:57.000 --> 28:59.670
for example right now, HTTPS.

28:59.670 --> 29:00.510
That's great.

29:00.510 --> 29:03.330
All right, we've got a decade to prepare, right?

29:03.330 --> 29:06.510
The problem is the harvest-now-decrypt-later problem,

29:06.510 --> 29:10.890
which is data that is collected today,

29:10.890 --> 29:14.130
whether it's by a competitor, a nation state,

29:14.130 --> 29:16.890
that data can be decrypted

29:16.890 --> 29:21.890
when that cryptographically relevant quantum computer

29:21.960 --> 29:23.910
becomes available.

29:23.910 --> 29:26.070
That means it's an immediate problem.

29:26.070 --> 29:28.080
I mean, what secrets do you have now

29:28.080 --> 29:32.070
that you really don't want revealed in 2035?

29:32.070 --> 29:35.190
A lot of things have a sort of like a lifetime,

29:35.190 --> 29:36.930
a half-life.

29:36.930 --> 29:38.310
But there are some things, probably,

29:38.310 --> 29:40.170
that you really don't want people to know about,

29:40.170 --> 29:42.300
even 10 years from now,

29:42.300 --> 29:45.630
and it may be trade secrets or something like that.

29:45.630 --> 29:46.923
The formula for Coke,

29:48.356 --> 29:51.750
the 11 herbs and spices in Kentucky Fried Chicken.

29:51.750 --> 29:56.460
So, that means that the problem

29:56.460 --> 30:01.460
of getting post-quantum safe is a real problem now.

30:01.950 --> 30:04.350
So NIST, the Department of Commerce's

30:04.350 --> 30:07.230
National Institute of Science and Technology,

30:07.230 --> 30:10.710
has been driving development of algorithms,

30:10.710 --> 30:12.360
standardization of those algorithms

30:12.360 --> 30:15.360
into how they can be incorporated

30:15.360 --> 30:18.210
into the tools that we use every day,

30:18.210 --> 30:20.940
and encouraging industry to migrate.

30:20.940 --> 30:22.020
How do you migrate?

30:22.020 --> 30:23.610
Inventory your use of encryption

30:23.610 --> 30:27.810
and public key infrastructure, know where you're using it,

30:27.810 --> 30:29.490
and this goes to the point Meredith had made,

30:29.490 --> 30:30.640
know what you're doing.

30:32.100 --> 30:36.180
And then work with your vendors

30:36.180 --> 30:40.560
on replacing what you're using now

30:40.560 --> 30:42.660
with something that's quantum-safe.

30:42.660 --> 30:44.550
The challenge is it would be nice

30:44.550 --> 30:46.560
if just dropped in one for one replacement.

30:46.560 --> 30:49.200
There's some things that are done a little bit differently.

30:49.200 --> 30:51.030
But this is actually happening now.

30:51.030 --> 30:52.930
And so get on that train a little bit.

30:54.185 --> 30:56.310
Go to the NIST website.

30:56.310 --> 31:01.270
All you have to do is hunt down NIST post-quantum roadmap,

31:02.160 --> 31:03.270
and you can find information

31:03.270 --> 31:05.193
on what you should be doing there.

31:06.570 --> 31:08.850
And talk to your vendors, do your inventorying.

31:08.850 --> 31:10.233
So, there's one.

31:12.060 --> 31:12.893
The second one,

31:12.893 --> 31:17.400
artificial intelligence is really interesting situation

31:17.400 --> 31:22.140
because it's weapons for both sides, right?

31:22.140 --> 31:24.240
It's red team and blue team weapons.

31:24.240 --> 31:28.643
So you've got tools that are coming along nicely for...

31:32.490 --> 31:37.490
endpoint detection of exploits and attacks

31:37.650 --> 31:39.260
for all kinds of...

31:41.790 --> 31:46.140
all kinds of compromises.

31:46.140 --> 31:48.450
So, artificial intelligence is a very powerful tool.

31:48.450 --> 31:50.010
That's great.

31:50.010 --> 31:51.721
On the other hand, the hackers have it, too.

31:51.721 --> 31:52.800
(Mike laughing)

31:52.800 --> 31:57.800
And so what we're seeing is we track a little of this

31:57.900 --> 31:59.580
in terms of some companies that we watch

31:59.580 --> 32:03.240
for the Nasdaq NQCYBR Index

32:03.240 --> 32:08.240
to see who's using AI for what purposes on the attack side.

32:08.550 --> 32:11.130
And we also hear about it from CISA

32:11.130 --> 32:15.600
and other government agencies on the threat side.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.330
And it's interesting because what I have seen,

32:18.330 --> 32:20.340
I would characterize it as a race

32:20.340 --> 32:22.320
where one side pulls ahead,

32:22.320 --> 32:23.880
then the other side pulls ahead.

32:23.880 --> 32:26.490
Right now, I'd give the hackers a slight edge.

32:26.490 --> 32:29.313
And that's just the chaos that they benefit from.

32:30.960 --> 32:34.394
<v Meredith>And the resources we give them, we pay them.</v>

32:34.394 --> 32:35.610
(Meredith laughing)

32:35.610 --> 32:37.153
<v ->Yeah, I mean if you look at...</v>

32:37.153 --> 32:40.063
I don't know if you mentioned this, but the ransomware,

32:40.063 --> 32:43.260
the biggest ransomware organizations are...

32:43.260 --> 32:46.500
I mean, these are billion-dollar organizations now.

32:46.500 --> 32:47.430
It's ridiculous.

32:47.430 --> 32:49.230
I mean, something like $50 billion

32:49.230 --> 32:51.990
for the largest organization, their revenue up to date,

32:51.990 --> 32:54.930
and what they're doing with that is they're reinvesting it.

32:54.930 --> 32:58.530
I mean, it's like going to war with Microsoft at this point.

32:58.530 --> 33:00.177
<v ->So, going off that, like what are some of,</v>

33:00.177 --> 33:01.500
and this is probably

33:01.500 --> 33:02.760
more Brendan and Meredith kind of question,

33:02.760 --> 33:05.670
but what are the top priorities for organizations right now

33:05.670 --> 33:07.770
and looking to strengthen over the next five years?

33:07.770 --> 33:09.930
So he mentioned quantum that's starting now,

33:09.930 --> 33:14.400
but it won't be kind of industry-wide until 2035 or 2030s.

33:14.400 --> 33:15.840
What are some of the top priorities right now

33:15.840 --> 33:18.090
or organizations are doing to either, A, get ready for that,

33:18.090 --> 33:21.240
or B, just prevent future attacks in general?

33:21.240 --> 33:22.680
<v ->Do you wanna start?</v>

33:22.680 --> 33:25.630
<v ->Yeah, I mean, I'm gonna use a prior comment that I made</v>

33:26.850 --> 33:27.800
of...

33:29.220 --> 33:32.487
taking it back to basic and foundational security concepts,

33:32.487 --> 33:34.533
and that is the best place to start.

33:36.120 --> 33:38.610
Resources will always continue to be a challenge,

33:38.610 --> 33:40.740
and especially as there is, I think,

33:40.740 --> 33:43.830
more sophisticated adoption of AI,

33:43.830 --> 33:47.280
quantum threat becomes far more prevalent

33:47.280 --> 33:49.020
as time progresses.

33:49.020 --> 33:53.550
But that's the highest impact that can be made now.

33:53.550 --> 33:57.060
So, I'd rather see whether at the enterprise level

33:57.060 --> 33:58.770
or organizations that are much smaller

33:58.770 --> 34:01.530
and in the SMB mid-market category, if you will,

34:01.530 --> 34:04.320
I'd rather see monumental steps made

34:04.320 --> 34:07.410
towards foundational security concepts

34:07.410 --> 34:09.720
because they can make an immediate impact,

34:09.720 --> 34:13.773
rather than massive investments in different products, even.

34:14.730 --> 34:18.600
There are more policy-driven angles that can be taken

34:18.600 --> 34:20.160
that don't require necessarily...

34:20.160 --> 34:21.630
There's still some resource investment

34:21.630 --> 34:23.550
of someone's time and labor,

34:23.550 --> 34:26.070
but does not necessarily require

34:26.070 --> 34:27.900
very large licensing purchases.

34:27.900 --> 34:30.000
Doesn't necessarily require an organization

34:30.000 --> 34:32.370
to go and buy every single product under the sun

34:32.370 --> 34:34.590
in order to accomplish some of the foundational tasks

34:34.590 --> 34:37.320
that someone ultimately should be responsible for

34:37.320 --> 34:39.559
or held responsible for.

34:39.559 --> 34:40.392
<v ->I couldn't agree more.</v>

34:40.392 --> 34:43.470
I mean, I think it's the basic blocking and tackling

34:43.470 --> 34:45.660
sort of the fundamentals of security

34:45.660 --> 34:50.460
that we still see organizations fall down on

34:50.460 --> 34:54.570
and are the cause of most breaches, right?

34:54.570 --> 34:56.280
Like, they didn't apply a patch,

34:56.280 --> 34:59.010
so patch management needs to be prioritized.

34:59.010 --> 35:02.400
They're looking for some sort of new technology,

35:02.400 --> 35:06.090
shiny bullet that they can install to keep them safer,

35:06.090 --> 35:11.090
but yet they're behind on security and awareness training

35:11.130 --> 35:13.323
or whatever it may be.

35:14.490 --> 35:17.190
So, I do think you make such an important point

35:17.190 --> 35:19.710
with the basic blocking and tackling,

35:19.710 --> 35:21.933
asset inventory, all of those things.

35:23.010 --> 35:26.640
Culture, prioritizing, as we said before,

35:26.640 --> 35:31.640
the mindset of security is a priority for our company.

35:32.160 --> 35:35.280
And that basic preparedness.

35:35.280 --> 35:37.140
Having your incident response plan,

35:37.140 --> 35:42.140
ensuring that it's practiced, tested, constantly evolved.

35:42.870 --> 35:45.030
So many times, we're still seeing...

35:45.030 --> 35:48.180
We get really excited when the root cause of an incident

35:48.180 --> 35:51.720
is some like zero-day vulnerability or something like that,

35:51.720 --> 35:55.290
but I can't tell you how few and far between those are.

35:55.290 --> 35:56.880
It is still the basic,

35:56.880 --> 35:59.970
like employee fell for a phishing link,

35:59.970 --> 36:04.970
or creds, passwords were reused and scraped off the dark web

36:06.270 --> 36:09.600
because an employee used the same one,

36:09.600 --> 36:12.630
or passwords weren't rotated or complex enough.

36:12.630 --> 36:16.830
And it's always those basic human-driven errors

36:16.830 --> 36:19.800
that tend to be the cause

36:19.800 --> 36:21.810
of so many of the big incidents we work on,

36:21.810 --> 36:23.970
and really they're preventable.

36:23.970 --> 36:27.450
So again, it's like knowing your assets,

36:27.450 --> 36:29.490
legacy systems,

36:29.490 --> 36:32.340
password requirements and complexity requirements,

36:32.340 --> 36:34.290
training, awareness.

36:34.290 --> 36:35.123
Those are the things

36:35.123 --> 36:37.410
that companies still aren't getting right.

36:37.410 --> 36:39.557
That lead to, I would say,

36:39.557 --> 36:42.783
90% of the massive incidents we work on.

36:42.783 --> 36:45.090
<v ->Hmm, and these are some of the largest organizations</v>

36:45.090 --> 36:46.200
in the world

36:46.200 --> 36:49.440
that are falling victim to an incident

36:49.440 --> 36:51.690
that is ultimately stemming from the same challenge

36:51.690 --> 36:53.670
that some of the smallest companies in the world

36:53.670 --> 36:54.900
are dealing with as well.

36:54.900 --> 36:56.430
Whether it's five endpoints

36:56.430 --> 36:58.740
or 500,000 endpoints in an environment,

36:58.740 --> 37:00.873
it is consistently the same problem.

37:04.290 --> 37:06.630
<v ->Everything you guys are saying really resonates.</v>

37:06.630 --> 37:08.940
One of the things I noticed the other day,

37:08.940 --> 37:10.200
I was looking at CISA's

37:10.200 --> 37:15.200
15 Most Exploited Vulnerabilities of 2024, right?

37:16.440 --> 37:19.050
And 2023, I think this was.

37:19.050 --> 37:22.641
And several of them were two or three years old.

37:22.641 --> 37:23.474
(Meredith chuckling)

37:23.474 --> 37:25.350
It's like most exploited,

37:25.350 --> 37:28.110
not something that just cropped up once or twice.

37:28.110 --> 37:31.800
The most commonly exploited ones were known

37:31.800 --> 37:36.597
and documented with CVEs three years before, so...

37:36.597 --> 37:38.301
<v ->And patch was never applied.</v>

37:38.301 --> 37:39.134
(Meredith laughing)

37:39.134 --> 37:39.967
<v ->I mean, that's a perfect</v>

37:39.967 --> 37:41.220
kind of in my last question for the day,

37:41.220 --> 37:45.240
but because that is a governmental agency,

37:45.240 --> 37:46.170
how can partnerships

37:46.170 --> 37:48.210
between the private sector and the government

37:48.210 --> 37:50.700
accelerate the adoption of these preventative measures

37:50.700 --> 37:51.533
across the industry?

37:51.533 --> 37:52.366
And I'll probably start with Mike

37:52.366 --> 37:54.180
'cause you may have a better understanding,

37:54.180 --> 37:56.820
but please open it up to everybody else after that.

37:56.820 --> 37:58.443
<v ->Sure, sure. Well, one thing.</v>

37:59.670 --> 38:03.990
It's not so much preventative as it is preparation,

38:03.990 --> 38:07.110
but along with the other comments that Meredith had made,

38:07.110 --> 38:08.790
I want to add in.

38:08.790 --> 38:11.940
Get to know your local FBI office, right?

38:11.940 --> 38:16.710
The first person you should call when you have been hacked

38:16.710 --> 38:18.360
is that person.

38:18.360 --> 38:19.380
And it shouldn't be the first time.

38:19.380 --> 38:20.580
Again, this is something you were saying,

38:20.580 --> 38:23.160
it should not be the first time you talk to your vendors.

38:23.160 --> 38:25.980
It also shouldn't be the first time you talk to the FBI.

38:25.980 --> 38:30.600
They're not there to like judge, "Can I help them?

38:30.600 --> 38:32.280
And by the way, were any laws broken?"

38:32.280 --> 38:35.430
They're entirely there to help you.

38:35.430 --> 38:38.700
And yeah, they're gonna be talking to you

38:38.700 --> 38:40.560
about whether or not you pay for the ransomware,

38:40.560 --> 38:44.760
but ultimately, that'll be your call.

38:44.760 --> 38:47.790
Definitely get to know the FBI, the local.

38:47.790 --> 38:50.280
They would love to talk to you, trust me.

38:50.280 --> 38:51.810
<v ->Yeah, and I think building on that,</v>

38:51.810 --> 38:54.300
it depends on what industry you're in, too.

38:54.300 --> 38:56.880
I mean, CISA can be a great partner

38:56.880 --> 38:59.880
if you're deemed critical infrastructure.

38:59.880 --> 39:02.010
Some of the ISACs are great,

39:02.010 --> 39:05.020
the FS-ISAC for if you're in financial services

39:06.240 --> 39:10.440
are really good sources of meaningful threat intelligence.

39:10.440 --> 39:12.600
Totally agree with the FBI.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.070
I might argue your first case

39:14.070 --> 39:15.740
should be call to your lawyer, but...

39:15.740 --> 39:16.573
(Meredith laughing)

39:16.573 --> 39:17.580
<v ->Well, that too.</v>
<v ->But no, no, I'm joking.</v>

39:17.580 --> 39:19.470
<v ->Not first off, yeah.</v>
<v ->But truly,</v>

39:19.470 --> 39:23.610
we do see the FBI now providing, again, meaningful IoCs,

39:23.610 --> 39:25.593
meaningful threat intelligence.

39:26.430 --> 39:29.100
maybe they had a case with the same bad guys a week ago

39:29.100 --> 39:30.240
where a payment was made

39:30.240 --> 39:32.100
and the company was re-extorted anyways,

39:32.100 --> 39:33.663
we see that a lot now.

39:34.860 --> 39:37.380
So, I do think the partnership

39:37.380 --> 39:41.280
between the government and private sector

39:41.280 --> 39:43.050
has gotten stronger and better,

39:43.050 --> 39:46.350
and there's not this fear anymore to pick up the phone

39:46.350 --> 39:48.990
and call your local law enforcement, there's no...

39:48.990 --> 39:52.410
We rarely see leaks to the public

39:52.410 --> 39:55.413
or to the press coming from law enforcement,

39:56.430 --> 39:59.640
and like, it's a great way to get some kudos, too,

39:59.640 --> 40:02.220
if you do have to go public with the incident.

40:02.220 --> 40:04.950
In particular, if you're dealing with a zero-day exploit

40:04.950 --> 40:06.780
or a zero-day vulnerability,

40:06.780 --> 40:08.220
you provide that to CISA,

40:08.220 --> 40:10.920
CISA gives you a pat on the back for it.

40:10.920 --> 40:13.410
You can go out and say we were proactive.

40:13.410 --> 40:15.000
Rising tide lifts all boats.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.460
We wanna be good partners to our peers

40:17.460 --> 40:19.050
and to others in the industry

40:19.050 --> 40:21.240
so that they can learn from this, too.

40:21.240 --> 40:25.473
So, totally agree with what you said and echo everything.

40:26.310 --> 40:29.190
<v ->Yeah, I'll definitely echo that again.</v>

40:29.190 --> 40:30.630
Information sharing is critical,

40:30.630 --> 40:32.670
and that's in many places,

40:32.670 --> 40:34.860
not obviously a variety of these agencies

40:34.860 --> 40:37.650
that you referenced have their own capabilities

40:37.650 --> 40:40.020
to go research and identify this type of activity,

40:40.020 --> 40:41.850
and certainly through the IC3

40:41.850 --> 40:43.470
or other reporting avenues as well.

40:43.470 --> 40:47.070
But, we help feed that information as well.

40:47.070 --> 40:49.500
So we report this type of information

40:49.500 --> 40:51.660
to various agencies in anonymized ways,

40:51.660 --> 40:54.180
and only when we're authorized to do so.

40:54.180 --> 40:57.990
But it helps to embolden the security posture

40:57.990 --> 40:59.310
of the entire world.

40:59.310 --> 41:00.420
So, that's the goal.

41:00.420 --> 41:04.020
<v ->I will add on your information-sharing perspective.</v>

41:04.020 --> 41:06.540
One of the kinds of information the FBI has,

41:06.540 --> 41:10.530
keys to the ransomware that has been reused.

41:10.530 --> 41:13.020
Sometimes, after the ransom is paid,

41:13.020 --> 41:15.510
they discover that the hackers

41:15.510 --> 41:17.640
are doing the same password sharing that...

41:17.640 --> 41:20.250
or password reuse that we all do, right?

41:20.250 --> 41:22.320
So they're like, "Well, we'll just use the same one.

41:22.320 --> 41:23.970
We're not gonna generate a new key for this one."

41:23.970 --> 41:25.590
And so the FBI sometimes

41:25.590 --> 41:27.270
can actually uncrack the ransomware for you.

41:27.270 --> 41:28.917
So definitely.
<v ->It's a great point.</v>

41:28.917 --> 41:30.630
And sorry, last thing I'm gonna say,

41:30.630 --> 41:31.860
I know we're out of time.

41:31.860 --> 41:33.630
So our team actually worked on,

41:33.630 --> 41:35.010
it's very public, we worked on it,

41:35.010 --> 41:37.590
so it's a case I can actually talk about for once.

41:37.590 --> 41:40.620
But we worked on the colonial pipeline crisis response

41:40.620 --> 41:41.910
for that ransomware incident.

41:41.910 --> 41:43.200
For anyone that doesn't know it,

41:43.200 --> 41:45.510
that was the attack on the pipeline

41:45.510 --> 41:49.020
that moves gasoline up and down the East Coast of the U.S.

41:49.020 --> 41:51.300
So a couple years ago, if you ran out of gas,

41:51.300 --> 41:53.010
that was the situation,

41:53.010 --> 41:56.940
and the company notified the FBI so quickly

41:56.940 --> 42:00.990
and was in touch with DHS, the DOE, the White House.

42:00.990 --> 42:03.450
We were briefing the White House every day, the NSC,

42:03.450 --> 42:05.430
and they acted so quickly

42:05.430 --> 42:08.520
that the FBI was actually able to trace the payment

42:08.520 --> 42:09.420
that the company made

42:09.420 --> 42:13.950
to get the decryption key on blockchain to the bad guys

42:13.950 --> 42:17.970
and then see the money moving to these different affiliates

42:17.970 --> 42:19.560
of the ransomware gang.

42:19.560 --> 42:20.700
And ultimately,

42:20.700 --> 42:23.400
they were able to claw back to intercept that

42:23.400 --> 42:25.680
and get some of the money back for the company.

42:25.680 --> 42:26.940
Doesn't happen often,

42:26.940 --> 42:29.640
but it was a benefit of the call

42:29.640 --> 42:32.550
being one of the first they made to law enforcement.

42:32.550 --> 42:35.703
So, it truly can help in times of need.

42:36.690 --> 42:37.830
<v ->Thank you so much. I mean, thank you so much.</v>

42:37.830 --> 42:39.420
We are out of time.

42:39.420 --> 42:40.620
Getting a little cut off here,

42:40.620 --> 42:42.900
but kind of to wrap it all up.

42:42.900 --> 42:44.190
One thing, if you don't...

42:44.190 --> 42:46.580
If you leave here with anything, I'm just gonna say it.

42:46.580 --> 42:48.330
If you see it, say it,

42:48.330 --> 42:51.060
and communication is key for cybersecurity.

42:51.060 --> 42:52.320
So, thank you all so much.

42:52.320 --> 42:53.220
Thank you all for being here,

42:53.220 --> 42:55.725
and enjoy the rest of your show, please.

42:55.725 --> 42:56.618
(audience applauding)

42:56.618 --> 42:59.285
(upbeat music)
