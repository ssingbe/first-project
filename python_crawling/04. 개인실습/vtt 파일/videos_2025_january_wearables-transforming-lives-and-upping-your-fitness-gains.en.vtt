00:01.419 --> 00:04.002
(upbeat music)

2
00:10.470 --> 00:12.270
<v ->First of all, good morning everyone.</v>

3
00:12.270 --> 00:16.170
Welcome to the Lifestyle and Retail track.

4
00:16.170 --> 00:17.520
I'm Janey Park

5
00:17.520 --> 00:20.640
and I'm really excited to be moderating this panel today

6
00:20.640 --> 00:22.680
with my lovely panelists.

7
00:22.680 --> 00:24.510
And we are talking about something

8
00:24.510 --> 00:28.500
that we're all very excited about, which is wearable tech,

9
00:28.500 --> 00:31.890
as I like to call it, wearable fashion tech.

10
00:31.890 --> 00:35.880
And we're going to be starting with a quick poll

11
00:35.880 --> 00:38.040
from our audience that's here.

12
00:38.040 --> 00:39.930
Who uses wearable tech?

13
00:39.930 --> 00:42.000
Can you please raise your hands?

14
00:42.000 --> 00:45.393
Okay, so majority of you are plugged in.

15
00:46.410 --> 00:48.813
And how about smart watches?

16
00:50.430 --> 00:51.390
Okay, we have many.

17
00:51.390 --> 00:54.243
And lastly, how about smart rings?

18
00:55.350 --> 00:56.640
Okay, so a little bit less,

19
00:56.640 --> 00:59.853
but people are plugged into wearable tech, which is great.

20
01:01.320 --> 01:02.400
So it's really amazing,

21
01:02.400 --> 01:04.320
obviously to see how wearable tech

22
01:04.320 --> 01:06.450
has become a integral part of our lives

23
01:06.450 --> 01:08.940
and it's a transformative part of our industry.

24
01:08.940 --> 01:11.910
And what I wanna get into is,

25
01:11.910 --> 01:13.830
first, let me just introduce myself,

26
01:13.830 --> 01:16.470
probably wondering what I'm doing here today.

27
01:16.470 --> 01:17.550
So my name is Janey Park.

28
01:17.550 --> 01:20.160
I'm a beauty fashion, a wearable tech strategist

29
01:20.160 --> 01:22.890
with over 20 years of global experience,

30
01:22.890 --> 01:25.260
including roles at brands like LVMH,

31
01:25.260 --> 01:27.300
Macy's Lip and Cotton, Elizabeth Arden,

32
01:27.300 --> 01:28.860
and 10 years in Asia.

33
01:28.860 --> 01:30.997
And I've also led marketing

34
01:30.997 --> 01:32.160
and growth at a digital fashion house.

35
01:32.160 --> 01:35.430
Everything from NFTs, air filters,

36
01:35.430 --> 01:36.930
and Metaverse initiatives.

37
01:36.930 --> 01:38.760
And I'm also the founder of a media brand

38
01:38.760 --> 01:40.530
called The Digital Runway,

39
01:40.530 --> 01:42.870
focusing on beauty, fashion, tech, and AI

40
01:42.870 --> 01:46.080
as an email newsletter that covers industry insights,

41
01:46.080 --> 01:48.120
as well as a LinkedIn live podcast.

42
01:48.120 --> 01:49.830
And it's my mission to bridge the gap

43
01:49.830 --> 01:53.160
between innovation, style, and equity.

44
01:53.160 --> 01:54.600
So without further ado,

45
01:54.600 --> 01:57.960
let me just give you a quick agenda overview

46
01:57.960 --> 02:01.173
in terms of what we are going over today.

47
02:02.100 --> 02:04.980
I feel like I am leading a classroom as I'm doing this,

48
02:04.980 --> 02:06.000
but just so you have an idea.

49
02:06.000 --> 02:07.530
So we're gonna be going over

50
02:07.530 --> 02:10.320
what these innovators are building, first of all,

51
02:10.320 --> 02:11.520
in wearable tech.

52
02:11.520 --> 02:14.310
And they're all doing some amazing, phenomenal things,

53
02:14.310 --> 02:17.460
getting into how wearable tech is transforming fitness,

54
02:17.460 --> 02:21.090
as well as daily lives, the challenges, opportunities,

55
02:21.090 --> 02:23.910
as well as interoperability in wearable tech.

56
02:23.910 --> 02:26.820
And finally, what the future holds

57
02:26.820 --> 02:28.770
for this exciting industry.

58
02:28.770 --> 02:31.410
So each panelist has been briefed,

59
02:31.410 --> 02:33.750
so you have a maximum of three minutes.

60
02:33.750 --> 02:36.750
You're gonna introduce yourselves, your company,

61
02:36.750 --> 02:39.000
and what you're building in wearable tech.

62
02:39.000 --> 02:41.550
So I'm gonna start from this side and go that way.

63
02:41.550 --> 02:44.460
So we'll start with Drew Blackard.

64
02:44.460 --> 02:47.820
You are the VP of Mobile Product Management at Samsung.

65
02:47.820 --> 02:50.280
So without further ado, kick us off.

66
02:50.280 --> 02:51.870
<v ->Hi guys, Drew Blackard,</v>

67
02:51.870 --> 02:55.573
and as you mentioned, I'm responsible for product management

68
02:55.573 --> 02:56.820
for mobile devices within the US market.

69
02:56.820 --> 03:01.740
And so our mobile devices include our smartphones,

70
03:01.740 --> 03:04.560
smart watches, tablets, PCs,

71
03:04.560 --> 03:08.220
and new wearable devices like our ring products.

72
03:08.220 --> 03:12.690
So overall, we're really trying to bring together

73
03:12.690 --> 03:14.130
an ecosystem of devices

74
03:14.130 --> 03:17.250
and wearable tech is super exciting for us,

75
03:17.250 --> 03:18.690
and super exciting for me also.

76
03:18.690 --> 03:21.243
Just personally, I'm a runner.

77
03:22.742 --> 03:24.420
I coach kids sports and things like that.

78
03:24.420 --> 03:26.490
So wearable tech to me is a really exciting,

79
03:26.490 --> 03:27.750
interesting area.

80
03:27.750 --> 03:30.030
Today, I'm excited to talk about

81
03:30.030 --> 03:32.040
not only the hardware products that we're doing

82
03:32.040 --> 03:33.660
like watch and and ring,

83
03:33.660 --> 03:36.870
but also the platform and services that pull that together.

84
03:36.870 --> 03:39.540
So Samsung Health, for example, is a service that we have,

85
03:39.540 --> 03:42.810
that's an enabling platform across our devices

86
03:42.810 --> 03:45.270
that can bring actionable insights to users.

87
03:45.270 --> 03:48.300
Then of course, one of the buzzwords of last year's CES

88
03:48.300 --> 03:50.070
and this year's CES is AI.

89
03:50.070 --> 03:52.230
And so how AI starts to take the data

90
03:52.230 --> 03:54.780
that we're collecting on these wearable devices

91
03:54.780 --> 03:57.150
and providing actionable insights to users.

92
03:57.150 --> 04:00.330
So I think that's what we're excited to talk about today.

93
04:00.330 --> 04:01.545
<v ->Amazing.</v>

94
04:01.545 --> 04:02.970
And just 'cause I'm Korean American on a fun note.

95
04:02.970 --> 04:06.060
How's your Korean, Drew? I'm putting you on the spot here.

96
04:06.060 --> 04:07.143
<v ->It's not great.</v>

97
04:08.850 --> 04:11.940
We go to Korea several times a year to work back

98
04:11.940 --> 04:15.360
and forth with our teams in Seoul and Suwon

99
04:15.360 --> 04:18.780
to make sure that we have the right products globally

100
04:18.780 --> 04:21.060
and for the consumers here in the US market.

101
04:21.060 --> 04:24.103
<v ->And how's the Suwon Galbi, which they're known for?</v>

102
04:24.103 --> 04:25.110
(Janey and Drew laughing)

103
04:25.110 --> 04:26.520
<v ->Okay.</v>

104
04:26.520 --> 04:30.030
<v ->Alright, so next we'll move on to Resh Sidhu</v>

105
04:30.030 --> 04:33.240
She's the Global Director of Arcadia Creative Studio

106
04:33.240 --> 04:36.150
at Snapchat coming with the fire fit today.

107
04:36.150 --> 04:38.370
So Resh, please introduce yourself.

108
04:38.370 --> 04:40.923
<v ->Hi everyone. Thanks Janey, appreciate it.</v>

109
04:42.030 --> 04:45.120
So I lead augmented reality at Snapchat.

110
04:45.120 --> 04:47.130
Team Arcadia is a team

111
04:47.130 --> 04:49.410
that is focused on working with brands

112
04:49.410 --> 04:52.773
to create first of a kind innovative AR experiences.

113
04:54.240 --> 04:58.707
I'm so excited about this panel because in September, 2024,

114
04:58.707 --> 05:00.450
and I know some of the panelists

115
05:00.450 --> 05:04.170
received one of these awesome little devices.

116
05:04.170 --> 05:07.680
So the sheer amount of excitement that I've had from people

117
05:07.680 --> 05:09.840
as I've navigated CES,

118
05:09.840 --> 05:12.450
because these are not consumer facing at the moment.

119
05:12.450 --> 05:15.810
What I'm holding in my hands is Snapchat spectacles.

120
05:15.810 --> 05:17.730
They are a developer version

121
05:17.730 --> 05:21.270
of standalone augmented reality glasses.

122
05:21.270 --> 05:24.960
We launched these with the focus to get these into the hands

123
05:24.960 --> 05:27.360
of incredible developers like yourself,

124
05:27.360 --> 05:29.970
and really leverage and tap into that community

125
05:29.970 --> 05:33.450
that Snapchat has been very well known for.

126
05:33.450 --> 05:37.530
Snapchat has over 850 million users

127
05:37.530 --> 05:40.500
and 300 million of them

128
05:40.500 --> 05:44.760
are using augmented reality on Snapchat every single day.

129
05:44.760 --> 05:48.270
So we know that augmented reality is an incredible tool

130
05:48.270 --> 05:50.550
to engage our community.

131
05:50.550 --> 05:51.390
And one of the things

132
05:51.390 --> 05:53.400
that's been very different about Snapchat

133
05:53.400 --> 05:56.700
is that we've always been about bringing people together.

134
05:56.700 --> 05:58.830
It was always about ephemeral messaging,

135
05:58.830 --> 06:02.250
conversations with your friends, connecting, sharing,

136
06:02.250 --> 06:03.690
and moments of joy.

137
06:03.690 --> 06:06.060
And whether that be puppy dog ears

138
06:06.060 --> 06:07.860
and vomiting rainbow filters.

139
06:07.860 --> 06:10.560
It was always about bringing people together.

140
06:10.560 --> 06:12.330
And we've taken those values,

141
06:12.330 --> 06:14.340
and this is actually our fifth generation

142
06:14.340 --> 06:16.590
of augmented reality glasses.

143
06:16.590 --> 06:19.725
Because at Snapchat, we really truly believe

144
06:19.725 --> 06:22.140
that technology can do better,

145
06:22.140 --> 06:24.570
do better at bringing people together.

146
06:24.570 --> 06:27.960
So the launch of these has really been about,

147
06:27.960 --> 06:29.190
yes, the technology

148
06:29.190 --> 06:32.130
and it's packed full of awesome technology,

149
06:32.130 --> 06:33.420
it's standalone.

150
06:33.420 --> 06:38.420
So no battery pack, no puck, it has AI,

151
06:38.550 --> 06:40.680
it also has world understanding.

152
06:40.680 --> 06:42.900
So it understands your world.

153
06:42.900 --> 06:46.380
It has voice interaction and understanding.

154
06:46.380 --> 06:49.680
But my favorite part is all of the experiences on here

155
06:49.680 --> 06:52.590
are built for you to do with people.

156
06:52.590 --> 06:54.810
It's about shared experiences.

157
06:54.810 --> 06:56.590
And the first branded experiences

158
06:57.660 --> 07:00.150
that we built on this was for Lego.

159
07:00.150 --> 07:02.310
So everybody loves Lego.

160
07:02.310 --> 07:04.830
I have two sons, they play with Lego all the time.

161
07:04.830 --> 07:07.410
As an adult I play with Lego all the time.

162
07:07.410 --> 07:08.970
And for a brand like Lego

163
07:08.970 --> 07:11.730
is an incredibly interesting device

164
07:11.730 --> 07:14.820
to be able to bring their vision of play

165
07:14.820 --> 07:16.320
and togetherness.

166
07:16.320 --> 07:20.220
And so now all of our panelists could pop one of these on

167
07:20.220 --> 07:22.800
and build an incredible Lego creation together.

168
07:22.800 --> 07:26.640
So it's really at the forefront of our computing vision

169
07:26.640 --> 07:28.080
and how we believe that technology

170
07:28.080 --> 07:29.940
can bring people together.

171
07:29.940 --> 07:32.068
<v ->And we're really excited about that.</v>

172
07:32.068 --> 07:33.510
We had a quick chat yesterday,

173
07:33.510 --> 07:35.790
excited to dig into a little bit more about the community

174
07:35.790 --> 07:38.460
and the creators later on during our panel.

175
07:38.460 --> 07:42.810
Next, Anna, I'm gonna try to pronounce your name.

176
07:42.810 --> 07:47.810
Anna Barnacka, CEO of MindMics, infrasonic earbuds.

177
07:47.970 --> 07:50.430
<v ->Hello everyone. My name is Anna Barnacka,</v>

178
07:50.430 --> 07:53.380
and I started MindMics about six years ago

179
07:54.852 --> 07:57.690
and before that I was actually an astrophysicist.

180
07:57.690 --> 08:00.180
And the way how it started was I was at Harvard,

181
08:00.180 --> 08:01.290
very stressful place.

182
08:01.290 --> 08:05.430
I needed to monitor my stress to not burn out very quickly.

183
08:05.430 --> 08:08.310
So I thought, "Okay, since I can monitor black holes

184
08:08.310 --> 08:10.830
billions of light years away,

185
08:10.830 --> 08:13.710
why the robots are not accurate enough

186
08:13.710 --> 08:16.230
to monitor what's happening inside my body

187
08:16.230 --> 08:21.210
with the precision enough to actually we could act on it."

188
08:21.210 --> 08:24.060
So this is how MindMics started.

189
08:24.060 --> 08:28.560
MindMics technology is enabled in the earbuds.

190
08:28.560 --> 08:31.770
So what we doing, we not using the optical light

191
08:31.770 --> 08:35.130
that is in the wearables that is giving us heart rate

192
08:35.130 --> 08:36.570
and other metrics.

193
08:36.570 --> 08:38.550
We using sound waves.

194
08:38.550 --> 08:41.490
Sound waves generated by our body.

195
08:41.490 --> 08:44.850
So we think that we are quiet creatures.

196
08:44.850 --> 08:47.910
We don't want to think about saying something loud.

197
08:47.910 --> 08:50.670
But actually our body's extremely loud

198
08:50.670 --> 08:52.890
to the point that the brain

199
08:52.890 --> 08:57.000
has to filter out everything below 20 hertz.

200
08:57.000 --> 08:58.920
Because if it didn't,

201
08:58.920 --> 09:01.920
it would be just cacophony of the sound.

202
09:01.920 --> 09:05.670
One of the loudest organs in our body, the heart.

203
09:05.670 --> 09:06.720
It's a huge pump

204
09:06.720 --> 09:10.350
that is pumping liters of blood every minute.

205
09:10.350 --> 09:14.190
And we can hear it, not hearing directly with our ears,

206
09:14.190 --> 09:19.050
but we can hear it using the microphones in the earbud.

207
09:19.050 --> 09:21.753
When I was starting the journey a few years ago,

208
09:22.860 --> 09:25.440
fancy earbuds had only speakers inside

209
09:25.440 --> 09:26.430
and the cables,

210
09:26.430 --> 09:30.330
and that was $300, the best tech ever.

211
09:30.330 --> 09:31.950
Today when you're looking at the earbuds,

212
09:31.950 --> 09:34.770
they are already full of sensors.

213
09:34.770 --> 09:36.270
For our application

214
09:36.270 --> 09:38.985
when you think about what's in the earbud,

215
09:38.985 --> 09:41.610
there is noise cancellation.

216
09:41.610 --> 09:43.980
Noise cancellation require a microphone

217
09:43.980 --> 09:46.230
that is facing the ear canal.

218
09:46.230 --> 09:48.870
So we can actually repurpose those microphones

219
09:48.870 --> 09:51.810
to listen to every heartbeat.

220
09:51.810 --> 09:55.890
I don't know if you had a chance to play our videos.

221
09:55.890 --> 09:57.750
But there is something in the video

222
09:57.750 --> 10:00.300
that the world hasn't seen yet

223
10:00.300 --> 10:03.570
'cause we just submitted it to Nature Cardiovascular Health.

224
10:03.570 --> 10:05.340
'Cause everyone was asking us

225
10:05.340 --> 10:07.140
where the signal is coming from.

226
10:07.140 --> 10:10.470
Are those heartbeats just some arteries is close to the ear?

227
10:10.470 --> 10:12.960
In that paper we showing that no,

228
10:12.960 --> 10:15.720
it's coming directly through the aorta.

229
10:15.720 --> 10:18.690
So as astrophysicist, I'm quite excited

230
10:18.690 --> 10:21.120
because when you think about Star Trek

231
10:21.120 --> 10:23.760
and the way how they monitored health was,

232
10:23.760 --> 10:27.540
you had that device that was scanning everything

233
10:27.540 --> 10:31.110
that was happening in the body.

234
10:31.110 --> 10:34.110
And that's exactly what MindMics does.

235
10:34.110 --> 10:37.560
What we see with MindMics, those heartbeats,

236
10:37.560 --> 10:38.550
those sound waves,

237
10:38.550 --> 10:41.040
those vibrations that travel to the ear canal,

238
10:41.040 --> 10:44.070
they create those tiny, tiny sound waves

239
10:44.070 --> 10:46.920
that we can pick up using microphones.

240
10:46.920 --> 10:49.560
And in the next view,

241
10:49.560 --> 10:52.830
you will see one of the comparison

242
10:52.830 --> 10:55.080
across different medical devices.

243
10:55.080 --> 10:58.740
At the top you see the blood flow through the aorta

244
10:58.740 --> 11:00.060
with echocardiogram.

245
11:00.060 --> 11:01.380
On the second plot,

246
11:01.380 --> 11:04.290
you see directly the blood pressure in the aorta

247
11:04.290 --> 11:06.000
and different paravascular system.

248
11:06.000 --> 11:08.640
The yellow one, the middle canal,

249
11:08.640 --> 11:10.800
this is what we see through the ear.

250
11:10.800 --> 11:15.060
It's highly correlated with exactly of the signals

251
11:15.060 --> 11:16.590
that today we have to put

252
11:16.590 --> 11:18.660
the very invasive probes
<v ->Yeah.</v>

253
11:18.660 --> 11:20.100
to see those signals.

254
11:20.100 --> 11:21.660
So this is really exciting,

255
11:21.660 --> 11:24.600
because wearables that we used to listen to music

256
11:24.600 --> 11:27.690
will be able to provide us something,

257
11:27.690 --> 11:32.280
that whole picture of our, especially cardiovascular health.

258
11:32.280 --> 11:34.594
<v ->Yeah, I mean I love what you're building.</v>

259
11:34.594 --> 11:36.660
It's really problem solving tech.

260
11:36.660 --> 11:40.890
And next we will get to Alex,

261
11:40.890 --> 11:45.690
who is the co-founder and CEO of XRWorkout.

262
11:45.690 --> 11:48.570
So please, give us your introduction.

263
11:48.570 --> 11:49.720
<v ->Thank you. Thank you.</v>

264
11:50.796 --> 11:54.480
And I consider myself a poster boy for wearables

265
11:54.480 --> 11:59.310
because I have an Oura, a smartwatch,

266
11:59.310 --> 12:00.753
a WHOOP on the ankle.

267
12:02.310 --> 12:04.980
I don't leave home without the air pods.

268
12:04.980 --> 12:09.060
I've got the glasses and I have the headset as well.

269
12:09.060 --> 12:10.890
The HMD.

270
12:10.890 --> 12:13.740
So yeah.
<v ->And your old trip, Alex?</v>

271
12:13.740 --> 12:14.693
<v ->Yeah. Yeah.</v>

272
12:17.640 --> 12:18.870
When you think about wearables,

273
12:18.870 --> 12:22.290
you don't really think about the VR headset as a wearable,

274
12:22.290 --> 12:25.140
but it technically is glasses.

275
12:25.140 --> 12:26.940
You feel like they're more wearables.

276
12:26.940 --> 12:30.660
But what my company is doing is an exercise game

277
12:30.660 --> 12:34.383
inside this paradigm of spatial computing.

278
12:36.000 --> 12:39.630
And we are a technology pioneer in the intersection

279
12:39.630 --> 12:44.630
of spatial computing, AI, and exercise and fitness.

280
12:45.420 --> 12:50.420
We're undergoing a pitch with Snap

281
12:50.550 --> 12:54.780
to build the ultimate AI assisted gym companion.

282
12:54.780 --> 12:57.813
So if you imagine yourself walking into the gym,

283
12:58.680 --> 12:59.670
you sign in.

284
12:59.670 --> 13:03.753
Sorry, hands up who's been to a gym in the last month?

285
13:05.160 --> 13:07.200
Okay, 60%.

286
13:07.200 --> 13:08.700
So imagine this story.

287
13:08.700 --> 13:11.400
You walk into your gym, you sign in,

288
13:11.400 --> 13:14.940
and then there's a little rack of glasses like these,

289
13:14.940 --> 13:18.390
eventually like these, but for now they're like that.

290
13:18.390 --> 13:20.463
You pick them up, you put them on,

291
13:21.730 --> 13:23.100
and it's like, "Hello Alex,

292
13:23.100 --> 13:26.010
it's been three days since your last visit.

293
13:26.010 --> 13:27.390
You ready for legs day?

294
13:27.390 --> 13:30.195
All right, let's go, how you feeling?" Da da da. Okay.

295
13:30.195 --> 13:31.840
And then it guides you over to the machine.

296
13:31.840 --> 13:33.083
And as you're doing your legs day,

297
13:35.730 --> 13:38.880
leg press, it's automatically counting your sets

298
13:38.880 --> 13:40.500
and your reps and your weight,

299
13:40.500 --> 13:41.970
so you don't have to log it anymore.

300
13:41.970 --> 13:45.210
And then it'll tell you, "Two more. Just two more, come on."

301
13:45.210 --> 13:47.700
It's in your ear with the coach.

302
13:47.700 --> 13:49.890
And it will give you the progressive overloads

303
13:49.890 --> 13:51.930
to make you stronger automatically

304
13:51.930 --> 13:56.220
without having to log it manually

305
13:56.220 --> 13:57.570
and figure it out yourself.

306
13:58.590 --> 14:00.090
Could we just play

307
14:00.090 --> 14:02.163
to speak to what we're doing our video?

308
14:08.290 --> 14:11.123
(easy mood music)

309
14:13.079 --> 14:17.919
Can we turn it up a bit, please? (laughing)

310
14:17.919 --> 14:20.502
(upbeat music)

311
14:24.479 --> 14:25.312
Thank you.

312
14:27.090 --> 14:27.923
That's a burpee.

313
14:39.180 --> 14:41.730
<v ->Alright, so-</v>
<v ->Okay, thank you, Alex.</v>

314
14:41.730 --> 14:42.570
<v Alex>Pleasure.</v>

315
14:42.570 --> 14:45.840
<v ->Alright, so we're just gonna get into the questions,</v>

316
14:45.840 --> 14:48.000
just wanna be mindful of everyone's time here.

317
14:48.000 --> 14:49.680
So we're gonna really dig into it.

318
14:49.680 --> 14:52.110
I wanna get into a specific use case.

319
14:52.110 --> 14:54.270
I wanna make this as beneficial

320
14:54.270 --> 14:55.710
to everyone in the room as possible.

321
14:55.710 --> 14:57.120
So my question is,

322
14:57.120 --> 15:00.930
how are wearables transforming fitness today?

323
15:00.930 --> 15:04.200
Please share one specific fitness related use case

324
15:04.200 --> 15:05.130
that stands out.

325
15:05.130 --> 15:07.950
And whoever wants to go first,

326
15:07.950 --> 15:09.003
please go ahead.

327
15:10.290 --> 15:12.720
Everyone is shy, then I'm gonna pick on Drew.

328
15:12.720 --> 15:14.870
<v ->Yeah, I'll go first and I'll go with one.</v>

329
15:16.170 --> 15:19.683
It's part of being prepared for exercise, which is sleep.

330
15:20.910 --> 15:23.640
I think if you don't have a full night of restful sleep,

331
15:23.640 --> 15:26.280
you're not ready to work out and engage in the next day.

332
15:26.280 --> 15:28.290
And I think one of the things we're trying to do

333
15:28.290 --> 15:30.822
with Samsung ring that's really powerful.

334
15:30.822 --> 15:32.702
I wear both, to your question earlier,

335
15:32.702 --> 15:34.463
I have a watch on and a ring on

336
15:34.463 --> 15:37.445
and a lot of people are like, "Well, why do you wear both?"

337
15:37.445 --> 15:38.850
And I think there's a few reasons why.

338
15:38.850 --> 15:41.700
One's functional when they're working together

339
15:41.700 --> 15:43.140
through our Samsung ecosystem

340
15:43.140 --> 15:44.850
and connected with our smartphone.

341
15:44.850 --> 15:46.050
You get better battery life.

342
15:46.050 --> 15:47.820
And so the battery consumption,

343
15:47.820 --> 15:50.790
it can decide which sensors to use and when.

344
15:50.790 --> 15:52.263
But practically speaking,

345
15:53.400 --> 15:56.010
I don't like to wear watches to sleep,

346
15:56.010 --> 15:58.770
and you're sleeping a third of your life.

347
15:58.770 --> 16:02.927
And so there's a huge window of your health,

348
16:04.530 --> 16:06.660
data that you're not capturing when you're wearing watch

349
16:06.660 --> 16:08.673
if you're sleeping at night.

350
16:08.673 --> 16:12.060
And so it's been a really powerful way for me to understand

351
16:12.060 --> 16:13.323
how I'm sleeping.

352
16:14.927 --> 16:17.718
Because you're monitoring your, not only through the day,

353
16:17.718 --> 16:18.948
but when you're sleeping,

354
16:18.948 --> 16:20.430
it can correlate data, days that you exercise,

355
16:20.430 --> 16:22.020
did you sleep better?

356
16:22.020 --> 16:25.170
If you exercise too many days in a row, did you sleep worse?

357
16:25.170 --> 16:26.220
If you're at CES

358
16:26.220 --> 16:29.070
and you had a glass of wine the night before,

359
16:29.070 --> 16:31.650
I run a little hot and don't sleep as well.

360
16:31.650 --> 16:32.731
And so-

361
16:32.731 --> 16:34.396
<v Janey>Everyone's laughing right now.</v>

362
16:34.396 --> 16:35.850
<v ->Yeah, and so you can see these things</v>

363
16:35.850 --> 16:37.716
and know these things.

364
16:37.716 --> 16:40.230
And then again, through software and AI,

365
16:40.230 --> 16:41.880
we're tying that into our platform

366
16:41.880 --> 16:43.770
through a feature called Energy Score.

367
16:43.770 --> 16:44.970
So you wake up in the morning

368
16:44.970 --> 16:46.380
and you can see your energy score,

369
16:46.380 --> 16:47.617
and you can determine,

370
16:47.617 --> 16:49.860
"Am I ready for an intense workout today?

371
16:49.860 --> 16:50.790
A light workout?"

372
16:50.790 --> 16:54.720
It can guide you similar to the example we just saw

373
16:54.720 --> 16:56.850
in terms of, you know, that Alex was talking about

374
16:56.850 --> 16:58.710
of getting coached along the way.

375
16:58.710 --> 17:01.593
It can coach you in your fitness and wellness journey.

376
17:02.460 --> 17:03.293
<v ->Yeah, no, I love that.</v>

377
17:03.293 --> 17:06.540
And I mean we had the example from Alex earlier,

378
17:06.540 --> 17:08.820
from literally head to toe wearing everything.

379
17:08.820 --> 17:10.476
So I love the fact-

380
17:10.476 --> 17:12.780
<v ->Almost on the toe. I've got ankle right now.</v>

381
17:12.780 --> 17:14.550
<v ->Sorry?</v>
<v ->Almost on the toe.</v>

382
17:14.550 --> 17:16.007
<v ->Right now it's ankle.</v>
<v ->Okay.</v>

383
17:16.007 --> 17:17.967
<v ->But I'll get something for the toe as well.</v>

384
17:17.967 --> 17:18.800
<v ->We need NFC chip.</v>

385
17:18.800 --> 17:21.110
<v ->We make small Samsung rings. You could do a toe ring.</v>

386
17:22.740 --> 17:24.990
<v ->I'd like to take a shot at that question as well.</v>

387
17:24.990 --> 17:26.130
<v ->Sure, go ahead.</v>

388
17:26.130 --> 17:27.540
<v ->The thought which comes to mind</v>

389
17:27.540 --> 17:29.017
is the Peter Drucker quote,

390
17:29.017 --> 17:31.860
"What gets measured gets managed."

391
17:31.860 --> 17:35.257
And so just like he had the question,

392
17:35.257 --> 17:36.995
"Why you wearing both?"

393
17:36.995 --> 17:39.540
For me, Oura and WHOOP,

394
17:39.540 --> 17:43.020
I'm basically AB testing which one I prefer

395
17:43.020 --> 17:45.360
and Oura is winning at the moment

396
17:45.360 --> 17:47.340
just in my personal opinion.

397
17:47.340 --> 17:52.320
But more in AI age, more data is better,

398
17:52.320 --> 17:55.200
because you have more things to feed in and learn from.

399
17:55.200 --> 17:57.693
So now I have two lenses,

400
17:58.560 --> 17:59.730
three including the watch.

401
17:59.730 --> 18:01.800
And then as the AI matures,

402
18:01.800 --> 18:03.584
I'll be able to feed that in

403
18:03.584 --> 18:07.080
and see how was I in 2024 versus 2025 and why,

404
18:07.080 --> 18:08.763
and these kinds of things.

405
18:08.763 --> 18:09.904
So I'm getting insights.

406
18:09.904 --> 18:12.513
That's my little take on the question.

407
18:14.700 --> 18:17.010
<v ->Yeah, I can definitely jump in with spectacles.</v>

408
18:17.010 --> 18:18.060
I mean one of the things,

409
18:18.060 --> 18:20.544
and Janey, you and I were talking about this yesterday

410
18:20.544 --> 18:21.690
that we're tremendously excited about

411
18:21.690 --> 18:23.490
with the spectacles is,

412
18:23.490 --> 18:24.540
when we were developing these,

413
18:24.540 --> 18:26.340
obviously, it's launched

414
18:26.340 --> 18:28.290
with a number of different experiences on here.

415
18:28.290 --> 18:30.480
There's a niantic experience with Paradot

416
18:30.480 --> 18:31.980
where you have a virtual pet,

417
18:31.980 --> 18:33.560
you could throw a Frisbee to it,

418
18:33.560 --> 18:36.270
it goes and catches it, it comes back, wonderful.

419
18:36.270 --> 18:39.120
There's drawing in the real world

420
18:39.120 --> 18:42.810
and you can just create art as you go.

421
18:42.810 --> 18:46.020
But the area that excited us most at Snapchat

422
18:46.020 --> 18:48.480
was the fitness and wellbeing area,

423
18:48.480 --> 18:52.110
because there's so much potential with this device.

424
18:52.110 --> 18:54.690
And Alex is not wrong, this is just a developer version.

425
18:54.690 --> 18:56.100
it's gonna get lighter,

426
18:56.100 --> 18:58.050
the field of view is gonna get better,

427
18:58.050 --> 18:59.493
it's gonna get faster,

428
19:00.390 --> 19:02.280
it's gonna be equivalent to, Janey,

429
19:02.280 --> 19:04.740
the glasses that you are wearing now.

430
19:04.740 --> 19:06.390
And what we are already doing

431
19:06.390 --> 19:08.130
and how we are already working with developers,

432
19:08.130 --> 19:09.780
like Alex and brands,

433
19:09.780 --> 19:12.720
is really thinking about what does fitness mean

434
19:12.720 --> 19:14.550
for the spectacles?

435
19:14.550 --> 19:17.880
And I've spent a lot of my career in digital

436
19:17.880 --> 19:18.930
and immersive technology,

437
19:18.930 --> 19:21.540
spent a lot of time in the VR space.

438
19:21.540 --> 19:24.780
Originally at Frame Store and headed up their VR studio,

439
19:24.780 --> 19:28.290
and was an early investor in the Kickstarter Oculus,

440
19:28.290 --> 19:31.037
and have what I call my VR

441
19:31.037 --> 19:35.460
and AR headset graveyard on my shelf.

442
19:35.460 --> 19:37.110
So if you ever do a Zoom call with me,

443
19:37.110 --> 19:39.570
you will see all of the headsets.

444
19:39.570 --> 19:42.330
And all of them have been tremendously important

445
19:42.330 --> 19:45.960
and fundamental in getting to where we are today,

446
19:45.960 --> 19:47.940
even though many of them are obsolete.

447
19:47.940 --> 19:49.410
But one of the things I look back on

448
19:49.410 --> 19:51.000
is when we talk about VR,

449
19:51.000 --> 19:53.880
often we thought VR would go mainstream.

450
19:53.880 --> 19:57.603
And I even have one of the Samson headsets as well.

451
19:58.770 --> 20:00.270
We thought VR would go mainstream.

452
20:00.270 --> 20:02.430
We thought by now every one of you sitting here

453
20:02.430 --> 20:05.730
would have a VR headset either in your bag,

454
20:05.730 --> 20:08.460
and not too much unlike Alex,

455
20:08.460 --> 20:11.550
but I think he's a very special use case.

456
20:11.550 --> 20:13.964
Or they would be in our homes

457
20:13.964 --> 20:15.270
and we would be using them often.

458
20:15.270 --> 20:18.000
And I was a huge advocate for this technology,

459
20:18.000 --> 20:20.130
and I remember being on stage

460
20:20.130 --> 20:22.710
and talking about we're gonna see VR headsets

461
20:22.710 --> 20:25.230
in every household and it didn't happen.

462
20:25.230 --> 20:28.500
And the fundamental reason why it didn't happen is,

463
20:28.500 --> 20:31.230
because no matter how good the technology is,

464
20:31.230 --> 20:34.350
if there isn't a reason to reach out for that headset

465
20:34.350 --> 20:35.550
or these glasses,

466
20:35.550 --> 20:37.590
then people are not gonna use it.

467
20:37.590 --> 20:38.730
And Snapchat's focus

468
20:38.730 --> 20:42.390
is making the everyday things that you do, better.

469
20:42.390 --> 20:46.050
So going to the gym, how can these enhance that?

470
20:46.050 --> 20:47.370
Playing basketball,

471
20:47.370 --> 20:51.330
how can we help you be better at what you do

472
20:51.330 --> 20:52.620
and love every day?

473
20:52.620 --> 20:56.190
And how can we help bring either a AI coach

474
20:56.190 --> 20:58.770
or your friends into that story?

475
20:58.770 --> 21:00.090
One of my favorite things on here

476
21:00.090 --> 21:02.190
is a basketball experience.

477
21:02.190 --> 21:03.690
So you go up to the hoop

478
21:03.690 --> 21:05.730
because this has world understanding,

479
21:05.730 --> 21:08.820
it knows that there's a basketball hoop right in front of me

480
21:08.820 --> 21:13.820
and it guides me already to make my shots better.

481
21:13.950 --> 21:16.950
Giving me feedback in real time,

482
21:16.950 --> 21:19.590
super fun, super exciting.

483
21:19.590 --> 21:22.590
And that's when everyday thing, like just shooting hoops,

484
21:22.590 --> 21:24.090
shooting hoops with my son,

485
21:24.090 --> 21:26.190
becomes something really exciting.

486
21:26.190 --> 21:28.620
And then all of that data,

487
21:28.620 --> 21:31.350
all of the things that you are doing are stored in here.

488
21:31.350 --> 21:34.290
So at any given moment it's helping me be better

489
21:34.290 --> 21:36.660
at the things that I love and the things that I do.

490
21:36.660 --> 21:39.210
So I think the opportunity for fitness is huge.

491
21:39.210 --> 21:40.950
We're seeing a number of our developers

492
21:40.950 --> 21:45.930
already build fun fitness movement-like experiences.

493
21:45.930 --> 21:46.830
One developer

494
21:46.830 --> 21:49.620
within two days of getting their hands on this,

495
21:49.620 --> 21:50.820
I don't know if you've seen this, Alex,

496
21:50.820 --> 21:53.520
but they built this adorable RPG game.

497
21:53.520 --> 21:57.750
And what they did is the everyday walk to their coffee shop,

498
21:57.750 --> 22:00.180
they turned it into this fun little RPG game.

499
22:00.180 --> 22:01.830
You popped on the spectacles,

500
22:01.830 --> 22:04.533
you're literally walking down the street,

501
22:06.014 --> 22:08.220
you have this like little sword and you're just hitting

502
22:08.220 --> 22:09.840
and attacking all of the little things

503
22:09.840 --> 22:11.737
that are coming at you.

504
22:11.737 --> 22:13.920
And before you know it, you've done 1,000 steps.

505
22:13.920 --> 22:18.360
It's play gamification, your everyday walks transformed.

506
22:18.360 --> 22:21.450
And magical little dragons appear

507
22:21.450 --> 22:24.300
or magical little orbs appear that you have to, you know?

508
22:24.300 --> 22:25.653
How joyful is that?

509
22:29.310 --> 22:32.880
It's magic in your hands.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

510
22:32.880 --> 22:35.040
What devices have you put on at CES

511
22:35.040 --> 22:37.740
that have put a smile on your face.

512
22:37.740 --> 22:39.570
And that's so important for Snapchat.

513
22:39.570 --> 22:41.040
So that's what we wanna see more of.

514
22:41.040 --> 22:43.500
And that's why I think the fitness space is really exciting.

515
22:43.500 --> 22:44.820
We're working with a number of brands

516
22:44.820 --> 22:46.650
that they can't really talk about.

517
22:46.650 --> 22:50.640
However, brands can really see the opportunity.

518
22:50.640 --> 22:53.880
As I said, in the near future, you'll be able to buy these.

519
22:53.880 --> 22:56.580
Right now, they're available for developers.

520
22:56.580 --> 23:00.030
We have a number of these in the hands of developers

521
23:00.030 --> 23:02.460
and we really want developers to use this.

522
23:02.460 --> 23:06.960
This is launched with its own groundbreaking Snap OS system

523
23:06.960 --> 23:09.840
and you can use Lens Studio to build on this.

524
23:09.840 --> 23:11.490
Anything you build on spectacles,

525
23:11.490 --> 23:13.800
you can also deploy on Snapchat too.

526
23:13.800 --> 23:15.840
So we're really thinking about that ecosystem

527
23:15.840 --> 23:17.580
that Drew was talking about as well,

528
23:17.580 --> 23:21.210
building once and being able to put onto multiple devices.

529
23:21.210 --> 23:24.240
So if there are any developers that are interested in this,

530
23:24.240 --> 23:25.200
come see me afterwards,

531
23:25.200 --> 23:28.110
and I'll let you know how you can sign up to the program.

532
23:28.110 --> 23:29.490
<v ->Sounds good.</v>

533
23:29.490 --> 23:32.580
I mean all of you covered so many interesting points.

534
23:32.580 --> 23:34.719
And I think you have something to say,

535
23:34.719 --> 23:36.780
so we'll have you to share on this point.

536
23:36.780 --> 23:37.890
<v ->I will be quick.</v>

537
23:37.890 --> 23:41.220
The use case I wanted to focus on is running.

538
23:41.220 --> 23:43.855
I think in terms of the running,

539
23:43.855 --> 23:44.910
wearables are transforming it,

540
23:44.910 --> 23:46.530
because it really helps people

541
23:46.530 --> 23:50.100
to look into what is the metabolic zone they're in.

542
23:50.100 --> 23:52.890
So when you're thinking about the metrics like heart rate,

543
23:52.890 --> 23:55.890
one of the best use cases is running,

544
23:55.890 --> 23:57.540
but it has to be accurate,

545
23:57.540 --> 23:59.940
and the demand of the consumer

546
23:59.940 --> 24:04.940
is that they actually making sure that it's accurate enough.

547
24:05.910 --> 24:07.830
So if they wear watches,

548
24:07.830 --> 24:10.410
often they will also wear the ECG patch

549
24:10.410 --> 24:12.570
and will compare the data.

550
24:12.570 --> 24:16.440
So that's why it's so important that the data for running

551
24:16.440 --> 24:17.340
are super accurate,

552
24:17.340 --> 24:21.180
and that's one of the best actionable use case

553
24:21.180 --> 24:22.560
for heart rate.

554
24:22.560 --> 24:25.350
And I would say it's just the beginning of that revolution

555
24:25.350 --> 24:26.190
in running,

556
24:26.190 --> 24:28.590
because there are people looking for the devices

557
24:28.590 --> 24:30.540
that they could wear easily,

558
24:30.540 --> 24:35.540
that they don't like wearing patches and the brand,

559
24:35.970 --> 24:39.138
some of them like wearing watches, usually they don't.

560
24:39.138 --> 24:40.350
So this is another opportunity for ear,

561
24:40.350 --> 24:43.534
I'm talking about this because every single company

562
24:43.534 --> 24:45.120
is asking us when we going to have a heart rate

563
24:45.120 --> 24:48.540
for running accurate enough in motion.

564
24:48.540 --> 24:50.550
It's not an easy task, but we're working on it.

565
24:50.550 --> 24:52.470
So stay tuned about this.

566
24:52.470 --> 24:55.230
So one thing of one use case for running

567
24:55.230 --> 24:58.350
is using the heart rate to looking at the metabolic zones.

568
24:58.350 --> 24:59.460
And that's something

569
24:59.460 --> 25:02.283
that people are using to match their steps.

570
25:03.990 --> 25:06.270
The another use case that we seeing coming

571
25:06.270 --> 25:08.250
and there is one really interesting startup

572
25:08.250 --> 25:09.784
that is working on that.

573
25:09.784 --> 25:12.240
That is matching the steps with the heart rate

574
25:12.240 --> 25:13.260
and with the beats,

575
25:13.260 --> 25:17.370
is able to coach people how to step

576
25:17.370 --> 25:20.040
to make sure that they stepping in the right face

577
25:20.040 --> 25:21.480
of the heartbeat.

578
25:21.480 --> 25:26.480
So again, to maximize the cardiovascular system performance

579
25:27.270 --> 25:28.470
of the heart

580
25:28.470 --> 25:31.890
doesn't work against muscle squeezing and steps.

581
25:31.890 --> 25:35.170
So it's really exciting how wearables

582
25:36.570 --> 25:39.393
can transform further running,

583
25:40.251 --> 25:42.000
and is already use case that exists

584
25:42.000 --> 25:44.130
and people looking for other solutions.

585
25:44.130 --> 25:46.977
<v ->Yeah, I mean all of you covered a lot of points</v>

586
25:46.977 --> 25:49.290
and I feel like we could literally have

587
25:49.290 --> 25:51.300
maybe a week long seminar

588
25:51.300 --> 25:53.340
where each of you are speaking individually

589
25:53.340 --> 25:57.390
and giving a TED talk and I wanna dig into everything,

590
25:57.390 --> 25:59.340
but I wanna segue into a question

591
25:59.340 --> 26:02.340
that I think is something that is interesting

592
26:02.340 --> 26:04.560
and people are wondering about.

593
26:04.560 --> 26:06.480
So we're talking about data,

594
26:06.480 --> 26:09.810
we're talking about heart monitoring, sleep monitoring,

595
26:09.810 --> 26:11.460
there's even problem solving

596
26:11.460 --> 26:16.200
different types of wearable tech with helping,

597
26:16.200 --> 26:19.110
for example, those who are hearing impaired

598
26:19.110 --> 26:20.130
or visually impaired,

599
26:20.130 --> 26:21.420
things of this nature.

600
26:21.420 --> 26:26.130
So I'm wondering how do you all see the industry evolving

601
26:26.130 --> 26:28.080
in terms of insurance companies?

602
26:28.080 --> 26:30.000
Because part of mass adoption

603
26:30.000 --> 26:35.000
is about getting coverage for this type of technology.

604
26:35.790 --> 26:37.650
And it could be about your product

605
26:37.650 --> 26:39.810
or how you see the industry at large.

606
26:39.810 --> 26:42.960
So whoever is more comfortable to share about this.

607
26:42.960 --> 26:45.090
I love to hear your thoughts on the future

608
26:45.090 --> 26:47.220
when it comes to insurance coverage,

609
26:47.220 --> 26:49.950
and what that looks like in terms of mass adoption.

610
26:49.950 --> 26:50.783
Alex?

611
26:50.783 --> 26:54.240
Well, I like to say this thing

612
26:54.240 --> 26:58.800
about the future being precision, preventive, proactive,

613
26:58.800 --> 27:00.303
and personalized.

614
27:01.200 --> 27:03.496
Some of those words mean the same thing,

615
27:03.496 --> 27:05.820
but it sounds good with all the Ps,

616
27:05.820 --> 27:09.600
and I think that therefore the insurance companies

617
27:09.600 --> 27:13.650
is gonna be very powerful for matching premiums

618
27:13.650 --> 27:17.840
with individual health conditions.

619
27:19.920 --> 27:22.173
Because now we will have the data,

620
27:23.730 --> 27:27.120
we'll be tracking how much activity they're doing,

621
27:27.120 --> 27:29.070
and then higher activity,

622
27:29.070 --> 27:31.680
people will be rewarded with lower premiums

623
27:31.680 --> 27:32.670
and that kind of thing.

624
27:32.670 --> 27:35.220
So that's a quick thought that comes to mind there.

625
27:36.780 --> 27:38.850
<v ->Yeah, and I think I can expand on that a little bit.</v>

626
27:38.850 --> 27:42.507
And today obviously, I think,

627
27:42.507 --> 27:43.770
it's ultimately where things will go.

628
27:43.770 --> 27:46.980
And even today for consumers with Galaxy ring for example,

629
27:46.980 --> 27:51.180
last year we got approval for FSA and HSA plans.

630
27:51.180 --> 27:53.730
So people who have a health savings account

631
27:53.730 --> 27:56.670
can actually apply that towards a ring product

632
27:56.670 --> 27:58.830
to manage their lifestyle

633
27:58.830 --> 28:01.890
and that becomes a cost effective way to do so.

634
28:01.890 --> 28:04.320
And then on top of that, I think,

635
28:04.320 --> 28:07.830
back to maybe some of the innovation and design,

636
28:07.830 --> 28:10.110
wearables, of course, are perfect for that kind of thing

637
28:10.110 --> 28:13.015
for an insurance company

638
28:13.989 --> 28:16.200
to make sure that their base is living a healthier life

639
28:16.200 --> 28:17.310
and can lower the premiums,

640
28:17.310 --> 28:19.320
and therefore the cost to the consumer ultimately.

641
28:19.320 --> 28:22.050
But if you think about the different form factors,

642
28:22.050 --> 28:25.740
watches is really great for a lot of users,

643
28:25.740 --> 28:29.430
but if you think about the breadth of users globally

644
28:29.430 --> 28:30.263
and in America,

645
28:30.263 --> 28:33.120
there's certain people in segments of population,

646
28:33.120 --> 28:34.590
let's take elderly for example,

647
28:34.590 --> 28:37.590
where a wearable is gonna be intimidating to use

648
28:37.590 --> 28:39.000
and perhaps difficult to set up,

649
28:39.000 --> 28:41.310
where a ring is actually very simple

650
28:41.310 --> 28:43.148
in terms of the interface.

651
28:43.148 --> 28:45.030
Literally all you have to do is put it on your finger

652
28:45.030 --> 28:48.330
and then you can start monitoring yourself

653
28:48.330 --> 28:51.030
and/or patients in that sense.

654
28:51.030 --> 28:54.160
And so we think it's gonna be a really compelling way

655
28:54.998 --> 28:57.420
to expand the reach of what wearables can do

656
28:57.420 --> 28:59.760
to maybe a non-tech audience

657
28:59.760 --> 29:03.360
that's used to engaging in technology first

658
29:03.360 --> 29:06.840
and more complex use cases that wearables can deliver.

659
29:06.840 --> 29:10.980
And having these simple designs like a ring

660
29:10.980 --> 29:13.410
can allow us to unlock new users,

661
29:13.410 --> 29:15.570
and ultimately that can work its way

662
29:15.570 --> 29:18.420
into how people can manage their health,

663
29:18.420 --> 29:23.177
and therefore build better lifestyle out of that.

664
29:23.177 --> 29:25.740
<v ->Yeah, you hit so many points that I would love to dig into</v>

665
29:25.740 --> 29:28.890
from the aging population to data analytics,

666
29:28.890 --> 29:31.590
the insurance premiums, HSA, FSA.

667
29:31.590 --> 29:34.740
There's so many opportunities to figure out

668
29:34.740 --> 29:37.380
how to service the consumers and the community,

669
29:37.380 --> 29:40.890
and also keep them essentially in your ecosystem as well

670
29:40.890 --> 29:43.620
depending on what your brand is and what you're building.

671
29:43.620 --> 29:45.360
Anna, just quick thoughts from yourself.

672
29:45.360 --> 29:46.193
<v ->Very quickly.</v>

673
29:46.193 --> 29:49.200
I consider myself outsider in that case

674
29:49.200 --> 29:51.360
and I have a little bit less optimism

675
29:51.360 --> 29:54.030
about the insurance companies covering it,

676
29:54.030 --> 29:55.320
but I think

677
29:55.320 --> 29:59.640
that the fact that the cost of the components of the sensors

678
29:59.640 --> 30:02.370
and enabling those technology will go down,

679
30:02.370 --> 30:04.590
and I think it's a part of our job

680
30:04.590 --> 30:06.630
to make it affordable enough,

681
30:06.630 --> 30:10.320
so people without health insurance can afford it

682
30:10.320 --> 30:11.250
and pay for it

683
30:11.250 --> 30:12.933
and have a control over the data.

684
30:13.803 --> 30:16.170
Because if somebody else is paying for the data,

685
30:16.170 --> 30:17.280
who owns the data then?

686
30:17.280 --> 30:21.060
So I think for us it's important to make sure

687
30:21.060 --> 30:24.240
that our technologies is affordable for everyone

688
30:24.240 --> 30:25.980
with or without having insurance

689
30:25.980 --> 30:29.660
because this will give us also control over the data.

690
30:29.660 --> 30:32.460
And insurance companies, if they will pay for it.

691
30:32.460 --> 30:34.680
I'm sure they will want to have some access

692
30:34.680 --> 30:39.270
to the information which can go both ways.

693
30:39.270 --> 30:44.270
So I'm curious to see where all of that will go.

694
30:44.820 --> 30:49.820
But looking at the structure of the whole ecosystem

695
30:50.250 --> 30:52.500
but also seeing how quickly

696
30:52.500 --> 30:54.990
that the price point is dropping.

697
30:54.990 --> 30:56.130
I think this is exciting

698
30:56.130 --> 30:58.770
because we can build wearable technologies

699
30:58.770 --> 31:01.980
that everyone can afford out of the pocket.

700
31:01.980 --> 31:04.027
<v ->Yeah, you brought up great points</v>

701
31:04.027 --> 31:05.970
and it's always good to have a counter opinion.

702
31:05.970 --> 31:08.400
I love the spicy hot takes.

703
31:08.400 --> 31:10.410
But I wanna get into something

704
31:10.410 --> 31:13.680
a little bit more style and fashion focus.

705
31:13.680 --> 31:16.530
So I actually just did some research

706
31:16.530 --> 31:19.140
and dropped a report called the Digital Runway report,

707
31:19.140 --> 31:22.020
was analyzing the 2025 trend forecast.

708
31:22.020 --> 31:25.410
And I mentioned this earlier today during our session,

709
31:25.410 --> 31:27.120
but I think that wearable tech

710
31:27.120 --> 31:29.940
will actually be wearable fashion tech.

711
31:29.940 --> 31:31.800
There was a piece of technology

712
31:31.800 --> 31:34.560
that was dropped earlier in last year,

713
31:34.560 --> 31:35.820
it was called Friend Necklace.

714
31:35.820 --> 31:39.387
I'm totally calling them out on this, $99,

715
31:39.387 --> 31:42.150
and it looks exactly like an Apple AirTag.

716
31:42.150 --> 31:45.180
So if you are trying to build a tech accessory

717
31:45.180 --> 31:46.980
that you want people to wear,

718
31:46.980 --> 31:49.080
you need people from different industries,

719
31:49.080 --> 31:51.390
especially from fashion design

720
31:51.390 --> 31:54.273
who can create a product that actually looks good.

721
31:55.427 --> 31:57.990
It tracks things regarding health and fitness,

722
31:57.990 --> 32:00.450
but also that people would actually be excited to wear

723
32:00.450 --> 32:01.860
on a daily basis.

724
32:01.860 --> 32:04.800
So based on that, I'm just curious,

725
32:04.800 --> 32:08.670
how does design aesthetics and style

726
32:08.670 --> 32:11.910
contribute to your product development, marketing,

727
32:11.910 --> 32:14.070
and mass adoption strategies?

728
32:14.070 --> 32:16.530
And I see Alex already with your hand up.

729
32:16.530 --> 32:17.910
Does that mean that you're ready to go?

730
32:17.910 --> 32:20.376
<v ->Yep, ready to go.</v>
<v ->Okay. Alright.</v>

731
32:20.376 --> 32:23.083
<v ->I think Meta has done a really good job</v>

732
32:23.083 --> 32:25.440
with partnering with EssilorLuxottica.

733
32:25.440 --> 32:29.280
I think that was one of the hacks that they did

734
32:29.280 --> 32:32.223
for getting into the style game a bit more.

735
32:34.083 --> 32:36.210
And there's been a big revamp in Meta

736
32:36.210 --> 32:38.850
in terms of getting a little bit more aesthetic.

737
32:38.850 --> 32:43.050
Zuckerberg has started wearing Amiri outfits

738
32:43.050 --> 32:44.010
and stuff like that.

739
32:44.010 --> 32:45.840
So there's been a big style push there,

740
32:45.840 --> 32:48.060
and I think it's gonna be very important, as you said,

741
32:48.060 --> 32:50.010
for mass adoption.

742
32:50.010 --> 32:50.880
The challenge

743
32:50.880 --> 32:55.880
is gonna be getting the full visual head glasses form factor

744
32:57.480 --> 32:58.874
with the screen.

745
32:58.874 --> 33:02.285
These just have cameras, so got the batteries in there.

746
33:02.285 --> 33:04.440
They're okay.

747
33:04.440 --> 33:07.740
These ones here, they're up 50% since the last edition.

748
33:07.740 --> 33:10.800
The previous battery life was 30 minutes, now it's 45,

749
33:10.800 --> 33:12.420
which is a good trend,

750
33:12.420 --> 33:16.050
but it's gonna be hard to have that same level of bulkiness

751
33:16.050 --> 33:18.540
and have a visual aesthetic.

752
33:18.540 --> 33:19.680
<v ->Yeah, I mean just on that point,</v>

753
33:19.680 --> 33:22.163
'cause I'm actually, if you guys didn't notice,

754
33:22.163 --> 33:23.400
we're both wearing smart glasses

755
33:23.400 --> 33:25.560
and recording each other from opposite ends.

756
33:25.560 --> 33:29.340
I love this, Alex, for all of us by the way,

757
33:29.340 --> 33:30.173
great content

758
33:30.173 --> 33:33.485
and also opportunity to have a conversation about this.

759
33:33.485 --> 33:35.460
But with Ray-Ban and also Meta,

760
33:35.460 --> 33:36.810
what a lot of people don't realize

761
33:36.810 --> 33:40.024
'cause I come from the beauty fashion retail industry,

762
33:40.024 --> 33:41.910
that actually they partnered with EssilorLuxottica,

763
33:41.910 --> 33:45.210
which is the majority stakeholder

764
33:45.210 --> 33:48.300
and I would say producer when it comes to glasses.

765
33:48.300 --> 33:50.730
They do glasses for Prada.
<v ->Monopolist.</v>

766
33:50.730 --> 33:53.190
Yeah, Prada, Oakley, Ray-Ban.

767
33:53.190 --> 33:55.620
So I mean it made sense for them to partner,

768
33:55.620 --> 33:58.470
they could work with a fashion design company

769
33:58.470 --> 34:01.230
that would actually produce the right sunglasses

770
34:01.230 --> 34:02.250
and glasses,

771
34:02.250 --> 34:04.560
and they could actually embed the tech with it,

772
34:04.560 --> 34:06.411
which I think is something

773
34:06.411 --> 34:07.710
that we'll see a lot more in the future.

774
34:07.710 --> 34:09.840
Anna, thoughts on this?

775
34:09.840 --> 34:10.800
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

776
34:10.800 --> 34:14.190
We actually now started partnership with Mastermind Dynamic.

777
34:14.190 --> 34:18.330
that builds beautiful design for a lot of brands.

778
34:18.330 --> 34:21.390
There was actually one picture in the end of the video

779
34:21.390 --> 34:25.680
showing the next MindMics inside Mastermind Dynamic.

780
34:25.680 --> 34:28.410
And basically, for what we see,

781
34:28.410 --> 34:30.060
what I've seen over the last six years,

782
34:30.060 --> 34:32.670
six years ago, if you go back to Kickstarters

783
34:32.670 --> 34:36.240
or even your memory to see what was launched,

784
34:36.240 --> 34:38.940
what people were happy to wear

785
34:38.940 --> 34:42.840
is very different to what people are using today.

786
34:42.840 --> 34:46.350
MVP is that you have to from the scratch,

787
34:46.350 --> 34:48.600
bring people amazing experience,

788
34:48.600 --> 34:51.960
and I think people paying attention to it,

789
34:51.960 --> 34:56.193
it's fashion, aesthetics is extremely important.

790
34:57.780 --> 34:59.760
<v ->Yeah, and I can just add from the ring perspective,</v>

791
34:59.760 --> 35:02.400
I mean, we had major engagements both in Paris

792
35:02.400 --> 35:04.410
and New York last year at their fashion weeks.

793
35:04.410 --> 35:08.310
And I think trying to make that to your point,

794
35:08.310 --> 35:11.010
fashionable in an aesthetic way is important.

795
35:11.010 --> 35:13.140
So just from the core designs,

796
35:13.140 --> 35:15.570
we have multiple colors and finishes,

797
35:15.570 --> 35:17.940
and so that you can tailor it

798
35:17.940 --> 35:20.730
to what you're looking for in your style,

799
35:20.730 --> 35:22.500
in addition to the functional aspects

800
35:22.500 --> 35:24.350
that we've been talking about.

801
35:24.350 --> 35:25.183
So that's critical in our wearables

802
35:25.183 --> 35:26.360
and even our smartphones.

803
35:27.262 --> 35:28.860
We've been doing fashion partnerships

804
35:28.860 --> 35:31.140
for as long as I can remember with major brands

805
35:31.140 --> 35:33.210
to try to bring either new accessories

806
35:33.210 --> 35:34.893
or custom designs to the market.

807
35:36.270 --> 35:39.210
I mean, ultimately, all these devices are lifestyle devices,

808
35:39.210 --> 35:41.471
they're things we carry every day.

809
35:41.471 --> 35:42.762
They represent who we are.

810
35:42.762 --> 35:44.280
So it's important that they look

811
35:44.280 --> 35:47.190
and feel comfortable with who we are.

812
35:47.190 --> 35:48.600
<v ->Yeah, and I did actually go</v>

813
35:48.600 --> 35:50.970
to the New York fashion week exhibit,

814
35:50.970 --> 35:54.528
sorry, the installation that you had with,

815
35:54.528 --> 35:55.380
I think, it was Colin Strod,

816
35:55.380 --> 35:57.030
I can't remember the last name at the moment

817
35:57.030 --> 35:58.320
if you remember.

818
35:58.320 --> 36:01.320
But the AI exhibit was absolutely phenomenal

819
36:01.320 --> 36:02.430
with all of your devices.

820
36:02.430 --> 36:04.881
So definitely if you guys are in the audience,

821
36:04.881 --> 36:06.402
make sure to check it out.

822
36:06.402 --> 36:08.670
Resh, you are phenomenally dressed,

823
36:08.670 --> 36:10.680
already fangirled over each other.

824
36:10.680 --> 36:13.320
So I know you have a conversation

825
36:13.320 --> 36:15.770
that we could go into very deep on this,

826
36:15.770 --> 36:16.620
but quick thoughts on this.

827
36:16.620 --> 36:18.990
<v ->Yeah, I think it's really interesting,</v>

828
36:18.990 --> 36:22.350
it's very important to distinguish the beautiful glasses

829
36:22.350 --> 36:24.510
that both of you are wearing at either end.

830
36:24.510 --> 36:26.820
Those are cameras in there, they're just Ray-Bans,

831
36:26.820 --> 36:29.850
and we've been able to put cameras

832
36:29.850 --> 36:32.310
which allow you to record the real world

833
36:32.310 --> 36:34.456
and everything that's happening.

834
36:34.456 --> 36:35.460
These are very different.

835
36:35.460 --> 36:38.250
This is augmented reality in the real world.

836
36:38.250 --> 36:41.430
So this is placing a layer of AR in your real world.

837
36:41.430 --> 36:43.593
It has world understanding and physics.

838
36:44.610 --> 36:47.910
If I pop these on, it understands everyone on this stage,

839
36:47.910 --> 36:50.820
every chair in this room and every human in this room.

840
36:50.820 --> 36:54.330
It has world understanding and world learning AI

841
36:54.330 --> 36:56.850
and machine learning capabilities packed into it.

842
36:56.850 --> 36:59.820
For us, the most important thing at Snapchat,

843
36:59.820 --> 37:02.280
it is always about form and function

844
37:02.280 --> 37:04.590
and the beautiful marriage between the two.

845
37:04.590 --> 37:07.740
Absolutely, we are moving towards a version

846
37:07.740 --> 37:09.240
that will be consumer facing.

847
37:09.240 --> 37:11.460
It will be slimmer, it will be faster,

848
37:11.460 --> 37:13.560
and it will look super fly.

849
37:13.560 --> 37:14.970
I was saying to Janey yesterday

850
37:14.970 --> 37:18.543
that the amount of times that I've seen people at CES,

851
37:19.380 --> 37:22.410
and they'd be like, "Hey, can I get a version but in blue.

852
37:22.410 --> 37:23.880
Can I get leopard print?"

853
37:23.880 --> 37:25.020
And I was like, "Sure."

854
37:25.020 --> 37:26.640
And they're like, "Hey Resh, why don't you have a version

855
37:26.640 --> 37:28.537
with leather on them?"

856
37:28.537 --> 37:30.690
And what I say is, "All of that is coming.

857
37:30.690 --> 37:31.830
All of that is coming."

858
37:31.830 --> 37:33.240
Our teams have been working

859
37:33.240 --> 37:36.630
with phenomenal product, fashion,

860
37:36.630 --> 37:38.610
and everybody on this panel is not wrong.

861
37:38.610 --> 37:43.230
You need to bring in different skill sets

862
37:43.230 --> 37:44.760
from different industries

863
37:44.760 --> 37:48.090
to make these something that people will want to wear

864
37:48.090 --> 37:49.560
and be proud of wearing.

865
37:49.560 --> 37:51.120
But the most important thing for us

866
37:51.120 --> 37:54.720
was actually getting a version into the hands of developers

867
37:54.720 --> 37:58.290
as quickly and as swiftly as possible.

868
37:58.290 --> 38:01.290
Meta launched Orion, does anyone have Orion?

869
38:01.290 --> 38:02.970
Do you have it? Do you have it, Alex?

870
38:02.970 --> 38:05.100
How quickly did we get you one of these?

871
38:05.100 --> 38:09.870
These are real and I am so excited to get my hands on Orion.

872
38:09.870 --> 38:11.280
I have a pair of Ray-Bans.

873
38:11.280 --> 38:12.750
Any of us in this space,

874
38:12.750 --> 38:15.750
we should have an insatiable appetite

875
38:15.750 --> 38:18.000
to look at all of these devices,

876
38:18.000 --> 38:23.000
whether it be rings, watches, AR glasses, VR headsets,

877
38:23.010 --> 38:27.540
because all of them help really us push the medium forward

878
38:27.540 --> 38:30.993
and push the technology forward into a place where,

879
38:31.890 --> 38:34.200
I think Drew hit it on the head, into a place

880
38:34.200 --> 38:37.050
where we can make our everyday experiences better

881
38:37.050 --> 38:39.060
and they're just part of every day.

882
38:39.060 --> 38:40.020
They're not clunky.

883
38:40.020 --> 38:43.200
So I'm excited in terms of how these are gonna look.

884
38:43.200 --> 38:45.960
But in terms of this version right now,

885
38:45.960 --> 38:48.000
developers can get their hands on it.

886
38:48.000 --> 38:50.370
It's $99 on a subscription,

887
38:50.370 --> 38:52.920
and we are using all of these incredible experiences

888
38:52.920 --> 38:54.510
that developers are building,

889
38:54.510 --> 38:56.940
and we're updating these weekly,

890
38:56.940 --> 39:00.450
so you can begin to start seeing what's really good,

891
39:00.450 --> 39:01.890
what really works,

892
39:01.890 --> 39:03.180
and what's popular.

893
39:03.180 --> 39:05.460
And that will really help inform then

894
39:05.460 --> 39:06.750
the consumer facing version

895
39:06.750 --> 39:09.573
and the launch experiences that we drop with.

896
39:10.830 --> 39:14.220
<v ->I feel very sad 'cause we're coming up on time,</v>

897
39:14.220 --> 39:17.220
and I'm wondering if I can go a little bit over,

898
39:17.220 --> 39:19.620
and no one is giving me a look right now,

899
39:19.620 --> 39:20.610
so,
<v ->Do it.</v>

900
39:20.610 --> 39:23.040
I am going to just go for it.

901
39:23.040 --> 39:26.580
So we'll do rapid fire very quickly, individual questions,

902
39:26.580 --> 39:29.070
and then try to take one question from the audience

903
39:29.070 --> 39:30.660
just 'cause I wanna make this as valuable

904
39:30.660 --> 39:32.490
for all of you as possible.

905
39:32.490 --> 39:34.530
Drew, we're gonna start with you.

906
39:34.530 --> 39:35.790
If you guys can keep your answers

907
39:35.790 --> 39:39.810
to a quick 30 seconds to one minute, that would be great.

908
39:39.810 --> 39:42.750
Samsung's emphasis on user friendly design,

909
39:42.750 --> 39:46.410
how do you balance cutting edge tech with simplicity,

910
39:46.410 --> 39:50.043
and as you were mentioning, chic design for mass adoption?

911
39:51.094 --> 39:53.182
<v ->Well, I think it's a matter</v>

912
39:53.182 --> 39:57.150
of we don't have a single design for any single user.

913
39:57.150 --> 39:57.990
Everyone's different.

914
39:57.990 --> 40:02.790
And so from the most tech-oriented user,

915
40:02.790 --> 40:05.940
we have products like foldable devices and things like that.

916
40:05.940 --> 40:08.709
And for people looking to track their health,

917
40:08.709 --> 40:10.048
we have amazing wearables,

918
40:10.048 --> 40:10.881
and even within the wearable category,

919
40:10.881 --> 40:12.968
we have these different types.

920
40:12.968 --> 40:15.840
And so I think simplicity is incredibly important

921
40:15.840 --> 40:18.270
when it comes to the user interface.

922
40:18.270 --> 40:23.270
And so as users are able to adopt new technology,

923
40:23.310 --> 40:25.590
having it be simple and easy is critical.

924
40:25.590 --> 40:28.500
And I think one of the drivers for us over the past year

925
40:28.500 --> 40:31.620
and going forward is our Galaxy AI platform.

926
40:31.620 --> 40:35.670
And so AI is something that can create usability

927
40:35.670 --> 40:37.680
for users effectively.

928
40:37.680 --> 40:40.530
You don't have to know how to use the device as much

929
40:40.530 --> 40:42.840
because the on-device intelligence

930
40:42.840 --> 40:46.230
is able to service up meaningful insights for you.

931
40:46.230 --> 40:47.370
It can push you forward.

932
40:47.370 --> 40:49.800
So I think those are the things that we're thinking about

933
40:49.800 --> 40:51.990
is how do we reduce points of friction,

934
40:51.990 --> 40:53.580
make things easier for users.

935
40:53.580 --> 40:56.640
And so regardless of the form factor where you're engaging

936
40:56.640 --> 40:57.810
and trying to track your health,

937
40:57.810 --> 41:02.810
whether it be glasses, a wearable, a ring,

938
41:03.420 --> 41:05.370
that those things become easy, intuitive,

939
41:05.370 --> 41:07.620
and you're guided along the way

940
41:07.620 --> 41:09.390
with the data that you're providing.

941
41:09.390 --> 41:12.450
<v ->Yeah, and I mean for anyone who hasn't tried Galaxy,</v>

942
41:12.450 --> 41:16.470
I highly recommend, it's not actually text to prompt,

943
41:16.470 --> 41:18.240
it's actually draw to prompt.

944
41:18.240 --> 41:21.360
And I think that's just an amazing visual representation

945
41:21.360 --> 41:23.340
of what the AI looks like.

946
41:23.340 --> 41:26.970
So I'm just gonna go the line here, Resh one minute or less.

947
41:26.970 --> 41:29.430
Snapchat platform built with a community,

948
41:29.430 --> 41:30.690
as you mentioned earlier,

949
41:30.690 --> 41:32.370
creator driven experiences

950
41:32.370 --> 41:34.980
from content creators and developers.

951
41:34.980 --> 41:37.530
How does SNAP cultivate a thriving

952
41:37.530 --> 41:40.680
and engaged community of creators?

953
41:40.680 --> 41:42.270
<v ->Yeah, I mean that's such a great question.</v>

954
41:42.270 --> 41:44.910
It's so fundamental to Snap's values.

955
41:44.910 --> 41:46.680
We've always been about our community,

956
41:46.680 --> 41:48.450
putting our community first,

957
41:48.450 --> 41:52.410
and part of the spectacles launch strategy

958
41:52.410 --> 41:54.690
was really about bringing our community

959
41:54.690 --> 41:57.120
into the conversation.

960
41:57.120 --> 42:00.300
A lot of technology and a lot of these AI experiences,

961
42:00.300 --> 42:02.940
I mean, I walked the convention center

962
42:02.940 --> 42:04.709
and all of the technology,

963
42:04.709 --> 42:05.968
and everything was all great,

964
42:05.968 --> 42:07.780
but a lot of it is done in isolation

965
42:08.640 --> 42:11.550
and not bringing normal human beings

966
42:11.550 --> 42:14.760
and the community

967
42:14.760 --> 42:17.130
that you are ultimately going to be selling to

968
42:17.130 --> 42:19.920
into the development process.

969
42:19.920 --> 42:21.750
We are doing that, we're opening up the doors,

970
42:21.750 --> 42:23.580
we're bringing our community into them,

971
42:23.580 --> 42:28.580
and the experience, the content, the spectacles,

972
42:29.190 --> 42:31.080
it's thriving because of that.

973
42:31.080 --> 42:32.520
We're learning what matters.

974
42:32.520 --> 42:34.890
We're learning and we're taking that input,

975
42:34.890 --> 42:37.140
and we're really being adaptive

976
42:37.140 --> 42:38.970
and iterative in our process.

977
42:38.970 --> 42:40.980
And so community driven,

978
42:40.980 --> 42:45.090
co-created content is fundamentally important.

979
42:45.090 --> 42:47.610
'Cause you have everything from indie developers

980
42:47.610 --> 42:51.469
to larger studios building for it.

981
42:51.469 --> 42:53.610
And what's really exciting,

982
42:53.610 --> 42:55.920
we're looking at ways in which we can reward them

983
42:55.920 --> 42:59.250
so they can be part of the process,

984
42:59.250 --> 43:01.620
and then also reap from the benefits as well.

985
43:01.620 --> 43:02.763
<v ->I love that.</v>

986
43:02.763 --> 43:04.380
And I just wanna highlight a few things from what you said,

987
43:04.380 --> 43:07.890
co-creation, gamification, and rewards,

988
43:07.890 --> 43:10.980
so important to building a community

989
43:10.980 --> 43:14.070
that I think you've really nailed there at Snapchat.

990
43:14.070 --> 43:18.810
Anna, okay, so MindMics, realtime heart monitoring,

991
43:18.810 --> 43:21.090
shaping the future of preventative health.

992
43:21.090 --> 43:22.890
Is there anything that you could tease out

993
43:22.890 --> 43:24.030
that you're exploring

994
43:24.030 --> 43:26.130
and you're incredibly interested in

995
43:26.130 --> 43:28.920
when it comes to MindMics in the future direction?

996
43:28.920 --> 43:29.753
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

997
43:29.753 --> 43:32.610
So I believe that the future of the preventive health

998
43:32.610 --> 43:35.460
and human health in general is in the ear.

999
43:35.460 --> 43:37.500
It's close to the brain, close to the lungs,

1000
43:37.500 --> 43:38.640
close to the heart.

1001
43:38.640 --> 43:43.200
We can monitor all of the key vital organs to us.

1002
43:43.200 --> 43:45.270
What's coming next with MindMics

1003
43:45.270 --> 43:47.250
that we are working on now is blood pressure.

1004
43:47.250 --> 43:49.620
So imagine accurate blood pressure monitoring

1005
43:49.620 --> 43:50.460
through the ear,

1006
43:50.460 --> 43:53.250
but there will be much, much more coming from us as well.

1007
43:53.250 --> 43:57.003
So keep watching what we up to.

1008
43:57.930 --> 43:59.070
<v ->Very cool.</v>

1009
43:59.070 --> 44:01.890
I'm very excited to see what MindMics come up with.

1010
44:01.890 --> 44:06.060
Alex, how do AI and hand tracking and XRWorkout

1011
44:06.060 --> 44:09.603
redefine home fitness compared to the traditional methods?

1012
44:10.650 --> 44:13.980
<v ->Okay, so what we're doing with our AI strategy,</v>

1013
44:13.980 --> 44:16.320
we have the ability through the headset

1014
44:16.320 --> 44:20.040
to capture a lot of data passively.

1015
44:20.040 --> 44:22.170
Normally, you have to log everything,

1016
44:22.170 --> 44:24.090
now the wearables are tracking passively,

1017
44:24.090 --> 44:28.860
but we've got movement data like XYZ planes.

1018
44:28.860 --> 44:32.130
So we are experimenting with form tracking.

1019
44:32.130 --> 44:34.770
We've got like camera based form tracking.

1020
44:34.770 --> 44:36.540
You sit your camera there looking at you

1021
44:36.540 --> 44:39.030
and it can figure out your body position

1022
44:39.030 --> 44:40.350
That's using AI.

1023
44:40.350 --> 44:45.350
Also, we're using like VR hardware trackers as well.

1024
44:45.360 --> 44:48.030
And so that there is creating a future

1025
44:48.030 --> 44:50.850
where we're gonna have an AI guided coach

1026
44:50.850 --> 44:52.560
gonna be telling you, "Keep your back straight,

1027
44:52.560 --> 44:53.850
put your butt out."

1028
44:53.850 --> 44:55.451
That kind of thing.

1029
44:55.451 --> 44:57.090
"Okay, that's a dangerous position there."

1030
44:57.090 --> 44:58.953
That kind of thing.

1031
44:58.953 --> 45:00.542
And then also on the coaching,

1032
45:00.542 --> 45:03.960
you too consistently be overloading yourself

1033
45:03.960 --> 45:06.000
so that you're getting stronger,

1034
45:06.000 --> 45:08.883
and that's a dream come true.

1035
45:10.260 --> 45:12.540
<v ->I'm very sad to say we are a little bit out of time</v>

1036
45:12.540 --> 45:14.070
and I'm getting this signal.

1037
45:14.070 --> 45:16.080
I love to have this chat with you,

1038
45:16.080 --> 45:19.200
each of you or all of you again, at another point.

1039
45:19.200 --> 45:20.610
Hopefully, we'll talk later

1040
45:20.610 --> 45:22.560
about having you join my podcast,

1041
45:22.560 --> 45:26.340
but I wanna just thank all of the incredible panelists.

1042
45:26.340 --> 45:27.540
Please connect with them,

1043
45:27.540 --> 45:31.380
watch for what they are working on now and what's to come.

1044
45:31.380 --> 45:34.110
This is literally only the beginning

1045
45:34.110 --> 45:35.550
when it comes to wearable tech,

1046
45:35.550 --> 45:38.070
or as I like to call it, wearable fashion tech.

1047
45:38.070 --> 45:41.220
And also to the audience, thank you for being here today,

1048
45:41.220 --> 45:43.770
and yeah, let's continue this conversation.

1049
45:43.770 --> 45:45.330
Feel free to connect with each

1050
45:45.330 --> 45:47.730
and every one after the session.

1051
45:47.730 --> 45:49.491
Thank you so much.

1052
45:49.491 --> 45:52.318
(audience clapping)

1053
45:52.318 --> 45:54.901
(upbeat music)
