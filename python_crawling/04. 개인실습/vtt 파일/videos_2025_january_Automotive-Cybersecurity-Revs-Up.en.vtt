00:00.000 --> 00:02.583
(upbeat music)

2
00:10.380 --> 00:12.390
<v ->So, welcome to today's session</v>

3
00:12.390 --> 00:15.033
on Automotive Cybersecurity Revs Up.

4
00:16.470 --> 00:21.470
I think I see a lot of faces, so thank you for joining.

5
00:23.010 --> 00:24.483
Good morning to all of you.

6
00:26.220 --> 00:28.500
So, I would be the moderator.

7
00:28.500 --> 00:31.470
My name is Debasish, so you can call me Deba.

8
00:32.477 --> 00:35.040
Just a brief introduction about me.

9
00:35.040 --> 00:38.220
I am joining from Wipro.

10
00:38.220 --> 00:42.180
I had automotive practice

11
00:42.180 --> 00:46.413
within Wipro's engineering edge business line.

12
00:47.280 --> 00:50.760
Also, I'm the distinguished member within Wipro

13
00:50.760 --> 00:54.540
for my two and a half decade contribution in mobility

14
00:54.540 --> 00:55.923
and the automotive space.

15
00:57.270 --> 00:59.490
So, friends, as we are stepping

16
00:59.490 --> 01:03.120
into the new era of connected vehicle,

17
01:03.120 --> 01:07.196
and as you know, software is hitting the world syndrome,

18
01:07.196 --> 01:12.043
is now a stark reality in automotive industry.

19
01:12.043 --> 01:15.570
We are seeing a numerous cybersecurity

20
01:15.570 --> 01:20.043
and privacy challenges.

21
01:21.060 --> 01:22.020
So, we are fortunate

22
01:22.020 --> 01:26.973
to have three eminent leader from industry leaders.

23
01:27.960 --> 01:30.810
They would enlighten us with their deep insight

24
01:30.810 --> 01:33.753
on how to combat with these challenges.

25
01:34.740 --> 01:39.240
They would explain us the engineering approach,

26
01:39.240 --> 01:42.210
standardization, regulation,

27
01:42.210 --> 01:44.403
innovation happening in this space.

28
01:45.510 --> 01:47.168
Without any further ado,

29
01:47.168 --> 01:50.853
let me welcome our distinguished panelists.

30
01:51.960 --> 01:55.833
Let us start with Cindy Warner.

31
01:56.760 --> 02:01.760
She joined from 360ofme. She's the co-founder and CEO.

32
02:01.980 --> 02:03.480
So, let us hear more from her.

33
02:04.599 --> 02:05.432
<v ->Thanks, Deba,</v>

34
02:05.432 --> 02:07.441
and thanks everybody for coming early session.

35
02:07.441 --> 02:09.180
Lots of things going on last night,

36
02:09.180 --> 02:10.740
so thank you for being here.

37
02:10.740 --> 02:12.300
I'm Cindy Warner, as Deba said.

38
02:12.300 --> 02:16.190
I'm the founder and CEO of 360ofme, a data privacy company.

39
02:16.190 --> 02:20.820
We provide a data privacy layer that is industry-agnostic

40
02:20.820 --> 02:23.135
and also tech stack-agnostic.

41
02:23.135 --> 02:25.560
Prior to being the founder of this company,

42
02:25.560 --> 02:27.402
I spent four decades

43
02:27.402 --> 02:31.050
as a partner in Big 4 consulting,

44
02:31.050 --> 02:32.963
doing systems consulting work.

45
02:32.963 --> 02:36.363
I'm an architect, systems architect by trade,

46
02:37.260 --> 02:38.430
but I've done hundreds

47
02:38.430 --> 02:41.820
and hundreds of global 1,000 systems implementation.

48
02:41.820 --> 02:44.569
So, I hail from a deep technology background,

49
02:44.569 --> 02:47.190
and really appreciative of being on the panel,

50
02:47.190 --> 02:48.270
so thank you.

51
02:48.270 --> 02:49.103
<v ->Thank you.</v>

52
02:50.460 --> 02:54.317
Next, I think we will go with John.

53
02:54.317 --> 02:56.880
John joined us from Eaton

54
02:56.880 --> 03:01.880
and he is chair of multiple standardization body,

55
03:03.030 --> 03:07.040
so let's hear more from him, so we can really understand

56
03:07.040 --> 03:10.533
what guidance he has for all of you.

57
03:11.490 --> 03:14.220
<v ->Yeah, good morning, everyone. Pleasure to be here.</v>

58
03:14.220 --> 03:15.780
A little bit of background on myself

59
03:15.780 --> 03:16.613
and first of all,

60
03:16.613 --> 03:20.820
the functional excellence lead in product, cybersecurity,

61
03:20.820 --> 03:23.335
and functional safety at Eaton Corporation.

62
03:23.335 --> 03:25.830
And then, as far as giving you a little bit

63
03:25.830 --> 03:29.580
of background in my experience, I've been involved

64
03:29.580 --> 03:32.940
with cybersecurity all the way from medical devices,

65
03:32.940 --> 03:36.360
a vital signs monitoring system, both the embedded device

66
03:36.360 --> 03:40.950
in the server side system through telematics,

67
03:40.950 --> 03:42.090
through all the way

68
03:42.090 --> 03:45.870
to autonomous vehicle systems, infotainment systems,

69
03:45.870 --> 03:48.766
and various applications within automotive.

70
03:48.766 --> 03:51.630
So, one of the areas I specialize in

71
03:51.630 --> 03:56.013
is the intersection of functional safety and cybersecurity.

72
03:56.013 --> 03:59.370
And I'm currently chair, as he mentioned,

73
03:59.370 --> 04:01.680
of the vehicle cybersecurity systems

74
04:01.680 --> 04:04.288
engineering committee at SAE.

75
04:04.288 --> 04:08.880
That also makes me co-convener

76
04:08.880 --> 04:13.260
with ISO on joint working group efforts between ISO

77
04:13.260 --> 04:16.320
and SAE and automotive cybersecurity.

78
04:16.320 --> 04:17.519
That would include

79
04:17.519 --> 04:22.519
the automotive cybersecurity standard, ISO/SAE 21434.

80
04:23.130 --> 04:24.780
Road vehicles is titled,

81
04:24.780 --> 04:26.968
Road Vehicle Cybersecurity Engineering.

82
04:26.968 --> 04:31.968
And I'm also involved in subsequent efforts in that area,

83
04:32.520 --> 04:34.970
which hopefully we'll get a chance to talk about.

84
04:36.060 --> 04:37.053
<v ->Thank you, John.</v>

85
04:37.980 --> 04:40.710
Next but not last, but not the least,

86
04:40.710 --> 04:45.270
I think we would like to welcome Jurgen Mueller.

87
04:45.270 --> 04:47.070
He joined us from IAV

88
04:47.070 --> 04:49.500
and he has a deep insight

89
04:49.500 --> 04:53.760
on end-to-end cybersecurity for connected vehicle.

90
04:53.760 --> 04:56.970
Let's hear more from him. Jurgen?

91
04:56.970 --> 04:58.083
<v ->Yes. Thank you.</v>

92
04:59.400 --> 05:01.290
Very warm welcome from my side as well.

93
05:01.290 --> 05:05.100
And I must admit, so cybersecurity must be a topic,

94
05:05.100 --> 05:08.130
otherwise not so many people would be here

95
05:08.130 --> 05:11.073
at nine o'clock at Las Vegas, so thank you for that.

96
05:12.630 --> 05:13.463
Yes.

97
05:13.463 --> 05:16.020
So, I started my career actually in life science,

98
05:16.020 --> 05:16.860
not in automotive.

99
05:16.860 --> 05:19.890
And so, I basically learned

100
05:19.890 --> 05:21.990
what safety is, functional safety is.

101
05:21.990 --> 05:24.660
And when I stepped into the automotive world,

102
05:24.660 --> 05:26.167
so I was socialized in the others world

103
05:26.167 --> 05:29.220
and there I learned that it's difficult to maintain

104
05:29.220 --> 05:32.040
or achieve functional safety without security,

105
05:32.040 --> 05:34.170
especially in a connected vehicle.

106
05:34.170 --> 05:37.170
And therefore, so I really gained a lot of experience

107
05:37.170 --> 05:42.170
in developing E/E architectures and platforms including HPC,

108
05:42.840 --> 05:44.220
so high performance computing.

109
05:44.220 --> 05:46.500
And so, we had to deal a lot with security.

110
05:46.500 --> 05:49.290
And one of the really hard lessons

111
05:49.290 --> 05:52.110
was so as if you don't do it from the beginning.

112
05:52.110 --> 05:54.390
So, it's very difficult in the very end.

113
05:54.390 --> 05:56.214
So, the one of the...

114
05:56.214 --> 05:58.038
John is laughing, yeah.

115
05:58.038 --> 06:01.440
So, it's one of the key experiences was,

116
06:01.440 --> 06:04.770
so do you develop a product without security,

117
06:04.770 --> 06:08.340
and then at a certain point, you decide to be secure,

118
06:08.340 --> 06:10.380
and then you switch on security and nothing is working.

119
06:10.380 --> 06:13.170
So, we learned the hard way in short words.

120
06:13.170 --> 06:18.000
And now, I'm at IAV and I'm responsible for a division,

121
06:18.000 --> 06:19.680
it's called connected software services.

122
06:19.680 --> 06:22.410
And basically, so we take care

123
06:22.410 --> 06:26.187
of the main technology pillars of the SDV

124
06:26.187 --> 06:28.053
and cybersecurity is one of them.

125
06:30.150 --> 06:30.983
<v ->Great.</v>

126
06:30.983 --> 06:35.983
I think we are now, we know all of us.

127
06:36.270 --> 06:39.060
So, my first question,

128
06:39.060 --> 06:41.370
I think I will take the cue from Jurgen,

129
06:41.370 --> 06:42.513
first question to you.

130
06:43.350 --> 06:46.680
As we are moving to these,

131
06:46.680 --> 06:49.350
vehicles are becoming always connected.

132
06:49.350 --> 06:53.370
And mask skills software registration is taking place

133
06:53.370 --> 06:56.820
as you explained in your experience as well.

134
06:56.820 --> 06:58.020
I would like to know

135
06:58.020 --> 07:01.020
what it means to the automotive cybersecurity.

136
07:01.020 --> 07:02.196
That is the first question.

137
07:02.196 --> 07:04.287
And the second question is,

138
07:04.287 --> 07:09.210
how do you think that auto manufacturers

139
07:09.210 --> 07:14.210
are gearing towards these challenges?

140
07:14.670 --> 07:19.410
<v ->Yes, so certainly, so the always connected vehicles</v>

141
07:19.410 --> 07:24.410
and the integration of software from multiple sources

142
07:24.862 --> 07:26.880
will have an effect

143
07:26.880 --> 07:28.650
in which transform the security landscape

144
07:28.650 --> 07:30.003
of the car manufacturers.

145
07:31.050 --> 07:33.220
The connectivity or the communication

146
07:34.169 --> 07:39.169
introduces a lot of numerous tech vectors

147
07:39.540 --> 07:42.780
and the integration of third party software

148
07:42.780 --> 07:47.103
from different sources of course increases that as well.

149
07:48.330 --> 07:53.330
We don't think so far that open source is a risk.

150
07:55.680 --> 07:57.330
So, we believe it's more an opportunity

151
07:57.330 --> 07:59.580
because of its transparency.

152
07:59.580 --> 08:01.150
And this transparency

153
08:01.150 --> 08:04.740
allows basically global developer communities

154
08:04.740 --> 08:08.130
to constantly or continuously innovate

155
08:08.130 --> 08:10.110
and improve those software.

156
08:10.110 --> 08:13.140
And that mean will result in better security

157
08:13.140 --> 08:14.493
and better functionality.

158
08:15.840 --> 08:20.090
But so, it's probably John is well-aware of that.

159
08:20.090 --> 08:25.090
So, the society or the legislations are already in place

160
08:25.410 --> 08:30.410
to issue regulations and standards to basically establish

161
08:31.540 --> 08:35.306
what we call a unified security foundation,

162
08:35.306 --> 08:38.781
and then ensure that the car manufacturers

163
08:38.781 --> 08:41.730
incorporate comprehensive security measures

164
08:41.730 --> 08:43.620
in the development processes.

165
08:43.620 --> 08:48.620
And technically, the car manufacturers

166
08:49.384 --> 08:52.380
are incorporating security measures now

167
08:52.380 --> 08:54.030
on an end-to-end scale actually

168
08:54.030 --> 08:57.933
to protect the entire vehicle ecosystem.

169
08:58.860 --> 09:02.490
And so, parts of that are of course encryption methods,

170
09:02.490 --> 09:05.798
introducing secure communication protocols,

171
09:05.798 --> 09:10.798
and not to forget all kinds of monitoring actually.

172
09:11.460 --> 09:15.600
And for us, so this is one thing

173
09:15.600 --> 09:19.560
where cybersecurity agility, as we call it, comes into play,

174
09:19.560 --> 09:24.210
because it gives you the ability to modify

175
09:24.210 --> 09:29.210
and optimize your current product in the field.

176
09:30.300 --> 09:33.060
And so, it means you can change the software architecture

177
09:33.060 --> 09:36.398
which is necessary then to react and minimize,

178
09:36.398 --> 09:37.680
to react on threats

179
09:37.680 --> 09:40.590
or to minimize the possibility of threats.

180
09:40.590 --> 09:42.660
And one part of it,

181
09:42.660 --> 09:45.570
and that is probably very important in the next 5

182
09:45.570 --> 09:49.350
to 10 years is what we call crypto-agility.

183
09:49.350 --> 09:54.350
And that means that we keep the crypto components,

184
09:54.600 --> 09:57.210
the crypto methods up-to-date,

185
09:57.210 --> 10:00.420
especially if we introduce quantum computers.

186
10:00.420 --> 10:05.060
So, quantum computers have the potential to really hack

187
10:05.060 --> 10:07.677
or break the current crypto methods.

188
10:07.677 --> 10:12.600
And so, the car makers really invest

189
10:12.600 --> 10:15.770
in what we call post-quantum cryptography

190
10:15.770 --> 10:18.840
to be future future-proof.

191
10:18.840 --> 10:21.030
And there's one thing which is not so obvious

192
10:21.030 --> 10:23.550
and that is what most

193
10:23.550 --> 10:28.500
of the car manufacturers already implement as well.

194
10:28.500 --> 10:32.310
And that is a centralized software management

195
10:32.310 --> 10:34.136
in order to streamline updates

196
10:34.136 --> 10:39.136
and to maintain control over software versions in the field.

197
10:40.527 --> 10:44.730
And that is of course ensuring that the improving security,

198
10:44.730 --> 10:45.563
but on the other side,

199
10:45.563 --> 10:49.680
it's improving consistent performance

200
10:49.680 --> 10:50.730
and availability as well.

201
10:50.730 --> 10:53.730
And in the very end, it probably saves costs as well.

202
10:53.730 --> 10:58.110
So, in summary, the industry is well-aware of that

203
10:58.110 --> 11:01.020
and is evolving to meet the challenges.

204
11:01.020 --> 11:05.036
So, by really introducing being compliant with standards,

205
11:05.036 --> 11:10.036
so UNECE 5156 and the ISO 21434.

206
11:12.527 --> 11:16.061
And on the other side, embracing cybersecurity agility

207
11:16.061 --> 11:20.943
to really maintain a secure product of our lifetime.

208
11:22.560 --> 11:27.120
<v ->Yeah, just to continue what Jurgen explained.</v>

209
11:27.120 --> 11:30.690
So, it is understood that cybersecurity

210
11:30.690 --> 11:33.030
need to be considered at every point

211
11:33.030 --> 11:36.360
in the vehicle development lifecycle.

212
11:36.360 --> 11:40.860
As we have John who has been the chair of SAE

213
11:40.860 --> 11:43.560
and also the co-convener of ISO

214
11:43.560 --> 11:45.930
and the standardization bodies.

215
11:45.930 --> 11:50.460
So, I would like to request John

216
11:50.460 --> 11:55.460
to give us his insight on the standardization,

217
11:55.920 --> 11:57.120
what the rational

218
11:57.120 --> 11:59.546
and what is the potential benefit

219
11:59.546 --> 12:03.060
we can get if we follow this.

220
12:03.060 --> 12:03.930
And also,

221
12:03.930 --> 12:06.750
I would like to add one more question to you, John,

222
12:06.750 --> 12:10.606
is if I look at from the end user's point of view,

223
12:10.606 --> 12:13.085
from the end user's point of view,

224
12:13.085 --> 12:17.373
what must follow to protect their future?

225
12:19.440 --> 12:21.229
<v ->Yeah, well, first of all,</v>

226
12:21.229 --> 12:24.420
fundamentally as Jurgen had mentioned,

227
12:24.420 --> 12:27.780
what should be done by both OEMs, tier ones,

228
12:27.780 --> 12:29.610
everyone in the supply chain,

229
12:29.610 --> 12:32.430
everyone involved in automotive cybersecurity

230
12:32.430 --> 12:37.260
is the application of the ISO/SAE 21434.

231
12:37.260 --> 12:39.420
Again, cybersecurity engineering.

232
12:39.420 --> 12:42.229
And note, it says cybersecurity engineering.

233
12:42.229 --> 12:44.820
He brought up many great points

234
12:44.820 --> 12:47.220
and one of 'em being, it's not a bolt-on.

235
12:47.220 --> 12:50.583
Cybersecurity is an engineering discipline.

236
12:51.450 --> 12:53.640
So, it's very complicated

237
12:53.640 --> 12:55.200
and evolves everything from systems

238
12:55.200 --> 12:58.359
to software, to hardware, you name it.

239
12:58.359 --> 13:00.060
So, 21434.

240
13:00.060 --> 13:01.950
One of the benefits of following it

241
13:01.950 --> 13:05.970
is it helps promote consistency throughout the life cycle

242
13:05.970 --> 13:08.550
and conscious decision making.

243
13:08.550 --> 13:13.550
So, it helps you both assess and manage cybersecurity risk.

244
13:13.770 --> 13:15.900
So, what I tell people is, they say,

245
13:15.900 --> 13:18.930
hey, John, should I do X in cybersecurity?

246
13:18.930 --> 13:20.220
Whatever that may be.

247
13:20.220 --> 13:21.840
And my first answer is, well,

248
13:21.840 --> 13:23.490
did you do a risk assessment on it,

249
13:23.490 --> 13:27.690
or in 21434 terms, a threat analysis and risk assessment.

250
13:27.690 --> 13:29.872
It ultimately helps you decide

251
13:29.872 --> 13:34.272
if a threat scenario were to be encountered,

252
13:34.272 --> 13:36.450
what is the associated impact?

253
13:36.450 --> 13:39.060
What would happen and what is the feasibility?

254
13:39.060 --> 13:41.580
So, following 21434 is fundamental.

255
13:41.580 --> 13:44.151
Procedurally, it's ultimately the foundation

256
13:44.151 --> 13:48.360
and it's all the way from throughout the entire life cycle,

257
13:48.360 --> 13:51.300
from concept phase, all the way through decommissioning.

258
13:51.300 --> 13:52.800
So, whether you're dealing with vulnerabilities

259
13:52.800 --> 13:54.330
in the middle of the life cycle,

260
13:54.330 --> 13:57.210
whatever, it's throughout the entire life cycle.

261
13:57.210 --> 14:01.710
Now, that's talking about it procedurally process-wise.

262
14:01.710 --> 14:04.470
Then, we of course have to understand

263
14:04.470 --> 14:06.780
that well, there's a technical aspect too,

264
14:06.780 --> 14:09.115
and one of the reasons we did not get

265
14:09.115 --> 14:12.120
into the technical aspects of 21434

266
14:12.120 --> 14:14.130
is because whatever we publish

267
14:14.130 --> 14:15.960
could be obsolete three months later.

268
14:15.960 --> 14:17.310
So, it's gotta be a framework

269
14:17.310 --> 14:20.243
that's gonna be stand the test of time.

270
14:20.243 --> 14:22.529
So, from a technical perspective,

271
14:22.529 --> 14:24.900
you need to, as an organization,

272
14:24.900 --> 14:27.750
be very careful in your technical implementation.

273
14:27.750 --> 14:29.220
So, you would use things

274
14:29.220 --> 14:32.910
such as SAE best practices and standards.

275
14:32.910 --> 14:36.753
There's best practices in terms of test methodologies.

276
14:37.800 --> 14:41.190
Also, J3101 for hardware-protected security.

277
14:41.190 --> 14:44.717
What type of features should be available in your hardware?

278
14:44.717 --> 14:48.450
As I indicate, software cannot protect software.

279
14:48.450 --> 14:50.640
It's gotta be founded in hardware.

280
14:50.640 --> 14:54.270
So, how do you actually have a good design

281
14:54.270 --> 14:55.740
that's gonna stand the test of time?

282
14:55.740 --> 14:59.245
So, leveraging NIST Special Publications,

283
14:59.245 --> 15:01.440
special publications that actually deal

284
15:01.440 --> 15:06.079
with secure development lifecycle and cryptography.

285
15:06.079 --> 15:08.790
So, you properly apply cryptography.

286
15:08.790 --> 15:10.470
Like one of the mistakes that can occur

287
15:10.470 --> 15:12.814
is you've applied cryptography,

288
15:12.814 --> 15:15.930
but you have an error in implementation.

289
15:15.930 --> 15:18.568
So, that is a threat vector that can be used.

290
15:18.568 --> 15:20.670
It actually can make your system quite weak

291
15:20.670 --> 15:22.530
if you have a flaw in implementation.

292
15:22.530 --> 15:25.770
So, carefully following NIST Special Publications

293
15:25.770 --> 15:27.571
or other publications like that.

294
15:27.571 --> 15:30.210
And then, another aspect that's also important

295
15:30.210 --> 15:33.030
is staying up-to-date on cybersecurity.

296
15:33.030 --> 15:36.600
Unfortunately, what we released today,

297
15:36.600 --> 15:39.000
one of the things, if you've never gone to a DEF CON

298
15:39.000 --> 15:41.911
or any cybersecurity conference, I highly recommend it.

299
15:41.911 --> 15:44.029
You will walk out paranoid.

300
15:44.029 --> 15:47.370
And it's actually, I think it's a good thing,

301
15:47.370 --> 15:49.650
because I've actually got a podcast

302
15:49.650 --> 15:51.510
that I call "Healthy Paranoia".

303
15:51.510 --> 15:54.030
I think it's very good for both end users

304
15:54.030 --> 15:56.049
and engineers to have a sense of paranoia,

305
15:56.049 --> 15:58.623
to a certain extent,
(Jurgen chuckles)

306
15:58.623 --> 16:00.750
to help you keep you on your edge.

307
16:00.750 --> 16:02.070
So, you have to stay up-to-date

308
16:02.070 --> 16:04.140
with threat intelligence information,

309
16:04.140 --> 16:05.940
what's happening out in the field,

310
16:05.940 --> 16:08.103
what is happening, what are researchers doing

311
16:08.103 --> 16:10.500
to understand the current threat landscape.

312
16:10.500 --> 16:13.051
So, organizations like the Automotive ISAC,

313
16:13.051 --> 16:17.057
that stands for the Information Sharing and Analysis Center.

314
16:17.057 --> 16:21.329
Participating in that, participating in hacking conferences.

315
16:21.329 --> 16:24.180
And ultimately having that healthy sense of paranoia.

316
16:24.180 --> 16:26.970
Now, going to your last question

317
16:26.970 --> 16:28.792
from an end user perspective,

318
16:28.792 --> 16:33.513
it really boils down to the typical normal practices.

319
16:33.513 --> 16:37.350
If there's a patch, apply it, don't wait.

320
16:37.350 --> 16:40.544
That patch could have critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities

321
16:40.544 --> 16:41.850
that are addressed.

322
16:41.850 --> 16:44.834
So, I know it's all of us have a tendency, well, I'm busy,

323
16:44.834 --> 16:46.740
I'm not gonna apply the patch.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

324
16:46.740 --> 16:48.930
<v ->Patch early and often.</v>

325
16:48.930 --> 16:51.183
If there's a patch, apply it, do not wait.

326
16:51.183 --> 16:54.660
And typical cybersecurity best practices,

327
16:54.660 --> 16:59.580
good passwords, don't use 1234,

328
16:59.580 --> 17:01.293
or something silly like that.

329
17:02.250 --> 17:06.300
Basically, basic cyber hygiene is very important.

330
17:06.300 --> 17:08.340
Another aspect that is important

331
17:08.340 --> 17:10.980
not only to basic cyber hygiene,

332
17:10.980 --> 17:12.570
but being very careful

333
17:12.570 --> 17:15.117
as to what you're allowing to be connected to your system.

334
17:15.117 --> 17:18.090
So, yes, your car can be connected

335
17:18.090 --> 17:19.500
to everything under the sun,

336
17:19.500 --> 17:21.780
but remember that when you do connect your car

337
17:21.780 --> 17:23.125
to everything under the sun,

338
17:23.125 --> 17:27.180
who knows what you're connected to and its vulnerabilities,

339
17:27.180 --> 17:30.000
its weaknesses, that system gets hacked.

340
17:30.000 --> 17:31.410
I think we've probably all heard

341
17:31.410 --> 17:34.770
about the famous hack in Las Vegas,

342
17:34.770 --> 17:38.370
where a casino got hacked through a fish tank feeder.

343
17:38.370 --> 17:39.900
They weren't trying to get into the fish tank,

344
17:39.900 --> 17:42.683
they used the fish tank feeder to get into the system.

345
17:42.683 --> 17:45.240
So, be very careful what you connect to.

346
17:45.240 --> 17:48.030
So, those are some basic best practices.

347
17:48.030 --> 17:51.660
<v ->Yeah, it's a great insight, John.</v>

348
17:51.660 --> 17:53.333
I'll switch the topic a little bit.

349
17:53.333 --> 17:56.100
We discussed the cybersecurity,

350
17:56.100 --> 17:59.340
but I think the privacy also plays a very,

351
17:59.340 --> 18:03.840
very important role, and it's little different.

352
18:03.840 --> 18:06.150
So, we have Cindy with us.

353
18:06.150 --> 18:08.848
I would like to understand

354
18:08.848 --> 18:11.789
that when we do the data exchange,

355
18:11.789 --> 18:15.870
how to make sure that there is enough trust

356
18:15.870 --> 18:18.153
between the enterprise and the end users?

357
18:19.230 --> 18:20.520
<v ->Yeah, thanks, Deba.</v>

358
18:20.520 --> 18:22.740
And that's obviously John and Jurgen

359
18:22.740 --> 18:24.720
work in the cybersecurity space.

360
18:24.720 --> 18:26.490
I do not work in the cybersecurity space

361
18:26.490 --> 18:28.620
and our company is not in the cybersecurity space.

362
18:28.620 --> 18:30.030
We're in data privacy.

363
18:30.030 --> 18:33.240
And I would tell you that in the automotive space,

364
18:33.240 --> 18:34.440
probably the greatest concern

365
18:34.440 --> 18:37.020
we have is keeping a car connected.

366
18:37.020 --> 18:38.550
And you probably all just are like,

367
18:38.550 --> 18:39.961
what is she talking about?

368
18:39.961 --> 18:42.750
There's a high propensity for people today,

369
18:42.750 --> 18:44.400
because of a lack of trust

370
18:44.400 --> 18:47.430
with unethical data use in the automotive industry

371
18:47.430 --> 18:49.607
for people to disconnect their cars.

372
18:49.607 --> 18:51.840
If you look at the trial period

373
18:51.840 --> 18:52.917
of somebody buying a new car,

374
18:52.917 --> 18:56.340
we just got some data not terribly long ago from one

375
18:56.340 --> 18:58.890
of the largest OEMs who I'll leave nameless that said,

376
18:58.890 --> 19:02.048
after the trial period, 80% of people disconnect their cars.

377
19:02.048 --> 19:03.630
Now, I don't know how in the world

378
19:03.630 --> 19:06.878
you update software in a car when the car is disconnected.

379
19:06.878 --> 19:09.390
Maybe some of you here have some great ideas

380
19:09.390 --> 19:11.910
you could share with me, but I haven't figured it out yet.

381
19:11.910 --> 19:14.400
And so, we, I believe,

382
19:14.400 --> 19:18.270
have to focus on ethical data use in the automotive industry

383
19:18.270 --> 19:21.242
as a core component of attempting

384
19:21.242 --> 19:25.020
to have software-defined vehicles become something

385
19:25.020 --> 19:28.200
that is really has delivers the promise

386
19:28.200 --> 19:30.960
and the prospect that you'll see on the show floor here

387
19:30.960 --> 19:32.523
and that every OEM talks about.

388
19:33.721 --> 19:36.000
We did a session last night,

389
19:36.000 --> 19:38.100
it was really insightful, with the World Economic Forum.

390
19:38.100 --> 19:40.680
They have a center for trusted technology,

391
19:40.680 --> 19:42.915
it's called CTT, that you should follow.

392
19:42.915 --> 19:45.750
And their whole mission is to say,

393
19:45.750 --> 19:48.660
how can we, these are my words, not theirs,

394
19:48.660 --> 19:52.860
how can we take ethical data use to a new level

395
19:52.860 --> 19:57.319
with a social contract with people that are required

396
19:57.319 --> 19:58.590
to give personal

397
19:58.590 --> 20:01.410
and sensitive data in order for a device to work?

398
20:01.410 --> 20:03.002
At the end of the day, a car's a device.

399
20:03.002 --> 20:05.400
It's no different than what your watch is or whatever.

400
20:05.400 --> 20:06.840
It's connected device.

401
20:06.840 --> 20:08.242
And so, all that data

402
20:08.242 --> 20:12.780
that the automotives need for that car to operate properly,

403
20:12.780 --> 20:15.300
the connectivity, the personal information,

404
20:15.300 --> 20:17.940
the GPS that's coming off the car,

405
20:17.940 --> 20:22.710
all of those whatever, 65 data points and sensors

406
20:22.710 --> 20:24.810
that are in that telematics stream,

407
20:24.810 --> 20:29.041
have to be protected and have to be used ethically.

408
20:29.041 --> 20:31.680
If for anybody that's been following some

409
20:31.680 --> 20:34.530
of the data privacy legislation in the federal government

410
20:34.530 --> 20:36.992
that hopefully will get passed here in 2025,

411
20:36.992 --> 20:41.992
one of the biggest facets of that bill is data minimization.

412
20:42.090 --> 20:43.710
And so, what I would say to all of you

413
20:43.710 --> 20:45.686
in the automotive space,

414
20:45.686 --> 20:50.686
just because that pipe coming into a car has 65 or whatever,

415
20:50.820 --> 20:54.516
we did a POC and found about 65 sensors,

416
20:54.516 --> 20:57.990
that data was coming into the car and that telemetry,

417
20:57.990 --> 21:00.900
just because it has 65 data fields,

418
21:00.900 --> 21:02.670
data points, and sensors,

419
21:02.670 --> 21:04.759
doesn't mean you have the right to use those.

420
21:04.759 --> 21:08.130
What it means is that you have to ask the consumer

421
21:08.130 --> 21:09.472
if you can use that data

422
21:09.472 --> 21:11.721
and get consent to use that data,

423
21:11.721 --> 21:13.742
and make sure it's the consumer

424
21:13.742 --> 21:16.170
that is telling you you can use that data,

425
21:16.170 --> 21:18.870
not a deep fake that's telling you you can use that data.

426
21:18.870 --> 21:20.970
And then, you have to minimize the data stream

427
21:20.970 --> 21:22.500
down to the data they authorized

428
21:22.500 --> 21:24.420
and consented for you to use.

429
21:24.420 --> 21:27.690
It's not a, this is not like some weird proposition.

430
21:27.690 --> 21:29.100
It's really three things.

431
21:29.100 --> 21:31.080
Verify the person giving you consent

432
21:31.080 --> 21:33.300
is that person, not a deepfake.

433
21:33.300 --> 21:34.860
Giving you consent to do it.

434
21:34.860 --> 21:36.420
And third, minimize the data

435
21:36.420 --> 21:38.670
and don't use the data nefariously,

436
21:38.670 --> 21:40.620
and they will have a value exchange with you.

437
21:40.620 --> 21:42.720
If they don't, they'll disconnect the car.

438
21:43.680 --> 21:46.923
<v ->Thank you. I think this is very, very important aspect.</v>

439
21:47.758 --> 21:51.033
Now, I will change the topic a little bit.

440
21:52.050 --> 21:54.423
Next question is to John again.

441
21:56.288 --> 21:59.580
So, we have, Cindy, safe,

442
21:59.580 --> 22:02.730
you are part of the safety as well as the cybersecurity.

443
22:02.730 --> 22:06.120
That's why it would be great if you can give your insight.

444
22:06.120 --> 22:08.550
Is it a complimentary to each other

445
22:08.550 --> 22:10.770
or is there any conflict?

446
22:10.770 --> 22:12.960
If there is any conflict happens

447
22:12.960 --> 22:14.589
during the system engineering

448
22:14.589 --> 22:18.603
between safety and security, what is the way to resolve it?

449
22:20.040 --> 22:22.164
<v ->Yeah, that's a good question.</v>

450
22:22.164 --> 22:25.290
For functional safety, just for those in the room

451
22:25.290 --> 22:28.110
that may not be aware of what exactly is functional safety,

452
22:28.110 --> 22:31.620
ultimately, you're looking at if a failure occurs

453
22:31.620 --> 22:33.750
in your vehicle, an electrical system

454
22:33.750 --> 22:35.760
or electrical or electronic system.

455
22:35.760 --> 22:38.520
And of course cybersecurity's looking at from the aspect

456
22:38.520 --> 22:40.620
of an attack on that system,

457
22:40.620 --> 22:43.320
someone's trying to do something malicious.

458
22:43.320 --> 22:45.840
So, fortunately, they're really,

459
22:45.840 --> 22:48.420
I guess, they're really complimentary.

460
22:48.420 --> 22:51.780
There are various points within the life cycle

461
22:51.780 --> 22:55.560
where it's vital that the two disciplines interact.

462
22:55.560 --> 22:58.282
And when I say interact or what I call touch points,

463
22:58.282 --> 23:01.770
that they interact and work very collaboratively together.

464
23:01.770 --> 23:03.870
So, collaboration is critical.

465
23:03.870 --> 23:06.660
So, it goes all the way to the beginning of the life cycle,

466
23:06.660 --> 23:09.090
where you're defining what's called the item definition,

467
23:09.090 --> 23:12.690
if you're in the functional safety or cybersecurity world.

468
23:12.690 --> 23:13.950
In other words, agreement.

469
23:13.950 --> 23:18.660
And what is the system that we are addressing?

470
23:18.660 --> 23:21.000
So, both parties are in agreement.

471
23:21.000 --> 23:24.210
This is the boundary of that system.

472
23:24.210 --> 23:25.410
This is what we're assessing.

473
23:25.410 --> 23:28.500
So, you work together to do the item definition.

474
23:28.500 --> 23:30.120
And at various points in the life cycle,

475
23:30.120 --> 23:31.383
we give some examples.

476
23:32.580 --> 23:34.800
Functional safety will come up with a goal.

477
23:34.800 --> 23:36.540
They'll see a particular failure

478
23:36.540 --> 23:38.370
and they'll say, well, because of that failure,

479
23:38.370 --> 23:39.420
let me give an example.

480
23:39.420 --> 23:43.479
A failure might be a vehicle safety message

481
23:43.479 --> 23:46.560
that's supposed to say, break,

482
23:46.560 --> 23:48.990
turn the brakes on, or something like that.

483
23:48.990 --> 23:51.390
So, safety might say, well, you have to make sure

484
23:51.390 --> 23:54.300
that message has integrity, so when the receiver gets it,

485
23:54.300 --> 23:56.460
they know some bit hasn't flipped

486
23:56.460 --> 23:59.220
in the message due to noise or something like that.

487
23:59.220 --> 24:00.630
So, they'll add what's called like

488
24:00.630 --> 24:04.209
a cyclic redundancy check or a CRC check to it.

489
24:04.209 --> 24:06.510
Well, now, cybersecurity looks at that

490
24:06.510 --> 24:08.535
and says, well, if I was an attacker,

491
24:08.535 --> 24:11.370
you're just using a basic CRC,

492
24:11.370 --> 24:13.950
I'm going into little technical details.

493
24:13.950 --> 24:15.780
I could mimic that as an attacker

494
24:15.780 --> 24:17.160
and I could say, disabled breaks,

495
24:17.160 --> 24:19.410
and send a valid, perfectly valid message.

496
24:19.410 --> 24:21.655
I could perform an attack on that.

497
24:21.655 --> 24:25.230
So, then I say, well, I've gotta know who sent the message,

498
24:25.230 --> 24:27.297
not just the message has integrity,

499
24:27.297 --> 24:30.060
is this an authentic message?

500
24:30.060 --> 24:31.945
Should I listen to this message?

501
24:31.945 --> 24:33.690
And so, we'll say, well gee,

502
24:33.690 --> 24:35.490
we need to add a digital signature.

503
24:35.490 --> 24:39.060
Well, that digital signature will need special hardware

504
24:39.060 --> 24:43.243
to do the cybersecurity computations in a secure enclave.

505
24:43.243 --> 24:47.065
Again, cybersecurity has to be rooted in hardware.

506
24:47.065 --> 24:50.160
Well, now, I've introduced special hardware

507
24:50.160 --> 24:51.685
that hardware can fail.

508
24:51.685 --> 24:55.290
So, now, I could fail in my cybersecurity calculation

509
24:55.290 --> 24:58.290
causing a failure in the functional safety message.

510
24:58.290 --> 25:01.200
So, now, functional safety needs to be informed about that.

511
25:01.200 --> 25:04.890
So, it's not that they conflict, you need to coordinate.

512
25:04.890 --> 25:06.660
So, you make them aware of, okay, now we need

513
25:06.660 --> 25:09.758
to consider the failure of your cybersecurity component.

514
25:09.758 --> 25:12.690
And then, cybersecurity also needs

515
25:12.690 --> 25:15.420
to look at safety impacts.

516
25:15.420 --> 25:16.680
Like one of the things you look at

517
25:16.680 --> 25:18.570
from a cybersecurity perspective

518
25:18.570 --> 25:22.560
is if this attack were to occur, what's gonna happen

519
25:22.560 --> 25:24.600
is somebody gonna get their finger pinched,

520
25:24.600 --> 25:25.950
somebody to get severely injured,

521
25:25.950 --> 25:28.530
or heaven forbid, somebody would die.

522
25:28.530 --> 25:31.020
So, you work with the functional safety team, saying,

523
25:31.020 --> 25:33.474
this is our assessment of the safety impact.

524
25:33.474 --> 25:37.380
Perhaps the driver could control the situation.

525
25:37.380 --> 25:39.229
Maybe they attack like the steering wheel,

526
25:39.229 --> 25:41.580
jerk set of somebody's hands, maybe the driver.

527
25:41.580 --> 25:42.987
So, maybe you can take controlability.

528
25:42.987 --> 25:45.988
So, you consult functional safety on that.

529
25:45.988 --> 25:50.988
And ultimately, the redundancy within functional safety

530
25:51.390 --> 25:52.680
can help as another example.

531
25:52.680 --> 25:56.490
So, that's an example where maybe some redundancy feature

532
25:56.490 --> 26:00.120
in functional safety can help you in cybersecurity.

533
26:00.120 --> 26:03.450
So, ultimately, it all boils down to within various points,

534
26:03.450 --> 26:05.550
like when you're doing specific requirements

535
26:05.550 --> 26:09.030
or deciding requirements, what are those requirements?

536
26:09.030 --> 26:11.700
So, I understand what functional safety is doing,

537
26:11.700 --> 26:14.620
pretending she's the functional safety engineer.

538
26:14.620 --> 26:16.500
She understands what I'm doing

539
26:16.500 --> 26:17.971
from a cybersecurity perspective

540
26:17.971 --> 26:19.549
and exchange that information

541
26:19.549 --> 26:22.683
to make sure they're complimentary and not conflicting.

542
26:23.940 --> 26:24.773
<v ->Thank you.</v>

543
26:24.773 --> 26:28.483
So, as we understand the system engineering

544
26:28.483 --> 26:30.660
is not just the cybersecurity,

545
26:30.660 --> 26:33.930
you have to consider multiple such items,

546
26:33.930 --> 26:36.870
functional safety, cybersecurity, privacy,

547
26:36.870 --> 26:38.719
all things need to be considered

548
26:38.719 --> 26:41.640
and we cannot ignore any of them.

549
26:41.640 --> 26:43.683
So, that's the beauty.

550
26:44.520 --> 26:46.872
Thank you for giving this deep insight.

551
26:46.872 --> 26:50.490
I would like to change the topic a little bit now,

552
26:50.490 --> 26:54.630
because as we know, AI is a new buzzword.

553
26:54.630 --> 26:58.200
In my company, we call it AI 360.

554
26:58.200 --> 27:01.468
If you see around you, everywhere, you will find AI.

555
27:01.468 --> 27:06.468
So, I would like to ask Jurgen
(attendee coughing)

556
27:06.792 --> 27:11.792
how AI transform the way the auto manufacturers would detect

557
27:14.220 --> 27:19.220
and neutralize the threat of tomorrow on real time?

558
27:21.390 --> 27:22.920
<v ->Yes. (clears throat)</v>

559
27:22.920 --> 27:27.920
So, AI certainly has a potential to revolutionize detection

560
27:29.280 --> 27:33.180
and utilization of cybersecurity attacks.

561
27:33.180 --> 27:35.437
And this is simply due to the fact

562
27:35.437 --> 27:39.977
that AI algorithms are pretty good in detecting

563
27:39.977 --> 27:42.150
or analyzing vast amount of datas,

564
27:42.150 --> 27:45.171
and really detect patterns and anomalies.

565
27:45.171 --> 27:47.700
And that's why in that case,

566
27:47.700 --> 27:51.420
so they really can act with a very high speed

567
27:51.420 --> 27:54.765
and detect those anomalies.

568
27:54.765 --> 27:58.170
And then, of course, you can initiate in immediate alerts

569
27:58.170 --> 27:59.370
and react on it.

570
27:59.370 --> 28:02.850
And so, the really key characteristic is here

571
28:02.850 --> 28:07.620
that AI really is able to have a, yeah,

572
28:07.620 --> 28:09.685
achieve a speed and a scale on data

573
28:09.685 --> 28:12.720
that is unattainable human analysts, so.

574
28:12.720 --> 28:13.553
And that's why,

575
28:13.553 --> 28:18.270
so you much faster using AI algorithms than humans.

576
28:18.270 --> 28:21.240
And on the other side, of course you can use AI

577
28:21.240 --> 28:24.900
to automate analysis of security logs, for instance,

578
28:24.900 --> 28:28.140
and detect possible

579
28:28.140 --> 28:32.370
or indications for threats and attacks.

580
28:32.370 --> 28:35.340
And one example could be that you detect those

581
28:35.340 --> 28:38.310
and you detect that the system is compromised,

582
28:38.310 --> 28:42.720
and then the AI is proposing steps for isolation

583
28:42.720 --> 28:43.616
in order to prevent

584
28:43.616 --> 28:48.150
or do a kind of containment of that security attack.

585
28:48.150 --> 28:50.642
So, there's a lot of potential in AI.

586
28:50.642 --> 28:53.190
And furthermore, actually,

587
28:53.190 --> 28:56.463
you really can use AI inside the vehicle as well.

588
28:57.660 --> 29:01.203
So, incorporate AI algorithms

589
29:01.203 --> 29:05.550
really to analyze all datas from sensors

590
29:05.550 --> 29:10.440
and communication flows, communication channels, and so on.

591
29:10.440 --> 29:12.120
So, there's huge potential,

592
29:12.120 --> 29:13.323
but what you need for that

593
29:13.323 --> 29:17.970
in order to keep your product future-proof is really this,

594
29:17.970 --> 29:20.940
what I mentioned earlier, the cybersecurity agility

595
29:20.940 --> 29:24.210
to be able to exploit the characteristics

596
29:24.210 --> 29:27.120
of machine learning that such an algorithm

597
29:27.120 --> 29:29.875
can improve over time using new datas.

598
29:29.875 --> 29:34.410
And so, being able to detect

599
29:34.410 --> 29:39.410
and basically deal with emerging new threats.

600
29:39.840 --> 29:44.610
And so, and that gives you the capability really

601
29:44.610 --> 29:47.580
to deal with cybersecurity over a lifetime,

602
29:47.580 --> 29:49.770
which is really important.

603
29:49.770 --> 29:51.450
So, as John explained,

604
29:51.450 --> 29:53.763
so cybersecurity is not a static issue.

605
29:54.722 --> 29:57.603
And AI is a key technology in that.

606
29:59.340 --> 30:00.173
<v ->Thank you.</v>

607
30:01.950 --> 30:03.870
So, last question I have,

608
30:03.870 --> 30:06.873
I think it's a little tricky for you, Cindy.

609
30:07.935 --> 30:12.935
So, we are hearing the ban on the Chinese software by 2027

610
30:15.047 --> 30:19.020
and hardware by 2030.

611
30:19.020 --> 30:22.860
I know that one shoe doesn't fit all approach will work,

612
30:22.860 --> 30:27.860
but you being part of the US government in some capacity.

613
30:30.628 --> 30:35.628
So, maybe if you can give some guidance to the team.

614
30:35.850 --> 30:36.683
Yeah.

615
30:36.683 --> 30:37.920
<v ->Yeah, thanks, Deb.</v>

616
30:37.920 --> 30:40.350
And yes, yes, that is a tricky question for sure.

617
30:40.350 --> 30:43.821
It all has the inflaming power.

618
30:43.821 --> 30:45.150
So, I'll be careful there.

619
30:45.150 --> 30:50.150
But I think what I would say is that privacy

620
30:50.160 --> 30:53.700
and cybersecurity working together can ensure

621
30:53.700 --> 30:57.240
that the data that bad actors

622
30:57.240 --> 30:58.470
are trying to get their hands on,

623
30:58.470 --> 30:59.610
they don't get their hands on it.

624
30:59.610 --> 31:02.490
It's no more complicated than that.

625
31:02.490 --> 31:05.880
Obviously, these are all devices with data

626
31:05.880 --> 31:07.620
that the data has huge value,

627
31:07.620 --> 31:11.130
and the data in the wrong hands can have huge consequences.

628
31:11.130 --> 31:13.200
And so, I think actually,

629
31:13.200 --> 31:15.270
when I look at what John and Jurgen

630
31:15.270 --> 31:17.280
are doing on the cybersecurity side,

631
31:17.280 --> 31:20.130
it's really important that a consumer can believe

632
31:20.130 --> 31:23.520
that their data in a car, whatever that data is,

633
31:23.520 --> 31:25.560
all the personal and sensitive data

634
31:25.560 --> 31:29.310
is not getting into the wrong hands for nefarious reasons.

635
31:29.310 --> 31:33.231
So, we rely a ton on the cybersecurity.

636
31:33.231 --> 31:35.670
When we look at privacy by design,

637
31:35.670 --> 31:38.520
that is something that should be in the design cycle.

638
31:38.520 --> 31:40.950
I think John said cybersecurity

639
31:40.950 --> 31:42.450
should not be an afterthought.

640
31:42.450 --> 31:44.480
It should be part of the design cycle.

641
31:44.480 --> 31:46.380
And it's the same with data privacy.

642
31:46.380 --> 31:48.000
It should be part of the design cycle.

643
31:48.000 --> 31:52.556
Privacy by design should be part of the data design as well.

644
31:52.556 --> 31:55.950
And then, we do the handoff

645
31:55.950 --> 31:58.722
or the collaboration with our cybersecurity peers

646
31:58.722 --> 32:01.350
after we've done that data design for the car,

647
32:01.350 --> 32:04.701
and make sure that they understand the data that's necessary

648
32:04.701 --> 32:07.712
for some of these systems to deliver the value.

649
32:07.712 --> 32:09.210
In particular, of course,

650
32:09.210 --> 32:10.620
some of the infotainment systems

651
32:10.620 --> 32:13.860
which require a ton of personal and sensitive data,

652
32:13.860 --> 32:16.643
and how we're both deprecating that data,

653
32:16.643 --> 32:18.360
anonymizing it, if we are,

654
32:18.360 --> 32:21.150
whatever we're doing to make sure on the security side,

655
32:21.150 --> 32:23.010
it doesn't get into the wrong hands

656
32:23.010 --> 32:24.420
into the nefarious hands.

657
32:24.420 --> 32:27.210
So, I don't care whether it's the Chinese

658
32:27.210 --> 32:29.100
or whomever, whether it...

659
32:29.100 --> 32:32.338
We've seen attacks come from all over all kinds of nations,

660
32:32.338 --> 32:34.080
not just the Chinese.

661
32:34.080 --> 32:36.790
So, I don't worry as much that it's just the Chinese

662
32:36.790 --> 32:38.670
that we're gonna have these bans against,

663
32:38.670 --> 32:41.337
because candidly in the United States,

664
32:41.337 --> 32:45.420
bad actors are hacking into consumer-sensitive

665
32:45.420 --> 32:47.790
and private data all day long, so.

666
32:47.790 --> 32:48.623
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

667
32:49.560 --> 32:54.480
So, with this, I think we conclude the discussion.

668
32:54.480 --> 32:56.190
I think because of the time-constraint,

669
32:56.190 --> 32:58.100
otherwise, the amount

670
32:58.100 --> 33:00.060
of insight I'm getting from the panelist,

671
33:00.060 --> 33:02.523
I could have probably taken another one hour.

672
33:03.810 --> 33:05.310
So, I would like

673
33:05.310 --> 33:09.300
to get one final word from each of our panelists.

674
33:09.300 --> 33:11.730
So, maybe, Cindy, you can get started.

675
33:11.730 --> 33:12.723
<v ->Yeah, sure.</v>

676
33:14.760 --> 33:16.920
We believe that data privacy

677
33:16.920 --> 33:18.670
is the tip of the spear in the car.

678
33:20.160 --> 33:25.160
I spend a lot of time reviewing software-defined vehicles

679
33:25.920 --> 33:27.438
and the data necessary

680
33:27.438 --> 33:30.450
to make the dream become a reality

681
33:30.450 --> 33:31.950
in software-defined vehicles.

682
33:31.950 --> 33:33.300
And like I said before,

683
33:33.300 --> 33:35.070
I've yet to figure out how in the world

684
33:35.070 --> 33:37.830
that dream will become a reality in a disconnected car.

685
33:37.830 --> 33:40.470
So, I think we have to do everything in our power

686
33:40.470 --> 33:43.680
to make sure that we have a social contract with consumers,

687
33:43.680 --> 33:46.740
that their data is not used nefariously,

688
33:46.740 --> 33:48.726
that we're not selling it to LexisNexis

689
33:48.726 --> 33:51.438
and our insurance rates aren't rising.

690
33:51.438 --> 33:55.200
And that consent is part of this equation.

691
33:55.200 --> 33:57.048
If we wanna take data off the car

692
33:57.048 --> 34:00.420
and use that data for a value exchange with the consumer,

693
34:00.420 --> 34:02.070
they have to be able to trust you.

694
34:02.070 --> 34:04.860
And so, we have to build that social contract

695
34:04.860 --> 34:06.352
on the data side as a way

696
34:06.352 --> 34:10.830
to ensure that all of these wonderful notions

697
34:10.830 --> 34:13.080
of software-defined vehicles come to reality.

698
34:15.159 --> 34:17.116
<v ->So, John, you.</v>

699
34:17.116 --> 34:18.457
<v ->Yeah, so kind of a few closing thoughts is,</v>

700
34:21.900 --> 34:23.910
unfortunately, I think we've got

701
34:23.910 --> 34:26.220
some major challenges ahead in cybersecurity.

702
34:26.220 --> 34:28.170
I'm excited about being,

703
34:28.170 --> 34:31.170
hopefully part of the solution of it.

704
34:31.170 --> 34:32.610
But with some of the challenges

705
34:32.610 --> 34:36.720
that I see ahead is as like Jurgen had mentioned,

706
34:36.720 --> 34:37.972
is quantum computers,

707
34:37.972 --> 34:42.972
that's gonna upend cybersecurity in a monumental way.

708
34:44.490 --> 34:46.624
So, fortunately, there's already been work done on that

709
34:46.624 --> 34:51.624
from NIST, in post-quantum cryptographic algorithms

710
34:51.690 --> 34:52.523
that have been released.

711
34:52.523 --> 34:54.330
But the migration path

712
34:54.330 --> 34:58.920
in automotive to that is gonna be painful.

713
34:58.920 --> 35:00.258
That's one of it.

714
35:00.258 --> 35:02.880
And just because of that rapidly threat,

715
35:02.880 --> 35:04.593
changing threat landscape,

716
35:05.480 --> 35:08.730
again, I highly recommend you attend a hacking conference

717
35:08.730 --> 35:11.880
that were really, it really opened my eyes when I went

718
35:11.880 --> 35:16.860
to one many years ago as to how real these threats are.

719
35:16.860 --> 35:19.770
That's not just what you're seeing in a movie.

720
35:19.770 --> 35:22.560
It's actually real what's happening behind the scenes.

721
35:22.560 --> 35:25.920
So, understanding that rapidly changing threat landscape

722
35:25.920 --> 35:28.080
and doing something about it,

723
35:28.080 --> 35:29.599
staying up-to-date on threats,

724
35:29.599 --> 35:32.850
participating in things like Automotive ISAC,

725
35:32.850 --> 35:36.090
attending these cybersecurity conferences,

726
35:36.090 --> 35:38.160
things like embedded security for cars,

727
35:38.160 --> 35:39.458
conference, et cetera,

728
35:39.458 --> 35:43.315
participating in standards development, et cetera.

729
35:43.315 --> 35:46.770
Doing all these things will help us stay up-to-date,

730
35:46.770 --> 35:48.660
'cause there are major challenges ahead,

731
35:48.660 --> 35:51.813
but I look forward to tackling those challenges.

732
35:54.723 --> 35:55.560
<v ->Jurgen, you go next.</v>

733
35:55.560 --> 35:56.430
Yeah.
<v ->Okay.</v>

734
35:56.430 --> 36:00.630
So, yeah, I believe that that speed

735
36:00.630 --> 36:03.407
and flexibility is very critical in cybersecurity.

736
36:03.407 --> 36:08.407
And the ability really to adapt for new attacks

737
36:08.730 --> 36:11.340
and to implement effective countermeasures

738
36:11.340 --> 36:13.140
will probably determine the difference

739
36:13.140 --> 36:15.000
between successful protection

740
36:15.000 --> 36:17.400
and significant security breaches.

741
36:17.400 --> 36:22.400
And as John and Cindy pointed out, it is crucial

742
36:22.710 --> 36:27.007
that those capabilities are designed into the product

743
36:27.007 --> 36:29.070
and not only into the vehicle,

744
36:29.070 --> 36:30.750
into the vehicle and the backend system.

745
36:30.750 --> 36:33.270
So, the task for the car manufacturers

746
36:33.270 --> 36:35.617
is to do that accordingly, actually.

747
36:35.617 --> 36:40.470
And then, I think with a continuous fleet monitoring

748
36:40.470 --> 36:45.030
and dynamic and agile cybersecurity strategy,

749
36:45.030 --> 36:48.870
car manufacturers can safeguard their products

750
36:48.870 --> 36:53.870
and users even with upcoming new complex dangers

751
36:55.110 --> 36:57.120
or cybersecurity threats.

752
36:57.120 --> 36:59.133
And so, being future-proof.

753
37:01.650 --> 37:03.027
<v ->Thank you.</v>

754
37:03.027 --> 37:06.630
Thank you for all your valuable insight.

755
37:06.630 --> 37:10.740
It's my pleasure to conduct such an insightful session.

756
37:10.740 --> 37:14.970
It was really a thought-provoking session for all of us.

757
37:14.970 --> 37:17.490
I think key takeaway for me

758
37:17.490 --> 37:21.464
is I think the holistic view is very, very important.

759
37:21.464 --> 37:25.890
And if we have the holistic view, then we would be able

760
37:25.890 --> 37:29.163
to place the right safeguard at right place.

761
37:30.510 --> 37:33.960
But of course, the topic is pretty complicated.

762
37:33.960 --> 37:37.140
It's may not be good enough for these 40 minutes,

763
37:37.140 --> 37:41.070
may not be a good enough time to go through all the aspect,

764
37:41.070 --> 37:44.430
but we try to touch upon the bigger canvas

765
37:44.430 --> 37:49.430
for of all of us to understand what cybersecurity means.

766
37:49.564 --> 37:52.500
I would like to thank from bottom of my heart

767
37:52.500 --> 37:56.310
to all the panelists for sharing their deep insight.

768
37:56.310 --> 37:59.880
I'm sure that it equip you

769
37:59.880 --> 38:02.520
to confront some of the challenges.

770
38:02.520 --> 38:05.187
Of course the future is very volatile.

771
38:05.187 --> 38:08.460
I'm not sure that we can provide all the insight

772
38:08.460 --> 38:11.280
to counter all the challenges of future,

773
38:11.280 --> 38:13.680
but if we probably follow some

774
38:13.680 --> 38:17.853
of the advice from our panelists, it would be of great help.

775
38:18.810 --> 38:21.570
I would like to thank the audience also

776
38:21.570 --> 38:25.493
for actively engaging with this discussion

777
38:25.493 --> 38:28.247
and probably at morning.

778
38:28.247 --> 38:31.228
So, thank you for coming here

779
38:31.228 --> 38:34.830
and being part of this session,

780
38:34.830 --> 38:36.660
and I hope this session

781
38:36.660 --> 38:39.900
would be useful for all of you in future.

782
38:39.900 --> 38:41.553
Let's secure our future as well.

783
38:43.080 --> 38:44.897
<v ->Thank you.</v>
<v ->Thank you.</v>

784
38:44.897 --> 38:47.473
(attendees clapping)

785
38:47.473 --> 38:50.056
(upbeat music)
