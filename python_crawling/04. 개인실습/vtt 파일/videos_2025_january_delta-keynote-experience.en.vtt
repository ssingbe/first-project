00:00.129 --> 00:02.712
(upbeat music)

2
00:10.830 --> 00:11.663
<v Announcer>Please welcome</v>

3
00:11.663 --> 00:16.663
CEO of the Consumer Technology Association, Gary Shapiro.

4
00:16.995 --> 00:21.995
(audience applauds)
(uplifting music)

5
00:35.250 --> 00:36.423
<v ->Wow.</v>

6
00:38.250 --> 00:39.573
This is incredible.

7
00:40.560 --> 00:45.420
I am so thrilled to be here introducing a keynote at Sphere

8
00:45.420 --> 00:48.858
for the first time in CES history.

9
00:48.858 --> 00:51.691
(audience cheers)

10
00:52.980 --> 00:54.630
And it's so fitting to do so

11
00:54.630 --> 00:59.430
with Delta Airlines CEO Ed Bastian this year.

12
00:59.430 --> 01:03.810
Just like CTA...
(audience cheers)

13
01:03.810 --> 01:07.470
I know the applause line. It's Ed Bastian.

14
01:07.470 --> 01:11.190
(audience cheers and applauds)

15
01:11.190 --> 01:13.440
But we're lucky because just like CTA,

16
01:13.440 --> 01:15.660
Delta is celebrating its centennial,

17
01:15.660 --> 01:17.430
a century of innovation,

18
01:17.430 --> 01:21.300
and also looking ahead for the next 100 years.

19
01:21.300 --> 01:25.537
At CES 2020, Delta and Ed joined us in the main stage

20
01:25.537 --> 01:30.026
for the first-ever keynote by an aviation company

21
01:30.026 --> 01:34.962
highlighting the power of technology to move every industry,

22
01:34.962 --> 01:38.107
every turn for CES 2023

23
01:38.107 --> 01:42.810
to share the transformative power of human connection

24
01:42.810 --> 01:46.500
and how Delta uses creativity, personalization,

25
01:46.500 --> 01:51.500
and humanity to win customers' hearts and their minds.

26
01:51.810 --> 01:54.270
And now I'm so thrilled to welcome him back

27
01:54.270 --> 01:56.580
to share the airline's vision for technology

28
01:56.580 --> 01:59.160
that enriches the human experience

29
01:59.160 --> 02:03.467
today, tomorrow, and for the next 100 years.

30
02:03.467 --> 02:06.720
It uses powerful AI capabilities

31
02:06.720 --> 02:10.170
to create an accessible, tech-forward vision

32
02:10.170 --> 02:13.410
for the future of travel.

33
02:13.410 --> 02:16.020
You know, I had the chance to work with Ed

34
02:16.020 --> 02:19.260
while writing my latest book, "Pivot or Die,"

35
02:19.260 --> 02:22.830
and realized that we share some core beliefs.

36
02:22.830 --> 02:27.660
We both recognize the importance of being open-minded,

37
02:27.660 --> 02:32.290
trying something new, and not fearing the unknown.

38
02:32.290 --> 02:33.917
And we both believe

39
02:33.917 --> 02:38.490
that people are at the heart of every business.

40
02:38.490 --> 02:42.540
As CEO of Delta and a 25-year veteran of the company,

41
02:42.540 --> 02:44.520
Ed knows that doesn't just mean

42
02:44.520 --> 02:46.950
Delta's customers or shareholders.

43
02:46.950 --> 02:51.060
He's also thinking about the thousands of Delta employees

44
02:51.060 --> 02:53.553
who are here tonight and who are back home.

45
02:54.442 --> 02:57.690
(audience cheers and applauds)

46
02:57.690 --> 02:59.460
I appreciate Delta employees.

47
02:59.460 --> 03:01.680
This body's made of Delta food.

48
03:01.680 --> 03:05.760
But you as the employees are the ones whose buy-in he needs

49
03:05.760 --> 03:07.511
to make the changes and pivots

50
03:07.511 --> 03:10.380
that are necessary to succeed.

51
03:10.380 --> 03:14.250
And the millions of people who, like me,

52
03:14.250 --> 03:16.102
step foot on a Delta plane

53
03:16.102 --> 03:19.440
almost every month, every day, or every week,

54
03:19.440 --> 03:22.110
and thanks to Ed Bastian's leadership,

55
03:22.110 --> 03:25.380
Delta is making the world a little smaller

56
03:25.380 --> 03:27.690
and creating human connections

57
03:27.690 --> 03:30.630
that will transform global travel.

58
03:30.630 --> 03:32.133
Let's take a look.

59
03:37.230 --> 03:41.650
<v Viola>As human beings, we share an instinctive need</v>

60
03:42.990 --> 03:45.333
to constantly look forward.

61
03:47.280 --> 03:51.780
With each launch, the dream of distant places

62
03:51.780 --> 03:54.543
ignites the desire to explore,

63
03:55.680 --> 03:59.553
connect, and let the imagination soar.

64
04:01.560 --> 04:06.250
With every flight, we become closer to each other

65
04:09.300 --> 04:11.957
and to ourselves.

66
04:11.957 --> 04:14.790
(inspiring music)

67
04:25.920 --> 04:28.920
<v Announcer>Please welcome Emmy, Grammy, Tony,</v>

68
04:28.920 --> 04:33.348
and Academy Award-winning actress Viola Davis.

69
04:33.348 --> 04:38.348
(audience cheers and applauds)
(upbeat music)

70
04:50.243 --> 04:52.143
<v ->Have I got a story for you,</v>

71
04:53.160 --> 04:58.160
a story 100 years in the making, made possible by you,

72
04:58.800 --> 05:01.860
the believers, the backers,

73
05:01.860 --> 05:06.333
the champions who gave Delta the wings to fly even higher.

74
05:07.260 --> 05:10.890
We've been connecting the world for a century now,

75
05:10.890 --> 05:14.400
beating the odds, breaking barriers,

76
05:14.400 --> 05:17.939
and flying in a class all our own

77
05:17.939 --> 05:21.120
because like history has taught us,

78
05:21.120 --> 05:22.713
there's nothing we can't do.

79
05:23.610 --> 05:27.360
Whether blue skies or storm clouds,

80
05:27.360 --> 05:29.310
nothing can ground the people

81
05:29.310 --> 05:31.950
who have fueled us for a century.

82
05:31.950 --> 05:35.580
Our indomitable spirit has propelled us forward

83
05:35.580 --> 05:40.580
and defined the Delta difference decade after decade.

84
05:40.620 --> 05:43.860
When times are tough, we're tougher.

85
05:43.860 --> 05:47.550
When they say slow down, we say catch up.

86
05:47.550 --> 05:49.350
And when they say it's impossible,

87
05:49.350 --> 05:54.300
we say, sit back, relax, and enjoy the flight.

88
05:54.300 --> 05:56.820
We'll never stop reaching for the skies

89
05:56.820 --> 05:59.100
and shooting for the stars.

90
05:59.100 --> 06:00.573
It's just who we are.

91
06:01.410 --> 06:03.303
This is Delta.

92
06:04.140 --> 06:09.140
And for 100 years and 100 more, we'll never stop climbing.

93
06:11.950 --> 06:16.401
(audience cheers and applauds)

94
06:16.401 --> 06:17.610
(inspiring music)

95
06:17.610 --> 06:22.563
Over the long course of 100 years, you learn some things,

96
06:23.970 --> 06:25.750
and one of the things we've learned

97
06:26.670 --> 06:30.360
is that while others might use a big centennial moment

98
06:30.360 --> 06:35.360
like ours to look back, at Delta, we look up.

99
06:38.430 --> 06:41.520
Because while some say having your head in the clouds

100
06:41.520 --> 06:46.520
is a bad thing, we say it's what dreamers do.

101
06:48.420 --> 06:52.920
At Delta, this kind of imagination is a fuel

102
06:52.920 --> 06:55.680
that's propelled us through the years.

103
06:55.680 --> 06:59.220
It's how we thought beyond our first lone crop duster

104
06:59.220 --> 07:00.660
in Macon, Georgia

105
07:00.660 --> 07:04.740
all the way to becoming the longest-running US airline,

106
07:04.740 --> 07:08.580
bringing you to every corner of the globe.

107
07:08.580 --> 07:12.420
It's how we pioneered the first hub and spoke model

108
07:12.420 --> 07:14.490
to help a world flourish,

109
07:14.490 --> 07:18.000
not least of which was our home of Atlanta.

110
07:18.000 --> 07:20.340
It's what inspired the DC-8,

111
07:20.340 --> 07:23.580
the first jet to get you places faster

112
07:23.580 --> 07:25.260
so you could spend more time

113
07:25.260 --> 07:27.780
with the people you're going to see.

114
07:27.780 --> 07:31.108
It's why we introduced fast free wifi,

115
07:31.108 --> 07:35.353
because connecting you from anywhere to everywhere

116
07:35.353 --> 07:38.403
has always been our ultimate destination.

117
07:39.510 --> 07:42.360
Remember, it wasn't that long ago

118
07:42.360 --> 07:44.913
that flight itself was impossible,

119
07:46.920 --> 07:51.750
and yet now we know that no single innovation

120
07:51.750 --> 07:55.080
has bound the world closer together,

121
07:55.080 --> 07:57.243
getting people out to learn more,

122
07:58.193 --> 08:03.193
to see more, to experience more

123
08:04.980 --> 08:07.863
so we can all be together more too.

124
08:09.840 --> 08:14.840
Now imagine where the next 100 years will take us from here.

125
08:17.574 --> 08:20.407
(plane whooshing)

126
08:22.109 --> 08:26.026
(audience cheers and applauds)

127
08:27.283 --> 08:30.366
(jet engine humming)

128
08:41.634 --> 08:44.051
(soft music)

129
09:30.810 --> 09:35.810
And now please welcome to the stage Delta CEO Ed Bastian.

130
09:39.897 --> 09:42.170
(audience cheers and applauds)

131
09:42.170 --> 09:45.003
(inspiring music)

132
09:51.270 --> 09:54.103
(audience cheers)

133
10:10.020 --> 10:12.853
(audience cheers)

134
10:19.942 --> 10:23.943
<v ->Thank you, thank you, thank you. What a great night.</v>

135
10:24.930 --> 10:27.240
Well, welcome to the Sphere.
(audience cheers)

136
10:27.240 --> 10:31.560
This is gonna be an amazing, amazing evening for us all.

137
10:31.560 --> 10:33.420
But before we start,

138
10:33.420 --> 10:38.420
please join me in a round of applause for Viola Davis.

139
10:38.700 --> 10:41.016
Viola was just awarded...
(audience applauds)

140
10:41.016 --> 10:41.849
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

141
10:41.849 --> 10:43.110
Viola was just awarded

142
10:43.110 --> 10:47.790
the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's highest honor

143
10:47.790 --> 10:49.920
at Sunday night's Golden Globes,

144
10:49.920 --> 10:52.740
a testament to her longstanding impact

145
10:52.740 --> 10:54.540
on the entertainment industry.

146
10:54.540 --> 10:56.660
Congratulations, Viola.

147
10:56.660 --> 10:59.660
(audience applauds)

148
11:02.625 --> 11:03.690
And I want to thank all of you

149
11:03.690 --> 11:06.270
for joining us on this journey today

150
11:06.270 --> 11:10.375
through travels past, present, and its future.

151
11:10.375 --> 11:13.530
Our Delta story began a century ago

152
11:13.530 --> 11:16.650
near the dawn of commercial flight.

153
11:16.650 --> 11:19.848
This is a story of how unparalleled innovation,

154
11:19.848 --> 11:22.740
technological advancements,

155
11:22.740 --> 11:25.950
and fearless thinking changed the world.

156
11:25.950 --> 11:29.760
Well, most of all, it's a story of what can be accomplished

157
11:29.760 --> 11:33.243
when you always put your values front and center.

158
11:34.140 --> 11:35.862
For the past 100 years,

159
11:35.862 --> 11:39.337
Delta has been driven by a simple mandate,

160
11:39.337 --> 11:44.337
always put people first in everything that we do.

161
11:44.940 --> 11:48.822
And it's as true today as it was in 1925

162
11:48.822 --> 11:52.683
when the very first Delta pilots took to the skies.

163
11:53.700 --> 11:55.502
Those values carried us

164
11:55.502 --> 11:59.373
from being a tiny startup crop duster

165
11:59.373 --> 12:04.373
to a global airline connecting the vast world.

166
12:04.555 --> 12:06.988
We can only imagine how exciting

167
12:06.988 --> 12:10.680
the world must have seemed a century ago.

168
12:10.680 --> 12:12.270
Could you imagine?

169
12:12.270 --> 12:16.776
The very concept of powered flight was only a few years old,

170
12:16.776 --> 12:19.410
but this brand new technology,

171
12:19.410 --> 12:22.830
it carried the promise of changing the world.

172
12:22.830 --> 12:26.850
Traversing the skies at high speed created opportunities

173
12:26.850 --> 12:31.530
that would've been impossible in the days of rail and ships.

174
12:31.530 --> 12:34.350
It brought people and communities together

175
12:34.350 --> 12:36.243
as never before in human history.

176
12:37.230 --> 12:39.107
And it feels similar today.

177
12:39.107 --> 12:43.658
New marvels like AI, the digital revolution,

178
12:43.658 --> 12:46.230
and innovations in sustainability

179
12:46.230 --> 12:48.960
are giving us incredible tools

180
12:48.960 --> 12:52.560
to transform the travel experience.

181
12:52.560 --> 12:55.290
But amid the wonder of new technology,

182
12:55.290 --> 12:59.541
we've always understood that the entire point of innovation

183
12:59.541 --> 13:02.040
is to lift people up.

184
13:02.040 --> 13:04.200
As Viola so beautifully said,

185
13:04.200 --> 13:07.620
that mandate to always put people first

186
13:07.620 --> 13:09.630
continues to drive us forward,

187
13:09.630 --> 13:14.412
just as it has for the past 100 years.

188
13:14.412 --> 13:17.130
And it's not just the people we serve,

189
13:17.130 --> 13:19.770
but the people who serve,

190
13:19.770 --> 13:23.253
people like these, our great Delta employees.

191
13:25.622 --> 13:29.539
(audience cheers and applauds)

192
13:31.110 --> 13:34.440
The technician working below wing

193
13:34.440 --> 13:37.410
to maintain our reliability

194
13:37.410 --> 13:41.010
or the flight attendant who recognizes that customer

195
13:41.010 --> 13:43.710
reaching their one millionth mile

196
13:43.710 --> 13:46.710
or the reservation agent who's there,

197
13:46.710 --> 13:50.130
ready to care for you as your plans change.

198
13:50.130 --> 13:54.060
They are the history makers, the innovators,

199
13:54.060 --> 13:56.880
and the champions of human connection.

200
13:56.880 --> 13:59.310
They define what we're all about,

201
13:59.310 --> 14:04.020
what welcoming, elevated, and caring really means.

202
14:04.020 --> 14:08.257
And we feel their contributions reverberate through our past

203
14:08.257 --> 14:11.910
and they carry us into our bright future.

204
14:11.910 --> 14:14.280
And so I want to stop and take a moment

205
14:14.280 --> 14:16.713
to celebrate a few of these people,

206
14:17.730 --> 14:20.310
people like Diane Carvelli,

207
14:20.310 --> 14:24.801
who together with her late colleagues, Jenny...

208
14:24.801 --> 14:25.634
(audience cheers and applauds)
Yes.

209
14:29.670 --> 14:31.470
Who together with her late colleagues,

210
14:31.470 --> 14:36.470
Jenny Oxford and Gene Owens, led a grassroots effort in 1982

211
14:37.827 --> 14:42.480
to buy an incredible gift for our airline,

212
14:42.480 --> 14:46.950
our very first Boeing 767 aircraft.

213
14:46.950 --> 14:48.300
Now, let me say that again.

214
14:49.230 --> 14:54.230
Our very first Boeing 767 was purchased by our own people

215
14:55.068 --> 14:57.930
and then gifted to our airline

216
14:57.930 --> 15:00.630
during a troubled financial period.

217
15:00.630 --> 15:05.090
That plane became known as the Spirit of Delta.

218
15:05.090 --> 15:06.259
(audience applauds)

219
15:06.259 --> 15:08.559
Thank you, Diane, for being here this evening.

220
15:15.180 --> 15:16.907
People like Dana Nelson,

221
15:16.907 --> 15:21.679
the first Black female pilot hired by Delta.

222
15:21.679 --> 15:25.596
(audience cheers and applauds)

223
15:28.650 --> 15:32.268
First Officer Nelson, thank you for all you've done

224
15:32.268 --> 15:35.133
for breaking barriers in aviation.

225
15:36.213 --> 15:40.419
(audience cheers and applauds)

226
15:40.419 --> 15:41.700
And people like James Sarvis,

227
15:41.700 --> 15:44.610
who served Delta for over 50 years

228
15:44.610 --> 15:47.126
in a number of vital positions.

229
15:47.126 --> 15:49.710
(audience cheers and applauds)

230
15:49.710 --> 15:52.140
So good to see you here, James.

231
15:52.140 --> 15:55.863
For your five decades of service to Delta, we thank you.

232
15:57.090 --> 16:01.110
And finally, people like Joan Crandall.

233
16:01.110 --> 16:06.110
Joan, another one of our legendary Delta flight attendants,

234
16:06.300 --> 16:11.108
recently celebrated 65 years of service to Delta.

235
16:11.108 --> 16:15.025
(audience cheers and applauds)

236
16:18.540 --> 16:22.260
Joan, thank you for your dedication to our customers

237
16:22.260 --> 16:24.150
and for the example that you have set

238
16:24.150 --> 16:27.240
for so many of us at Delta.

239
16:27.240 --> 16:30.240
These are the Delta professionals

240
16:30.240 --> 16:31.640
that have written our story.

241
16:32.610 --> 16:37.210
They embody our values, our culture, our history,

242
16:37.210 --> 16:39.450
and they've helped build a foundation

243
16:39.450 --> 16:42.870
that's going to power our next 100 years.

244
16:42.870 --> 16:44.883
Thanks again to each of you.

245
16:50.340 --> 16:54.000
<v ->Now we have to insert propeller blades to the hub.</v>

246
16:54.000 --> 16:58.140
<v Viola>As we fly across continents and cultures</v>

247
16:58.140 --> 17:00.843
toward adventures and achievements,

248
17:01.770 --> 17:04.383
through times of turbulence and triumph,

249
17:06.480 --> 17:09.210
we are propelled by curiosity

250
17:09.210 --> 17:13.623
and a deep desire to forge bonds that transcend borders.

251
17:14.483 --> 17:15.665
<v ->You did it.</v>

252
17:15.665 --> 17:16.915
Yes. Great job.

253
17:18.130 --> 17:20.395
(plane buzzing)

254
17:20.395 --> 17:25.056
<v Viola>With childlike wonder, we travel everywhere</v>

255
17:25.056 --> 17:29.139
and imagine a world where everything is possible.

256
17:31.736 --> 17:34.403
(plane buzzing)

257
17:44.172 --> 17:46.589
(soft music)

258
18:25.254 --> 18:28.087
(uplifting music)

259
18:49.590 --> 18:51.360
<v ->As we take flight,</v>

260
18:51.360 --> 18:54.960
technology is transforming the way we travel,

261
18:54.960 --> 18:59.960
with AI at the forefront of shaping our future.

262
18:59.970 --> 19:04.970
But at Delta, it's not technology for technology's sake. No.

263
19:05.040 --> 19:08.490
It's always about putting people first.

264
19:08.490 --> 19:11.040
We call it innovating with heart,

265
19:11.040 --> 19:14.430
using technology to create premium experiences

266
19:14.430 --> 19:16.653
with humanity at the core.

267
19:17.760 --> 19:19.541
Compared to a century ago,

268
19:19.541 --> 19:23.310
our ability to innovate has grown exponentially

269
19:23.310 --> 19:26.730
thanks to better data and smarter tools.

270
19:26.730 --> 19:28.320
That helps us make a difference

271
19:28.320 --> 19:31.953
at more points along your journey than ever before.

272
19:32.790 --> 19:36.423
Today, you expect travel that feels tailored to you.

273
19:37.410 --> 19:41.349
The goal is to create a seamless connected travel experience

274
19:41.349 --> 19:42.903
from start to finish.

275
19:43.770 --> 19:45.960
That's why we work with partners,

276
19:45.960 --> 19:47.970
including rideshare providers

277
19:47.970 --> 19:50.793
who serve the first and last miles of your trip.

278
19:51.630 --> 19:54.090
Joby, which promises to bring

279
19:54.090 --> 19:58.144
a new mode of transportation to market and wheels up

280
19:58.144 --> 20:00.540
where elevated private solutions

281
20:00.540 --> 20:03.672
complement Delta's premium service,

282
20:03.672 --> 20:06.600
it all creates more choice for customers

283
20:06.600 --> 20:08.820
to get to their destination

284
20:08.820 --> 20:11.910
in a way that works best for them.

285
20:11.910 --> 20:15.754
So how can we use AI to help each of you connect

286
20:15.754 --> 20:19.230
more meaningfully at each step?

287
20:19.230 --> 20:23.370
How can we couple it with human ingenuity, imagination,

288
20:23.370 --> 20:26.730
and the world's most on-time airline?

289
20:26.730 --> 20:30.030
The possibilities really are endless.

290
20:30.030 --> 20:30.918
This evening,

291
20:30.918 --> 20:34.470
we'll focus on four key moments along the journey

292
20:34.470 --> 20:38.073
where we see opportunity for great innovation.

293
20:39.030 --> 20:42.037
First, embedding modern technology

294
20:42.037 --> 20:46.650
to power and enhance the operational experience.

295
20:46.650 --> 20:50.280
Delta already is the world's most reliable airline,

296
20:50.280 --> 20:53.763
but we're raising the bar even higher for you.

297
20:54.750 --> 20:56.971
Second, convening partners

298
20:56.971 --> 21:00.248
to create new means of seamless travel

299
21:00.248 --> 21:03.540
that enable greater access and ease.

300
21:03.540 --> 21:08.097
Third, re-imagining how you spend your time on board

301
21:08.097 --> 21:12.442
and how we show our loyalty back to you.

302
21:12.442 --> 21:16.270
And finally, bringing the world closer together

303
21:16.270 --> 21:20.100
by unlocking more access to international travel

304
21:20.100 --> 21:23.340
through new fleet technologies.

305
21:23.340 --> 21:25.299
But let's begin with you.

306
21:25.299 --> 21:28.320
It's critical that we have a deep understanding

307
21:28.320 --> 21:30.388
of how you like to travel

308
21:30.388 --> 21:34.402
and we're working with leaders in data and insights

309
21:34.402 --> 21:36.201
to do just that,

310
21:36.201 --> 21:39.960
to share more about how we're turning your feedback

311
21:39.960 --> 21:42.930
into meaningful moments throughout your journey.

312
21:42.930 --> 21:45.390
Please welcome to the stage the co-founder

313
21:45.390 --> 21:49.140
and executive chairman of Qualtrics, Mr. Ryan Smith,

314
21:49.140 --> 21:52.530
and one of our own iconic Delta flight attendants,

315
21:52.530 --> 21:53.433
Jeanie Brady.

316
21:54.508 --> 21:59.508
(uplifting music)
(audience applauds)

317
22:14.280 --> 22:15.690
Well, Ryan and Jeanie...

318
22:15.690 --> 22:18.016
Jeanie, you got your fan club already out there.

319
22:18.016 --> 22:20.040
(audience cheers)

320
22:20.040 --> 22:21.153
Including on stage.

321
22:22.380 --> 22:24.903
Well, Ryan and Jeanie, thank you for joining us.

322
22:25.740 --> 22:29.190
Ryan, Qualtrics is the leader in experience management

323
22:29.190 --> 22:31.950
and has been an amazing partner for Delta,

324
22:31.950 --> 22:36.950
helping us use data to better understand our customers.

325
22:37.020 --> 22:40.383
Ryan, could you start to describe how we're using feedback

326
22:40.383 --> 22:43.380
to shape the future of travel?

327
22:43.380 --> 22:44.920
<v ->Well, thanks, Ed.</v>

328
22:44.920 --> 22:46.170
It's been incredible to be a partner with Delta

329
22:46.170 --> 22:47.430
for some time now,

330
22:47.430 --> 22:51.497
but it really boils down to experience.

331
22:51.497 --> 22:56.497
Experience is actually the currency of business today

332
22:56.610 --> 23:01.530
and the travel experiences that Delta provides at scale,

333
23:01.530 --> 23:04.140
you're clearly setting yourself apart.

334
23:04.140 --> 23:06.150
Last year at Qualtrics,

335
23:06.150 --> 23:10.290
we looked at nearly 7 million records of feedback

336
23:10.290 --> 23:13.541
from Delta customers to identify the areas

337
23:13.541 --> 23:17.640
which people actually care about the most.

338
23:17.640 --> 23:20.670
And nobody's doing this at the scale that Delta is

339
23:20.670 --> 23:22.530
across the global network

340
23:22.530 --> 23:27.530
with nearly 200 million travelers that you serve each year.

341
23:27.810 --> 23:30.030
Delta is clearly the leader,

342
23:30.030 --> 23:33.420
but this experience data, the feedback that we're collecting

343
23:33.420 --> 23:38.420
is critical to unlocking how Delta can meaningfully connect

344
23:38.700 --> 23:41.519
with customers, exceed their expectations,

345
23:41.519 --> 23:45.930
and ultimately anticipate their needs.

346
23:45.930 --> 23:49.080
This anticipate word, anticipate the needs

347
23:49.080 --> 23:52.170
to transform the whole travel experience,

348
23:52.170 --> 23:55.288
because truly knowing customers better,

349
23:55.288 --> 23:59.968
it really should mean that in turn, you're recognizing them

350
23:59.968 --> 24:02.430
and you're improving that experience

351
24:02.430 --> 24:05.640
as they move through each leg of the journey.

352
24:05.640 --> 24:07.500
<v ->That's so perfect, Ryan,</v>

353
24:07.500 --> 24:10.650
and you described the journey that we're on together

354
24:10.650 --> 24:11.730
and it is a long journey.

355
24:11.730 --> 24:13.650
Jeanie, you've been on our journey

356
24:13.650 --> 24:15.270
for a while together with us.

357
24:15.270 --> 24:17.460
Can you share your perspective about that?

358
24:17.460 --> 24:18.840
<v ->Thank you, Ed.</v>

359
24:18.840 --> 24:22.110
Every customer that walks through our boarding door

360
24:22.110 --> 24:23.790
has a unique story.

361
24:23.790 --> 24:27.540
As flight attendants, we hear those stories every day

362
24:27.540 --> 24:31.200
and Ryan makes a great point about recognition.

363
24:31.200 --> 24:34.200
It's not just about recognizing a birthday,

364
24:34.200 --> 24:38.220
it's about making every moment they spend on Delta

365
24:38.220 --> 24:41.580
feel welcoming, elevated, and caring.

366
24:41.580 --> 24:45.300
As Ed said, it's in our DNA at Delta.

367
24:45.300 --> 24:48.568
And if you take million milers as an example,

368
24:48.568 --> 24:53.568
65 customers each day cross over a million mile threshold.

369
24:54.600 --> 24:56.760
And what do all those customers,

370
24:56.760 --> 24:59.250
those million miler customers have in common?

371
24:59.250 --> 25:00.990
They all started at zero.

372
25:00.990 --> 25:02.490
That's a lot of moments

373
25:02.490 --> 25:04.590
through their travel history at Delta

374
25:04.590 --> 25:07.260
where we have an opportunity to recognize

375
25:07.260 --> 25:09.030
and celebrate them.

376
25:09.030 --> 25:12.930
That data helps empower our frontline team members,

377
25:12.930 --> 25:16.020
create moments of magic in real time

378
25:16.020 --> 25:18.720
and in a way that fits that occasion.

379
25:18.720 --> 25:20.220
Those million milers,

380
25:20.220 --> 25:23.040
it first started with a handwritten card

381
25:23.040 --> 25:26.520
and now it's developed into a full-blown program

382
25:26.520 --> 25:29.790
at multi-level delivered by Delta people.

383
25:29.790 --> 25:33.960
A handwritten note or card, it could be a small gift,

384
25:33.960 --> 25:36.968
an announcement onboard, and so much more.

385
25:36.968 --> 25:40.828
So think about it, if we take that concept, that idea,

386
25:40.828 --> 25:44.790
and you now move it to moments, more moments,

387
25:44.790 --> 25:46.935
if there was a digital continuity

388
25:46.935 --> 25:51.420
in which that check encounter looks at that customer

389
25:51.420 --> 25:53.520
and know exactly what their story is

390
25:53.520 --> 25:56.010
and that transfers over to the gate agent

391
25:56.010 --> 25:58.620
in the boarding house and they know how to treat 'em

392
25:58.620 --> 26:01.200
and then they come on board our airplane

393
26:01.200 --> 26:03.060
and all of us as flight attendants,

394
26:03.060 --> 26:06.930
we know exactly how to celebrate them or care for them.

395
26:06.930 --> 26:10.530
That is the opportunity ahead to go above and beyond

396
26:10.530 --> 26:11.670
and it's exciting.

397
26:11.670 --> 26:12.960
<v ->And you are so right, Jeanie,</v>

398
26:12.960 --> 26:15.243
and that is the Delta difference right there.

399
26:16.224 --> 26:17.550
(audience applauds)

400
26:17.550 --> 26:20.070
While feedback informs the experience today,

401
26:20.070 --> 26:22.680
there is much more we can and will be doing

402
26:22.680 --> 26:23.940
in the years ahead

403
26:23.940 --> 26:26.280
to deepen the connections that we're making

404
26:26.280 --> 26:28.110
and give you all control over

405
26:28.110 --> 26:30.990
how your experience is personalized.

406
26:30.990 --> 26:33.030
Ryan, this isn't a futuristic vision.

407
26:33.030 --> 26:35.070
This is something we're already starting on today.

408
26:35.070 --> 26:37.170
<v ->Yeah, everything we're working on together</v>

409
26:37.170 --> 26:39.625
is about these personalized moments

410
26:39.625 --> 26:44.502
and you know, how do you deliver them in an individualized,

411
26:44.502 --> 26:49.110
highly contextual experience at scale?

412
26:49.110 --> 26:50.940
It's easy when it's one to a few.

413
26:50.940 --> 26:55.539
It's hard when it's one to many as in 200 million.

414
26:55.539 --> 27:00.000
So above all, what people want and what we're finding out,

415
27:00.000 --> 27:02.719
people want to be seen, as you described.

416
27:02.719 --> 27:07.061
And so we're combining intelligent listening

417
27:07.061 --> 27:09.930
with the AI that we're working on together

418
27:09.930 --> 27:13.592
to unlock new ways to deliver these elevated moments

419
27:13.592 --> 27:16.260
while maintaining a personal touch

420
27:16.260 --> 27:19.380
that Delta is known for all over the world.

421
27:19.380 --> 27:21.870
For example, many of you in the audience

422
27:21.870 --> 27:23.910
are traveling here on business,

423
27:23.910 --> 27:26.820
but what if you were traveling for another reason?

424
27:26.820 --> 27:29.516
What if it was for a honeymoon or a job interview

425
27:29.516 --> 27:34.010
or your first mile or even your 15 millionth mile?

426
27:34.010 --> 27:39.010
How might Delta act on that to change your experience

427
27:39.127 --> 27:42.000
and meet you where you are on your journey

428
27:42.000 --> 27:44.910
and actually make you feel understood?

429
27:44.910 --> 27:48.429
In some ways, we're already doing this and Delta's a leader,

430
27:48.429 --> 27:50.010
but what if we were to build in,

431
27:50.010 --> 27:52.665
as you were describing, Jeanie, from the ground up,

432
27:52.665 --> 27:56.160
what if you could let Delta know yourself,

433
27:56.160 --> 28:00.632
how you're feeling, how you actually want to be cared for?

434
28:00.632 --> 28:04.500
This is the opportunity that we're unlocking together

435
28:04.500 --> 28:07.502
through AI and it's the years ahead

436
28:07.502 --> 28:09.690
that we're looking forward to,

437
28:09.690 --> 28:13.242
because that is what's making every single interaction

438
28:13.242 --> 28:16.170
feel personal.

439
28:16.170 --> 28:18.840
And Jeanie, I know you've seen the impact of this already.

440
28:18.840 --> 28:20.216
<v ->Yeah.</v>

441
28:20.216 --> 28:22.950
Last Friday, I was flying my trip Atlanta to Honolulu

442
28:22.950 --> 28:26.310
and there were two customers who crossed over on that flight

443
28:26.310 --> 28:27.420
to their millionth mile

444
28:27.420 --> 28:29.340
and we had a great time celebrating them,

445
28:29.340 --> 28:30.630
a honeymoon couple.

446
28:30.630 --> 28:31.920
Then we had another couple

447
28:31.920 --> 28:33.810
celebrating their 50th anniversary

448
28:33.810 --> 28:36.330
and they brought their whole family on that flight

449
28:36.330 --> 28:39.150
and that was wonderful to celebrate 'em.

450
28:39.150 --> 28:40.140
In the future,

451
28:40.140 --> 28:43.560
that connectivity between customer and employee tools

452
28:43.560 --> 28:46.200
will help us proactively understand

453
28:46.200 --> 28:49.564
how to create those moments of magic or moments of care

454
28:49.564 --> 28:52.230
from the very start of their journey.

455
28:52.230 --> 28:53.940
It's powerful to think about

456
28:53.940 --> 28:57.893
and we think it's gonna transform the travel experience

457
28:57.893 --> 29:02.370
as we move forward with human connection at the center.

458
29:02.370 --> 29:04.203
<v ->Ryan and Jeanie are so right</v>

459
29:04.203 --> 29:07.589
and we have an amazing opportunity to use data

460
29:07.589 --> 29:10.890
and new technologies powered by AI

461
29:10.890 --> 29:14.691
to preserve these moments, not disrupt them.

462
29:14.691 --> 29:17.190
It's a reinforcement of Delta's commitment

463
29:17.190 --> 29:20.550
to putting our customers at the center of our business.

464
29:20.550 --> 29:22.920
Ryan and Jeanie, thank you for what you're doing.

465
29:22.920 --> 29:24.810
Appreciate you being here with us today.

466
29:24.810 --> 29:26.160
<v ->Thanks, Ed.</v>
<v ->Thank you.</v>

467
29:27.302 --> 29:32.302
(uplifting music)
(audience applauds)

468
29:44.070 --> 29:47.520
<v ->What feedback has also shown us is more than anything</v>

469
29:47.520 --> 29:50.160
is how much you value your time

470
29:50.160 --> 29:53.689
and specifically being on time.

471
29:53.689 --> 29:55.352
For any given flight,

472
29:55.352 --> 29:58.230
a series of carefully curated steps

473
29:58.230 --> 30:00.487
must go exactly according to plan,

474
30:00.487 --> 30:03.294
from inbound planes and crews and bags

475
30:03.294 --> 30:07.560
to catering, connecting passengers, predicting the weather,

476
30:07.560 --> 30:09.690
and everything in between.

477
30:09.690 --> 30:13.320
At Delta, those steps happen over 5,000 times

478
30:13.320 --> 30:14.500
each and every day.

479
30:14.500 --> 30:18.792
But the center of all that is you, the Delta customer.

480
30:18.792 --> 30:22.944
So how do we preserve that promise of reliability

481
30:22.944 --> 30:27.510
and give you more control over your journey?

482
30:27.510 --> 30:31.710
How do you create space for more meaningful connections?

483
30:31.710 --> 30:34.170
Well, it starts with thinking differently

484
30:34.170 --> 30:38.040
about how we blend the digital and physical experiences,

485
30:38.040 --> 30:40.894
beginning with the Fly Delta app.

486
30:40.894 --> 30:44.970
We know our customers count on the Fly Delta app

487
30:44.970 --> 30:47.820
from home to airport and beyond.

488
30:47.820 --> 30:49.542
In fact, in 2024,

489
30:49.542 --> 30:54.510
we saw roughly 1.3 billion interactions in the app.

490
30:54.510 --> 30:55.563
It's amazing number.

491
30:56.430 --> 31:00.717
More than 97% of SkyMiles Medallion members use their app

492
31:00.717 --> 31:04.586
as the go-to companion during travel.

493
31:04.586 --> 31:08.463
And in 2025, we intend to make that even better

494
31:08.463 --> 31:11.010
with an industry-leading experience

495
31:11.010 --> 31:15.690
that we're calling, stay for it, Delta Concierge.

496
31:15.690 --> 31:17.778
That's an announcement. Okay?

497
31:17.778 --> 31:19.133
(audience cheers and applauds)
Delta Concierge.

498
31:20.760 --> 31:24.080
Delta Concierge will serve as a thread

499
31:24.080 --> 31:26.316
across your experience,

500
31:26.316 --> 31:29.735
a Gen AI-powered personal assistant

501
31:29.735 --> 31:34.500
that anticipates your needs, provides real-time guidance,

502
31:34.500 --> 31:37.371
and delivers tailored recommendations,

503
31:37.371 --> 31:40.288
combining the context of who you are

504
31:40.288 --> 31:44.400
and how you travel with the deep knowledge and insights

505
31:44.400 --> 31:46.200
that we've already built

506
31:46.200 --> 31:48.480
as the world's most reliable airline.

507
31:48.480 --> 31:52.050
Soon, elements of Delta Concierge will be available

508
31:52.050 --> 31:54.780
across all our digital and onboard channels

509
31:54.780 --> 31:57.900
and in the hands of our reservation agents,

510
31:57.900 --> 32:01.680
making their ability to assist you even better.

511
32:01.680 --> 32:05.850
Let's take a closer look at how we envision Delta Concierge

512
32:05.850 --> 32:07.983
connecting your day of travel.

513
32:09.120 --> 32:11.689
In a few moments, we'll meet Eve.

514
32:11.689 --> 32:15.111
Eve is a few years into the future,

515
32:15.111 --> 32:18.420
preparing for a business trip to Tokyo.

516
32:18.420 --> 32:23.250
As she prepares for her trip, Delta is preparing for her.

517
32:23.250 --> 32:24.990
Through AI and the Delta team,

518
32:24.990 --> 32:27.600
we are anticipating her every need

519
32:27.600 --> 32:30.900
to ensure her day of travel is not only seamless,

520
32:30.900 --> 32:34.803
but also reaps the benefits of her SkyMiles membership.

521
32:38.310 --> 32:40.319
<v Concierge>Good morning, Eve.</v>

522
32:40.319 --> 32:41.490
We look forward to welcoming you aboard your flight today.

523
32:41.490 --> 32:42.323
<v ->Great.</v>

524
32:45.023 --> 32:46.230
I'll be ready to leave soon.

525
32:46.230 --> 32:47.790
<v Concierge>Traffic to the airport is heavy.</v>

526
32:47.790 --> 32:49.710
Time by car is 90 minutes.

527
32:49.710 --> 32:51.960
Would you like to request a Joby flight?

528
32:51.960 --> 32:53.790
Journey time is 10 minutes.

529
32:53.790 --> 32:57.420
<v ->Oh, yes, please. Let's grab a Joby.</v>

530
32:57.420 --> 32:58.870
<v Concierge>Joby confirmed.</v>

531
32:59.797 --> 33:02.880
(electronic beeping)

532
33:08.005 --> 33:09.344
(audience applauds)

533
33:09.344 --> 33:13.470
<v ->Delta Concierge uses Gen AI and voice processing</v>

534
33:13.470 --> 33:17.910
to listen, understand, and then respond intelligently

535
33:17.910 --> 33:21.326
to our customers' unique needs in real time.

536
33:21.326 --> 33:24.150
Delta Concierge helped ensure that Eve's journey

537
33:24.150 --> 33:26.364
to the airport was free of any stress.

538
33:26.364 --> 33:29.980
It checked to make sure her passport is current

539
33:29.980 --> 33:34.050
and whether she requires any additional travel documents.

540
33:34.050 --> 33:37.410
It can even book end-to-end travel on her behalf

541
33:37.410 --> 33:39.851
using only her voice.

542
33:39.851 --> 33:44.204
Now, as we saw, Eve is running tight on time,

543
33:44.204 --> 33:48.330
so taking a car is not gonna be an option.

544
33:48.330 --> 33:49.380
Guess what?

545
33:49.380 --> 33:53.100
Delta Concierge is already working on an alternate solution,

546
33:53.100 --> 33:56.670
a Joby, a new breed of electric vehicle

547
33:56.670 --> 33:59.220
vertical takeoff and landing aircraft,

548
33:59.220 --> 34:01.030
which can get her to the airport

549
34:02.701 --> 34:03.990
in a short fraction of the time.

550
34:03.990 --> 34:06.963
Pretty cool, huh? I wish we had that in New York today.

551
34:08.070 --> 34:11.880
All Eve needs to do is to ask Delta Concierge

552
34:11.880 --> 34:14.610
to confirm the Joby and off she goes.

553
34:25.244 --> 34:28.077
(plane whooshing)

554
34:35.130 --> 34:37.963
(uplifting music)

555
35:42.002 --> 35:44.910
(audience applauds)

556
35:44.910 --> 35:46.320
That's incredible.

557
35:46.320 --> 35:48.510
Gary Shapiro, I think we need to get some

558
35:48.510 --> 35:51.570
at the next CES in Vegas to be able to get us around

559
35:51.570 --> 35:53.820
the mean streets of Las Vegas a lot easier.

560
35:53.820 --> 35:54.970
Next year's conference.

561
35:56.880 --> 35:58.860
Joby is going to transform

562
35:58.860 --> 36:02.044
how we move through the travel experience,

563
36:02.044 --> 36:05.070
and it's not a distant future that we're talking about.

564
36:05.070 --> 36:08.760
We expect Joby to be flying in the next couple of years,

565
36:08.760 --> 36:12.960
beginning with our service to Los Angeles and New York City.

566
36:12.960 --> 36:16.710
And we're happy that the executive chairman of Joby,

567
36:16.710 --> 36:19.890
Paul Sciarra, is with us here today.

568
36:19.890 --> 36:23.970
Hey, Paul. Good to see you.
(audience applauds)

569
36:23.970 --> 36:25.770
Thank you for being here.

570
36:25.770 --> 36:29.850
Appreciate all you're doing at Joby. But back to Eve.

571
36:29.850 --> 36:33.360
She's now arrived at the airport and Delta Concierge

572
36:33.360 --> 36:36.330
has been preparing her travel in advance.

573
36:36.330 --> 36:38.493
So the next steps are simple.

574
36:41.190 --> 36:43.740
<v Narrator>Having dodged the traffic with a Joby,</v>

575
36:43.740 --> 36:45.393
Eve heads straight to bag drop.

576
36:46.470 --> 36:47.970
Using AR wayfinding,

577
36:47.970 --> 36:51.650
Delta Concierge shows her exactly where she needs to go,

578
36:51.650 --> 36:54.990
and Eve won't need to worry about her bag.

579
36:54.990 --> 36:56.880
A permanent digital bag tag means

580
36:56.880 --> 36:58.923
she can track her luggage in real time.

581
37:00.630 --> 37:02.670
Delta Concierge will let Eve know

582
37:02.670 --> 37:04.800
which gate she's flying from.

583
37:04.800 --> 37:08.160
And by using biometrics and connected digital tools,

584
37:08.160 --> 37:11.130
fumbling for documents will become a thing of the past,

585
37:11.130 --> 37:13.350
meaning Eve can breeze through security

586
37:13.350 --> 37:14.750
without breaking her stride.

587
37:19.680 --> 37:22.470
A seamless airport experience means more time for Eve

588
37:22.470 --> 37:25.560
to connect with loved ones before boarding her flight.

589
37:25.560 --> 37:28.641
<v ->Hey, sweetie.</v>
<v ->Hi, Mommy.</v>

590
37:28.641 --> 37:30.290
<v ->How are you?</v>
<v ->I'm good.</v>

591
37:30.290 --> 37:32.341
Are you at the airport already?

592
37:32.341 --> 37:34.230
<v ->I'm at the airport now.</v>
<v ->When are you coming back?</v>

593
37:34.230 --> 37:36.480
<v ->I'll see you when I come back this weekend. Okay?</v>

594
37:36.480 --> 37:39.710
<v ->Okay, I love you. Bye.</v>
<v ->Bye.</v>

595
37:39.710 --> 37:42.793
(electronic beeping)

596
37:52.050 --> 37:53.870
<v Captain>Good morning.</v>

597
37:53.870 --> 37:55.590
This is Captain Nelson in the flight deck.

598
37:55.590 --> 37:56.940
From all of us in the Delta family,

599
37:56.940 --> 37:58.853
it's our pleasure to have you on board.

600
38:08.370 --> 38:11.444
(audience applauds)

601
38:11.444 --> 38:13.890
<v ->Well, we just saw how Delta Concierge</v>

602
38:13.890 --> 38:16.980
made Eve's airport experience pressure-free

603
38:16.980 --> 38:21.810
by taking away the need for her to keep an eye on her clock,

604
38:21.810 --> 38:25.380
but that commitment to an effortless travel experience

605
38:25.380 --> 38:28.530
doesn't just stop at her departure airport.

606
38:28.530 --> 38:32.070
If Eve has to take a connecting flight on her journey

607
38:32.070 --> 38:33.660
to her destination,

608
38:33.660 --> 38:38.190
Delta's AI-driven technology is ready to help.

609
38:38.190 --> 38:42.180
Our systems analyze real-time arrival and departure data

610
38:42.180 --> 38:45.720
to assign gates that bring customers even closer

611
38:45.720 --> 38:47.640
to their connecting flights

612
38:47.640 --> 38:50.430
that dramatically reduces the time you need

613
38:50.430 --> 38:51.663
between connections.

614
38:52.530 --> 38:55.860
Throughout her journey, Delta is using technology

615
38:55.860 --> 39:00.060
to give Eve her time back, creating moments of connection

616
39:00.060 --> 39:02.910
and delivering safe, secure travel

617
39:02.910 --> 39:04.833
that protects her wellbeing.

618
39:05.730 --> 39:09.990
It also enables us to personalize Eve's in-fight journey

619
39:09.990 --> 39:14.073
with our best-in-class seatback screens and Delta Sync.

620
39:17.430 --> 39:19.170
<v Narrator>Thank you for flying Delta.</v>

621
39:19.170 --> 39:22.440
Log in with SkyMiles to your personalized onboard experience

622
39:22.440 --> 39:25.500
via Delta Sync seatback from the moment you sit down

623
39:25.500 --> 39:27.510
and enjoy everything from trip planning

624
39:27.510 --> 39:30.120
to curated content at your fingertips.

625
39:30.120 --> 39:33.200
To get started, real-time live translation will ensure

626
39:33.200 --> 39:36.000
we're always speaking your language.

627
39:36.000 --> 39:38.220
Tap into our onboard experience planner

628
39:38.220 --> 39:39.900
to check out new wellness tools

629
39:39.900 --> 39:42.600
and customize your food and beverage experience.

630
39:42.600 --> 39:46.200
Then explore your recommendations from Delta Concierge

631
39:46.200 --> 39:48.060
to take the hassle out of planning

632
39:48.060 --> 39:51.090
and enjoy your destination as soon as you land.

633
39:51.090 --> 39:53.220
When it's almost time to touch down,

634
39:53.220 --> 39:56.970
arrival mode makes the moments after landing a breeze.

635
39:56.970 --> 39:58.860
Get directions through the airport

636
39:58.860 --> 40:02.010
and make sure your rideshare is ready when you are.

637
40:02.010 --> 40:07.010
Now sit back, relax, and thank you again for choosing Delta.

638
40:09.306 --> 40:12.060
(audience applauds)

639
40:12.060 --> 40:17.060
<v ->Since we announced fast free wifi on Delta two years ago,</v>

640
40:17.370 --> 40:19.770
millions of customers have signed on

641
40:19.770 --> 40:24.030
to become SkyMiles members and access this great benefit,

642
40:24.030 --> 40:26.250
which we expect will be completely rolled out

643
40:26.250 --> 40:28.563
through our entire global system this year,

644
40:29.430 --> 40:34.430
and millions more access Delta Sync on our seatback screens.

645
40:34.680 --> 40:39.680
We have over 165,000 screens flying each and every day.

646
40:41.160 --> 40:43.110
That's a heck of a movie change,

647
40:43.110 --> 40:45.390
far more than any other airline,

648
40:45.390 --> 40:47.220
providing endless opportunities

649
40:47.220 --> 40:50.370
to give our customers new content.

650
40:50.370 --> 40:52.530
Whether through Delta Sync wifi

651
40:52.530 --> 40:55.380
or our industry-leading seatback screens,

652
40:55.380 --> 40:58.440
we pride ourselves on giving customers content

653
40:58.440 --> 41:01.806
that feels personal and meets you where you are.

654
41:01.806 --> 41:04.170
And that's why we're announcing today

655
41:04.170 --> 41:07.440
an exclusive partnership with a company

656
41:07.440 --> 41:10.740
that knows content better than anyone else.

657
41:10.740 --> 41:12.273
You guessed, YouTube.

658
41:13.383 --> 41:14.693
(audience cheers and applauds)
Yes.

659
41:17.040 --> 41:21.240
Beginning this year, YouTube will be the newest partner

660
41:21.240 --> 41:24.330
to join Delta Sync exclusively.

661
41:24.330 --> 41:26.670
Joining me to tell us more,

662
41:26.670 --> 41:30.120
please welcome YouTube's Chief Business Officer,

663
41:30.120 --> 41:30.953
Mary Ellen Coe.

664
41:33.570 --> 41:38.570
(uplifting music)
(audience applauds)

665
41:43.310 --> 41:46.477
<v ->Thank you so much for being with us.</v>

666
41:49.170 --> 41:51.090
Well, Mary Ellen, we are so thrilled

667
41:51.090 --> 41:53.700
to kick off our partnership with YouTube

668
41:53.700 --> 41:56.730
beginning this year on Delta Sync.

669
41:56.730 --> 41:58.467
Can you share with the audience

670
41:58.467 --> 42:00.330
something about our partnership?

671
42:00.330 --> 42:01.742
<v ->Yeah.</v>

672
42:01.742 --> 42:03.150
Well, Ed, we are so thrilled

673
42:03.150 --> 42:05.190
to be working with you and the team

674
42:05.190 --> 42:08.280
and we know Delta is first in class

675
42:08.280 --> 42:10.790
in how you prioritize your customers,

676
42:10.790 --> 42:12.630
and that is so consistent

677
42:12.630 --> 42:14.610
with how we think about our creators.

678
42:14.610 --> 42:17.190
They're at the center of everything we do.

679
42:17.190 --> 42:20.381
So what a great way to bring our missions together

680
42:20.381 --> 42:25.124
to be able to bring your customers, Delta's customers,

681
42:25.124 --> 42:29.710
the fantastic creator and content experience of YouTube.

682
42:29.710 --> 42:33.784
Creators are producing the must-see TV of today

683
42:33.784 --> 42:36.390
and viewers no longer distinguish

684
42:36.390 --> 42:38.940
between content from traditional studios

685
42:38.940 --> 42:41.010
and creator-led content.

686
42:41.010 --> 42:43.170
They turn to YouTube for all of it,

687
42:43.170 --> 42:46.569
whether it's episodic series, sports highlights,

688
42:46.569 --> 42:50.880
podcasts, music performances.

689
42:50.880 --> 42:53.640
And since the very first upload,

690
42:53.640 --> 42:56.730
YouTube has opened up whole new ways for viewers

691
42:56.730 --> 43:01.730
to get access to that content, any screen, anywhere,

692
43:02.400 --> 43:05.250
and now even when you're in the air on a plane.

693
43:05.250 --> 43:06.750
<v ->That's awesome.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

694
43:06.750 --> 43:09.810
So that's why we're so excited to partner with Delta

695
43:09.810 --> 43:13.920
to bring YouTube's fantastic creators and content

696
43:13.920 --> 43:18.920
in a highly curated way, unique and only for Delta's

697
43:19.080 --> 43:21.243
in-flight entertainment ecosystem.

698
43:22.320 --> 43:25.380
Through our partnership, Delta customers will be able

699
43:25.380 --> 43:30.380
to enjoy our favorite creators, podcasts, music,

700
43:30.390 --> 43:34.290
a wide variety of music artists, and all of this ads-free.

701
43:34.290 --> 43:35.940
<v Ed>Ad-free, that's great. You heard that.</v>

702
43:35.940 --> 43:39.661
<v ->Ads-free.
(audience cheers)</v>

703
43:39.661 --> 43:42.664
And that's all on personal devices

704
43:42.664 --> 43:46.164
or on Delta seatback experience.

705
43:46.164 --> 43:50.288
Even better, and this is the really exciting part,

706
43:50.288 --> 43:54.390
we will be providing all Delta customers a free trial

707
43:54.390 --> 43:56.400
of YouTube Music and Premium

708
43:56.400 --> 43:58.320
that you can use even beyond travel.

709
43:58.320 --> 43:59.420
<v ->Wow, that's awesome.</v>

710
44:00.540 --> 44:03.840
(audience applauds)
Thank you, Mary Ellen.

711
44:03.840 --> 44:06.840
Access to entertainment is really key

712
44:06.840 --> 44:09.810
to having an enjoyable travel experience.

713
44:09.810 --> 44:12.510
What role have you seen YouTube play

714
44:12.510 --> 44:14.880
in the travel experiences to date?

715
44:14.880 --> 44:16.330
<v ->Yeah.</v>

716
44:16.330 --> 44:18.390
Well, personally, I really love catching up

717
44:18.390 --> 44:21.930
on my favorite content or podcasts when I'm traveling

718
44:21.930 --> 44:25.230
and I travel a lot and I know that I'm not unique.

719
44:25.230 --> 44:29.400
So our creators provide just a fantastic viewing experience

720
44:29.400 --> 44:33.840
and they take viewers along the road and along for the ride

721
44:33.840 --> 44:35.250
and behind the scenes.

722
44:35.250 --> 44:38.940
So just as an example, the Paris Olympics.

723
44:38.940 --> 44:42.060
So we sent creators to the Paris Olympics.

724
44:42.060 --> 44:45.210
Their fans loved to watch some of the games

725
44:45.210 --> 44:48.044
and the events through their favorite creators,

726
44:48.044 --> 44:50.880
but they also traveled all around Paris.

727
44:50.880 --> 44:54.000
They unlocked new restaurants, underground restaurants,

728
44:54.000 --> 44:58.860
new cafes, found all new ways to travel and tour the city.

729
44:58.860 --> 45:01.080
So this is just a simple example.

730
45:01.080 --> 45:03.780
We used to pick up books to travel, right?

731
45:03.780 --> 45:05.430
And to get recommendations.

732
45:05.430 --> 45:07.080
Now people experience that

733
45:07.080 --> 45:08.910
through their favorite YouTube creator.

734
45:08.910 --> 45:09.990
<v ->That's so cool.</v>

735
45:09.990 --> 45:11.610
Okay, one more for the audience

736
45:11.610 --> 45:14.790
and I'm sure all of our folks are here dying to know.

737
45:14.790 --> 45:19.170
What is your go-to in-flight entertainment pick?

738
45:19.170 --> 45:21.180
<v ->I don't think you're asking about email.</v>

739
45:21.180 --> 45:22.650
<v ->I'm not asking about email.</v>
<v ->No. All right.</v>

740
45:22.650 --> 45:24.210
Okay. I have a hot tip.

741
45:24.210 --> 45:26.160
Sean Evans, Hot Ones.
<v ->Sean Evans.</v>

742
45:26.160 --> 45:30.240
<v ->Fantastic interviews. That's the hot tip of the night.</v>

743
45:30.240 --> 45:31.961
<v ->Good. Well, that's awesome.</v>

744
45:31.961 --> 45:34.560
And I want to thank Mary Ellen for being with us tonight.

745
45:34.560 --> 45:37.590
YouTube coming exclusively to Delta this year.

746
45:37.590 --> 45:39.420
I could not think of a better way

747
45:39.420 --> 45:41.730
to pass through an enjoyable trip.

748
45:41.730 --> 45:43.110
Thank you, Mary Ellen.
<v ->So excited.</v>

749
45:43.110 --> 45:44.260
<v ->Thank you.</v>
<v ->Thanks.</v>

750
45:45.411 --> 45:50.411
(audience applauds)
(uplifting music)

751
46:01.350 --> 46:04.230
<v ->Now, it's not enough to ensure that customers enjoy</v>

752
46:04.230 --> 46:07.440
a personalized and seamless travel experience.

753
46:07.440 --> 46:08.670
We also are exploring

754
46:08.670 --> 46:13.050
how new partnerships can support customers' wellbeing too.

755
46:13.050 --> 46:18.050
For example, Fount's FlyKitt is a complete jet lag solution

756
46:18.480 --> 46:21.315
designed to help travelers adjust to new time zones

757
46:21.315 --> 46:24.270
and feel refreshed upon arrival.

758
46:24.270 --> 46:26.970
I'm sure some of our international guests here tonight

759
46:26.970 --> 46:28.800
could be using some of that.

760
46:28.800 --> 46:32.190
We'll be partnering with Fount later this year

761
46:32.190 --> 46:35.205
to provide FlyKitts to our customers.

762
46:35.205 --> 46:37.260
We're also working with SkyView's

763
46:37.260 --> 46:41.696
circadian light technology, which aligns cabin lighting

764
46:41.696 --> 46:44.040
with passengers' natural rhythms

765
46:44.040 --> 46:47.613
to reduce jet lag during and after the flight.

766
46:49.920 --> 46:54.920
And in 2025, we are launching a brand new series

767
46:55.579 --> 46:59.117
exclusively available on Delta onboard

768
46:59.117 --> 47:01.590
called "Well Traveled."

769
47:01.590 --> 47:05.266
And it's designed to show you how to integrate wellness

770
47:05.266 --> 47:07.968
into every flight you take.

771
47:07.968 --> 47:11.857
Its host is someone who was charged with the responsibility

772
47:11.857 --> 47:15.210
of performing at the top of his game

773
47:15.210 --> 47:16.740
immediately after traveling,

774
47:16.740 --> 47:19.680
no matter how far he had just flown.

775
47:19.680 --> 47:21.780
Our host is with us here tonight

776
47:21.780 --> 47:24.960
to give us a glimpse of what he's got in store.

777
47:24.960 --> 47:28.080
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage

778
47:28.080 --> 47:30.993
seven-time Super Bowl winner, Tom Brady.

779
47:31.835 --> 47:36.835
(uplifting music)
(audience applauds)

780
47:49.278 --> 47:51.600
Tom, it's so great to be here,

781
47:51.600 --> 47:55.035
especially since this is now one of your new towns

782
47:55.035 --> 47:59.190
as one of the newest owners of the Las Vegas Raiders.

783
47:59.190 --> 48:00.450
<v ->Thanks, Ed. I appreciate it.</v>

784
48:00.450 --> 48:01.803
Thank you guys so much.

785
48:02.869 --> 48:04.840
(audience cheers and applauds)

786
48:04.840 --> 48:07.033
<v ->And do we have any Raiders fans tonight?</v>

787
48:07.033 --> 48:10.197
<v ->How many Raider fans have we got in here?</v>

788
48:10.197 --> 48:12.147
(audience cheers)
<v ->Okay, we got some.</v>

789
48:13.809 --> 48:18.720
Now, as many of you know, Tom has finishing his first year

790
48:18.720 --> 48:20.820
as an NFL announcer.

791
48:20.820 --> 48:23.040
And by the way, I think you're doing an awesome job.

792
48:23.040 --> 48:23.873
<v ->Thank you.</v>

793
48:23.873 --> 48:25.770
<v ->I'm biased, but I do believe that.</v>

794
48:25.770 --> 48:29.503
Now, how many miles a season would you say you fly?

795
48:29.503 --> 48:33.023
<v ->A lot. I used to fly about half the time.</v>

796
48:33.023 --> 48:35.700
So many of the games we had when I was playing,

797
48:35.700 --> 48:37.330
they were home games.

798
48:37.330 --> 48:38.778
But now as a broadcaster,

799
48:38.778 --> 48:40.410
I'm basically on the road every single weekend,

800
48:40.410 --> 48:41.700
which is really fun,

801
48:41.700 --> 48:43.860
except when I go to some of these tough road environments

802
48:43.860 --> 48:46.200
that heckle me every week.

803
48:46.200 --> 48:47.460
But that's not that important right now.

804
48:47.460 --> 48:49.590
Sorry for getting off topic.
<v ->That's okay.</v>

805
48:49.590 --> 48:53.421
But you still manage to look so fresh. What's the secret?

806
48:53.421 --> 48:55.917
<v ->I can't give you all the secrets.</v>

807
48:55.917 --> 49:00.420
For that, you're gonna have to tune into "Well Traveled,"

808
49:00.420 --> 49:03.960
my new travel show coming to Delta in 2025.

809
49:03.960 --> 49:06.780
But I can give you my top three travel hacks.

810
49:06.780 --> 49:07.710
You guys wanna hear those?

811
49:07.710 --> 49:10.200
<v ->You're gonna give 'em to us? Okay, let's go.</v>

812
49:10.200 --> 49:11.791
What's first?

813
49:11.791 --> 49:13.200
<v ->All right, first up, hydration.</v>

814
49:13.200 --> 49:15.960
I always make sure to have my electrolyte hydration packs

815
49:15.960 --> 49:19.822
on hand and I'm well hydrated when I'm on the plane always.

816
49:19.822 --> 49:22.440
I even bring my own water canteen.

817
49:22.440 --> 49:23.910
You know that. You played a lot of golf with me.

818
49:23.910 --> 49:25.620
I kind of tote it around.

819
49:25.620 --> 49:27.227
It's never too far from when I need it

820
49:27.227 --> 49:30.330
and it always helps me stay fresh.

821
49:30.330 --> 49:31.830
It helps me stay energized

822
49:31.830 --> 49:34.470
and as soon as I land, I'm ready to take on the day,

823
49:34.470 --> 49:37.380
whether it's meetings, very cool events like this,

824
49:37.380 --> 49:39.600
or even prepping for Sunday's game.

825
49:39.600 --> 49:40.433
<v ->Okay, then.</v>

826
49:40.433 --> 49:41.560
That's just one. What's next?

827
49:42.666 --> 49:44.940
So next up, taking care of your physical health,

828
49:44.940 --> 49:47.790
because my routine, it was always so important to me

829
49:47.790 --> 49:49.975
and working out every day was crucial.

830
49:49.975 --> 49:53.340
And even as I spent all my career on the field and training

831
49:53.340 --> 49:55.500
and competing at the highest level was so important.

832
49:55.500 --> 49:58.777
So working out, it's always been a great part of my life

833
49:58.777 --> 50:01.110
and it really could be anything for us now.

834
50:01.110 --> 50:02.460
I'm certainly retired.

835
50:02.460 --> 50:04.230
I don't have to work out quite as hard as I used to.

836
50:04.230 --> 50:08.190
But hiking, swimming, biking, just even a simple walk.

837
50:08.190 --> 50:10.223
And I try to do those things in the morning

838
50:10.223 --> 50:13.290
when I have the most energy before the kids wake up.

839
50:13.290 --> 50:16.027
So today I woke up pretty early. I knew I was coming here.

840
50:16.027 --> 50:18.420
I got a little bit of weight training in

841
50:18.420 --> 50:19.810
because I truly believe this.

842
50:19.810 --> 50:22.830
Just like our brains, our bodies are the same way.

843
50:22.830 --> 50:26.640
If you don't use it, you lose it. So get up and get moving.

844
50:26.640 --> 50:28.754
<v ->Okay, what's number three?</v>

845
50:28.754 --> 50:32.670
<v ->So number three, I saved the best for last.</v>

846
50:32.670 --> 50:35.580
So if it's okay, maybe, just maybe,

847
50:35.580 --> 50:37.500
let's keep this one between you and me.

848
50:37.500 --> 50:38.879
<v ->I think we can.</v>

849
50:38.879 --> 50:40.383
<v ->And the 10,000 other people here.</v>

850
50:40.383 --> 50:43.018
<v ->All right. Everybody good with that?</v>

851
50:43.018 --> 50:44.610
(audience cheers)

852
50:44.610 --> 50:45.918
<v ->Awesome.</v>

853
50:45.918 --> 50:48.180
So number three, I try to use all the time

854
50:48.180 --> 50:50.040
that I have on the planes in traveling

855
50:50.040 --> 50:51.660
to stay very productive.

856
50:51.660 --> 50:53.884
I love being productive on long flights

857
50:53.884 --> 50:55.494
'cause it's actually time

858
50:55.494 --> 50:57.753
where I can just lock in and focus.

859
50:57.753 --> 50:59.940
I don't have people chirping at me all the time.

860
50:59.940 --> 51:01.500
I can get the job done.

861
51:01.500 --> 51:04.410
And I like to use that time to read up on all my notes

862
51:04.410 --> 51:06.368
to be prepared for my meetings and events.

863
51:06.368 --> 51:09.640
I even use the time to study game film as a broadcaster

864
51:09.640 --> 51:12.293
of the different teams that I'm covering.

865
51:12.293 --> 51:14.550
I did that when I was a player too.

866
51:14.550 --> 51:16.793
So travel time is a little bit of rest,

867
51:16.793 --> 51:19.681
but it's a lot of time studying.

868
51:19.681 --> 51:22.857
Preparation's always been so important to me

869
51:22.857 --> 51:25.317
and in order to feel confident in whatever I'm doing,

870
51:25.317 --> 51:27.983
it's always about preparing

871
51:27.983 --> 51:30.930
in order to get the results that I want.

872
51:30.930 --> 51:32.160
<v ->Well, Tom, that's amazing.</v>

873
51:32.160 --> 51:34.219
It's no wonder you look so great.

874
51:34.219 --> 51:36.900
Now I want to ask everyone,

875
51:36.900 --> 51:39.087
you ready to watch "Well Traveled?"

876
51:40.201 --> 51:41.034
(audience cheers)

877
51:41.034 --> 51:42.720
Okay. This is just a little preview.

878
51:42.720 --> 51:44.400
We didn't give away all the good stuff.

879
51:44.400 --> 51:48.475
But coming on Delta Sync and the seatback screens this year,

880
51:48.475 --> 51:51.360
you'll be able to see Tom and "Well Traveled"

881
51:51.360 --> 51:52.710
and enjoy those experiences.

882
51:52.710 --> 51:54.270
Tom, thank you for coming out today.

883
51:54.270 --> 51:56.382
<v ->Thank you, Ed.</v>
<v ->Appreciate it, brother.</v>

884
51:56.382 --> 51:57.976
<v ->Thank you. Great to meet with you guys.</v>

885
51:57.976 --> 52:00.503
<v ->Give it up for Tom Brady.</v>
<v ->Thank you. Thank you.</v>

886
52:00.503 --> 52:05.503
(uplifting music)
(audience applauds)

887
52:15.570 --> 52:18.810
<v ->Delta Sync, our partnership with YouTube,</v>

888
52:18.810 --> 52:21.263
and content like Tom's "Well Traveled"

889
52:21.263 --> 52:25.014
are all great examples of how anticipating your needs

890
52:25.014 --> 52:28.320
and serving you with exclusive experiences

891
52:28.320 --> 52:30.360
can elevate your journey.

892
52:30.360 --> 52:32.550
We expect many of the features shown today

893
52:32.550 --> 52:35.408
will be online on our planes this year,

894
52:35.408 --> 52:37.864
and we continue to find new partners

895
52:37.864 --> 52:40.680
to bring into our ecosystem.

896
52:40.680 --> 52:42.720
Well, since we're here in Las Vegas,

897
52:42.720 --> 52:45.480
the gaming capital of the world, it's only fitting

898
52:45.480 --> 52:48.570
to announce a collaboration with DraftKings,

899
52:48.570 --> 52:51.870
one of the world's leading online gaming platforms,

900
52:51.870 --> 52:54.180
for the Delta Sync experience.

901
52:54.180 --> 52:57.660
Jason Robins, DraftKings co-founder and CEO,

902
52:57.660 --> 52:59.195
is with us today.

903
52:59.195 --> 53:02.820
Is that you, Jason? Did I see you?

904
53:02.820 --> 53:04.530
Did I see you staring at your phone

905
53:04.530 --> 53:06.426
instead of watching the show?

906
53:06.426 --> 53:09.690
Jason, stop looking at your phone.

907
53:09.690 --> 53:12.543
Fantasy football season's over. Okay, it's over.

908
53:13.658 --> 53:16.155
We love you, Jason.

909
53:16.155 --> 53:19.440
From fantasy sports to online adventures,

910
53:19.440 --> 53:22.156
gaming has become a regular part of the daily lives

911
53:22.156 --> 53:24.630
of millions of our customers.

912
53:24.630 --> 53:26.730
And you shouldn't have to hit pause

913
53:26.730 --> 53:28.610
just because you're in the sky.

914
53:28.610 --> 53:30.450
Our partnership with DraftKings

915
53:30.450 --> 53:32.190
will build on the games portfolio

916
53:32.190 --> 53:35.190
that we already offer today via Delta Sync

917
53:35.190 --> 53:39.300
and our seatback screens, while using the deep expertise

918
53:39.300 --> 53:42.933
that Jason and his team have developed over the past decade.

919
53:42.933 --> 53:45.996
Now, let's check in with Eve

920
53:45.996 --> 53:48.720
to see how she's doing one more time

921
53:48.720 --> 53:51.843
to see what's in store for her upon arrival in Tokyo.

922
53:54.495 --> 53:55.454
(electronic beeping)

923
53:55.454 --> 53:57.480
<v Narrator>Because Delta Concierge</v>

924
53:57.480 --> 53:59.430
has been working on Eve's behalf,

925
53:59.430 --> 54:01.800
her rideshare already knows when she'll land.

926
54:01.800 --> 54:03.540
We'll have a car waiting to take her

927
54:03.540 --> 54:04.803
wherever she wants to go.

928
54:06.734 --> 54:09.817
(electronic beeping)

929
54:13.320 --> 54:16.740
<v ->Now let's talk more about that rideshare.</v>

930
54:16.740 --> 54:20.100
And to help me, I'd like to welcome to the stage

931
54:20.100 --> 54:23.310
someone that does not need an introduction with this crowd,

932
54:23.310 --> 54:26.490
the CEO of Uber, Dara Khosrowshahi.

933
54:26.490 --> 54:27.323
Dara.

934
54:28.165 --> 54:33.165
(uplifting music)
(audience applauds)

935
54:45.990 --> 54:48.240
Dara, thank you for joining us today.

936
54:48.240 --> 54:49.110
<v ->Thank you, Ed.</v>

937
54:49.110 --> 54:51.360
It is a privilege to be here with you

938
54:51.360 --> 54:53.084
to celebrate the history of Delta

939
54:53.084 --> 54:56.224
and to give us a glimpse of what's to come.

940
54:56.224 --> 54:59.700
And I'm thrilled that we're coming together

941
54:59.700 --> 55:01.722
to shape the future of travel.

942
55:01.722 --> 55:02.820
<v ->It's so true. It's so true.</v>

943
55:02.820 --> 55:04.590
And we could not be more thrilled

944
55:04.590 --> 55:06.570
that you could be with us tonight.

945
55:06.570 --> 55:08.220
And we're excited to be announcing

946
55:08.220 --> 55:10.784
a new exclusive partnership with Uber,

947
55:10.784 --> 55:14.314
the company that revolutionized how we go anywhere

948
55:14.314 --> 55:18.930
and get anything at the simple tap of a button.

949
55:18.930 --> 55:20.624
Okay, out of interest,

950
55:20.624 --> 55:24.240
how many people took an Uber to get here today?

951
55:24.240 --> 55:26.654
Show of hands. Okay.

952
55:26.654 --> 55:29.793
Keep your hand up if you also flew on Delta.

953
55:30.660 --> 55:33.630
Okay. Wow, we got more Delta people than Uber.

954
55:33.630 --> 55:35.205
You got work to do.

955
55:35.205 --> 55:36.690
(both laugh)

956
55:36.690 --> 55:39.000
<v ->I think you stacked the deck with the crowd.</v>

957
55:39.000 --> 55:40.440
<v ->Just a little bit. Just a little bit.</v>

958
55:40.440 --> 55:42.968
Well, you're gonna love what Dara has got to share.

959
55:42.968 --> 55:45.614
Tell 'em what Uber customers can expect

960
55:45.614 --> 55:47.820
from our new partnership together.

961
55:47.820 --> 55:48.750
<v ->Gladly.</v>

962
55:48.750 --> 55:51.360
So I'm incredibly excited to announce

963
55:51.360 --> 55:53.826
that Uber will be teaming up with Delta

964
55:53.826 --> 55:57.540
for a new exclusive partnership.

965
55:57.540 --> 55:58.830
So travel's a big deal for us.

966
55:58.830 --> 56:01.830
In fact, 50% of Uber bookings

967
56:01.830 --> 56:04.648
either begin or end at an airport.

968
56:04.648 --> 56:06.570
So that's why we're starting with something

969
56:06.570 --> 56:10.227
that we know is very important to Delta customers,

970
56:10.227 --> 56:13.170
and that's SkyMiles.
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

971
56:13.170 --> 56:15.510
<v ->So SkyMiles members will be able to earn miles</v>

972
56:15.510 --> 56:17.910
when they use Uber and Uber Eats.

973
56:17.910 --> 56:20.010
So for every Uber X ride

974
56:20.010 --> 56:21.810
that you take to the airport-
(audience cheers)

975
56:21.810 --> 56:22.890
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

976
56:22.890 --> 56:27.180
As well as premium and reserved rides, you will get miles

977
56:27.180 --> 56:28.560
and it doesn't stop there.

978
56:28.560 --> 56:31.770
You'll also earn miles for eligible restaurant

979
56:31.770 --> 56:35.178
and grocery deliveries that you order with Uber Eats.

980
56:35.178 --> 56:38.460
But we're also evolving our airport experience

981
56:38.460 --> 56:42.056
from providing easy step-by-step instructions

982
56:42.056 --> 56:44.404
right in the Uber app to guide you

983
56:44.404 --> 56:47.260
from the plane straight to your ride

984
56:47.260 --> 56:51.105
to improve pickup and drop-off experiences at Delta hubs

985
56:51.105 --> 56:53.284
and much, much more.

986
56:53.284 --> 56:56.565
We're super excited to be launching our collaboration

987
56:56.565 --> 56:58.560
just this coming spring.

988
56:58.560 --> 57:00.090
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->And in the meantime,</v>

989
57:00.090 --> 57:05.021
all of you sign up for the wait list at uber.com/delta.

990
57:05.021 --> 57:07.432
<v ->Sounds good, right? You guys got that?</v>

991
57:07.432 --> 57:09.660
(audience cheers and applauds)

992
57:09.660 --> 57:13.680
Dara, what excites me the most are the new opportunities

993
57:13.680 --> 57:15.840
that this partnership will create

994
57:15.840 --> 57:17.797
as we work together over time.

995
57:17.797 --> 57:21.090
As we start to better integrate the findings,

996
57:21.090 --> 57:22.620
the learnings of Delta and Uber,

997
57:22.620 --> 57:25.260
we're gonna be making the experience for our customers,

998
57:25.260 --> 57:28.320
these people, less stressful, easier to manage,

999
57:28.320 --> 57:30.930
and making sure that you, our customers,

1000
57:30.930 --> 57:33.870
are in control of every step of the way.

1001
57:33.870 --> 57:34.890
<v ->That's exactly right.</v>

1002
57:34.890 --> 57:39.890
And with our shared goals of always putting people first,

1003
57:40.020 --> 57:43.156
I think the possibilities are just absolutely endless.

1004
57:43.156 --> 57:46.918
Now, Ed, you've clearly been busy this afternoon,

1005
57:46.918 --> 57:49.993
this evening, so I hope you don't mind.

1006
57:49.993 --> 57:52.050
I took the liberty of ordering us

1007
57:52.050 --> 57:55.028
a little pick-me-up with Uber Eats.

1008
57:55.028 --> 57:56.314
<v ->Oh, you did?</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1009
57:56.314 --> 57:57.564
<v ->Wow. Awesome.</v>

1010
57:58.457 --> 58:03.457
(scooter buzzing)
(uplifting music)

1011
58:38.324 --> 58:40.587
<v ->Wow. This is so kind.</v>
<v ->Thank you. Thank you.</v>

1012
58:40.587 --> 58:41.666
Appreciate it.

1013
58:41.666 --> 58:42.944
<v ->Thank you. Thank you.</v>

1014
58:42.944 --> 58:44.340
<v ->I heard it's hazelnut with a little splash of cream.</v>

1015
58:44.340 --> 58:45.173
Did I get that right?

1016
58:45.173 --> 58:47.415
<v ->How'd you know? That's pretty cool.</v>

1017
58:47.415 --> 58:52.415
Smells great, doesn't it? Thank you for this, Dara.

1018
58:52.680 --> 58:54.990
Now, we're up here sipping coffee,

1019
58:54.990 --> 58:56.730
but it hardly seems fair

1020
58:56.730 --> 59:00.513
that we're the only ones enjoying a mid-keynote pick-me-up.

1021
59:00.513 --> 59:03.720
Have you got anything for these lovely people out there?

1022
59:03.720 --> 59:05.834
<v ->Well, of course I do.</v>

1023
59:05.834 --> 59:08.610
We're also thrilled to bring the joy of Uber Eats

1024
59:08.610 --> 59:10.230
to each of you today.

1025
59:10.230 --> 59:11.313
So, guys, come on in.

1026
59:12.864 --> 59:15.697
(uplifting music)

1027
59:45.720 --> 59:47.400
<v ->This is so cool.</v>

1028
59:47.400 --> 59:49.530
Thank you, Dara. This is really great.

1029
59:49.530 --> 59:52.405
And if you didn't get a chance to receive a gift card,

1030
59:52.405 --> 59:55.020
keep an eye out for the Uber Guides

1031
59:55.020 --> 59:56.430
as you exit the building.

1032
59:56.430 --> 59:58.800
Everyone please give it up for Dara.

1033
01:00:01.972 --> 01:00:05.389
(audience applauds)
Dara.

1034
01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:10.860
So as we saw with Eve,

1035
01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:15.210
data, Gen AI, and the ingenuity of the Delta people

1036
01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:19.530
are driving our ability to transform her journey.

1037
01:00:19.530 --> 01:00:23.490
At every step, new and connected experiences were unlocked

1038
01:00:23.490 --> 01:00:25.530
by her SkyMiles membership

1039
01:00:25.530 --> 01:00:29.410
before, during, and after her day of travel.

1040
01:00:29.410 --> 01:00:34.133
The idea of loyalty is changing and it has changed.

1041
01:00:34.133 --> 01:00:39.133
SkyMiles membership is the way to access new experiences

1042
01:00:39.253 --> 01:00:41.689
well beyond your day of travel.

1043
01:00:41.689 --> 01:00:43.793
It's at the center of our innovations

1044
01:00:43.793 --> 01:00:47.544
powering Delta Sync and the Fly Delta app.

1045
01:00:47.544 --> 01:00:51.150
Those of you who may use of our expedited badge pickup

1046
01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:53.010
this year when you landed in Vegas,

1047
01:00:53.010 --> 01:00:55.873
you know the power of SkyMiles membership.

1048
01:00:55.873 --> 01:00:58.470
And if there's anything that we've learned

1049
01:00:58.470 --> 01:01:02.413
over the past 100 years, it's that our mission isn't just

1050
01:01:02.413 --> 01:01:06.284
to move people around the world safely and comfortably.

1051
01:01:06.284 --> 01:01:10.433
No, it really is to harness the power of travel

1052
01:01:10.433 --> 01:01:12.690
to bring people together,

1053
01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:15.988
to connect communities across vast distances,

1054
01:01:15.988 --> 01:01:17.880
to create opportunities

1055
01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:20.640
that were unimaginable just a few years ago.

1056
01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:24.483
This mission is more important today than ever before.

1057
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:35.490
<v Viola>We see a future</v>

1058
01:01:35.490 --> 01:01:39.000
where human ingenuity and imagination

1059
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.793
simplify how we move through the world.

1060
01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:46.233
Human kindness ignites our endeavors.

1061
01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:50.100
As we travel effortlessly

1062
01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:55.100
to people, places, and cultures previously unknown,

1063
01:01:56.070 --> 01:02:01.070
differences melt away as we begin to understand

1064
01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:05.973
our shared humanity and what it means to live a life.

1065
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:21.130
<v ->Our planet is vast</v>

1066
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:25.020
and our opportunity to forge a better future

1067
01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:26.313
has never been greater.

1068
01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:29.220
But the amazing promise of technology

1069
01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:33.603
to bring us together has also at times driven us apart.

1070
01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:38.730
That's why what we do at Delta is so important.

1071
01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:41.880
Our purpose isn't just to transport people,

1072
01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:44.100
it's to bring them together.

1073
01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:46.290
When you come face to face with someone,

1074
01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:48.660
you discover what you have in common.

1075
01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:51.570
You start to bridge those gaps in understanding.

1076
01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:54.720
At Delta, we know better than anyone

1077
01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:58.320
that the power that travel holds to create opportunity

1078
01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:02.280
to power economies and dramatically change lives.

1079
01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:04.210
Just consider these facts.

1080
01:03:04.210 --> 01:03:09.210
People flew an estimated 5 billion times last year,

1081
01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:14.240
5 billion, and one-third of global trade by value

1082
01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:16.333
is sent by air,

1083
01:03:16.333 --> 01:03:21.333
and aviation generates 4% of the entire world's GDP.

1084
01:03:22.086 --> 01:03:24.480
It's no wonder that aviation supports

1085
01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:28.350
more than 86 million jobs globally.

1086
01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:30.648
And through innovation and technology,

1087
01:03:30.648 --> 01:03:34.380
we can connect developing nations to the world

1088
01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:36.000
as never before.

1089
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.540
But it won't work unless it's both accessible

1090
01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:41.853
and affordable for everyone.

1091
01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:46.020
Countless regions remain underserved

1092
01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:47.733
by commercial air capacity.

1093
01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:49.830
Get this.

1094
01:03:49.830 --> 01:03:52.560
It's estimated that just one in five

1095
01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:56.127
of the world's population has even experienced air travel.

1096
01:03:56.127 --> 01:03:58.263
Can you believe that? One in five.

1097
01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:02.730
Our first century of flight was largely focused

1098
01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:05.970
on uniting regions and continents.

1099
01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:08.943
I firmly believe the next century of flight

1100
01:04:08.943 --> 01:04:12.270
will be about uniting the world.

1101
01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:13.950
Imagine the benefits

1102
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:16.813
of conveniently connecting local farmers in Nigeria

1103
01:04:16.813 --> 01:04:19.073
to customers in Sweden

1104
01:04:19.073 --> 01:04:24.073
or students in Nepal to educational opportunities in Japan.

1105
01:04:25.006 --> 01:04:28.424
And so it's important to hear from those

1106
01:04:28.424 --> 01:04:32.493
who will be navigating that next century,

1107
01:04:32.493 --> 01:04:36.420
a group of people who have zero preconceptions

1108
01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:39.648
about how the next century of travel might look like,

1109
01:04:39.648 --> 01:04:42.853
a group of people who, in my experience,

1110
01:04:42.853 --> 01:04:44.823
tend to be our kids.

1111
01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:52.560
<v ->Welcome to Delta Airbus Innovation Lab.</v>

1112
01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.870
Today we are going to do a deep dive

1113
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:58.304
on all the exciting developments and innovations in aviation

1114
01:04:58.304 --> 01:05:02.580
that will shape how we travel over the next 100 years.

1115
01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:05.280
We got some really cool things that we're gonna discuss.

1116
01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.257
Like who here likes Roblox?

1117
01:05:07.257 --> 01:05:08.407
<v Kids>Me, me, me!</v>

1118
01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:10.760
<v ->Yes. This is great.</v>

1119
01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:13.710
So Delta is working with Roblox

1120
01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:16.230
to create a game called Delta Locals,

1121
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:18.390
where you can collect these cool souvenirs

1122
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:20.790
and then learn more about places all around the world.

1123
01:05:20.790 --> 01:05:23.520
So that is one cool thing that we're doing.

1124
01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.450
What are your ideas?

1125
01:05:24.450 --> 01:05:27.788
<v ->How about a plane made of garbage?</v>

1126
01:05:27.788 --> 01:05:28.784
<v Kids>What?</v>

1127
01:05:28.784 --> 01:05:29.803
<v ->I like that.</v>

1128
01:05:29.803 --> 01:05:31.050
<v ->He's right. We have to save our planet.</v>

1129
01:05:31.050 --> 01:05:31.883
<v ->Great idea.</v>

1130
01:05:32.846 --> 01:05:35.010
One day, your seat may be made of plastic

1131
01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:36.965
that we remove from the oceans.

1132
01:05:36.965 --> 01:05:37.800
<v Kids>Whoa.</v>

1133
01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:38.640
<v ->I agree. Yeah.</v>

1134
01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:40.230
You know, we're working with all kinds of material

1135
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:42.930
like algae and bamboo.

1136
01:05:42.930 --> 01:05:44.404
Anything is possible, guys.

1137
01:05:44.404 --> 01:05:46.950
<v ->What about a plane that has wings that flap like a bird?</v>

1138
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:50.040
<v ->I like this. Well, how about folding instead of flapping?</v>

1139
01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.170
I mean, we're working on a new wing

1140
01:05:52.170 --> 01:05:55.293
that makes planes fly even more efficiently, a folding wing.

1141
01:05:55.293 --> 01:05:57.510
<v ->It's a good idea to copy birds.</v>

1142
01:05:57.510 --> 01:06:00.675
They've been flying forever. They're the literal experts.

1143
01:06:00.675 --> 01:06:02.100
<v ->Exactly.</v>

1144
01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:05.452
See, we're working on getting planes to fly in formation,

1145
01:06:05.452 --> 01:06:07.260
like when you see a group of geese

1146
01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:09.450
and they fly in that V shape,

1147
01:06:09.450 --> 01:06:12.450
it means quicker journeys and using less fuel.

1148
01:06:12.450 --> 01:06:16.260
And we're actually doing a test flight this year. Yeah.

1149
01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:17.130
<v ->Can I come?</v>

1150
01:06:17.130 --> 01:06:19.260
<v ->Not yet, but soon.</v>

1151
01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:21.810
Okay. Grab your headsets.

1152
01:06:21.810 --> 01:06:26.810
Using a combination of AR and VR in this device,

1153
01:06:26.970 --> 01:06:30.360
we can customize planes in whatever way we want.

1154
01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:31.706
<v Kids>Whoa.</v>

1155
01:06:31.706 --> 01:06:35.250
<v ->This is a plane and it also glows in the dark.</v>

1156
01:06:35.250 --> 01:06:37.685
<v ->Oh, that's fantastic. It's perfect for night flight.</v>

1157
01:06:37.685 --> 01:06:38.790
<v ->What about a plane with plants?</v>

1158
01:06:38.790 --> 01:06:40.860
<v Instructor>You're so innovative, everybody here.</v>

1159
01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:42.990
<v ->What about a plane with camouflage?</v>

1160
01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:44.580
<v Instructor>This is getting really good, guys.</v>

1161
01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:48.133
I'm loving all these ideas.
(kids laughing)

1162
01:06:48.133 --> 01:06:51.133
(audience applauds)

1163
01:06:52.386 --> 01:06:54.210
<v ->I don't know about you, but I think it's fair to say</v>

1164
01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:57.930
that the future is in pretty safe hands with these kids.

1165
01:06:57.930 --> 01:06:59.850
That was an exclusive look

1166
01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:02.109
at one of Delta's most important partnerships,

1167
01:07:02.109 --> 01:07:04.084
our partnership with Airbus,

1168
01:07:04.084 --> 01:07:06.489
the company which makes many of the airplanes

1169
01:07:06.489 --> 01:07:09.667
that carry our customers across the skies.

1170
01:07:09.667 --> 01:07:12.329
And it's a relationship that's been critical

1171
01:07:12.329 --> 01:07:15.928
to making Delta the airline who we are today.

1172
01:07:15.928 --> 01:07:17.153
And like Delta,

1173
01:07:17.153 --> 01:07:20.613
our friends at Airbus are playing the long game,

1174
01:07:20.613 --> 01:07:23.845
looking into the future to imagine how the magic of travel

1175
01:07:23.845 --> 01:07:28.350
will be changing our world for decades to come.

1176
01:07:28.350 --> 01:07:31.373
Joining me to discuss the steps we're taking together

1177
01:07:31.373 --> 01:07:34.830
to build a better world for the next 100 years,

1178
01:07:34.830 --> 01:07:37.770
I'd like to welcome Airbus's Chief Sustainability Officer

1179
01:07:37.770 --> 01:07:40.770
and Head of Communications, Julie Kitcher,

1180
01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:45.770
and renowned futurist and founder of WAYE, Sinead Bovell.

1181
01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:47.591
Ladies.

1182
01:07:47.591 --> 01:07:52.591
(uplifting music)
(audience applauds)

1183
01:07:57.030 --> 01:08:00.966
<v ->Hi, Ed.</v>
<v ->Thank you, Julie.</v>

1184
01:08:00.966 --> 01:08:02.466
Sinead, thank you.

1185
01:08:06.810 --> 01:08:11.070
Julie, what we just heard from those amazing kids

1186
01:08:11.070 --> 01:08:15.153
help us paint one vision of the future of travel.

1187
01:08:15.153 --> 01:08:16.830
But when you think about

1188
01:08:16.830 --> 01:08:20.640
the next 10, 50, 100 years of travel,

1189
01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:23.400
what kinds of big changes do you see

1190
01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:27.030
in how aircraft are being designed and then built?

1191
01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:29.610
<v ->Thanks, Ed, and hello, everyone.</v>

1192
01:08:29.610 --> 01:08:32.253
I'm so excited to be here with you

1193
01:08:32.253 --> 01:08:36.120
and our friends and partners at Delta.

1194
01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:39.363
So first, you're right to talk about shared values.

1195
01:08:39.363 --> 01:08:44.363
At Airbus, our purpose is to pioneer sustainable aerospace

1196
01:08:44.491 --> 01:08:48.673
for a safe and united world.

1197
01:08:48.673 --> 01:08:53.250
So it means we are pioneering innovation and technology

1198
01:08:53.250 --> 01:08:56.069
for global mobility and connectivity,

1199
01:08:56.069 --> 01:08:58.893
bringing the world together.

1200
01:08:58.893 --> 01:09:01.650
So that's really, you know,

1201
01:09:01.650 --> 01:09:05.723
over the next decade, over the next century,

1202
01:09:05.723 --> 01:09:09.540
we'll be bringing flight to future generations,

1203
01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:12.750
those brilliant kids that we saw on that video,

1204
01:09:12.750 --> 01:09:15.840
and today's aircraft go beyond the boundaries

1205
01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:18.030
we knew even a decade ago.

1206
01:09:18.030 --> 01:09:21.692
But we are actually imagining technological innovations

1207
01:09:21.692 --> 01:09:24.420
that seemed impossible.

1208
01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:28.770
So it's never been more exciting for engineers to design,

1209
01:09:28.770 --> 01:09:31.950
develop, and implement at Airbus.

1210
01:09:31.950 --> 01:09:34.127
And those kids are pretty smart.

1211
01:09:34.127 --> 01:09:35.550
<v ->They're pretty smart.</v>
<v ->They are pretty smart.</v>

1212
01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:37.680
So actually I'd like to share

1213
01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:42.360
that we are actually working on wings that do change shape.

1214
01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:44.760
If you think about an eagle in flight

1215
01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.480
and the way those wings bend and change shape,

1216
01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:50.820
well, we are actually working on longer,

1217
01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:53.910
leaner, lighter wings with moving parts

1218
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:57.746
that change shape in flight to improve aerodynamics,

1219
01:09:57.746 --> 01:10:01.650
reduce fuel used to cut costs and emissions.

1220
01:10:01.650 --> 01:10:04.827
And that's what we're doing to support you at Delta.

1221
01:10:04.827 --> 01:10:08.408
And for those of you who grew up with Star Wars like I did,

1222
01:10:08.408 --> 01:10:12.630
that means science fiction is actually becoming a reality

1223
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:14.940
when we see those wings moving.

1224
01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:19.172
So I'm really thrilled to be able to announce collaboration

1225
01:10:19.172 --> 01:10:23.329
with Delta and Airbus on early stage technology

1226
01:10:23.329 --> 01:10:27.949
between our innovation labs, including Airbus UpNext,

1227
01:10:27.949 --> 01:10:31.773
to explore wing performance, fuel efficiency,

1228
01:10:31.773 --> 01:10:35.520
superconductivity, which is about the efficiency

1229
01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:40.520
of electrical energy, and advanced aircraft assistance.

1230
01:10:40.770 --> 01:10:43.680
And so Ed, that collaboration will be key to us

1231
01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:45.870
because we need your feedback

1232
01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:49.680
to be able to continue to develop the best aircraft

1233
01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:53.130
and achieve our shared vision together.

1234
01:10:53.130 --> 01:10:54.210
<v ->That's really great, Julie.</v>

1235
01:10:54.210 --> 01:10:57.930
And I'm so excited about what we see out into our future,

1236
01:10:57.930 --> 01:10:59.400
which brings me to Sinead.

1237
01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.140
Sinead is a futurist,

1238
01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:03.900
a frequent speaker at the United Nations.

1239
01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:05.880
I think you've got one of the toughest jobs in the world

1240
01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:09.947
having to predict what's gonna happen into the future.

1241
01:11:09.947 --> 01:11:12.540
What are some of the big changes

1242
01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:15.690
that you see happening on our horizon?

1243
01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:16.680
<v ->That's a great question. Yeah.</v>

1244
01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:19.680
I would say augmented reality, virtual reality,

1245
01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:23.040
like we saw in that video, and AI first devices

1246
01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:25.145
will eventually become as standard

1247
01:11:25.145 --> 01:11:29.400
as in-flight wifi and entertainment screens are today.

1248
01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:31.110
And then AI, it's going to go on

1249
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:34.910
to deliver extremely hyper-personalized travel experiences

1250
01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:37.260
where the planning just moves seamlessly

1251
01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:38.760
into the background.

1252
01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:42.000
And then there's rapid advancements in synthetic biology

1253
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.380
and material science.

1254
01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:46.233
So we can build planes with biodegradable materials

1255
01:11:46.233 --> 01:11:49.740
that could even one day self-heal.

1256
01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:52.620
<v ->Self-heal. Explain that to me.</v>

1257
01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:55.440
<v ->Just the way, it's the same way nature heals itself</v>

1258
01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.840
if it gets a tear or it gets injured,

1259
01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.910
taking that biomimicry example,

1260
01:11:59.910 --> 01:12:01.650
building using similar materials

1261
01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:04.380
so planes in the future can heal and repair themselves,

1262
01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:05.940
copying nature again.

1263
01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:08.468
<v ->That's so incredible and I'm so excited to hear that.</v>

1264
01:12:08.468 --> 01:12:12.913
Julie, as someone who oversees sustainability at Airbus,

1265
01:12:12.913 --> 01:12:14.910
what are some of the advancements

1266
01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:16.890
that you see in fuel science

1267
01:12:16.890 --> 01:12:19.110
that's shaping the future of our industry?

1268
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.943
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1269
01:12:19.943 --> 01:12:23.613
And fuel science is actually becoming extremely exciting.

1270
01:12:23.613 --> 01:12:28.500
So first let's put aviation history into perspective.

1271
01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:29.333
So at Airbus,

1272
01:12:29.333 --> 01:12:33.060
we like to talk about four revolutions of aviation.

1273
01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:36.033
Well, the first was flight itself

1274
01:12:36.033 --> 01:12:37.984
because scientists believed

1275
01:12:37.984 --> 01:12:41.087
that machines heavier than air wouldn't fly.

1276
01:12:41.087 --> 01:12:44.310
The second is making aviation safer,

1277
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:47.092
and that's a continuous priority for us all.

1278
01:12:47.092 --> 01:12:50.310
The third is making flight accessible.

1279
01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:52.350
So democratization of flight and air.

1280
01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:54.390
You were talking about that.

1281
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:58.950
And now we are at the dawn of the fourth revelation.

1282
01:12:58.950 --> 01:13:03.003
So pioneering the technology for sustainable aerospace.

1283
01:13:03.003 --> 01:13:04.064
And at Airbus,

1284
01:13:04.064 --> 01:13:07.728
our mission is to significantly reduce fuel burn,

1285
01:13:07.728 --> 01:13:11.220
driving down costs and CO2 emissions

1286
01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:14.100
with each new generation of aircraft,

1287
01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:18.240
which equates to about 25% fuel burn reduction

1288
01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.310
with each new generation of aircraft.

1289
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:24.128
And we're supporting Delta with that on the new aircraft.

1290
01:13:24.128 --> 01:13:26.820
And sustainable aviation fuel,

1291
01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:28.590
which is a nascent technology,

1292
01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:31.500
is now central to that mission too.

1293
01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:35.220
So for example, the cooking oil that you use at home

1294
01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:39.714
and throw away can actually be used today to fuel a plane.

1295
01:13:39.714 --> 01:13:41.029
So that's right.

1296
01:13:41.029 --> 01:13:44.494
Aviation fuels are now made from renewable sources

1297
01:13:44.494 --> 01:13:47.227
like cooking oil or agricultural waste.

1298
01:13:47.227 --> 01:13:50.010
And Airbus aircraft can actually fly

1299
01:13:50.010 --> 01:13:54.210
with a 50% blend today of this fuel.

1300
01:13:54.210 --> 01:13:59.038
And by 2030, that figure is going to grow to 100%.

1301
01:13:59.038 --> 01:14:00.750
But the real challenge is

1302
01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:03.480
to make those fuels more affordable

1303
01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:06.420
and increase production and fast.

1304
01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:09.060
So we are excited again about this partnership

1305
01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:13.890
we're announcing with Delta to drive and scale production,

1306
01:14:13.890 --> 01:14:16.920
which is going to combine our pioneering innovation

1307
01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:21.920
with Delta's vision and operational expertise.

1308
01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:26.250
And that collaboration will strengthen energy security,

1309
01:14:26.250 --> 01:14:28.427
which is a key issue today,

1310
01:14:28.427 --> 01:14:32.210
and drive economic growth and development

1311
01:14:32.210 --> 01:14:34.560
as well as social development,

1312
01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:37.680
particularly in rural communities.

1313
01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:40.874
Because this is a new business, it's a nascent technology,

1314
01:14:40.874 --> 01:14:45.270
so it will create jobs, it can foster innovation,

1315
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:48.900
attract investment, and build more resilience.

1316
01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:51.548
So I think that's a pretty exciting future.

1317
01:14:51.548 --> 01:14:52.950
<v ->That's a very, very exciting, a very exciting future.</v>

1318
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:56.312
And all of this is ultimately in the service

1319
01:14:56.312 --> 01:15:00.951
of making our world smaller, bringing us closer together.

1320
01:15:00.951 --> 01:15:02.970
And it's gonna cause each of us

1321
01:15:02.970 --> 01:15:05.970
to think differently about the challenges ahead.

1322
01:15:05.970 --> 01:15:07.650
'cause as we've seen today,

1323
01:15:07.650 --> 01:15:10.338
the future of travel a century from now

1324
01:15:10.338 --> 01:15:14.191
is not going to be recognizable to what we knew today.

1325
01:15:14.191 --> 01:15:18.107
Ladies and gentlemen, please thank Julie and Sinead

1326
01:15:18.107 --> 01:15:20.413
for spending this time with us today.

1327
01:15:20.413 --> 01:15:22.078
Thank you, ladies.
(audience applauds)

1328
01:15:22.078 --> 01:15:24.661
<v Julie>Thank you. Thank you.</v>

1329
01:15:29.289 --> 01:15:32.372
(jet engine humming)

1330
01:15:39.458 --> 01:15:42.291
(uplifting music)

1331
01:16:38.317 --> 01:16:40.643
(audience cheers and applauds)
<v ->Wasn't that incredible?</v>

1332
01:16:43.233 --> 01:16:46.380
Feels like we've been on a journey tonight together.

1333
01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:50.850
At Delta, we want to make flying seem effortless,

1334
01:16:50.850 --> 01:16:52.230
but the truth?

1335
01:16:52.230 --> 01:16:53.790
It's not.

1336
01:16:53.790 --> 01:16:55.320
Flying requires the effort

1337
01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:58.350
of thousands of Delta employees every day,

1338
01:16:58.350 --> 01:17:02.251
each striving to make Delta the very best it can be.

1339
01:17:02.251 --> 01:17:04.009
And some of those amazing people

1340
01:17:04.009 --> 01:17:06.057
are standing behind me today

1341
01:17:06.057 --> 01:17:08.810
and I just want to take a moment to thank them...

1342
01:17:10.837 --> 01:17:12.599
(audience applauds)

1343
01:17:12.599 --> 01:17:16.680
Thank our team who put this amazing show together for us,

1344
01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:18.760
and all the Delta people who are here

1345
01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:20.520
for a great, great evening.

1346
01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:23.373
Thank you for what you all do for us.

1347
01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:32.103
I've always been an optimist.

1348
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.210
When you work in the airline business, you have to be.

1349
01:17:36.210 --> 01:17:39.750
But even for me, sometimes it can be hard

1350
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:42.450
to be optimistic about the future

1351
01:17:42.450 --> 01:17:45.843
when you see the challenges that we face today.

1352
01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:50.793
How are we gonna solve them? Is it even possible?

1353
01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:56.264
Well, once the idea of a person soaring through the clouds

1354
01:17:56.264 --> 01:17:59.217
seemed equally impossible.

1355
01:17:59.217 --> 01:18:02.790
And as those early Delta pilots learned,

1356
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:07.170
by pushing against the wind, they could take to the skies.

1357
01:18:07.170 --> 01:18:09.720
I'm optimistic because we're on the verge

1358
01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:14.463
of a transformation that goes far beyond transportation.

1359
01:18:15.810 --> 01:18:17.790
It's about shrinking the world,

1360
01:18:17.790 --> 01:18:21.725
making even the most remote places feel closer than ever.

1361
01:18:21.725 --> 01:18:24.900
You can't do that on a phone or a screen

1362
01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:26.520
or via social media.

1363
01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:29.749
We tried that pretty unsuccessfully during the pandemic.

1364
01:18:29.749 --> 01:18:32.418
We don't live in the virtual world.

1365
01:18:32.418 --> 01:18:35.678
True connection comes when we're standing together,

1366
01:18:35.678 --> 01:18:37.490
sharing the same space.

1367
01:18:37.490 --> 01:18:39.918
That's when conversations begin,

1368
01:18:39.918 --> 01:18:43.470
when lifelong relationships are born.

1369
01:18:43.470 --> 01:18:45.857
It's the promise of the next century of flight

1370
01:18:45.857 --> 01:18:48.000
to me is exhilarating.

1371
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.220
Just imagine the possibilities.

1372
01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:53.411
Travel powered by sustainable energy,

1373
01:18:53.411 --> 01:18:56.250
advancements in material science

1374
01:18:56.250 --> 01:18:59.938
that allow us to better adapt to new environments,

1375
01:18:59.938 --> 01:19:04.938
airplanes becoming immersive destinations in themselves.

1376
01:19:05.112 --> 01:19:09.378
Imagine when journeys won't be measured by distance,

1377
01:19:09.378 --> 01:19:12.092
but by the potential they unlock,

1378
01:19:12.092 --> 01:19:15.473
the physical and the digital blend.

1379
01:19:15.473 --> 01:19:18.498
Sustainable travel has been achieved

1380
01:19:18.498 --> 01:19:21.829
and entire regions of the world are transformed

1381
01:19:21.829 --> 01:19:25.020
by the power of travel and connection.

1382
01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:28.050
This is the future that we are building,

1383
01:19:28.050 --> 01:19:30.599
a future of limitless possibilities.

1384
01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:33.720
Behind every innovation are the people

1385
01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:36.478
who dedicate their lives to pushing ahead,

1386
01:19:36.478 --> 01:19:38.280
from that first passenger

1387
01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:42.291
who strapped into the back of a crop duster a century ago

1388
01:19:42.291 --> 01:19:45.750
to the innovators driving today's advancements.

1389
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:48.180
It's the curiosity, creativity,

1390
01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:49.830
relentless drive of individuals

1391
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:52.680
that shape the future of travel.

1392
01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:56.258
Thanks to them, the sky is no longer the limit.

1393
01:19:56.258 --> 01:19:58.023
It's just the beginning.

1394
01:20:01.170 --> 01:20:05.250
The innovations and partnerships that we've shared today

1395
01:20:05.250 --> 01:20:07.830
are more than advancements.

1396
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:09.690
They're the foundation of a future

1397
01:20:09.690 --> 01:20:14.100
where technology links us to experience, places, and people

1398
01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:16.533
in ways we've only dreamed about.

1399
01:20:17.370 --> 01:20:20.010
Delta's not just preparing for that future.

1400
01:20:20.010 --> 01:20:21.668
We're creating it.

1401
01:20:21.668 --> 01:20:24.960
And with every innovation, daring idea,

1402
01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:27.840
and the passion of those who keep climbing,

1403
01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:30.390
we are transcending the boundaries of travel

1404
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:33.570
and redefining what it means to connect.

1405
01:20:33.570 --> 01:20:35.038
It's as simple as this.

1406
01:20:35.038 --> 01:20:38.493
If you don't go, the world will never change.

1407
01:20:39.330 --> 01:20:43.230
When you go, anything is possible.

1408
01:20:43.230 --> 01:20:46.500
This is the beginning of a new era of travel.

1409
01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:49.020
So as we take off into our next century,

1410
01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:50.550
fasten your seat belts.

1411
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:53.677
Our best is yet to come. Thank you all.

1412
01:20:54.598 --> 01:20:57.598
(audience applauds)

1413
01:20:59.538 --> 01:21:04.538
(uplifting music)
(fireworks popping)

1414
01:24:02.337 --> 01:24:04.920
(upbeat music)
