00:00.000 --> 00:02.583
(bright music)

2
00:10.210 --> 00:12.090
<v Announcer>Please welcome the president</v>

3
00:12.090 --> 00:16.593
of the Consumer Technology Association, Kinsey Fabrizio.

4
00:16.593 --> 00:21.593
(upbeat music)
(audience applauds)

5
00:21.605 --> 00:24.690
(Kinsey chuckles)

6
00:24.690 --> 00:29.690
<v ->Thank you. Welcome to CES 2025.</v>

7
00:29.880 --> 00:33.330
We have all watched a dramatic transformation

8
00:33.330 --> 00:37.800
in the world of media over the past few years.

9
00:37.800 --> 00:40.980
New technologies are making it easier than ever

10
00:40.980 --> 00:44.700
to get information and personalized content,

11
00:44.700 --> 00:48.810
and helping connect people around the world.

12
00:48.810 --> 00:52.260
As we look to a new future for digital communication,

13
00:52.260 --> 00:54.690
X Corp is setting the agenda

14
00:54.690 --> 00:58.050
and reshaping the landscape for content creation,

15
00:58.050 --> 01:03.050
social platforms, and how technology empowers creators

16
01:03.480 --> 01:05.673
and communities to thrive.

17
01:06.960 --> 01:09.720
Under CEO, Linda Yaccarino,

18
01:09.720 --> 01:13.980
X Corp has become the global newsroom in your pocket

19
01:13.980 --> 01:18.330
and a community that brings together global conversations

20
01:18.330 --> 01:21.450
and debates, sometimes, to life.

21
01:21.450 --> 01:25.650
Just like the company she leads, Linda is a trailblazer

22
01:25.650 --> 01:28.290
who embodies the spirit of CES

23
01:28.290 --> 01:33.093
with a career marked by innovation, resilience, and vision.

24
01:33.960 --> 01:35.940
She's risen through the ranks

25
01:35.940 --> 01:39.150
of some of the biggest media companies in the US,

26
01:39.150 --> 01:41.430
including more than a decade,

27
01:41.430 --> 01:44.190
leading global advertising and partnerships

28
01:44.190 --> 01:46.374
at NBC Universal.

29
01:46.374 --> 01:51.030
Linda will be joined on stage by Catherine Herridge,

30
01:51.030 --> 01:55.050
an Emmy award winning investigative journalist,

31
01:55.050 --> 01:57.390
and as a senior investigative correspondent

32
01:57.390 --> 02:02.390
for CBS News from 2019 to 2024, and before that,

33
02:02.670 --> 02:06.930
chief intelligence correspondent for Fox News Channel.

34
02:06.930 --> 02:10.380
Herridge has a reputation for insightful questions

35
02:10.380 --> 02:13.380
and thought provoking conversation.

36
02:13.380 --> 02:16.140
I hope you are as excited as I am

37
02:16.140 --> 02:18.240
for this meaningful conversation.

38
02:18.240 --> 02:21.000
Please join me in welcoming Linda

39
02:21.000 --> 02:23.411
and Catherine to the stage.

40
02:23.411 --> 02:28.411
(everyone applauds)
(upbeat music)

41
02:32.851 --> 02:34.057
<v ->Thank you.</v>
<v ->Thank you.</v>

42
02:34.057 --> 02:36.636
<v Kinsey>Thank you very much. Thank you for being here.</v>

43
02:36.636 --> 02:39.462
Thank you for being here.
(group chattering)

44
02:39.462 --> 02:42.045
(upbeat music)

45
02:46.800 --> 02:49.740
<v ->All right, Kinsey, thank you for the kind introduction.</v>

46
02:49.740 --> 02:51.240
Linda, let's jump right in

47
02:51.240 --> 02:54.240
and begin with the announcement from Mark Zuckerberg

48
02:54.240 --> 02:57.090
earlier today that Meta is abandoning

49
02:57.090 --> 02:58.500
the fact checking program

50
02:58.500 --> 03:01.950
in favor of a community notes style system.

51
03:01.950 --> 03:03.303
What's your response?

52
03:04.260 --> 03:07.795
<v ->How cool is that? (chuckles)</v>

53
03:07.795 --> 03:10.800
I think it's really exciting

54
03:10.800 --> 03:13.530
that when you think about community notes

55
03:13.530 --> 03:15.270
being good for the world,

56
03:15.270 --> 03:20.010
think about it as this global collective consciousness,

57
03:20.010 --> 03:22.680
keeping each other accountable,

58
03:22.680 --> 03:25.980
at global scale, in real time.

59
03:25.980 --> 03:29.970
And it couldn't be more validating than to see that

60
03:29.970 --> 03:33.630
Mark and Meta realized that, right?

61
03:33.630 --> 03:35.910
And when you think about community notes,

62
03:35.910 --> 03:39.780
Mark and Meta realized that it's the most effective,

63
03:39.780 --> 03:42.930
fastest fact checking without bias.

64
03:42.930 --> 03:47.282
Mark and Meta realized there's every language

65
03:47.282 --> 03:50.970
in almost 200 countries on the platform.

66
03:50.970 --> 03:52.740
Fastest, most accurate.

67
03:52.740 --> 03:55.980
And also it inspires great behavior.

68
03:55.980 --> 04:00.980
Human behavior is inspired because when a post is noted,

69
04:02.190 --> 04:05.280
it's dramatically shared less.

70
04:05.280 --> 04:08.010
So that's the power of community notes.

71
04:08.010 --> 04:12.960
And we say, Mark, Meta, welcome to the party.

72
04:12.960 --> 04:14.640
<v ->So what do you think is driving this?</v>

73
04:14.640 --> 04:19.050
Do you think it's a genuine embrace of free speech?

74
04:19.050 --> 04:20.010
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

75
04:20.010 --> 04:23.430
I think that people all around the world have spoken.

76
04:23.430 --> 04:27.270
It's why there's almost a million community noters on X.

77
04:27.270 --> 04:31.410
And when you think about it, world leaders are on X.

78
04:31.410 --> 04:35.440
Where are all you, right? Mark and meta are there, right?

79
04:35.440 --> 04:37.410
Global leaders, business leaders,

80
04:37.410 --> 04:38.910
sharing their thoughts every day.

81
04:38.910 --> 04:43.140
Where are you? Gen Z, all on X.

82
04:43.140 --> 04:46.140
Authenticity matters to Gen Z.

83
04:46.140 --> 04:47.430
Where are all of you?

84
04:47.430 --> 04:51.090
The time now, go big on X.

85
04:51.090 --> 04:54.330
Incredible validation of the power

86
04:54.330 --> 04:57.600
of what's good for the world, and that's community notes.

87
04:57.600 --> 04:59.190
<v ->We see all the posts on X</v>

88
04:59.190 --> 05:01.560
about the big advertisers coming back.

89
05:01.560 --> 05:03.513
What's the data that supports that?

90
05:04.620 --> 05:06.600
<v ->Well, there's growth everywhere we look.</v>

91
05:06.600 --> 05:09.270
Every corner of X, there's growth.

92
05:09.270 --> 05:12.210
And when you think about the numbers, as you say,

93
05:12.210 --> 05:17.210
90% of the advertisers are back on X,

94
05:17.280 --> 05:20.970
and it's really about three things, right?

95
05:20.970 --> 05:22.980
It's about safety.

96
05:22.980 --> 05:25.470
We've already talked about community notes, right?

97
05:25.470 --> 05:28.950
It's about safety, it's about product innovation,

98
05:28.950 --> 05:30.330
and then it's about

99
05:30.330 --> 05:33.510
that there's absolutely no surrogate for X, right?

100
05:33.510 --> 05:35.100
So if you start with the safety part,

101
05:35.100 --> 05:38.610
already talk about massive, massive success

102
05:38.610 --> 05:42.152
of community notes, but we also rolled out

103
05:42.152 --> 05:47.152
a suite of tools that didn't exist prior to acquisition.

104
05:47.520 --> 05:51.660
So all the tools, marketers in this room care about, right?

105
05:51.660 --> 05:56.660
So controls and settings that lets you

106
05:56.670 --> 05:59.927
engage on the platform as you wish.

107
05:59.927 --> 06:02.940
Brand safety and suitability partnerships,

108
06:02.940 --> 06:06.540
industry certifications, check the box, we did all the work.

109
06:06.540 --> 06:11.365
And think about that then leads to product innovation.

110
06:11.365 --> 06:15.720
Since acquisition, we have rolled out and shipped

111
06:15.720 --> 06:17.970
over 250 product innovations,

112
06:17.970 --> 06:21.810
more than in the last 10 years at the company.

113
06:21.810 --> 06:25.950
And one of those things, one of the best product innovations

114
06:25.950 --> 06:27.900
that I usually refer to it as,

115
06:27.900 --> 06:32.100
it may in fact be the holy grail of advertising products

116
06:32.100 --> 06:33.990
is called Trend Genius,

117
06:33.990 --> 06:37.920
because it's something that only X can do.

118
06:37.920 --> 06:39.840
Is that a new innovation?
<v ->New innovation.</v>

119
06:39.840 --> 06:41.520
<v ->2025?</v>
<v ->Maybe, maybe.</v>

120
06:41.520 --> 06:45.090
We probably beta tested with it within the last,

121
06:45.090 --> 06:47.220
I'm gonna say max, four or five months.

122
06:47.220 --> 06:49.620
<v ->And how does it work?</v>
<v ->It's unbelievable.</v>

123
06:49.620 --> 06:52.200
So everyone talks about what's trending on X, right?

124
06:52.200 --> 06:54.180
No surrogate for X, you have to check X,

125
06:54.180 --> 06:55.590
you gotta know what's going on.

126
06:55.590 --> 07:00.590
So the product we developed is when a trend kicks up on X

127
07:01.830 --> 07:05.100
and it hits a certain, let's call it altitude, right?

128
07:05.100 --> 07:07.170
Or it's really on fire on X,

129
07:07.170 --> 07:09.450
what's designed with advertisers

130
07:09.450 --> 07:11.370
that we have agreements with,

131
07:11.370 --> 07:13.440
their ad campaign gets fired up

132
07:13.440 --> 07:15.270
and it starts to take advantage of those trends.

133
07:15.270 --> 07:18.840
I'll put it in something that's easy to visualize.

134
07:18.840 --> 07:23.840
So for example, during a Taylor Swift concert,

135
07:24.510 --> 07:28.530
Bradley Cooper is spotted with Travis Kelsey,

136
07:28.530 --> 07:33.030
and one of the boxes starts singing the Taylor Swift song.

137
07:33.030 --> 07:36.180
Oh my God, Bradley Cooper is now a Swifty.

138
07:36.180 --> 07:39.240
So it starts trending on the platform.

139
07:39.240 --> 07:40.350
So what happened,

140
07:40.350 --> 07:43.710
because of our previous agreement with LVMH,

141
07:43.710 --> 07:48.710
and Bradley Cooper is an influencer for LVMH,

142
07:49.800 --> 07:53.190
that campaign starts kicking and fired

143
07:53.190 --> 07:55.525
in the real time conversation

144
07:55.525 --> 07:58.110
that's talking about Bradley Cooper

145
07:58.110 --> 08:01.170
being a Swifty in real time.

146
08:01.170 --> 08:03.720
So think about for the marketers in the room,

147
08:03.720 --> 08:08.720
the holy grail, right ad, right place, right time.

148
08:10.230 --> 08:15.230
But now you're adding global scale in the conversation.

149
08:15.847 --> 08:18.060
And the most important thing about it is

150
08:18.060 --> 08:21.840
because of the uniqueness of the trends, maximum efficiency,

151
08:21.840 --> 08:24.810
I mean knock every KPI out of the park

152
08:24.810 --> 08:26.490
with something like Trend Genius,

153
08:26.490 --> 08:31.320
because then when the trend starts to cool down,

154
08:31.320 --> 08:36.000
then your campaign pauses and we move on to the next.

155
08:36.000 --> 08:38.550
Imagine that, and actually, coincidentally,

156
08:38.550 --> 08:41.970
I would've talked to you about this anyway

157
08:41.970 --> 08:45.090
because it truly is the holy grail in ad product,

158
08:45.090 --> 08:48.149
but replicated during the Golden Globes

159
08:48.149 --> 08:53.149
where you had Zendaya, who's also an influencer with LVMH,

160
08:53.220 --> 08:54.630
another campaign kicked

161
08:54.630 --> 08:57.726
'cause the were so hot with her

162
08:57.726 --> 09:00.630
showing up at the Golden Globes-

163
09:00.630 --> 09:03.150
<v ->And the engagement.</v>
<v ->That was the big thing,</v>

164
09:03.150 --> 09:06.420
yes, the big announcement and probably lasted long,

165
09:06.420 --> 09:09.090
like what is that we see, is there an engagement?

166
09:09.090 --> 09:13.770
So, so exciting, and that's what's been so effective,

167
09:13.770 --> 09:17.010
but it really does speak to, when you think about it,

168
09:17.010 --> 09:19.680
where there's no surrogate for X,

169
09:19.680 --> 09:21.660
when you wanna know what's going on,

170
09:21.660 --> 09:24.270
red carpet fashion for the Golden Globes,

171
09:24.270 --> 09:26.820
it's like, I was talking about this the other night.

172
09:26.820 --> 09:30.030
It was like the first time that I stopped arguing

173
09:30.030 --> 09:33.930
with my husband over who has the remote for the TV,

174
09:33.930 --> 09:35.910
because you had the Golden Globes going on,

175
09:35.910 --> 09:39.210
and I was like dying when I was reading about,

176
09:39.210 --> 09:43.170
I mean, come on, Nikki Glaser's like fire monologue.

177
09:43.170 --> 09:46.500
But my husband is interested in the football game

178
09:46.500 --> 09:49.290
and wanting to like, he's eyes glued,

179
09:49.290 --> 09:53.752
saying this is consequential in Jahmyr Gibbs for touchdowns.

180
09:53.752 --> 09:56.220
So we didn't have to fight over the remote anymore

181
09:56.220 --> 10:00.090
because it was breaking in real time, in my hand.

182
10:00.090 --> 10:03.330
So that's what's been so exciting

183
10:03.330 --> 10:06.660
and that's really what's leading to, you know,

184
10:06.660 --> 10:07.950
the growth on the platform.

185
10:07.950 --> 10:09.690
And it brings you to what makes sense

186
10:09.690 --> 10:14.430
is recent poll showing that Gen Z

187
10:14.430 --> 10:18.832
is what's really fueling the growth of the platform.

188
10:18.832 --> 10:23.832
Ad age Harris Poll talking about the number one brand

189
10:24.210 --> 10:28.620
getting Gen Z's attention is X and why is that?

190
10:28.620 --> 10:29.820
That's things we're talking about.

191
10:29.820 --> 10:32.280
It's fashion, it's culture, it's sports, it's music,

192
10:32.280 --> 10:35.790
it's gaming, in real time when they wanna see it,

193
10:35.790 --> 10:38.130
which is whenever they wanna see it.

194
10:38.130 --> 10:41.790
So it's been a really exciting moment,

195
10:41.790 --> 10:45.480
a really exciting time at X and the platform.

196
10:45.480 --> 10:48.005
<v ->So in addition to Trend Genius,</v>

197
10:48.005 --> 10:50.220
what are the other big innovations

198
10:50.220 --> 10:51.390
people can expect in 2025-
<v ->Okay,</v>

199
10:51.390 --> 10:55.440
so we talked about that it was about three things, right?

200
10:55.440 --> 10:56.910
So we talked about the safety,

201
10:56.910 --> 10:59.850
we talked about the ad products, that there's also,

202
10:59.850 --> 11:04.157
you know, no surrogate for X, and it leads you to,

203
11:04.157 --> 11:07.795
really partnerships like only X would do.

204
11:07.795 --> 11:11.040
If you're transforming the company like we are,

205
11:11.040 --> 11:12.820
you want a partner with the best brands

206
11:12.820 --> 11:15.990
and there's no bigger, stronger brand than the NFL.

207
11:15.990 --> 11:19.830
So we just rolled out this season, the NFL Portal.

208
11:19.830 --> 11:22.140
So think about, you know, we talk about X

209
11:22.140 --> 11:23.670
as the global town square,

210
11:23.670 --> 11:27.930
think about the NFL town square, all conversation,

211
11:27.930 --> 11:32.040
all rankings, all stats, all video, all in one place.

212
11:32.040 --> 11:34.020
And the season's not even done yet.

213
11:34.020 --> 11:39.020
So far this year, 36 billion impressions around the NFL.

214
11:41.490 --> 11:44.610
Four billion video views.

215
11:44.610 --> 11:47.400
So when you look at numbers like that,

216
11:47.400 --> 11:51.300
it really starts to crystallize in your mind

217
11:51.300 --> 11:54.480
what this was all about in the first place,

218
11:54.480 --> 11:55.749
and what the idea

219
11:55.749 --> 11:59.880
of becoming the everything app really means.

220
11:59.880 --> 12:03.420
<v ->Are you thinking about expanding the portal model?</v>

221
12:03.420 --> 12:06.510
And I'm thinking specifically about news.

222
12:06.510 --> 12:09.450
What are we expecting in 2025

223
12:09.450 --> 12:11.070
in terms of news and journalism?

224
12:11.070 --> 12:13.380
<v ->Well, I think it's safe to assume you will see,</v>

225
12:13.380 --> 12:17.580
since we rolled out the NFL Portal soft launch

226
12:17.580 --> 12:19.890
with the portal to Paris with the Olympics,

227
12:19.890 --> 12:22.740
and you'll see other big leagues around the world.

228
12:22.740 --> 12:24.540
So global sports portal,

229
12:24.540 --> 12:27.630
it's safe to assume that that will expand.

230
12:27.630 --> 12:30.840
As far as news goes-
<v ->Will there be a news portal?</v>

231
12:30.840 --> 12:33.540
<v ->Well, I think it's really exciting time.</v>

232
12:33.540 --> 12:38.540
As you know, this year was a seminal year for X,

233
12:38.714 --> 12:43.714
particularly as it provided independent journalists,

234
12:45.262 --> 12:50.220
a clear canvas to really explore their craft.

235
12:50.220 --> 12:52.230
That's such a challenge for them today.

236
12:52.230 --> 12:53.520
I mean, look at yourself, come on,

237
12:53.520 --> 12:55.230
you knew I would check the numbers.

238
12:55.230 --> 12:59.881
Your followers are up over 35% since October,

239
12:59.881 --> 13:01.950
and there's a reason for that.

240
13:01.950 --> 13:06.950
When we look at the sad challenge state of journalism today,

241
13:07.710 --> 13:11.393
when you think that a journalism,

242
13:11.393 --> 13:15.420
just under pressure from financials, constant layoffs,

243
13:15.420 --> 13:17.160
you're reading about it today,

244
13:17.160 --> 13:20.580
the state of journalism today in legacy media,

245
13:20.580 --> 13:25.140
we know, the future of news is not legacy media.

246
13:25.140 --> 13:29.070
Legacy Media News has become almost like a fan service

247
13:29.070 --> 13:32.040
to make sure that you're speaking to a niche audience

248
13:32.040 --> 13:34.050
to make your budget, right?

249
13:34.050 --> 13:35.760
And what we wanna do is make sure

250
13:35.760 --> 13:38.410
that we provide a great place for that

251
13:39.450 --> 13:42.764
journalistic curiosity to return, right?

252
13:42.764 --> 13:45.939
To make sure that there is a place

253
13:45.939 --> 13:50.490
for journalists to come thrive and earn a great living.

254
13:50.490 --> 13:53.280
We have a great creator of revenue share program

255
13:53.280 --> 13:54.600
that we're very generous.

256
13:54.600 --> 13:58.410
We wanna make sure that we pay off our promise

257
13:58.410 --> 14:01.830
to incent the livelihoods of the journalists

258
14:01.830 --> 14:04.410
who contribute to the free and fair press

259
14:04.410 --> 14:07.110
that the citizens of the world are missing.

260
14:07.110 --> 14:11.700
It's why what naturally rose up on the platform

261
14:11.700 --> 14:14.790
where the shift in control, the shift in the narrative

262
14:14.790 --> 14:16.800
is now in the user's hand,

263
14:16.800 --> 14:20.076
and it's people like you and the exposes

264
14:20.076 --> 14:22.590
and giving whistle blowers a safe forum

265
14:22.590 --> 14:24.210
to talk about the stories

266
14:24.210 --> 14:27.090
that people are really interested in,

267
14:27.090 --> 14:30.720
and inspiring change, really inspiring change

268
14:30.720 --> 14:34.170
by what's allowed by protected free speech

269
14:34.170 --> 14:38.490
and a two-way conversation of information accessibility,

270
14:38.490 --> 14:42.660
and not one way, filtered information,

271
14:42.660 --> 14:45.660
of legacy news that is designed

272
14:45.660 --> 14:48.570
to make you think a certain way.

273
14:48.570 --> 14:50.400
It's a new day, a new era.

274
14:50.400 --> 14:53.463
<v ->So it sounds like a news portal may be possible.</v>

275
14:54.540 --> 14:56.490
<v ->Well, it's a really good push.</v>

276
14:56.490 --> 14:58.890
I have to say, she's very good, right?

277
14:58.890 --> 15:00.630
It's why I'm like pretty excited

278
15:00.630 --> 15:04.470
to talk about X hiring John Stoll, right?

279
15:04.470 --> 15:08.509
Former editor and bureau chief of "The Wall Street Journal,"

280
15:08.509 --> 15:12.709
who's just joining us to help lead together

281
15:12.709 --> 15:17.670
the news group and partnership team at X to again,

282
15:17.670 --> 15:20.190
bring everything we're just talking about to life

283
15:20.190 --> 15:25.190
and just expand it on such a global scale.

284
15:25.196 --> 15:29.759
<v ->We're sitting down just 13 days before the inauguration</v>

285
15:29.759 --> 15:32.610
of President Trump as the 47th president

286
15:32.610 --> 15:34.380
of the United States.

287
15:34.380 --> 15:37.140
Have you had a conversation with Elon Musk

288
15:37.140 --> 15:38.880
about how this is going to work

289
15:38.880 --> 15:41.130
with the Department of Government Efficiency?

290
15:42.060 --> 15:46.980
<v ->Well, listen, Elon is a visionary</v>

291
15:46.980 --> 15:51.980
and there is no better person that can set a vision

292
15:54.030 --> 15:59.030
and a course for others to be inspired and follow.

293
15:59.640 --> 16:02.880
Maybe that's the question we ask Mark Zuckerberg today,

294
16:02.880 --> 16:03.713
right?

295
16:03.713 --> 16:05.940
So he inspires people to follow,

296
16:05.940 --> 16:09.690
and that's what I do with the team every day at the company,

297
16:09.690 --> 16:14.400
is to take that vision and to bring it to life

298
16:14.400 --> 16:16.470
and to execute with perfection.

299
16:16.470 --> 16:21.470
But as far as DOGE is concerned, I would imagine that

300
16:21.660 --> 16:26.660
surfacing, identifying government waste and inefficiency

301
16:27.540 --> 16:29.820
is beneficial to all of us.

302
16:29.820 --> 16:32.520
And I don't think there's two better people

303
16:32.520 --> 16:35.130
than Elon and Vivek to do that.

304
16:35.130 --> 16:40.130
And as Americans, we should all be rooting

305
16:40.260 --> 16:43.800
for the overwhelming success of DOGE.

306
16:43.800 --> 16:47.130
I would expect other countries to follow.

307
16:47.130 --> 16:50.430
And I would also imagine, you know,

308
16:50.430 --> 16:55.430
you said the inauguration is about two weeks away,

309
16:55.521 --> 16:57.267
but I would imagine that DOGE

310
16:57.267 --> 17:00.720
and the success of DOGE will talked about

311
17:00.720 --> 17:04.380
as probably one of the single biggest unifiers

312
17:04.380 --> 17:06.540
that will bring this country together,

313
17:06.540 --> 17:09.090
and it's something we should all be rooting for

314
17:09.090 --> 17:12.734
and really cheering for its success.

315
17:12.734 --> 17:15.734
(audience applauds)

316
17:18.270 --> 17:21.330
<v ->Do you expect Elon Musk to use X</v>

317
17:21.330 --> 17:25.319
to advance his objectives for government efficiency?

318
17:25.319 --> 17:29.820
<v ->Well, I think there's open dialogue on the platform</v>

319
17:29.820 --> 17:34.820
and there's no more transparent user of X than Elon.

320
17:36.960 --> 17:40.980
And he shares all his thoughts and feelings

321
17:40.980 --> 17:43.621
and vision on what he thinks about everything

322
17:43.621 --> 17:48.030
in his real life and his views on the world.

323
17:48.030 --> 17:53.030
And actually think about that, that we encourage,

324
17:53.190 --> 17:57.060
we should encourage all business leaders,

325
17:57.060 --> 18:01.620
all government leaders to do exactly the same thing

326
18:01.620 --> 18:04.890
and share more, not less.

327
18:04.890 --> 18:06.210
Because whether it's Elon,

328
18:06.210 --> 18:09.240
whether it's you Catherine Herridge or me Lindy Yaccarino,

329
18:09.240 --> 18:12.840
we should exercise our own individual

330
18:12.840 --> 18:16.590
freedom of speech rights, but also our life experiences

331
18:16.590 --> 18:20.220
and what we'd like to share and inspire other people.

332
18:20.220 --> 18:23.220
I was really taken a couple of weeks ago,

333
18:23.220 --> 18:25.296
now that I think about it, if you saw,

334
18:25.296 --> 18:27.870
Elon was posting on the platform

335
18:27.870 --> 18:29.610
and having a real time conversation

336
18:29.610 --> 18:34.500
with Sundar about quantum computing, like in real time.

337
18:34.500 --> 18:35.790
If you haven't seen it, you gotta look it up,

338
18:35.790 --> 18:40.790
and I'm watching it going, "This is the power of X."

339
18:41.490 --> 18:44.910
So you have these business leaders, world leaders,

340
18:44.910 --> 18:47.910
we encourage them to share more, not less.

341
18:47.910 --> 18:51.480
So I think it's really with growth exploding

342
18:51.480 --> 18:52.590
all over the platform.

343
18:52.590 --> 18:54.840
And obviously, you talked about the election,

344
18:54.840 --> 18:59.840
a validation that free two-way lane street

345
18:59.850 --> 19:04.200
of accessibility to information, that's what people want.

346
19:04.200 --> 19:09.200
And that authenticity now more than ever is rewarded.

347
19:09.300 --> 19:12.240
It's rewarded by the people, Gen Z the most.

348
19:12.240 --> 19:15.210
They want you to bring your real self

349
19:15.210 --> 19:18.060
because they talk about the election

350
19:18.060 --> 19:22.830
as being a podcast and a X election.

351
19:22.830 --> 19:24.330
That's where that comes from

352
19:24.330 --> 19:28.050
because that authenticity is new table stakes.

353
19:28.050 --> 19:30.120
And I think that should inspire a lot of leaders

354
19:30.120 --> 19:32.520
all around the world to have at it.

355
19:32.520 --> 19:36.840
<v ->There's tremendous power in an Elon Musk post.</v>

356
19:36.840 --> 19:41.840
I had checked last night, he has over 211 million followers.

357
19:42.210 --> 19:45.240
And look at what's happened in the last week

358
19:45.240 --> 19:50.240
with the grooming gangs scandal in the UK.

359
19:51.756 --> 19:54.720
As CEO, does it cross any red lines

360
19:54.720 --> 19:58.350
when you start to see reporting about the UK Prime Minister

361
19:58.350 --> 20:01.800
considering changing the nature of the relationship

362
20:01.800 --> 20:03.990
between the UK and the US?

363
20:03.990 --> 20:08.990
<v ->Well first of all, I don't think about it as red lines.</v>

364
20:10.320 --> 20:13.230
I think about it in a different way, like I said,

365
20:13.230 --> 20:16.890
of really a different perspective.

366
20:16.890 --> 20:19.050
It's more than less.

367
20:19.050 --> 20:24.050
And what I would really say, as a mom, you are a mom,

368
20:24.150 --> 20:26.373
if not for X,

369
20:27.420 --> 20:31.320
where would the conversation be about

370
20:31.320 --> 20:36.320
to save thousands of girls to bring people to justice

371
20:37.470 --> 20:41.460
who must be brought to justice?

372
20:41.460 --> 20:45.150
So I say more than less,

373
20:45.150 --> 20:48.300
and those grooming trials would've stayed silent

374
20:48.300 --> 20:50.580
and now we're looking at an inquiry.

375
20:50.580 --> 20:54.240
So I look at bravery and vision

376
20:54.240 --> 20:56.400
and the courage to do that.

377
20:56.400 --> 20:59.070
So I think that, saving those girls,

378
20:59.070 --> 21:02.130
preventing any other girl in the world

379
21:02.130 --> 21:05.070
to be exposed to such sick depravity,

380
21:05.070 --> 21:07.410
as a mother, I ask all of you,

381
21:07.410 --> 21:09.693
that's what deserves a round of applause.

382
21:10.745 --> 21:13.745
(audience applauds)

383
21:15.453 --> 21:18.510
<v ->It is quite something to see these conversations</v>

384
21:18.510 --> 21:21.060
playing out in real time online

385
21:21.060 --> 21:25.008
and seeing responses from European leaders,

386
21:25.008 --> 21:26.820
alleging that Elon Musk

387
21:26.820 --> 21:30.960
is engaging in political interference or meddling.

388
21:30.960 --> 21:32.970
How do you respond to those-

389
21:32.970 --> 21:34.860
<v ->Did you say like peer leaders?</v>

390
21:34.860 --> 21:36.507
I'm sorry, I really didn't-
<v ->European, European leader.</v>

391
21:36.507 --> 21:40.350
<v ->Oh, European, I'm sorry. (laughs)</v>

392
21:40.350 --> 21:41.820
I really think it's interesting

393
21:41.820 --> 21:44.673
because I also, I was reading that in real time.

394
21:45.660 --> 21:48.420
I don't understand how that's interfering in elections.

395
21:48.420 --> 21:52.920
There's influential people all over the world,

396
21:52.920 --> 21:54.483
stating their points of view.

397
21:55.440 --> 21:57.900
Publications either endorse

398
21:57.900 --> 21:59.700
or state their points of view all the time.

399
21:59.700 --> 22:02.610
I saw a lot of that popping up,

400
22:02.610 --> 22:04.263
and it really isn't about that.

401
22:05.160 --> 22:09.600
It's about that it's a different point of view

402
22:09.600 --> 22:12.840
and it's not the current, I think,

403
22:12.840 --> 22:16.950
talking points of yesterday that was acceptable.

404
22:16.950 --> 22:20.340
And I go back to what I just said, if not for X,

405
22:20.340 --> 22:23.250
where would those girls and future girls be?

406
22:23.250 --> 22:26.493
So I say more, not less.

407
22:27.600 --> 22:31.110
<v ->X is the number one news app in how many countries now?</v>

408
22:31.110 --> 22:34.860
<v ->Oh my gosh. I think it's nearing a couple of hundred.</v>

409
22:34.860 --> 22:38.545
It's the number one news app in the world.

410
22:38.545 --> 22:40.923
<v ->And what do you think explains that?</v>

411
22:41.795 --> 22:44.100
<v ->I think it's pretty simple, right?</v>

412
22:44.100 --> 22:48.030
And it's the core foundational value of X,

413
22:48.030 --> 22:51.960
which is protecting the freedom of speech around the world.

414
22:51.960 --> 22:55.950
And when the freedom of speech is protected,

415
22:55.950 --> 23:00.360
democracies are able to be successful and thrive.

416
23:00.360 --> 23:03.630
And that means the global town square,

417
23:03.630 --> 23:06.690
which invites all walks of life

418
23:06.690 --> 23:09.400
to come and share their points of view

419
23:10.683 --> 23:13.530
is enabled and becomes popular.

420
23:13.530 --> 23:15.090
What it's also about

421
23:15.090 --> 23:19.800
is how technology has liberated information.

422
23:19.800 --> 23:23.370
You and I, we spent most of our careers at Legacy media-

423
23:23.370 --> 23:24.720
<v ->Correct.</v>
<v ->Right?</v>

424
23:24.720 --> 23:29.430
And what our jobs became was working within these boundaries

425
23:29.430 --> 23:32.190
of what legacy media was, the way I talk about it,

426
23:32.190 --> 23:35.268
like stacking the proverbial sandbags

427
23:35.268 --> 23:39.300
to try to prevent the future from overtaking us

428
23:39.300 --> 23:41.640
before it happened while we were there.

429
23:41.640 --> 23:45.120
Well, when you look at why has X

430
23:45.120 --> 23:49.050
become such a popular news app, it is because, right,

431
23:49.050 --> 23:51.030
I said I wanna go there,

432
23:51.030 --> 23:55.980
I wanna go where the free flow of information is encouraged,

433
23:55.980 --> 23:58.950
where the users are given the respect

434
23:58.950 --> 24:03.300
to make their own decisions and see both points of view.

435
24:03.300 --> 24:05.400
Can you see it now all kind of stitched together,

436
24:05.400 --> 24:08.130
coming together, community notes,

437
24:08.130 --> 24:12.750
the protection of free speech, all of this ad innovation.

438
24:12.750 --> 24:14.730
It was the vision all along.

439
24:14.730 --> 24:18.360
<v ->Well, it's very hard to argue with the data.</v>

440
24:18.360 --> 24:20.100
Let's talk about 2024.

441
24:20.100 --> 24:22.260
What were the watershed events

442
24:22.260 --> 24:24.753
in terms of engagements and the numbers?

443
24:25.650 --> 24:29.220
<v ->You know, I think there are a lot of watershed moments</v>

444
24:29.220 --> 24:30.720
for the platform.

445
24:30.720 --> 24:33.720
When I think about last year at this time,

446
24:33.720 --> 24:36.690
we were testifying in front of the US Senate

447
24:36.690 --> 24:41.040
about X's P zero priority

448
24:41.040 --> 24:44.040
of protecting children all around the world.

449
24:44.040 --> 24:46.320
And it gave everyone like a wake up call.

450
24:46.320 --> 24:50.160
We said, wow, there's real people at that new company,

451
24:50.160 --> 24:51.900
reshuffling priorities,

452
24:51.900 --> 24:54.120
and their priority is protecting children.

453
24:54.120 --> 24:56.130
But then when you kind of fast forward,

454
24:56.130 --> 24:59.280
let's talk about the last bunch of months,

455
24:59.280 --> 25:01.350
and you look about the watershed moments

456
25:01.350 --> 25:03.750
of the results of the election.

457
25:03.750 --> 25:08.340
All eyes were on X, three biggest days on the platform.

458
25:08.340 --> 25:12.181
Unfortunately the first assassination attempt

459
25:12.181 --> 25:17.181
on President Trump, you had election day, right?

460
25:17.970 --> 25:20.670
And you also had Biden stepping out of the race-

461
25:20.670 --> 25:22.050
<v ->In that window was a debate.</v>

462
25:22.050 --> 25:25.170
<v ->Yes, so the debate, it all came together</v>

463
25:25.170 --> 25:28.350
where there was the highest days of usage

464
25:28.350 --> 25:30.750
on the platform globally.

465
25:30.750 --> 25:34.230
And now you look at it and those seminal moments

466
25:34.230 --> 25:38.973
are still continuing because X has crossed into that,

467
25:40.200 --> 25:43.230
really no surrogate that could perform.

468
25:43.230 --> 25:46.320
You're watching the new government unfold, right?

469
25:46.320 --> 25:49.290
And you're seeing all the nominees announced,

470
25:49.290 --> 25:51.420
the background all of a sudden coming up,

471
25:51.420 --> 25:52.770
and you're watching it in real time,

472
25:52.770 --> 25:55.320
and I thought to myself, when this first started happening

473
25:55.320 --> 25:57.660
and President-elect Trump

474
25:57.660 --> 25:59.880
was starting to announce his nominees

475
25:59.880 --> 26:04.170
and I thought, wow, in real time, no surrogate for X,

476
26:04.170 --> 26:07.620
but this is really an example of a government

477
26:07.620 --> 26:10.080
of the people, by the people, for the people.

478
26:10.080 --> 26:11.280
I felt a part of it.

479
26:11.280 --> 26:13.830
And I think a lot of people share that view

480
26:13.830 --> 26:17.100
and that's where they come to X now to enjoy that,

481
26:17.100 --> 26:18.900
which is no surrogate.

482
26:18.900 --> 26:22.140
I need to find out what's happening and I need to check X.

483
26:22.140 --> 26:23.370
<v ->You mentioned this earlier,</v>

484
26:23.370 --> 26:25.530
it feels like 2024 was an election

485
26:25.530 --> 26:30.270
where X independent journalism podcasters, like Joe Rogan,

486
26:30.270 --> 26:32.700
really broke the back of traditional media,

487
26:32.700 --> 26:35.760
especially with "60 Minutes" in the presidential interviews.

488
26:35.760 --> 26:38.130
I don't think you would ever have expected four years ago

489
26:38.130 --> 26:41.010
that candidates would skip "60 Minutes."

490
26:41.010 --> 26:42.956
<v ->Yeah, I don't think they would've ever skipped</v>

491
26:42.956 --> 26:47.340
"60 Minutes" and there was no other platform

492
26:47.340 --> 26:50.400
that would encourage it, whether it was Joe Rogan

493
26:50.400 --> 26:52.200
and some of the other podcasts,

494
26:52.200 --> 26:53.970
or X certainly wouldn't have done it.

495
26:53.970 --> 26:55.920
And it's something we wear that,

496
26:55.920 --> 26:59.779
kind of that X badge of honor very proudly.

497
26:59.779 --> 27:04.779
<v ->In closing, in 2025, is there a single idea or concept</v>

498
27:06.180 --> 27:10.350
or technology that will take X to the next level?

499
27:10.350 --> 27:12.064
<v ->Oh goodness. What a question.</v>

500
27:12.064 --> 27:16.406
If there are any Xers in the room or watching,

501
27:16.406 --> 27:20.850
there's things that haven't been thought up yet,

502
27:20.850 --> 27:23.430
or maybe there's one person that thought of them already.

503
27:23.430 --> 27:26.160
So to predict '25, but I would say

504
27:26.160 --> 27:27.873
what's in front of us now,

505
27:28.980 --> 27:31.380
I would say two things that'll continue

506
27:31.380 --> 27:35.100
to just change the way any user

507
27:35.100 --> 27:37.980
comes to expect what a social media platform is,

508
27:37.980 --> 27:41.460
and I would talk about X money, right?

509
27:41.460 --> 27:44.250
Is going to change both payments

510
27:44.250 --> 27:49.140
and the opportunities creators on the platform forever.

511
27:49.140 --> 27:52.590
And then you have to talk about Grok, right?

512
27:52.590 --> 27:55.260
So those two things together,

513
27:55.260 --> 27:58.440
profound differentiation for our company

514
27:58.440 --> 28:02.340
and profoundly propelling us,

515
28:02.340 --> 28:04.590
like at breakneck speed into '25.

516
28:04.590 --> 28:06.720
<v ->Just in the final 10 seconds,</v>

517
28:06.720 --> 28:08.160
what do you think the engagement numbers

518
28:08.160 --> 28:10.350
will look like in 2025?

519
28:10.350 --> 28:12.873
<v ->A lot higher than they were in 2024.</v>

520
28:14.429 --> 28:16.980
<v ->All right, Linda Yaccarino, CES.</v>

521
28:16.980 --> 28:18.510
Thank you for the opportunity today.

522
28:18.510 --> 28:20.293
<v Linda>Thank you.</v>

523
28:20.293 --> 28:22.839
(audience applauds)

524
28:22.839 --> 28:26.256
Very well.
(upbeat music)
