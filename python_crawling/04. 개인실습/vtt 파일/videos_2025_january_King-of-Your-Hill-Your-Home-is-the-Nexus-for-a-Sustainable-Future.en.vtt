1
00:00.557 --> 00:04.057
(upbeat electronic music)

2
00:11.580 --> 00:15.210
<v ->I want to introduce an absolutely fantastic panel to you.</v>

3
00:15.210 --> 00:17.310
Today, we are talking about

4
00:17.310 --> 00:18.390
the home,

5
00:18.390 --> 00:19.620
where we live,

6
00:19.620 --> 00:22.020
and how it interacts with the world around us

7
00:22.020 --> 00:25.380
in very different ways than you may suspect,

8
00:25.380 --> 00:27.960
in terms of not only sustainability,

9
00:27.960 --> 00:29.730
energy efficiency,

10
00:29.730 --> 00:32.130
new extensions of the homes.

11
00:32.130 --> 00:35.790
And the panel is a rockstar group

12
00:35.790 --> 00:39.240
of executives at the highest level,

13
00:39.240 --> 00:41.820
who have worked on this problem

14
00:41.820 --> 00:44.100
and on this opportunity

15
00:44.100 --> 00:47.910
of the home as a lower carbon footprint world.

16
00:47.910 --> 00:50.010
So, I'm gonna let them introduce themselves.

17
00:50.010 --> 00:52.080
I'm gonna do a little framing for you,

18
00:52.080 --> 00:54.150
to give you a sense of background,

19
00:54.150 --> 00:55.823
and then we'll dive right in.

20
00:55.823 --> 00:58.400
So, let's go right through this.

21
00:58.400 --> 00:59.510
<v ->Yeah. Thank you.</v>

22
00:59.510 --> 01:00.813
Is this working? Yeah.

23
01:02.190 --> 01:03.660
Yeah, there we go. Thanks, John.

24
01:03.660 --> 01:04.493
I'm Nicole.

25
01:04.493 --> 01:07.380
I am VP of product at Savant Systems

26
01:07.380 --> 01:09.870
for all of our energy management products.

27
01:09.870 --> 01:11.730
Nice to be here, today.

28
01:11.730 --> 01:12.870
<v ->Great to see everyone, here.</v>

29
01:12.870 --> 01:14.340
I'm Greg Fyke,

30
01:14.340 --> 01:15.810
president and CEO for Ecobee,

31
01:15.810 --> 01:17.583
best known for smart thermostats.

32
01:18.780 --> 01:20.730
<v ->Hey everyone, I'm Katy Bolan</v>

33
01:20.730 --> 01:23.340
and I lead environmental sustainability

34
01:23.340 --> 01:25.740
in some of our product areas at Google.

35
01:25.740 --> 01:29.580
And I'm also an avid interior architect designer,

36
01:29.580 --> 01:32.703
focused on interior, focused on sustainability.

37
01:34.050 --> 01:35.850
<v ->Hello, everyone. I'm Bingrui Yang,</v>

38
01:35.850 --> 01:37.740
I'm the founder and CEO of Pebble.

39
01:37.740 --> 01:39.390
We are a startup

40
01:39.390 --> 01:41.940
that's building a all-electric travel trailer.

41
01:41.940 --> 01:44.010
We just launched it, two days ago, at CES.

42
01:44.010 --> 01:46.049
It's on display in West Hall.

43
01:46.049 --> 01:47.367
Great to meet you all.
<v ->Congratulations.</v>

44
01:47.367 --> 01:48.840
It's a great panel.

45
01:48.840 --> 01:52.080
Just to, you know, get one thing out there

46
01:52.080 --> 01:53.760
and I'm gonna do the context.

47
01:53.760 --> 01:56.700
I have had an Ecobee thermostat for about 10 years.

48
01:56.700 --> 02:00.150
And I know Bingrui for, you know, the last nine months.

49
02:00.150 --> 02:03.030
So, just so you know, I know them really well

50
02:03.030 --> 02:04.590
and I just wanted that out there

51
02:04.590 --> 02:07.080
because, while I'm fans of everybody's products

52
02:07.080 --> 02:08.130
on the panel,

53
02:08.130 --> 02:09.840
I just didn't want you to think

54
02:09.840 --> 02:11.790
I was biased in any way,

55
02:11.790 --> 02:14.040
but I'm biased to what every one of these people

56
02:14.040 --> 02:15.210
is working on.

57
02:15.210 --> 02:17.340
So, what we're gonna talk about today

58
02:17.340 --> 02:19.140
has to be put into a greater context.

59
02:19.140 --> 02:21.780
And in general, the greater context is

60
02:21.780 --> 02:23.580
that the world is heating up.

61
02:23.580 --> 02:25.200
So, about two and a half miles from my home,

62
02:25.200 --> 02:28.020
in Santa Monica now, there are huge fires

63
02:28.020 --> 02:31.230
that are engulfing very standard residential neighborhoods.

64
02:31.230 --> 02:34.110
If you live near water, anywhere in the world,

65
02:34.110 --> 02:39.060
you're seeing effects of weather and extreme events.

66
02:39.060 --> 02:42.150
And why this is happening is very simple,

67
02:42.150 --> 02:45.510
is that for the last a hundred plus years,

68
02:45.510 --> 02:48.990
we've taken dinosaurs and plants out of the ground,

69
02:48.990 --> 02:51.900
it's called fossil fuels, in many forms.

70
02:51.900 --> 02:56.900
And the CO2 that's emitted from converting those to energy

71
02:56.910 --> 02:59.760
and energy fuels economies, as they grow,

72
02:59.760 --> 03:02.550
has stayed in the atmosphere and does for a thousand years.

73
03:02.550 --> 03:05.160
So the planet is getting much, much, much warmer,

74
03:05.160 --> 03:08.523
warmer than most people actually know.

75
03:09.390 --> 03:12.000
The problem with that is

76
03:12.000 --> 03:15.570
that it increases what we're seeing right now.

77
03:15.570 --> 03:19.140
And what happens is, over time, things get worse.

78
03:19.140 --> 03:21.570
Now, the negative side of the story

79
03:21.570 --> 03:24.090
has to be framed in a different way,

80
03:24.090 --> 03:26.370
which is there's an opportunity here.

81
03:26.370 --> 03:29.640
One, to try and work to fix this problem.

82
03:29.640 --> 03:32.700
And the beautiful thing about the companies we have today,

83
03:32.700 --> 03:36.120
at least, within the environment we call the home,

84
03:36.120 --> 03:39.090
they are focused on reducing carbon

85
03:39.090 --> 03:41.250
and creating a more efficient home.

86
03:41.250 --> 03:43.830
Why this is really important is

87
03:43.830 --> 03:45.930
because in the US,

88
03:45.930 --> 03:50.930
we emit about 13% of all of those greenhouse gases

89
03:51.330 --> 03:52.590
from our home.

90
03:52.590 --> 03:55.260
And that's EPA number.

91
03:55.260 --> 03:57.510
It's only from the electricity

92
03:57.510 --> 04:00.540
and heating and cooling from fossil,

93
04:00.540 --> 04:03.180
more green energy going into that, better.

94
04:03.180 --> 04:07.440
So, the home is a really big focus of, you know,

95
04:07.440 --> 04:12.360
opportunity, but also issues to reduce carbon.

96
04:12.360 --> 04:14.370
The benefit that you have,

97
04:14.370 --> 04:16.410
when you see this as an opportunity,

98
04:16.410 --> 04:19.410
is you don't make yourself or your friends

99
04:19.410 --> 04:21.420
feel like that frog in the water,

100
04:21.420 --> 04:23.040
where it's getting warmer and warmer

101
04:23.040 --> 04:25.050
and there's nothing you can do about it.

102
04:25.050 --> 04:28.920
You actually see this as a huge, huge business opportunity.

103
04:28.920 --> 04:30.990
And we're gonna get into that a little today.

104
04:30.990 --> 04:32.130
Just so you know, the globe,

105
04:32.130 --> 04:35.520
and this is an IEA number, it's an energy agency,

106
04:35.520 --> 04:39.810
spends $2 trillion on just green energy inputs.

107
04:39.810 --> 04:41.880
That's not climate tech on top of that.

108
04:41.880 --> 04:45.000
And general estimates put it at four to five years,

109
04:45.000 --> 04:47.370
at $5 trillion a year.

110
04:47.370 --> 04:50.370
The market cap of the five largest companies in the world

111
04:50.370 --> 04:51.810
is $15 trillion.

112
04:51.810 --> 04:52.980
So, every three years,

113
04:52.980 --> 04:54.510
they're all tech companies, you know them,

114
04:54.510 --> 04:57.420
they're, every three years, we'll spend that on,

115
04:57.420 --> 04:59.190
obviously, saving ourselves from ourselves.

116
04:59.190 --> 05:02.490
But you have to think about that as the biggest investment

117
05:02.490 --> 05:05.280
and business opportunity in the history of humanity.

118
05:05.280 --> 05:09.120
And that's the part that is exciting,

119
05:09.120 --> 05:10.770
despite the difficulties.

120
05:10.770 --> 05:14.550
And these individuals have embraced that.

121
05:14.550 --> 05:15.630
And so, what I'd like to do,

122
05:15.630 --> 05:17.160
is I'd like it to turn to Nicole,

123
05:17.160 --> 05:19.560
because Nicole has a whole-home vision,

124
05:19.560 --> 05:20.850
as we'll hear from others.

125
05:20.850 --> 05:23.040
And maybe just take it, in what you're seeing

126
05:23.040 --> 05:26.040
and what you're doing, in regards to the home as a-

127
05:26.040 --> 05:27.450
<v ->Yeah, absolutely. Thank you, John.</v>

128
05:27.450 --> 05:31.140
So, a core part of energy management for the home

129
05:31.140 --> 05:34.290
comes down to improving energy efficiency.

130
05:34.290 --> 05:35.910
And so, what that really means is

131
05:35.910 --> 05:38.640
reducing energy consumption in the home,

132
05:38.640 --> 05:41.610
while maintaining comfort and convenience.

133
05:41.610 --> 05:43.500
And then, there's an added benefit, as well,

134
05:43.500 --> 05:45.720
of saving money on your utility bill.

135
05:45.720 --> 05:49.470
And so, Savant looks at this in a few different ways,

136
05:49.470 --> 05:52.080
but starting with a really great

137
05:52.080 --> 05:54.180
simple approach to start with,

138
05:54.180 --> 05:56.670
is just giving users a way to know

139
05:56.670 --> 05:58.350
how much energy they're consuming,

140
05:58.350 --> 06:00.360
how they're consuming it throughout the day,

141
06:00.360 --> 06:03.540
what appliances or systems are taking up that power

142
06:03.540 --> 06:05.040
that they're getting, you know,

143
06:05.040 --> 06:06.480
you're getting your bill at the end of the month

144
06:06.480 --> 06:08.340
and you see the number, the dollar amount,

145
06:08.340 --> 06:09.660
maybe you see the kilowatt hours,

146
06:09.660 --> 06:11.850
but you don't really know where it's come from.

147
06:11.850 --> 06:15.030
And so, Savant has an energy-management product

148
06:15.030 --> 06:17.130
that goes into your electric panel,

149
06:17.130 --> 06:19.230
your standard panel that you have in your home.

150
06:19.230 --> 06:21.993
And we can monitor how much power you're consuming,

151
06:22.950 --> 06:24.840
the total consumption you're consuming,

152
06:24.840 --> 06:27.450
and also on a circuit-level basis,

153
06:27.450 --> 06:29.850
as well as being able to control those circuits.

154
06:29.850 --> 06:32.010
So, this is a really great, easy way.

155
06:32.010 --> 06:34.020
You can go in to our mobile app,

156
06:34.020 --> 06:36.900
see, you know, I've consumed my,

157
06:36.900 --> 06:38.850
my kitchen appliances more this month.

158
06:38.850 --> 06:41.430
Why was that? Is there a way I could be better there?

159
06:41.430 --> 06:42.540
<v John>Mm.</v>

160
06:42.540 --> 06:45.120
<v ->And another, another approach we take is</v>

161
06:45.120 --> 06:47.670
controlling those items in the home.

162
06:47.670 --> 06:50.850
So, even just by knowing you've, where you're consuming,

163
06:50.850 --> 06:52.560
you can be more conscious,

164
06:52.560 --> 06:54.330
but you can also use software

165
06:54.330 --> 06:55.950
to improve your day-to-day life

166
06:55.950 --> 06:59.310
by scheduling your usage, based on when you're,

167
06:59.310 --> 07:01.380
maybe not at home or you're on vacation

168
07:01.380 --> 07:03.330
or there's a certain part of your house

169
07:03.330 --> 07:05.550
that doesn't need to be running at these times of day.

170
07:05.550 --> 07:09.300
And so we have a smart lighting line, product line,

171
07:09.300 --> 07:12.900
where we can automate when lights are on or off in the home.

172
07:12.900 --> 07:15.810
We also, with our energy-management product,

173
07:15.810 --> 07:19.230
can connect up to anything you have coming out of your panel

174
07:19.230 --> 07:21.720
to automate, maybe it's your dryer,

175
07:21.720 --> 07:24.420
maybe it's your electric car charger.

176
07:24.420 --> 07:26.340
And so, these are all really great ways

177
07:26.340 --> 07:28.020
that are approachable.

178
07:28.020 --> 07:30.000
And you don't have to do all of these things.

179
07:30.000 --> 07:31.650
You can, sort of, pick and choose

180
07:31.650 --> 07:33.843
what's right for you, in your home.

181
07:34.920 --> 07:37.140
<v ->So, just one thing I wanted to say about that,</v>

182
07:37.140 --> 07:39.660
for the audience, is if you think about activity trackers,

183
07:39.660 --> 07:41.130
before we had activity trackers,

184
07:41.130 --> 07:42.480
once you get activity trackers,

185
07:42.480 --> 07:45.180
you know, roughly, how much you're moving or not.

186
07:45.180 --> 07:48.150
If you have data, you can actually change behavior.

187
07:48.150 --> 07:50.100
And I just loved what you said, too,

188
07:50.100 --> 07:52.350
that the behavior is cost saving, as well.

189
07:52.350 --> 07:54.390
So, it's all beneficial.

190
07:54.390 --> 07:56.340
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

191
07:56.340 --> 07:58.200
<v ->No, that's great.</v>
<v ->Interject that.</v>

192
07:58.200 --> 07:59.640
But

193
07:59.640 --> 08:00.630
there's,

194
08:00.630 --> 08:03.270
at Ecobee, there's a similar,

195
08:03.270 --> 08:05.580
not the same way of looking at it,

196
08:05.580 --> 08:08.040
but the two of you speaking together,

197
08:08.040 --> 08:10.653
I think, will really drive this point to the next level.

198
08:10.653 --> 08:11.550
<v ->Yep.</v>
<v ->So Greg,</v>

199
08:11.550 --> 08:12.480
can you tell us about it?

200
08:12.480 --> 08:13.313
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

201
08:13.313 --> 08:15.180
I think, the part I would really,

202
08:15.180 --> 08:18.060
kind of, follow up on Nicole's point is a key word,

203
08:18.060 --> 08:19.770
simple and simplicity.

204
08:19.770 --> 08:21.000
<v ->Yep.</v>

205
08:21.000 --> 08:21.833
<v ->One of the things,</v>

206
08:21.833 --> 08:25.140
like the greatest path to simplicity that we'd see is that

207
08:25.140 --> 08:27.630
with the increased complexity of energy,

208
08:27.630 --> 08:29.100
we have now, time of use,

209
08:29.100 --> 08:31.380
billing rates that are getting a lot more complex.

210
08:31.380 --> 08:33.510
They're increasing in costs,

211
08:33.510 --> 08:35.130
you're having greater power outages,

212
08:35.130 --> 08:38.760
and the overall, kind of, the increased demand on the grid,

213
08:38.760 --> 08:41.730
customers, fundamentally, it's a bit overwhelming for them.

214
08:41.730 --> 08:44.490
And so, one of the core things that we can all do

215
08:44.490 --> 08:46.740
is to try and make these solutions

216
08:46.740 --> 08:49.290
that are geared towards sustainability,

217
08:49.290 --> 08:50.670
ultimately, simple to use.

218
08:50.670 --> 08:54.630
And what that leads to is a lot greater use for customers.

219
08:54.630 --> 08:56.190
It takes all of that complexity away

220
08:56.190 --> 08:59.100
and leads to, ultimately, greater usage of

221
08:59.100 --> 09:01.080
these solutions that we can provide

222
09:01.080 --> 09:03.900
that reduce carbon emissions,

223
09:03.900 --> 09:05.790
ultimately, make the planet more sustainable,

224
09:05.790 --> 09:07.110
and it's a really critical component

225
09:07.110 --> 09:08.370
of the work that we actually do.

226
09:08.370 --> 09:09.203
<v ->That's fantastic.</v>

227
09:09.203 --> 09:12.570
'Cause when you think, too, about what

228
09:12.570 --> 09:15.000
I have seen out in the market,

229
09:15.000 --> 09:17.310
the complexity in so much of this

230
09:17.310 --> 09:19.200
is really the friction point.

231
09:19.200 --> 09:21.630
And the cost savings versus the complexity

232
09:21.630 --> 09:25.050
are a psychological barrier for so many people.

233
09:25.050 --> 09:28.350
It's now great to save costs, but it could be very complex.

234
09:28.350 --> 09:30.120
One of the things that's fascinating

235
09:30.120 --> 09:32.820
is when you take a point of view of solving

236
09:32.820 --> 09:34.560
really big wicked problems,

237
09:34.560 --> 09:35.637
where there was a lot of complexity

238
09:35.637 --> 09:37.230
and you make it simple,

239
09:37.230 --> 09:40.560
you reinvent how people think about a category,

240
09:40.560 --> 09:42.720
a product or the home.

241
09:42.720 --> 09:44.520
And I have to say, I would love, Bingrui,

242
09:44.520 --> 09:47.700
for you to talk a little bit about your journey,

243
09:47.700 --> 09:51.180
because I see a lot of that in what you're doing.

244
09:51.180 --> 09:52.013
<v ->That's right. Yeah.</v>

245
09:52.013 --> 09:53.490
So, we're a bit of in the

246
09:53.490 --> 09:55.680
similar but different category here.

247
09:55.680 --> 09:59.850
So, a lot of people get to know Pebble in the last two years

248
09:59.850 --> 10:02.940
as the RV, the travel trailer company.

249
10:02.940 --> 10:04.830
We've designed and built

250
10:04.830 --> 10:06.750
and unveiled, two days ago,

251
10:06.750 --> 10:08.910
an all-electric, smart travel trailer,

252
10:08.910 --> 10:10.080
it's got a large battery,

253
10:10.080 --> 10:12.570
it's got solar, over the entire roof.

254
10:12.570 --> 10:14.250
Everything it runs off the battery.

255
10:14.250 --> 10:16.320
So, it's sustainable.

256
10:16.320 --> 10:19.800
A lot of people look at us as an RV company,

257
10:19.800 --> 10:22.500
but really a lot what people, most of them,

258
10:22.500 --> 10:24.210
they don't know is Pebble is actually

259
10:24.210 --> 10:26.190
a sustainable living company.

260
10:26.190 --> 10:28.560
And we are thinking this in a different way,

261
10:28.560 --> 10:31.260
that home is not just your house,

262
10:31.260 --> 10:32.430
your apartment.

263
10:32.430 --> 10:35.250
Home is anywhere you're staying at.

264
10:35.250 --> 10:38.100
That can be a camper, can be a travel trailer.

265
10:38.100 --> 10:40.410
So, what we have developed is this, essentially,

266
10:40.410 --> 10:43.770
extension of your home that you can park this Pebble Flow,

267
10:43.770 --> 10:46.230
which is a flagship product, at your home,

268
10:46.230 --> 10:48.030
on your driveway or backyard.

269
10:48.030 --> 10:50.520
It's got three times the size of the Tesla Powerwall,

270
10:50.520 --> 10:52.200
in terms of battery capacity.

271
10:52.200 --> 10:54.150
You can power your home in a blackout.

272
10:54.150 --> 10:57.360
It has solar panel to generate renewable energy.

273
10:57.360 --> 10:59.460
And then you can use this as an ADU.

274
10:59.460 --> 11:02.670
And we have heat pump systems for air conditioning.

275
11:02.670 --> 11:07.260
So, it's really the golden standard, when it comes to

276
11:07.260 --> 11:09.390
electrification and sustainability.

277
11:09.390 --> 11:10.980
<v ->And the beauty is that, you know,</v>

278
11:10.980 --> 11:13.350
you start to integrate these ideas.

279
11:13.350 --> 11:15.900
And you know, one piece of this is,

280
11:15.900 --> 11:18.840
what is, you know, product? What is service?

281
11:18.840 --> 11:21.810
And how does it interact with all the other systems?

282
11:21.810 --> 11:24.690
The energy system, if specifically, electricity,

283
11:24.690 --> 11:26.940
if you're not aware, doesn't have an ability

284
11:26.940 --> 11:28.980
to store in the middle of the network.

285
11:28.980 --> 11:33.210
So, load is balanced by increasing production of power.

286
11:33.210 --> 11:36.570
Usually, fossil in the United States, it's 80% fossil

287
11:36.570 --> 11:38.580
for electricity generation.

288
11:38.580 --> 11:41.490
And if they need more power, they crank up fossil.

289
11:41.490 --> 11:43.200
But when you have batteries

290
11:43.200 --> 11:45.840
or other types of storage in the middle,

291
11:45.840 --> 11:48.060
these new technologies

292
11:48.060 --> 11:52.440
and greener ways of approaching things become available.

293
11:52.440 --> 11:55.770
So, the home is the edge of a network,

294
11:55.770 --> 11:57.360
which is really an exciting place

295
11:57.360 --> 12:00.660
to think about energy saving, energy storage,

296
12:00.660 --> 12:02.490
to mitigate what you may have read about,

297
12:02.490 --> 12:04.890
which is the difficulty in reinvesting

298
12:04.890 --> 12:06.660
and reinventing our grid.

299
12:06.660 --> 12:08.100
Now, the home is also a place

300
12:08.100 --> 12:10.230
where people buy products and services.

301
12:10.230 --> 12:12.060
And that's a classic,

302
12:12.060 --> 12:15.090
Americans buy a lot of products and services.

303
12:15.090 --> 12:15.923
So,

304
12:17.430 --> 12:19.770
Katy, I'd love to turn it to you,

305
12:19.770 --> 12:22.290
to talk about, what's the thinking around

306
12:22.290 --> 12:25.080
when you're offering a very high value

307
12:25.080 --> 12:27.570
product or service, into the home?

308
12:27.570 --> 12:31.527
And how does the sustainability angle fit into that for you

309
12:31.527 --> 12:34.140
and what you're doing at Google TV?

310
12:34.140 --> 12:36.000
<v ->Yeah, so for Google TV,</v>

311
12:36.000 --> 12:39.150
and for those of you who don't know, a Google TV is,

312
12:39.150 --> 12:41.730
you know, you can buy, like, Sony with Google TV

313
12:41.730 --> 12:43.590
or you can buy a Dongle

314
12:43.590 --> 12:46.470
to make your existing TV

315
12:46.470 --> 12:47.550
a Google TV.

316
12:47.550 --> 12:49.980
And it's a launcher interface

317
12:49.980 --> 12:53.490
that allows you to access all your streaming networks

318
12:53.490 --> 12:57.570
and live TV in one place and search through it.

319
12:57.570 --> 13:01.560
So, we're just the operating system really, right?

320
13:01.560 --> 13:04.920
So, I work with engineers, directly,

321
13:04.920 --> 13:08.040
on things like energy efficiencies and whatnot.

322
13:08.040 --> 13:11.610
But we have manufacturing partners like Sony

323
13:11.610 --> 13:14.043
and LG and Hisense and whatnot,

324
13:15.030 --> 13:16.860
who produce these TVs.

325
13:16.860 --> 13:21.630
And we work with them on things like sustainable packaging

326
13:21.630 --> 13:24.510
and materials manufacturing and whatnot.

327
13:24.510 --> 13:27.450
It's all about the user experience, right?

328
13:27.450 --> 13:30.690
This is consumer electronics that we're dealing with

329
13:30.690 --> 13:34.110
and every portion of it has to do with

330
13:34.110 --> 13:36.450
the user experience with the product.

331
13:36.450 --> 13:37.800
And in my opinion,

332
13:37.800 --> 13:39.780
if it's not sustainable

333
13:39.780 --> 13:43.680
then it's a terrible product user experience.

334
13:43.680 --> 13:47.887
And so, we are looking at the full circularity of,

335
13:47.887 --> 13:49.320
of the Google TV experience,

336
13:49.320 --> 13:51.180
among our other products, as well,

337
13:51.180 --> 13:53.430
that we also support.

338
13:53.430 --> 13:58.050
But for Google TV, recently we launched, like, energy modes,

339
13:58.050 --> 14:00.240
which gives users the option

340
14:00.240 --> 14:04.050
to reduce their power consumption when the TV's in standby.

341
14:04.050 --> 14:06.150
Most consumers don't know this,

342
14:06.150 --> 14:08.940
but when your TV appears to be off,

343
14:08.940 --> 14:10.530
it is actually not off

344
14:10.530 --> 14:13.290
and it is consuming, potentially,

345
14:13.290 --> 14:14.970
substantial amounts of power,

346
14:14.970 --> 14:19.860
in some TVs it's consuming almost as much as if it were on.

347
14:19.860 --> 14:21.450
And that's not fair,

348
14:21.450 --> 14:23.910
I don't think most people want that experience

349
14:23.910 --> 14:25.500
and don't wanna be paying for something

350
14:25.500 --> 14:29.220
that they're not imminently using, for no reason.

351
14:29.220 --> 14:33.690
So, we're really focused on giving users the option,

352
14:33.690 --> 14:35.340
you know, you make the decision,

353
14:35.340 --> 14:36.660
the options are here for you,

354
14:36.660 --> 14:39.687
whatever suits your home lifestyle.

355
14:39.687 --> 14:40.520
<v John>Mm-hmm.</v>

356
14:40.520 --> 14:43.710
<v ->But if we're introducing features like "Always On,"</v>

357
14:43.710 --> 14:45.480
we wanna do it responsibly

358
14:45.480 --> 14:48.900
and provide those options that will, you know,

359
14:48.900 --> 14:51.420
help you make the more sustainable choices.

360
14:51.420 --> 14:54.600
Now, at the scale of Google and Google products,

361
14:54.600 --> 14:58.080
there, you know, we have millions and billions of users,

362
14:58.080 --> 15:00.810
across the different product areas.

363
15:00.810 --> 15:04.293
One lever can have massive effects, so,

364
15:05.250 --> 15:06.690
not an official quote,

365
15:06.690 --> 15:10.800
but if I reduce the brightness of the TV by 5%,

366
15:10.800 --> 15:13.560
across all Google TVs,

367
15:13.560 --> 15:16.540
we may be collectively able to reduce

368
15:17.730 --> 15:21.540
the equivalent of 5 million cars off the road, per year.

369
15:21.540 --> 15:23.070
<v ->So, Katy brings a great point</v>

370
15:23.070 --> 15:24.270
and I loved hearing about that,

371
15:24.270 --> 15:26.250
which is, when you're thinking about the home

372
15:26.250 --> 15:28.710
and products and services, that was a great product example,

373
15:28.710 --> 15:30.690
it's a systems thinking approach.

374
15:30.690 --> 15:33.630
So, it's not just the home, it's what leads into the home.

375
15:33.630 --> 15:36.510
So, on the other side of the TV and your smartphone

376
15:36.510 --> 15:39.030
or data centers and they use a lot of power.

377
15:39.030 --> 15:42.870
So, you start to see that these companies, as evidence here,

378
15:42.870 --> 15:45.030
think about it as a complete system,

379
15:45.030 --> 15:47.280
versus the very transactional model

380
15:47.280 --> 15:48.690
of just selling products,

381
15:48.690 --> 15:51.210
that was like the 10 or 15-year-old way.

382
15:51.210 --> 15:53.610
So, this is really cool that there's, sort of like,

383
15:53.610 --> 15:56.040
a fingerprint now around the home

384
15:56.040 --> 15:57.000
and what's going on,

385
15:57.000 --> 15:59.400
and at both product and at a broader level.

386
15:59.400 --> 16:01.890
So, turning to,

387
16:01.890 --> 16:03.300
I think something that, you know,

388
16:03.300 --> 16:06.630
has been on a lot of people's minds lately,

389
16:06.630 --> 16:08.877
which is, you know, energy consumption

390
16:08.877 --> 16:12.360
and the cost of energy has gone up, dramatically.

391
16:12.360 --> 16:14.130
And we were talking before,

392
16:14.130 --> 16:16.590
if it can be electrified, it should.

393
16:16.590 --> 16:18.690
You know, I'm gonna just throw this open

394
16:18.690 --> 16:21.000
to anybody who wants to pick this up.

395
16:21.000 --> 16:22.650
But, how, when you're thinking about

396
16:22.650 --> 16:24.000
managing what you're doing,

397
16:24.000 --> 16:26.430
are you thinking completely from

398
16:26.430 --> 16:28.770
supply of energy, all the way down?

399
16:28.770 --> 16:30.465
Or maybe you're not, and you know,

400
16:30.465 --> 16:32.010
you mentioned simplicity and the like.

401
16:32.010 --> 16:34.530
But can you talk a little bit more about, sort of,

402
16:34.530 --> 16:37.410
the electrification of our world that's going on,

403
16:37.410 --> 16:41.220
in terms of, the consumer seeing the benefits of it?

404
16:41.220 --> 16:43.473
And I'm not asking an EV question,

405
16:44.520 --> 16:46.050
Pebble notwithstanding,

406
16:46.050 --> 16:48.690
it's not an EV, but I am, sort of,

407
16:48.690 --> 16:50.580
asking more on the level of

408
16:50.580 --> 16:52.890
looking at the home data and the like.

409
16:52.890 --> 16:54.660
<v ->If I could start just to.</v>
<v ->That's fine, sure.</v>

410
16:54.660 --> 16:56.370
<v ->Yeah, follow on.</v>
<v ->Oh yeah, sure.</v>

411
16:56.370 --> 16:57.660
<v ->From Katy's question a bit here,</v>

412
16:57.660 --> 16:58.733
but it's related to that.
<v ->Please.</v>

413
16:58.733 --> 17:03.030
<v ->And that is, you use packaging as an example and,</v>

414
17:03.030 --> 17:04.680
we talked about systems.

415
17:04.680 --> 17:08.880
One of the really, really powerful things that can happen,

416
17:08.880 --> 17:10.620
actually transformative in a company,

417
17:10.620 --> 17:12.810
is when you incorporate sustainability thinking,

418
17:12.810 --> 17:14.850
early on into that process.
<v ->Yes.</v>

419
17:14.850 --> 17:16.320
<v ->And so, the simple thing,</v>

420
17:16.320 --> 17:18.280
even like the choice of packaging

421
17:19.200 --> 17:20.280
can have a profound impact,

422
17:20.280 --> 17:22.500
not only on the materials that you use,

423
17:22.500 --> 17:24.810
the choice of inks that actually kind of reduce,

424
17:24.810 --> 17:27.300
and make the planet more sustainable,

425
17:27.300 --> 17:30.510
but it also can save costs, as well.

426
17:30.510 --> 17:32.580
We, for example, at Ecobee, in some of our products

427
17:32.580 --> 17:35.130
for both thermostats and our cameras.

428
17:35.130 --> 17:38.670
We use tapioca in some of our, no jokes.

429
17:38.670 --> 17:40.560
So tapioca and some of our trays.

430
17:40.560 --> 17:41.940
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->And it's,</v>

431
17:41.940 --> 17:43.200
it's both locally sourced,

432
17:43.200 --> 17:45.090
from the areas where we're getting supply,

433
17:45.090 --> 17:47.250
it is lower cost, it's a great product

434
17:47.250 --> 17:48.630
and we still make the experience

435
17:48.630 --> 17:50.130
that you get out of the box

436
17:50.130 --> 17:52.080
to be a delightful experience,

437
17:52.080 --> 17:54.150
<v John>Smart thermostat and dessert, too.</v>

438
17:54.150 --> 17:56.070
<v ->And it comes back to, so coming back to</v>

439
17:56.070 --> 17:57.600
that system thinking,

440
17:57.600 --> 17:59.010
one of the core things that, you know,

441
17:59.010 --> 18:00.270
I'd love for the audience to take away,

442
18:00.270 --> 18:02.520
is just this idea of really

443
18:02.520 --> 18:05.610
shifting sustainability left in your organization.

444
18:05.610 --> 18:08.370
Because that can lead to, frankly, much better decisions.

445
18:08.370 --> 18:09.870
And it's really not a compromise.

446
18:09.870 --> 18:12.510
It's a path to ultimately lead to

447
18:12.510 --> 18:14.220
better products and solutions,

448
18:14.220 --> 18:15.930
better experiences for our customers

449
18:15.930 --> 18:17.482
and less waste, as well.

450
18:17.482 --> 18:19.020
<v Katy>Can I pick up on that?</v>

451
18:19.020 --> 18:22.065
<v ->I just wanna. Go ahead, if it's something.</v>

452
18:22.065 --> 18:24.390
<v ->I just wanna stay on the packaging for a moment.</v>

453
18:24.390 --> 18:25.860
<v ->Can I take it away from the packaging?</v>

454
18:25.860 --> 18:27.600
'Cause the initial question, I'll come back to it.

455
18:27.600 --> 18:28.433
<v ->Okay.</v>
<v ->'Cause I have a thought</v>

456
18:28.433 --> 18:30.510
on the packaging, that you can pick up on.

457
18:30.510 --> 18:32.100
So, do you want to talk a little bit

458
18:32.100 --> 18:33.570
about the electrification,

459
18:33.570 --> 18:35.700
sort of, home piece?

460
18:35.700 --> 18:37.203
<v ->Yeah, absolutely. So,</v>

461
18:38.344 --> 18:40.800
and the original, sort of, question around

462
18:40.800 --> 18:42.720
energy management and energy efficiency,

463
18:42.720 --> 18:46.140
and how can I be more energy efficient, as a homeowner,

464
18:46.140 --> 18:48.420
or as a tenant?

465
18:48.420 --> 18:52.080
One great way is by electrifying your home.

466
18:52.080 --> 18:54.720
And again, that can be very overwhelming.

467
18:54.720 --> 18:57.660
What does that, what are my options? How do I do that?

468
18:57.660 --> 19:01.020
But people are putting in new electric heat pumps

469
19:01.020 --> 19:04.200
and you know, they're switching to an electric vehicle

470
19:04.200 --> 19:05.070
and they're charging at home.

471
19:05.070 --> 19:07.470
<v ->Dryers with heat pumps.</v>
<v ->Electric dryers.</v>

472
19:07.470 --> 19:11.130
Savant actually has a partnership with GE appliances.

473
19:11.130 --> 19:13.500
And so, they have a really incredible product line

474
19:13.500 --> 19:15.780
of energy-efficient electric appliances

475
19:15.780 --> 19:17.880
for the kitchen, the dryer.

476
19:17.880 --> 19:18.713
<v ->Right.</v>
<v ->They have an</v>

477
19:18.713 --> 19:21.630
electric water heater product that you can,

478
19:21.630 --> 19:24.120
again, similar to what Katy was saying

479
19:24.120 --> 19:27.240
with energy modes and being conscious about

480
19:27.240 --> 19:30.450
the mode that your appliance or your device is running in.

481
19:30.450 --> 19:32.640
It can be put into a vacation mode,

482
19:32.640 --> 19:36.780
where you're away and it's consuming less and

483
19:36.780 --> 19:39.270
cool features, where you can supercharge the water

484
19:39.270 --> 19:42.390
at certain times of day, when electricity is less expensive,

485
19:42.390 --> 19:45.000
with time of use coming into play.

486
19:45.000 --> 19:47.640
And then using that water later,

487
19:47.640 --> 19:49.980
when electricity prices are higher.

488
19:49.980 --> 19:52.230
So, these are really great ways that are

489
19:52.230 --> 19:54.000
different options that people can start

490
19:54.000 --> 19:56.220
bringing into their homes to electrify,

491
19:56.220 --> 19:58.857
be more energy efficient, be more energy conscious.

492
19:58.857 --> 20:00.330
<v ->And we're gonna go to packaging</v>

493
20:00.330 --> 20:02.310
before I say one thing, which is,

494
20:02.310 --> 20:05.400
we have designed our use of energy

495
20:05.400 --> 20:08.820
for the traditional model of fossil,

496
20:08.820 --> 20:11.190
exactly the opposite of how you would want it

497
20:11.190 --> 20:13.590
for when we're talking about green energy.

498
20:13.590 --> 20:17.130
We tell people to save energy by doing things at night

499
20:17.130 --> 20:18.960
and there's something called a duck curve,

500
20:18.960 --> 20:21.210
which between 10 and two in the afternoon

501
20:21.210 --> 20:22.560
is when we have the most energy.

502
20:22.560 --> 20:25.440
California ran a hundred percent green

503
20:25.440 --> 20:26.730
off of the entire grid,

504
20:26.730 --> 20:28.440
for the fifth largest economy in the world,

505
20:28.440 --> 20:30.090
a hundred days last year.

506
20:30.090 --> 20:34.890
So, this point about realigning the psychology of consumers,

507
20:34.890 --> 20:37.200
it was mentioned in time of use by Greg,

508
20:37.200 --> 20:38.350
which is the

509
20:39.270 --> 20:41.250
old metrics for use at night, and not.

510
20:41.250 --> 20:43.560
This is really, really impactful.

511
20:43.560 --> 20:48.000
So, little things add up to big, as Katy said before.

512
20:48.000 --> 20:49.260
Katy, you wanna go back to the piece?

513
20:49.260 --> 20:52.920
<v ->Yeah, I'll give a quick food for thought on packaging.</v>

514
20:52.920 --> 20:56.280
And then, I've got something on data for you.

515
20:56.280 --> 20:57.880
How about, how about that, John?

516
20:59.520 --> 21:01.380
On packaging, you know, as,

517
21:01.380 --> 21:05.070
your product, as a consumer electronics producer,

518
21:05.070 --> 21:08.520
is not just the electronics, it includes the packaging.

519
21:08.520 --> 21:11.970
I mean, how many unboxing videos and things are out there?

520
21:11.970 --> 21:14.520
It's really the first experience

521
21:14.520 --> 21:17.490
the user has with your product, is the package.

522
21:17.490 --> 21:21.090
And so, if you think about what you're giving your customer

523
21:21.090 --> 21:22.920
to deal with,

524
21:22.920 --> 21:25.800
you might consider making that

525
21:25.800 --> 21:27.930
a frustration-free experience.

526
21:27.930 --> 21:30.510
And part of that is being plastic free

527
21:30.510 --> 21:33.420
because in so many municipalities,

528
21:33.420 --> 21:36.390
it's really difficult to recycle things.

529
21:36.390 --> 21:38.640
So, like, if you think about a TV

530
21:38.640 --> 21:40.650
with all the styrofoam in the box,

531
21:40.650 --> 21:43.890
the unboxing experience can be really awful.

532
21:43.890 --> 21:44.784
<v John>Right.</v>

533
21:44.784 --> 21:47.070
Only 10% of plastic in the United States is recycled,

534
21:47.070 --> 21:49.890
which is the supporting, keep going. I'm sorry.

535
21:49.890 --> 21:51.660
<v ->And then there's even questions around around that.</v>

536
21:51.660 --> 21:54.540
But, so, in some places where

537
21:54.540 --> 21:58.020
you're expected to sort your trash at home,

538
21:58.020 --> 21:59.970
you know, it can take weeks

539
21:59.970 --> 22:03.393
to finally get rid of that TV trash.

540
22:04.560 --> 22:06.270
So, think about the experience that

541
22:06.270 --> 22:09.330
your user would have at home

542
22:09.330 --> 22:12.750
if they had to keep all of their trash on their property.

543
22:12.750 --> 22:14.940
Like, what do you think they would want

544
22:14.940 --> 22:17.820
or what would you want to have on your property

545
22:17.820 --> 22:19.020
to have to deal with?

546
22:19.020 --> 22:20.850
Piles of plastic garbages

547
22:20.850 --> 22:23.220
or, like, cardboard and things that you can

548
22:23.220 --> 22:24.963
take care of and compost?

549
22:26.100 --> 22:27.120
<v ->So can.</v>
<v ->That's the visual</v>

550
22:27.120 --> 22:29.370
I live with, is if I had to keep all the trash

551
22:29.370 --> 22:30.360
on my property.

552
22:30.360 --> 22:31.193
<v ->That's a good point because</v>

553
22:31.193 --> 22:32.130
we used to ship it around the world

554
22:32.130 --> 22:33.960
and we can't do that anymore.

555
22:33.960 --> 22:35.640
And before we go to data,

556
22:35.640 --> 22:37.290
it just brought a thought into my head

557
22:37.290 --> 22:38.440
and Bingrui, you can

558
22:40.740 --> 22:42.960
tell the audience about what this was like.

559
22:42.960 --> 22:47.130
You really reimagined a vision of living,

560
22:47.130 --> 22:49.260
starting with a white sheet of paper.

561
22:49.260 --> 22:51.810
And it's extraordinary, 'cause it was only,

562
22:51.810 --> 22:53.513
roughly, two and a half, three years ago.

563
22:53.513 --> 22:54.346
<v Bingrui>That's right.</v>

564
22:54.346 --> 22:56.010
<v ->So, can you tell us, sort of,</v>

565
22:56.010 --> 22:58.590
what were the pieces you were thinking about,

566
22:58.590 --> 23:01.080
in terms of, when you have a white sheet of paper?

567
23:01.080 --> 23:03.600
'Cause they also inform everything that everybody else says

568
23:03.600 --> 23:05.160
and now, Katy, you can see,

569
23:05.160 --> 23:07.360
I'm gonna go back to data, in a second. So.

570
23:07.360 --> 23:08.193
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

571
23:08.193 --> 23:09.960
<v ->So, I would just take a step back.</v>

572
23:09.960 --> 23:11.520
I think we've,

573
23:11.520 --> 23:14.160
humans have lived for hundreds of years,

574
23:14.160 --> 23:15.840
more or less, in the same way.

575
23:15.840 --> 23:17.100
<v ->Mm-hmm.</v>
<v ->We think of a home</v>

576
23:17.100 --> 23:20.460
the same way as we thought about home decades ago.

577
23:20.460 --> 23:22.650
But COVID really gave a systematic shock

578
23:22.650 --> 23:24.480
to the entire world.

579
23:24.480 --> 23:26.550
when you think about how you live,

580
23:26.550 --> 23:28.710
when you think about how you work, right?

581
23:28.710 --> 23:32.440
So, the part of the inspiration about Pebble is really

582
23:33.510 --> 23:36.540
looking ahead on how people wanna live and work.

583
23:36.540 --> 23:39.270
They wanna do it differently than they were

584
23:39.270 --> 23:40.103
before COVID.

585
23:40.103 --> 23:42.210
People are working hybrid and remote and all these things

586
23:42.210 --> 23:44.160
and people want more freedom.

587
23:44.160 --> 23:46.770
So, fundamentally, Pebble, as a company,

588
23:46.770 --> 23:49.710
is really about creating this new lifestyle

589
23:49.710 --> 23:52.980
of lighter and freer and more sustainable living

590
23:52.980 --> 23:53.813
for people,

591
23:53.813 --> 23:57.000
and bringing product that does that, right?

592
23:57.000 --> 24:00.930
So, our first and flagship product, Pebble Flow is,

593
24:00.930 --> 24:02.460
literally, a home on the road

594
24:02.460 --> 24:05.610
that you can have a home anywhere you want it to be.

595
24:05.610 --> 24:08.040
Or even just have this as an extension home

596
24:08.040 --> 24:09.243
in front of your,

597
24:10.080 --> 24:11.160
your house.

598
24:11.160 --> 24:13.080
I, kind of, want to go back to what, John,

599
24:13.080 --> 24:15.480
you were talking about data, right?

600
24:15.480 --> 24:17.010
So,

601
24:17.010 --> 24:20.343
and there's a bit of discussion about habit, right?

602
24:21.330 --> 24:23.010
When people think about energy at home,

603
24:23.010 --> 24:24.300
we, kind of, take it for granted.

604
24:24.300 --> 24:26.580
We turn on a switch, we turn on an AC,

605
24:26.580 --> 24:28.260
things just gonna work.

606
24:28.260 --> 24:30.070
But we're in this

607
24:31.200 --> 24:33.000
pivotal moment, like John talked about,

608
24:33.000 --> 24:35.370
and because global warming,

609
24:35.370 --> 24:37.320
that cannot be taken for granted anymore.

610
24:37.320 --> 24:39.090
Your energy supply is not guaranteed.

611
24:39.090 --> 24:40.620
We have blackouts.

612
24:40.620 --> 24:42.390
<v ->Mm-hmm.</v>
<v ->Several years in California,</v>

613
24:42.390 --> 24:44.880
the fifth largest economy in the world, right?

614
24:44.880 --> 24:48.517
So, we are really taking, thinking about,

615
24:48.517 --> 24:52.800
"What is our role, to bridge to that sustainable future

616
24:52.800 --> 24:56.910
where we have energy and it's done sustainably?"

617
24:56.910 --> 24:59.670
In providing that assurance and infrastructure,

618
24:59.670 --> 25:01.050
by giving battery storage,

619
25:01.050 --> 25:03.180
by giving solar that can run your home,

620
25:03.180 --> 25:05.790
if the grid is not, cannot be relied on,

621
25:05.790 --> 25:09.720
can even use this product and go to places,

622
25:09.720 --> 25:13.020
if really there is a wildfire, you have to go somewhere.

623
25:13.020 --> 25:13.853
You know?

624
25:13.853 --> 25:17.400
<v ->And it just brings up an interesting point, too, which is,</v>

625
25:17.400 --> 25:19.920
you know, many times with technologies

626
25:19.920 --> 25:21.120
that are breakthrough,

627
25:21.120 --> 25:24.570
like all of the panelists evidence in what they're doing,

628
25:24.570 --> 25:28.110
it takes a while for it to come down the cost curve,

629
25:28.110 --> 25:30.330
you know, economies of scale.

630
25:30.330 --> 25:34.170
And the brilliant thinking that's going on much faster now

631
25:34.170 --> 25:36.270
is bringing more products to the market

632
25:36.270 --> 25:39.480
that, in general, appeal to the high-end home first.

633
25:39.480 --> 25:43.500
I often say that there's only 133 million,

634
25:43.500 --> 25:45.630
135 million homes in the United States.

635
25:45.630 --> 25:50.250
The median household income, which is pre-tax, is $93,000.

636
25:50.250 --> 25:52.950
So, there's a lot of work to be done,

637
25:52.950 --> 25:56.250
but if you don't start with things that are,

638
25:56.250 --> 25:59.580
what would call, a little bit of an add-on for most,

639
25:59.580 --> 26:00.990
you can't get it down

640
26:00.990 --> 26:03.750
and solve the whole problem of the home.

641
26:03.750 --> 26:05.550
So, it's a very good point that, you know,

642
26:05.550 --> 26:06.807
we're starting here

643
26:06.807 --> 26:08.910
and we're gonna change, fundamentally,

644
26:08.910 --> 26:10.683
how we think of the home.

645
26:11.520 --> 26:12.930
Greg, you wanna follow on?

646
26:12.930 --> 26:14.520
<v ->I'd love to talk more about data as well.</v>

647
26:14.520 --> 26:15.407
<v ->Please, datas.</v>

648
26:16.347 --> 26:18.840
<v ->So, really two points that I'd love to cover.</v>

649
26:18.840 --> 26:21.990
There's one, from an internal standpoint,

650
26:21.990 --> 26:23.880
data from a sustainability perspective

651
26:23.880 --> 26:26.490
can lead to really incredible outcomes.

652
26:26.490 --> 26:29.340
One of the examples that I can share here today is

653
26:29.340 --> 26:31.860
understanding your house and how your house

654
26:31.860 --> 26:33.810
is heated and cooled

655
26:33.810 --> 26:36.690
and learning, over time, what that profile looks like

656
26:36.690 --> 26:39.630
by leveraging data and machine learning.

657
26:39.630 --> 26:41.340
What that leads to, is this then ability

658
26:41.340 --> 26:43.530
to then shift your load

659
26:43.530 --> 26:45.330
and shift your heating and cooling cycles,

660
26:45.330 --> 26:48.450
such that you can preheat and pre-cool your home,

661
26:48.450 --> 26:51.150
such that it's, actually, operating like a battery.

662
26:51.150 --> 26:52.200
Really incredible way.

663
26:52.200 --> 26:53.850
And I think, from the other panelists here

664
26:53.850 --> 26:55.410
that have talked about,

665
26:55.410 --> 26:56.760
there are points in time when energy

666
26:56.760 --> 26:57.990
is more expensive than others.

667
26:57.990 --> 27:00.180
And so, this ability to shift and move,

668
27:00.180 --> 27:03.570
kind of, that heat battery across, over time,

669
27:03.570 --> 27:05.370
leads to, not only, again, like,

670
27:05.370 --> 27:07.080
a home that is still comfortable,

671
27:07.080 --> 27:09.090
but a home that is then heated or cooled using

672
27:09.090 --> 27:11.610
cleaner and cheaper sources of energy.

673
27:11.610 --> 27:14.430
On the flip side, that same set of data

674
27:14.430 --> 27:18.540
is really, incredibly powerful in your customer's hands.

675
27:18.540 --> 27:20.490
And so, one of the things that we've done,

676
27:20.490 --> 27:22.860
is basically release this information

677
27:22.860 --> 27:26.280
and highlighted how your home is being heated and cooled,

678
27:26.280 --> 27:28.680
what is happening, in full transparency.

679
27:28.680 --> 27:30.930
And what we're finding is that this allows our customers,

680
27:30.930 --> 27:32.970
then, to make further optimizations.

681
27:32.970 --> 27:35.970
It also allows customers to understand even opportunities

682
27:35.970 --> 27:37.680
to make their homes more efficient.

683
27:37.680 --> 27:40.890
A great example is we leverage both that data

684
27:40.890 --> 27:42.990
and really a social graph,

685
27:42.990 --> 27:45.480
where we understand how maybe one home is performing

686
27:45.480 --> 27:46.740
within a neighborhood

687
27:46.740 --> 27:48.270
and that can inform, perhaps,

688
27:48.270 --> 27:51.120
the need to improve insulation or change out windows,

689
27:51.120 --> 27:53.850
which then leads to again, a

690
27:53.850 --> 27:56.550
more efficiently heated or cooled home,

691
27:56.550 --> 27:57.780
all leveraging data.

692
27:57.780 --> 27:58.710
<v ->That's great.</v>

693
27:58.710 --> 27:59.799
Katy, did you wanna go back to data?

694
27:59.799 --> 28:01.560
<v ->That's exactly</v>
<v ->Oh, okay.</v>

695
28:01.560 --> 28:02.393
<v ->Teeing up.</v>

696
28:03.438 --> 28:04.680
<v ->Anything to add?</v>

697
28:04.680 --> 28:06.990
<v ->Just putting on my other hat for a minute on,</v>

698
28:06.990 --> 28:09.090
on a sustainable-built environment.

699
28:09.090 --> 28:12.000
As a homeowner, I don't know how many people have done

700
28:12.000 --> 28:14.463
a renovation recently. Anyone?

701
28:15.720 --> 28:16.950
<v ->You got some.</v>
<v ->About how many decisions</v>

702
28:16.950 --> 28:20.670
did you have to make during that process?

703
28:20.670 --> 28:22.470
Like, possibly, yeah, like, 10,000.

704
28:22.470 --> 28:24.390
Like, it's just, it's utter insanity.

705
28:24.390 --> 28:27.600
Even as a professional in sustainability,

706
28:27.600 --> 28:29.400
when we were renovating our home

707
28:29.400 --> 28:32.310
and I wanted to be as sustainable as possible,

708
28:32.310 --> 28:35.760
it is tough to get the information you need

709
28:35.760 --> 28:38.250
that is specific to your property.

710
28:38.250 --> 28:39.930
<v John>That's right.</v>

711
28:39.930 --> 28:41.970
<v ->And your location and your climate and whatever.</v>

712
28:41.970 --> 28:43.830
And so, what I'm really hopeful for,

713
28:43.830 --> 28:46.290
in terms of that data is,

714
28:46.290 --> 28:48.600
as a consumer, throwing all that data at me

715
28:48.600 --> 28:50.820
is not gonna do me any good.

716
28:50.820 --> 28:54.840
But once we implement AI into the equation,

717
28:54.840 --> 28:58.290
suddenly, I have some very powerful information

718
28:58.290 --> 29:02.670
and the decisions can be made on a system level

719
29:02.670 --> 29:04.290
for me, for my neighbors,

720
29:04.290 --> 29:06.390
for, you know, a region

721
29:06.390 --> 29:09.990
and taking away all the complexity,

722
29:09.990 --> 29:10.837
you know, in terms of like,

723
29:10.837 --> 29:12.720
"Should I get this or should I get that?"

724
29:12.720 --> 29:13.620
Sort of balance.

725
29:13.620 --> 29:16.110
Being sustainable is not at home,

726
29:16.110 --> 29:18.720
when you're renovating, especially,

727
29:18.720 --> 29:20.040
is not straightforward.

728
29:20.040 --> 29:22.807
It's, there's a lot of, like, balancing,

729
29:22.807 --> 29:25.260
"Should I get this kind of countertop?

730
29:25.260 --> 29:27.658
Should it be marble or should it be,

731
29:27.658 --> 29:28.491
you know, a composite?

732
29:28.491 --> 29:29.790
Which one is more sustainable?"

733
29:29.790 --> 29:31.770
Well it depends. How far you shipping?

734
29:31.770 --> 29:32.603
Blah, blah, blah.

735
29:32.603 --> 29:36.420
So, having an AI system to take all that data

736
29:36.420 --> 29:39.870
and customize solutions for you is gonna be amazing.

737
29:39.870 --> 29:41.820
<v ->That was a nice build on what Greg was saying.</v>

738
29:41.820 --> 29:43.720
I want to take it back to a point that

739
29:44.970 --> 29:46.530
Greg made, which is,

740
29:46.530 --> 29:48.690
you also have to help consumers understand

741
29:48.690 --> 29:50.850
what's the most consequential thing they can do.

742
29:50.850 --> 29:52.800
So, the number one use of energy in the home

743
29:52.800 --> 29:53.940
is heating and cooling.

744
29:53.940 --> 29:56.100
So, if you don't get heating and cooling right,

745
29:56.100 --> 29:57.690
you got a big problem because,

746
29:57.690 --> 29:59.070
we're gonna try and electrify everything.

747
29:59.070 --> 30:00.360
We've got a grid that's got issues,

748
30:00.360 --> 30:03.300
we've got generation that needs to come more green,

749
30:03.300 --> 30:04.380
we've got generation problems.

750
30:04.380 --> 30:07.560
So, this notion of data, as we've heard,

751
30:07.560 --> 30:10.350
and then the decisions that consumers can make,

752
30:10.350 --> 30:12.540
it's important that consumers understand

753
30:12.540 --> 30:15.900
what the consequential decisions are as opportunities.

754
30:15.900 --> 30:17.437
Which is like,

755
30:17.437 --> 30:20.310
"Oh, if I have a system

756
30:20.310 --> 30:23.610
and I'm making sustainability decisions around renovation

757
30:23.610 --> 30:26.190
and, behind the scenes, I'm gonna get."

758
30:26.190 --> 30:27.217
It's not gonna happen this way.

759
30:27.217 --> 30:30.000
"But I'm gonna get lower energy costs and credits."

760
30:30.000 --> 30:31.560
Which actually, California does,

761
30:31.560 --> 30:33.060
or at least SoCal Edison.

762
30:33.060 --> 30:35.010
Then it's almost frictionless

763
30:35.010 --> 30:36.390
to the consumer.

764
30:36.390 --> 30:38.190
They still have to deal with the startup cost

765
30:38.190 --> 30:39.023
and all of that.

766
30:39.023 --> 30:40.170
That's really a mess.

767
30:40.170 --> 30:42.180
What are the grants you're gonna get or the like?

768
30:42.180 --> 30:45.930
But it's simplifying the notion of being sustainable

769
30:45.930 --> 30:50.930
without somehow turning it into a confusing scenario.

770
30:51.180 --> 30:54.240
Because the planet needs this in the next five years.

771
30:54.240 --> 30:57.330
It can't wait for all the new homes to be built

772
30:57.330 --> 30:59.850
to have energy management systems and the like.

773
30:59.850 --> 31:04.140
By the way, all those homes will be over $250 or $300,000.

774
31:04.140 --> 31:07.710
We gotta work on what these folks are talking about, today.

775
31:07.710 --> 31:09.990
I wanna talk about, I would love for you, Nicole,

776
31:09.990 --> 31:13.277
to talk about, sort of, a Savant vision of,

777
31:13.277 --> 31:14.520
that's a great name, too,

778
31:14.520 --> 31:16.950
a Savant vision of, you know,

779
31:16.950 --> 31:21.540
where this goes for you, as a scaling company.

780
31:21.540 --> 31:23.460
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

781
31:23.460 --> 31:25.710
And at similar points to what

782
31:25.710 --> 31:27.180
some of the other panelists are bringing up,

783
31:27.180 --> 31:31.680
but using, because we have a product that goes into the home

784
31:31.680 --> 31:34.050
and it's gonna monitor your energy consumption,

785
31:34.050 --> 31:37.140
there's a lot we can do with that to help users improve,

786
31:37.140 --> 31:39.000
like improve their energy efficiency,

787
31:39.000 --> 31:40.740
but also improve their day-to-day life.

788
31:40.740 --> 31:44.970
So, for example, we are working on solutions where we can

789
31:44.970 --> 31:49.970
detect that appliance or a device is not running efficiently

790
31:50.100 --> 31:52.200
and it's looking like there's a

791
31:52.200 --> 31:53.730
issue occurring in the device

792
31:53.730 --> 31:55.140
and that maybe they need to

793
31:55.140 --> 31:58.570
go check out why their dryer isn't running effectively and

794
31:59.550 --> 32:01.110
predict that there might be an issue

795
32:01.110 --> 32:03.450
before their dryer breaks and things like that.

796
32:03.450 --> 32:04.623
But also,

797
32:05.490 --> 32:08.160
just sort of, keeping an eye on the home

798
32:08.160 --> 32:10.860
and providing recommendations to users.

799
32:10.860 --> 32:13.110
So for example, you're running your dryer

800
32:13.110 --> 32:15.630
in the middle of the day, when rates are high,

801
32:15.630 --> 32:17.790
we recommend that maybe you push this off,

802
32:17.790 --> 32:20.490
you shift this off to later in the day or

803
32:20.490 --> 32:21.690
you've plugged in your car

804
32:21.690 --> 32:24.033
and this isn't an optimal time to charge.

805
32:25.023 --> 32:28.170
And there's a lot of really cool things where this,

806
32:28.170 --> 32:30.330
where data can become even more powerful.

807
32:30.330 --> 32:32.340
We haven't talked too much about solar

808
32:32.340 --> 32:33.420
and home batteries yet,

809
32:33.420 --> 32:37.020
but by being able to predict, look at weather patterns

810
32:37.020 --> 32:38.370
to predict solar production,

811
32:38.370 --> 32:42.000
we can also help homeowners be efficient,

812
32:42.000 --> 32:43.680
if they've got rooftop solar,

813
32:43.680 --> 32:45.330
how they're using their solar energy,

814
32:45.330 --> 32:47.520
and how they're storing that excess power

815
32:47.520 --> 32:48.600
if they've got a home battery,

816
32:48.600 --> 32:52.980
and being prepared, if a grid outage does occur. So

817
32:52.980 --> 32:54.750
<v John>As has been more the case.</v>

818
32:54.750 --> 32:56.310
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>
<v ->Natural disaster</v>

819
32:56.310 --> 32:58.389
and grid overload.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

820
32:58.389 --> 32:59.520
<v ->I think, it's a really good point.</v>

821
32:59.520 --> 33:02.400
And Greg, it reminded me when Bingrui was talking about,

822
33:02.400 --> 33:04.140
you know, having a sidecar to the home

823
33:04.140 --> 33:05.910
and then the sidecar becomes mobile,

824
33:05.910 --> 33:09.180
it's like a little home that you bring with,

825
33:09.180 --> 33:10.650
that you take with you.

826
33:10.650 --> 33:12.870
You know, it brought a question into my head,

827
33:12.870 --> 33:15.960
which you might have some thoughts on, which is,

828
33:15.960 --> 33:18.150
as I mentioned, there are only 84 million

829
33:18.150 --> 33:20.640
single-family homes in the United States.

830
33:20.640 --> 33:23.160
The rest are multifamily dwellings.

831
33:23.160 --> 33:26.070
How do you guys, I mean, you can put a thermostat

832
33:26.070 --> 33:29.130
in each of those, but in the Ecobee world,

833
33:29.130 --> 33:31.050
how do we think about multifamily?

834
33:31.050 --> 33:32.340
'Cause if we don't get that right,

835
33:32.340 --> 33:34.353
we still have a huge problem.

836
33:35.340 --> 33:38.220
<v ->In the multi-family market,</v>

837
33:38.220 --> 33:39.570
I think one of the things we think about

838
33:39.570 --> 33:41.873
is really making our products more affordable.

839
33:41.873 --> 33:43.920
<v ->Mm-hmm.</v>
<v ->To ultimately drive also,</v>

840
33:43.920 --> 33:45.753
more sustainable outcomes, as well.

841
33:46.680 --> 33:49.110
We're excited, this week we've just announced

842
33:49.110 --> 33:52.500
a new thermostat that is now, like, $129,

843
33:52.500 --> 33:53.763
our lowest cost, to date.

844
33:54.600 --> 33:56.640
<v John>Subsidized by some utilities.</v>

845
33:56.640 --> 33:57.990
<v ->And the, I was gonna get to that.</v>

846
33:57.990 --> 33:59.130
<v ->Oh, sorry.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

847
33:59.130 --> 34:00.790
I think one of the key things is that,

848
34:00.790 --> 34:02.640
with utility programs

849
34:02.640 --> 34:04.950
that are involved in demand response programs,

850
34:04.950 --> 34:06.060
which we also support,

851
34:06.060 --> 34:09.210
there are opportunities to get these devices for free.

852
34:09.210 --> 34:11.700
And so, in terms of making, kind of like,

853
34:11.700 --> 34:13.350
that smart sustainable choice,

854
34:13.350 --> 34:15.300
having that simple solution,

855
34:15.300 --> 34:17.910
in terms of addressing, kind of, a much broader set

856
34:17.910 --> 34:19.260
of the population,

857
34:19.260 --> 34:21.360
that's one of the key things that we're investing in.

858
34:21.360 --> 34:23.220
We're really, really excited about, as well.

859
34:23.220 --> 34:24.053
<v ->That's great.</v>

860
34:24.053 --> 34:26.850
And you know, the good news here, too, is

861
34:26.850 --> 34:29.730
that you're seeing innovators, on stage,

862
34:29.730 --> 34:31.290
who are really not dependent

863
34:31.290 --> 34:34.290
on the broader political winds of the United States.

864
34:34.290 --> 34:36.990
And I only bring that up because people should know

865
34:36.990 --> 34:38.610
that green energy,

866
34:38.610 --> 34:41.400
despite us not having it all day,

867
34:41.400 --> 34:44.730
is the lowest cost form of energy deliverable,

868
34:44.730 --> 34:46.500
onshore wind, which you can't make enough of,

869
34:46.500 --> 34:48.570
but solar is the lowest cost of energy.

870
34:48.570 --> 34:51.270
So, when we're hearing about shifting loads

871
34:51.270 --> 34:54.060
and balancing this, we're really moving to

872
34:54.060 --> 34:57.270
the physics of the cheapest form of energy

873
34:57.270 --> 34:59.010
that's the best for the planet.

874
34:59.010 --> 35:02.370
And that's a really dynamic moment

875
35:02.370 --> 35:05.250
because it's happening from the home.

876
35:05.250 --> 35:08.370
It's not like the grid has all of this technology in it,

877
35:08.370 --> 35:10.560
to start to balance and do this.

878
35:10.560 --> 35:12.930
So, I want to come back to this notion

879
35:12.930 --> 35:14.700
of storage at the edge.

880
35:14.700 --> 35:15.720
<v Bingrui>Okay.</v>

881
35:15.720 --> 35:19.110
<v ->And I'm gonna do it in two ways.</v>

882
35:19.110 --> 35:20.430
I'm gonna ask Bingrui,

883
35:20.430 --> 35:22.260
because he has storage at the edge

884
35:22.260 --> 35:23.880
but in a very unique and different way.

885
35:23.880 --> 35:26.220
And then I'll bring it to however

886
35:26.220 --> 35:28.620
both you would like to talk about it.

887
35:28.620 --> 35:31.530
But, Bingrui, you're putting storage at the edge.

888
35:31.530 --> 35:33.000
<v ->That's absolutely right. Yeah.</v>

889
35:33.000 --> 35:34.530
And we're doing in the-

890
35:34.530 --> 35:36.240
<v ->Edge of the electric network, I'm sorry,</v>

891
35:36.240 --> 35:37.710
<v ->Edge of the, edge of the grid.</v>

892
35:37.710 --> 35:38.543
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Right.</v>

893
35:38.543 --> 35:40.350
<v ->So 'cause as I talked about earlier, right,</v>

894
35:41.370 --> 35:44.070
as weather gets more, events gets more severe,

895
35:44.070 --> 35:45.570
you're gonna have more and more blackouts.

896
35:45.570 --> 35:46.710
It is really essential

897
35:46.710 --> 35:49.980
that we have these energy storage device as a grid.

898
35:49.980 --> 35:52.230
'Cause you can't just count on the grid to upgrade,

899
35:52.230 --> 35:56.250
the infrastructure upgrade cycle is just so long, right?

900
35:56.250 --> 35:59.550
So, but what's hard for a consumer is, like,

901
35:59.550 --> 36:03.630
kind of, to what, Katy and Greg, you all talked about

902
36:03.630 --> 36:06.450
is upgrading these infrastructure at home

903
36:06.450 --> 36:07.710
is really difficult.

904
36:07.710 --> 36:09.450
Consumer doesn't know what to get

905
36:09.450 --> 36:11.250
and they have to hire someone.

906
36:11.250 --> 36:12.780
Once they pick what they want to get,

907
36:12.780 --> 36:14.490
they have to hire someone to put it in.

908
36:14.490 --> 36:16.800
So, what we really thought about, at Pebble, is,

909
36:16.800 --> 36:19.740
how do we make it as frictionless as possible?

910
36:19.740 --> 36:20.573
Turnkey.

911
36:20.573 --> 36:21.600
So,

912
36:21.600 --> 36:23.160
which our product is,

913
36:23.160 --> 36:26.010
is basically you can buy one, get delivered to your home,

914
36:26.010 --> 36:27.000
and plug it in.

915
36:27.000 --> 36:28.020
And that there you have it,

916
36:28.020 --> 36:29.010
you have energy storage,

917
36:29.010 --> 36:31.233
you have solar generation already, right?

918
36:33.240 --> 36:35.190
<v ->Yeah, I would add, I think, you know,</v>

919
36:36.630 --> 36:38.070
there's light at the end of the tunnel here.

920
36:38.070 --> 36:39.960
And that is, one of the things that I think

921
36:39.960 --> 36:42.300
is really exciting is that

922
36:42.300 --> 36:44.970
batteries at the edge, the cost of battery technology

923
36:44.970 --> 36:46.230
is rapidly decreasing.

924
36:46.230 --> 36:48.060
And so, what that means is that,

925
36:48.060 --> 36:49.920
while still, kind of, at the higher end of home,

926
36:49.920 --> 36:51.480
it's becoming increasingly affordable

927
36:51.480 --> 36:54.300
to bring that local storage to your house.

928
36:54.300 --> 36:56.610
And I think that the point that you made earlier, John,

929
36:56.610 --> 36:58.620
is that, that actually helps to provide a buffer

930
36:58.620 --> 37:00.720
for some of the challenges that exist within the grid,

931
37:00.720 --> 37:02.910
that idea of balancing loads.

932
37:02.910 --> 37:05.070
And having that local storage in houses

933
37:05.070 --> 37:08.280
that allows you to use that cleaner cheaper energy

934
37:08.280 --> 37:10.950
to accumulate that energy from perhaps solar

935
37:10.950 --> 37:13.480
or when the utility grid is at its cheapest

936
37:15.245 --> 37:17.010
point of rate of use.

937
37:17.010 --> 37:20.310
And that affords you then, to not only have

938
37:20.310 --> 37:22.920
kinda that local storage and to actually help the grid,

939
37:22.920 --> 37:25.020
relative to balancing loads,

940
37:25.020 --> 37:26.910
that same battery then provides you with resiliency.

941
37:26.910 --> 37:27.837
And so, if there, you know,

942
37:27.837 --> 37:31.140
and we talked about increasing outage events,

943
37:31.140 --> 37:32.160
having that battery in your house

944
37:32.160 --> 37:33.810
can then sustain a whole home now,

945
37:33.810 --> 37:37.080
with the size of batteries that can be supplied,

946
37:37.080 --> 37:39.540
for hours, in some cases days,

947
37:39.540 --> 37:41.550
depending on the size of the battery and the home.

948
37:41.550 --> 37:43.380
Really, kind of, just creating a better overall

949
37:43.380 --> 37:45.340
customer experience that also is sustainable.

950
37:45.340 --> 37:48.030
<v John>Yeah, and that home innovation is a key piece.</v>

951
37:48.030 --> 37:49.410
And, go ahead, Nicole.

952
37:49.410 --> 37:51.720
<v ->Yeah, one thing to just add to what Greg mentioned</v>

953
37:51.720 --> 37:53.730
is that, we've talked a lot about

954
37:53.730 --> 37:56.400
shifting your energy use at certain times of day

955
37:56.400 --> 37:57.360
to save money.

956
37:57.360 --> 38:01.110
But the other really awesome use case for a home battery is

957
38:01.110 --> 38:03.300
a number of utilities are adopting

958
38:03.300 --> 38:04.920
demand response battery programs,

959
38:04.920 --> 38:06.480
where if you have a battery at home,

960
38:06.480 --> 38:08.250
you can actually discharge power

961
38:08.250 --> 38:11.130
that you've stored up, earlier in the day, to the grid,

962
38:11.130 --> 38:14.280
when they need it most, at peak times of day.

963
38:14.280 --> 38:16.290
And so, that's great, as a homeowner,

964
38:16.290 --> 38:18.840
you get a financial incentive to do that.

965
38:18.840 --> 38:21.570
But this is also really helping utilities

966
38:21.570 --> 38:24.810
promote grid stability and give them power

967
38:24.810 --> 38:26.520
when they need it most.

968
38:26.520 --> 38:27.960
So, another great use case.

969
38:27.960 --> 38:28.890
<v ->I think, that's a great point</v>

970
38:28.890 --> 38:31.590
because what we're seeing is, as Bingrui was saying,

971
38:31.590 --> 38:33.450
and we've been implying that,

972
38:33.450 --> 38:36.360
the cost of upgrading the network

973
38:36.360 --> 38:38.040
of the grid

974
38:38.040 --> 38:39.870
is extraordinarily high

975
38:39.870 --> 38:42.570
and the technologies are still very old.

976
38:42.570 --> 38:45.060
It's very hard to reinvent the grid quickly.

977
38:45.060 --> 38:48.300
We're a very large country with a lot of land mass

978
38:48.300 --> 38:50.610
and one of the hardest things in the world to do

979
38:50.610 --> 38:52.770
is move electricity long distances.

980
38:52.770 --> 38:54.570
There's huge loss.

981
38:54.570 --> 38:57.390
So, if the home becomes the nexus

982
38:57.390 --> 38:59.850
of energy production

983
38:59.850 --> 39:02.250
and demand balancing,

984
39:02.250 --> 39:05.160
it's at least something that everybody,

985
39:05.160 --> 39:08.370
even if they're aware or unaware that it's going on,

986
39:08.370 --> 39:09.870
can help implement,

987
39:09.870 --> 39:12.930
which is effectively helping the entire country

988
39:12.930 --> 39:14.070
be more energy efficient.

989
39:14.070 --> 39:17.850
So, it's a really great point that they brought up.

990
39:17.850 --> 39:19.920
And we have one minute more,

991
39:19.920 --> 39:22.200
so I'm just gonna close it off

992
39:22.200 --> 39:24.300
by giving you a couple of thoughts

993
39:24.300 --> 39:26.190
that we've heard about today,

994
39:26.190 --> 39:29.010
which is the notion of home

995
39:29.010 --> 39:30.660
is a

996
39:30.660 --> 39:34.050
changing and evolving concept.

997
39:34.050 --> 39:38.430
Data within the home is helping people to reimagine

998
39:38.430 --> 39:40.620
and rethink how they

999
39:40.620 --> 39:43.830
use energy and do other things in their home.

1000
39:43.830 --> 39:48.060
The notion of home is also being extended

1001
39:48.060 --> 39:50.070
to new technologies

1002
39:50.070 --> 39:52.470
and products, like Bingrui's,

1003
39:52.470 --> 39:55.050
so that you can have support at the home,

1004
39:55.050 --> 39:56.060
when you're at home.

1005
39:56.060 --> 39:59.490
Or you can be out and be in a home that moves around

1006
39:59.490 --> 40:01.407
or only have a home that moves around.

1007
40:01.407 --> 40:03.660
And the important thing here is

1008
40:03.660 --> 40:06.300
that all of this is going on

1009
40:06.300 --> 40:09.180
at the scale of real innovators here,

1010
40:09.180 --> 40:12.270
that are real companies, really delivering. Right?

1011
40:12.270 --> 40:14.670
Utilities and others have a harder time.

1012
40:14.670 --> 40:17.340
There's more, you know, money and investment involved.

1013
40:17.340 --> 40:19.800
But you're seeing real potential

1014
40:19.800 --> 40:23.340
and massive opportunities, right here,

1015
40:23.340 --> 40:25.020
which is incredibly encouraging

1016
40:25.020 --> 40:27.570
'cause ultimately, what we've talked about

1017
40:27.570 --> 40:29.700
in the heating of the atmosphere

1018
40:29.700 --> 40:31.320
and all of what we're seeing

1019
40:31.320 --> 40:32.880
impacts the home

1020
40:32.880 --> 40:35.460
as clear as anything,

1021
40:35.460 --> 40:37.290
through insurance costs,

1022
40:37.290 --> 40:39.900
the risk of where the home is located.

1023
40:39.900 --> 40:42.930
So, the home is really a nexus, while we don't know it yet,

1024
40:42.930 --> 40:45.540
as broadly as our panelists have shown us,

1025
40:45.540 --> 40:47.940
of, sort of, the early

1026
40:47.940 --> 40:51.390
opportunity to have a better path

1027
40:51.390 --> 40:53.310
for future generations

1028
40:53.310 --> 40:57.240
to have a planet somewhat like ours today.

1029
40:57.240 --> 40:59.370
And you all are involved

1030
40:59.370 --> 41:03.900
by getting the message out in your companies, and the like,

1031
41:03.900 --> 41:06.060
that thinking about sustainability,

1032
41:06.060 --> 41:09.600
and specifically about reducing carbon in whatever way,

1033
41:09.600 --> 41:12.780
is a path to not only customer success,

1034
41:12.780 --> 41:14.220
it's impact for the planet,

1035
41:14.220 --> 41:16.110
it's doing good for your company,

1036
41:16.110 --> 41:19.170
it's attracting and retaining the best talent

1037
41:19.170 --> 41:21.240
and hopefully having a huge impact.

1038
41:21.240 --> 41:24.630
So, it's empowering, it's a great message

1039
41:24.630 --> 41:26.160
and don't ever forget,

1040
41:26.160 --> 41:28.560
it's, literally, the largest investment opportunity

1041
41:28.560 --> 41:30.060
in the history of humanity.

1042
41:30.060 --> 41:34.230
So, a huge thank you to our absolutely superstar panelists

1043
41:34.230 --> 41:35.585
'cause they were great.

1044
41:35.585 --> 41:37.633
(audience applauding)

1045
41:37.633 --> 41:40.216
(upbeat music)
