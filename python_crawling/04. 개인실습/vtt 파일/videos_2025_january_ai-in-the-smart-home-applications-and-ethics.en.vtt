00:00.287 --> 00:02.870
(upbeat music)

2
00:11.010 --> 00:16.010
<v ->Welcome to the 19th annual Connections Summit at CES.</v>

3
00:20.850 --> 00:21.683
I'm Jennifer Kent,

4
00:21.683 --> 00:23.910
vice president of Research with Parks Associates.

5
00:23.910 --> 00:28.500
We are so pleased to be hosting this event today.

6
00:28.500 --> 00:31.410
Conversations all day long from the industry leaders

7
00:31.410 --> 00:34.500
making it happen all across the connected home

8
00:34.500 --> 00:37.710
on some of the most critical conversations

9
00:37.710 --> 00:39.870
that are happening in this market.

10
00:39.870 --> 00:42.330
I happen to find a picture of the conversations

11
00:42.330 --> 00:45.510
that were happening 10 years ago back in 2015.

12
00:45.510 --> 00:48.600
We love to hear what you're working on,

13
00:48.600 --> 00:50.190
what the big questions are,

14
00:50.190 --> 00:54.183
and really to see how this market has expanded and evolved.

15
00:55.080 --> 00:58.110
And that a lot has happened over the past 10 years.

16
00:58.110 --> 01:00.810
Parks Associates' research shows that

17
01:00.810 --> 01:03.450
the average American internet household

18
01:03.450 --> 01:05.940
has over 17 connected devices today,

19
01:05.940 --> 01:08.160
more than two times the amount of connected devices

20
01:08.160 --> 01:10.890
they had back in 2015.

21
01:10.890 --> 01:12.420
And the percentage of households

22
01:12.420 --> 01:14.670
that have at least one smart home device,

23
01:14.670 --> 01:18.450
not including smart speakers and smart displays,

24
01:18.450 --> 01:22.680
so think locks, lights, thermostats, door locks,

25
01:22.680 --> 01:26.700
garage openers, you know,

26
01:26.700 --> 01:29.610
plugs, power strips, smart appliances,

27
01:29.610 --> 01:33.270
45% of 5X from back in 2014.

28
01:33.270 --> 01:35.040
So a lot has happened.

29
01:35.040 --> 01:36.870
There are a lot of big questions

30
01:36.870 --> 01:38.490
for the industry leaders today,

31
01:38.490 --> 01:43.490
such as how do you serve an increasingly mainstream end user

32
01:43.740 --> 01:45.660
when you have 45% of households now

33
01:45.660 --> 01:47.730
having a smart home product?

34
01:47.730 --> 01:48.660
You're really actually looking

35
01:48.660 --> 01:50.670
at a different type of customer.

36
01:50.670 --> 01:54.840
How can consumer IoT business units operate profitably,

37
01:54.840 --> 01:57.180
perhaps within a larger, more traditional manufacturer?

38
01:57.180 --> 01:58.590
We see that a lot.

39
01:58.590 --> 02:01.020
What is my competitive edge in the AI arms race?

40
02:01.020 --> 02:03.510
We're talking today, this morning, right,

41
02:03.510 --> 02:06.450
jumping right into AI in the smart home.

42
02:06.450 --> 02:09.180
What does that mean for your strategic plans

43
02:09.180 --> 02:10.890
for the competitive landscape?

44
02:10.890 --> 02:12.540
We're gonna talk a lot about standards today.

45
02:12.540 --> 02:15.300
How do standards efforts unlock new opportunity

46
02:15.300 --> 02:17.160
and also new competition?

47
02:17.160 --> 02:19.650
What market segments are right for expansion?

48
02:19.650 --> 02:21.720
How do I leverage my assets

49
02:21.720 --> 02:24.180
to better serve other ecosystem players

50
02:24.180 --> 02:25.980
and not just that end user?

51
02:25.980 --> 02:28.830
We're gonna be talking about a lot of that today

52
02:28.830 --> 02:30.990
across our different panels.

53
02:30.990 --> 02:33.960
We're also kicking off in about a month,

54
02:33.960 --> 02:37.470
our big B2B industry research effort

55
02:37.470 --> 02:40.680
where we are very interested in what you're struggling with

56
02:40.680 --> 02:41.580
and what you're seeing

57
02:41.580 --> 02:44.040
as you're working on consumer IoT products.

58
02:44.040 --> 02:46.620
And we're gonna release the results of that research

59
02:46.620 --> 02:49.230
at our Connections event in May.

60
02:49.230 --> 02:51.390
So if you wanna participate in that research,

61
02:51.390 --> 02:53.760
it comes with a free pass to Connections.

62
02:53.760 --> 02:55.440
You can scan this QR code.

63
02:55.440 --> 02:57.120
And when we have that survey ready,

64
02:57.120 --> 02:59.020
we'll reach out to you to participate.

65
03:01.350 --> 03:03.930
So you can see today we are starting off at

66
03:03.930 --> 03:05.400
with AI in the Smart Home,

67
03:05.400 --> 03:06.840
talking about applications and ethics.

68
03:06.840 --> 03:09.630
We're talking about profitability next at 10 o'clock.

69
03:09.630 --> 03:10.860
At the top of every hour

70
03:10.860 --> 03:13.050
where we're running into a new topic.

71
03:13.050 --> 03:15.780
Smart Home Standards and Platforms at 11 o'clock.

72
03:15.780 --> 03:18.030
We'll have lunch first come, first serve

73
03:18.030 --> 03:19.830
in the room to the left.

74
03:19.830 --> 03:21.030
If you go out to the hallway to the left.

75
03:21.030 --> 03:25.110
A big thank you to ADT for sponsoring that lunch.

76
03:25.110 --> 03:27.210
We're back in the afternoon talking about energy,

77
03:27.210 --> 03:29.550
talking about multifamily markets,

78
03:29.550 --> 03:33.000
and also what's happening in home security.

79
03:33.000 --> 03:34.950
And we invite all of you to attend

80
03:34.950 --> 03:37.680
our VIP networking reception

81
03:37.680 --> 03:39.960
over at Treasure Island this evening.

82
03:39.960 --> 03:41.100
It is complimentary.

83
03:41.100 --> 03:42.240
You're all welcome to attend.

84
03:42.240 --> 03:45.930
We do ask that you RSVP so that we have a headcount

85
03:45.930 --> 03:49.380
and you can do that with this form at this QR code.

86
03:49.380 --> 03:52.200
So with that, I'd love to invite my panelists up

87
03:52.200 --> 03:55.770
to jump right into our first topic of the day,

88
03:55.770 --> 03:57.900
AI in the Smart Home: Applications and Ethics.

89
03:57.900 --> 03:59.050
Come on up and join me.

90
04:01.621 --> 04:04.788
(audience applauding)

91
04:08.117 --> 04:09.034
Okay, yeah.

92
04:09.870 --> 04:12.870
And as they do that, I just wanna set the scene.

93
04:12.870 --> 04:14.130
We have a lot to talk about today,

94
04:14.130 --> 04:16.950
so I'm just gonna jump in and get running.

95
04:16.950 --> 04:20.460
You know, there's a lot of possibility

96
04:20.460 --> 04:25.200
of what AI can really add to the connected home landscape.

97
04:25.200 --> 04:27.660
A lot of what we see in the smart home specifically

98
04:27.660 --> 04:31.770
is adding to better understanding of the context

99
04:31.770 --> 04:35.610
of an action or an event or a call for assistance.

100
04:35.610 --> 04:36.600
What is happening?

101
04:36.600 --> 04:39.690
Who is in the home that gets to identity?

102
04:39.690 --> 04:40.523
Who is in the home?

103
04:40.523 --> 04:41.550
Is it a known person?

104
04:41.550 --> 04:43.860
Is it an unknown person?

105
04:43.860 --> 04:47.493
How do I authenticate myself for access into the home?

106
04:49.140 --> 04:50.910
I lost my slides, but that's okay.

107
04:50.910 --> 04:53.160
Also, things like communication

108
04:53.160 --> 04:55.890
and communicating both between people,

109
04:55.890 --> 04:57.270
between people and devices,

110
04:57.270 --> 04:59.550
and between the devices themselves.

111
04:59.550 --> 05:03.900
But our data also shows that 71% of consumers

112
05:03.900 --> 05:08.400
are concerned about society's ability to control

113
05:08.400 --> 05:13.400
and ethically control and develop AI.

114
05:13.587 --> 05:15.330
And so what does that mean for everybody in the room?

115
05:15.330 --> 05:17.370
What does that mean for the smart home market?

116
05:17.370 --> 05:19.710
So I'm very excited to have

117
05:19.710 --> 05:21.420
all sorts of leaders in this space

118
05:21.420 --> 05:25.800
to really talk about the challenges, the opportunities,

119
05:25.800 --> 05:28.290
and how you're using AI today.

120
05:28.290 --> 05:29.370
I'd love to bring the slides up

121
05:29.370 --> 05:31.773
so that we can show everybody in the audience.

122
05:32.850 --> 05:35.840
Here we go.

123
05:35.840 --> 05:36.673
There we go.

124
05:36.673 --> 05:37.680
So we can see your beautiful pictures

125
05:37.680 --> 05:39.960
and everybody can see your names and your titles.

126
05:39.960 --> 05:40.980
So we have Arsham,

127
05:40.980 --> 05:43.050
who's the SVP of Product and Technology

128
05:43.050 --> 05:45.450
with Universal Electronics.

129
05:45.450 --> 05:47.760
Amalia, who's the head of Strategic Marketing

130
05:47.760 --> 05:49.560
with Intuition Robotics.

131
05:49.560 --> 05:53.040
Casey, the director of Business Development with Josh.ai.

132
05:53.040 --> 05:56.160
Paulus, who's the president of the Open Home Foundation.

133
05:56.160 --> 05:57.150
And Paul Williams,

134
05:57.150 --> 05:58.380
the global managing director

135
05:58.380 --> 06:02.160
for the Home Management Business unit with the Nice Group.

136
06:02.160 --> 06:05.310
So I'd love to really start by diving in

137
06:05.310 --> 06:06.480
and asking each of you

138
06:06.480 --> 06:08.820
as you sort of introduce yourselves and your organizations

139
06:08.820 --> 06:11.550
to tell us how are you using AI today?

140
06:11.550 --> 06:12.963
Arsham, you could start.

141
06:14.100 --> 06:15.180
<v ->Good morning.</v>

142
06:15.180 --> 06:17.340
Ooh, first day of the show.

143
06:17.340 --> 06:20.310
Hopefully everybody is ready and pumped.

144
06:20.310 --> 06:25.310
UEI designs, develops, and manufactures

145
06:25.470 --> 06:29.430
entertainment and smart home products with strong focus

146
06:29.430 --> 06:31.950
on climate control and energy management

147
06:31.950 --> 06:34.020
in more recent years.

148
06:34.020 --> 06:38.460
Now, AI fits throughout the full lifecycle

149
06:38.460 --> 06:41.100
of a product company like ours.

150
06:41.100 --> 06:42.870
So from design and development,

151
06:42.870 --> 06:43.703
if you think about it,

152
06:43.703 --> 06:45.450
you can have any software engineer

153
06:45.450 --> 06:47.970
that's not using AI on a daily basis,

154
06:47.970 --> 06:50.700
you should probably reconsider that engineer

155
06:50.700 --> 06:53.700
and probably move on to somebody

156
06:53.700 --> 06:55.980
who can use the tools today better

157
06:55.980 --> 07:00.390
to double faster, more efficiently, and better quality.

158
07:00.390 --> 07:01.860
When you go into manufacturing,

159
07:01.860 --> 07:06.420
you certainly can apply AI to have much better yields,

160
07:06.420 --> 07:08.130
much better quality,

161
07:08.130 --> 07:10.410
and even fine tune and calibrate things

162
07:10.410 --> 07:12.660
that previously were not even possible.

163
07:12.660 --> 07:15.240
So design and development is quite obvious,

164
07:15.240 --> 07:16.560
From DevOps perspective,

165
07:16.560 --> 07:19.260
our cloud servers today,

166
07:19.260 --> 07:23.310
so a part of our products is a software only product

167
07:23.310 --> 07:27.030
that resides on hundreds of millions of

168
07:27.030 --> 07:29.853
connected entertainment devices in the homes today.

169
07:30.780 --> 07:35.100
We serve about 100 million households every single week.

170
07:35.100 --> 07:38.850
About 30% of these actually use the cloud services

171
07:38.850 --> 07:40.350
on a daily basis.

172
07:40.350 --> 07:45.350
And about 55% of them use AI-powered APIs from our servers

173
07:46.350 --> 07:51.350
to achieve certain functionality for personalization

174
07:51.660 --> 07:54.030
and optimizing the experiences.

175
07:54.030 --> 07:56.730
So we've taken everything

176
07:56.730 --> 08:00.660
from software side and hardware side,

177
08:00.660 --> 08:02.100
and we're putting it together

178
08:02.100 --> 08:05.130
in the next generation of our product development

179
08:05.130 --> 08:10.130
to deliver an on-device AI framework

180
08:10.350 --> 08:15.350
that can both protect the privacy and personalization,

181
08:15.360 --> 08:18.030
the privacy and security required in a home,

182
08:18.030 --> 08:20.310
but provide that personalization framework

183
08:20.310 --> 08:22.920
that a lot of the applications that we're focused on

184
08:22.920 --> 08:24.120
can actually benefit from.

185
08:24.120 --> 08:25.650
Everything from energy management

186
08:25.650 --> 08:30.630
around occupancy in a fully private fashion,

187
08:30.630 --> 08:33.360
and personalization based on

188
08:33.360 --> 08:36.120
proximity and movement throughout the home,

189
08:36.120 --> 08:38.430
guests and guests coming and going.

190
08:38.430 --> 08:42.480
And rather than hoarding all this data on a central server,

191
08:42.480 --> 08:45.180
we actually allow your devices

192
08:45.180 --> 08:47.220
to get to know you through time,

193
08:47.220 --> 08:50.550
adapt to you and adapt to your changes through your time.

194
08:50.550 --> 08:52.076
So we'll talk more about

195
08:52.076 --> 08:55.500
how we look at privacy and security in this fashion.

196
08:55.500 --> 08:56.970
<v ->Yeah, fantastic context.</v>

197
08:56.970 --> 08:59.700
Personalization, presence, fantastic.

198
08:59.700 --> 09:01.800
Amalia, tell us a little bit more about Intuition

199
09:01.800 --> 09:03.930
and how you're using AI today.

200
09:03.930 --> 09:05.520
<v ->Hi, good morning everyone.</v>

201
09:05.520 --> 09:07.380
Thank you for having me.

202
09:07.380 --> 09:08.940
I'm thrilled.

203
09:08.940 --> 09:11.280
So, as Jennifer said,

204
09:11.280 --> 09:13.740
I lead marketing for Intuition Robotics.

205
09:13.740 --> 09:17.190
Intuition Robotics is the creator of ElliQ.

206
09:17.190 --> 09:22.190
ElliQ is an AI companion built to live with older adults,

207
09:22.680 --> 09:25.740
help them on their health and wellness journey,

208
09:25.740 --> 09:29.160
help them live at home independently longer,

209
09:29.160 --> 09:32.340
help them live happier and healthier lives.

210
09:32.340 --> 09:34.410
ElliQ is a non humanoid robot.

211
09:34.410 --> 09:36.780
She's a tabletop device.

212
09:36.780 --> 09:39.540
And she's basically built

213
09:39.540 --> 09:43.230
on both AI and scripted conversations.

214
09:43.230 --> 09:46.590
But AI has really been a game changer for us

215
09:46.590 --> 09:51.450
in making ElliQ a smarter, more connected companion.

216
09:51.450 --> 09:55.530
She's able to have much more in-depth conversations.

217
09:55.530 --> 09:57.060
We have an orchestrator

218
09:57.060 --> 09:59.760
that basically decides on each interaction

219
09:59.760 --> 10:04.560
whether she'll go to our own LLM, open-source LLM,

220
10:04.560 --> 10:06.540
or a scripted conversation.

221
10:06.540 --> 10:09.480
And this allows her to personalize herself to each user,

222
10:09.480 --> 10:11.550
contextualize her interactions,

223
10:11.550 --> 10:15.150
and also build a memory for each user.

224
10:15.150 --> 10:17.550
So the longer she lives with someone,

225
10:17.550 --> 10:21.210
the smarter she becomes, the more in tune with their needs.

226
10:21.210 --> 10:24.420
She knows which interactions to initiate.

227
10:24.420 --> 10:26.640
I did not mention that as far as we know,

228
10:26.640 --> 10:30.450
ElliQ is the only proactive,

229
10:30.450 --> 10:32.550
fully functional AI agent today.

230
10:32.550 --> 10:34.080
So she's not just prompt-based,

231
10:34.080 --> 10:36.690
she doesn't wait to be spoken to,

232
10:36.690 --> 10:38.820
she really initiates interactions.

233
10:38.820 --> 10:42.900
And we leverage AI hugely to be able to do that

234
10:42.900 --> 10:44.790
and to be able to do that in a fashion

235
10:44.790 --> 10:49.260
that is non-obtrusive, that drives to action,

236
10:49.260 --> 10:52.440
that helps us realize our goals

237
10:52.440 --> 10:54.360
that are obviously aligned with goals

238
10:54.360 --> 10:56.730
to help users live happier, healthier lives.

239
10:56.730 --> 10:58.590
So for example,

240
10:58.590 --> 11:02.520
if we know that a user didn't sleep very well

241
11:02.520 --> 11:04.590
and ElliQ asks in the morning,

242
11:04.590 --> 11:05.940
hi, how are you Jennifer?

243
11:05.940 --> 11:07.290
How did you sleep today?

244
11:07.290 --> 11:10.260
And if you say, oh, I didn't have a great night.

245
11:10.260 --> 11:11.520
So she'll remember that.

246
11:11.520 --> 11:13.447
And maybe around 5:00 or 6:00 she'll ask you,

247
11:13.447 --> 11:16.350
maybe you wanna have some breathing exercises

248
11:16.350 --> 11:20.700
before you go to sleep or maybe a short meditation session.

249
11:20.700 --> 11:22.890
And if you'll agree, she'll ask you the next day.

250
11:22.890 --> 11:26.490
So she's really sort of ongoing relationship conversation.

251
11:26.490 --> 11:27.540
How do you sleep?

252
11:27.540 --> 11:30.270
And if you said, oh, I was better tonight.

253
11:30.270 --> 11:31.680
So she'll initiate

254
11:31.680 --> 11:35.460
the same kind of interaction next evening.

255
11:35.460 --> 11:36.480
If it doesn't work,

256
11:36.480 --> 11:37.950
maybe she'll ask you in the morning

257
11:37.950 --> 11:40.050
if you wanna do a short yoga session,

258
11:40.050 --> 11:43.560
or maybe she'll suggest to call your doctor

259
11:43.560 --> 11:45.360
or call your daughter or call your son

260
11:45.360 --> 11:46.710
or a different loved one

261
11:46.710 --> 11:48.270
to see whether they can help.

262
11:48.270 --> 11:51.030
So we really do leverage AI

263
11:51.030 --> 11:53.250
to also be able to have those interactions,

264
11:53.250 --> 11:57.630
but to also have a much more natural and wide

265
11:57.630 --> 11:59.160
and deep conversation.

266
11:59.160 --> 12:02.310
So ElliQ can talk with the users about the meaning of life.

267
12:02.310 --> 12:04.410
She can interpret their dreams,

268
12:04.410 --> 12:07.440
she can talk to them about childhood memories,

269
12:07.440 --> 12:10.620
she can talk to them about sporting events, historic events.

270
12:10.620 --> 12:13.740
So really everything and anything.

271
12:13.740 --> 12:14.940
<v ->Yeah, so it really sounds like</v>

272
12:14.940 --> 12:16.770
when we talk about the various forms

273
12:16.770 --> 12:18.990
or you know, subcategories of AI,

274
12:18.990 --> 12:21.810
you're already really leaning into that creative,

275
12:21.810 --> 12:26.610
you know, generative layer of AI with your ElliQ.

276
12:26.610 --> 12:29.550
<v ->Yes, combined with her very unique character.</v>

277
12:29.550 --> 12:30.383
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

278
12:30.383 --> 12:31.216
Okay, Casey, tell us,

279
12:31.216 --> 12:32.970
Josh.ai it's right in the name,

280
12:32.970 --> 12:34.710
for those of in the crowd

281
12:34.710 --> 12:37.560
who might not be familiar with what you do, right,

282
12:37.560 --> 12:41.727
tell us all the layers of how you're leveraging AI

283
12:41.727 --> 12:43.800
and some of your more recent announcements

284
12:43.800 --> 12:46.290
of what the next generation looks like.

285
12:46.290 --> 12:47.123
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

286
12:47.123 --> 12:48.300
Good morning everybody.

287
12:48.300 --> 12:50.250
Thank you to Parks Associates and everybody

288
12:50.250 --> 12:51.210
for putting this on.

289
12:51.210 --> 12:53.520
And also for all of you for waking up with us this morning

290
12:53.520 --> 12:55.590
for the first one of these.

291
12:55.590 --> 12:57.000
My name is Casey Levy-Tulloch,

292
12:57.000 --> 12:59.700
director of Business Development at Josh.ai.

293
12:59.700 --> 13:02.400
The way that I would put Josh in a nutshell

294
13:02.400 --> 13:04.890
is that we are your smart home control system.

295
13:04.890 --> 13:06.330
in the era of AI.

296
13:06.330 --> 13:09.360
We offer all of your traditional interfaces,

297
13:09.360 --> 13:12.690
a mobile app, a touchscreen, universal remote controls.

298
13:12.690 --> 13:14.280
We also offer a couple different

299
13:14.280 --> 13:16.050
far-field microphone products,

300
13:16.050 --> 13:20.310
which leverage AI through, you know, throughout the process.

301
13:20.310 --> 13:22.530
But it doesn't just start there with the user experience

302
13:22.530 --> 13:24.330
and ultimately the different interfaces

303
13:24.330 --> 13:25.470
that you use in the smart home

304
13:25.470 --> 13:27.840
to talk to your connected devices.

305
13:27.840 --> 13:31.350
We start by leveraging AI in the deployment process

306
13:31.350 --> 13:33.000
and we'll probably get into that a bit more later.

307
13:33.000 --> 13:35.640
But basically making the smart home simpler,

308
13:35.640 --> 13:40.530
not only to interact with but also to commission, setup,

309
13:40.530 --> 13:44.310
ultimately personalize and customize with natural scenes,

310
13:44.310 --> 13:46.620
which I would say are maybe one of

311
13:46.620 --> 13:48.930
the most powerful transformative aspects of the smart home

312
13:48.930 --> 13:51.600
is creating a good morning or a good night scene.

313
13:51.600 --> 13:53.460
We have a special tool

314
13:53.460 --> 13:55.860
that we use called our Natural Language Scene Builder.

315
13:55.860 --> 13:56.693
It's an extension

316
13:56.693 --> 13:58.680
of our natural language processing with voice

317
13:58.680 --> 14:01.140
where you can basically dictate

318
14:01.140 --> 14:03.180
what you'd like that activation to be.

319
14:03.180 --> 14:05.070
You want to dim your lights in the bedroom,

320
14:05.070 --> 14:07.050
open the shades on the second floor,

321
14:07.050 --> 14:08.790
listen to your favorite playlist,

322
14:08.790 --> 14:10.650
you can simply dictate that to Josh.

323
14:10.650 --> 14:13.770
You of course could program it or configure it as well.

324
14:13.770 --> 14:16.920
But we're removing the barriers of complexity ultimately

325
14:16.920 --> 14:20.147
for the the best custom and most personalized experiences

326
14:20.147 --> 14:21.303
in the smart home.

327
14:22.320 --> 14:23.153
In addition to that,

328
14:23.153 --> 14:26.070
we are not just a smart home control system,

329
14:26.070 --> 14:30.600
we also offer an intelligent assistant that we call JoshGPT.

330
14:30.600 --> 14:33.575
We launched JoshGPT a couple summers ago

331
14:33.575 --> 14:37.140
and basically built our own LLM on top of our core stack

332
14:37.140 --> 14:39.290
of natural language processing in the home.

333
14:40.200 --> 14:42.330
JoshGPT basically can answer

334
14:42.330 --> 14:45.270
any sort of assistant type question or query

335
14:45.270 --> 14:46.103
that you would have.

336
14:46.103 --> 14:48.570
So you want a recipe while you're cooking,

337
14:48.570 --> 14:50.130
you want travel recommendations

338
14:50.130 --> 14:52.170
for your upcoming Vegas trip,

339
14:52.170 --> 14:53.460
whatever it may be,

340
14:53.460 --> 14:55.290
JoshGPT is your intelligent assistant

341
14:55.290 --> 14:59.010
that we essentially can send those commands off to for,

342
14:59.010 --> 15:02.133
you know, more engaging personalized experience as well.

343
15:03.120 --> 15:04.950
But yeah, we'll get into much more later,

344
15:04.950 --> 15:07.050
but that's a quick intro.

345
15:07.050 --> 15:08.220
<v Jennifer>So quick follow up there.</v>

346
15:08.220 --> 15:10.980
Can you share anything about what people are asking most?

347
15:10.980 --> 15:12.810
What are they looking to know

348
15:12.810 --> 15:15.780
or be assisted with with JoshGPT?

349
15:15.780 --> 15:18.870
<v ->Yeah, JoshGPT I'd say recipes are really high up there.</v>

350
15:18.870 --> 15:20.940
Naturally you're cooking in your kitchen,

351
15:20.940 --> 15:21.773
your hands are busy,

352
15:21.773 --> 15:23.430
so asking, you know,

353
15:23.430 --> 15:25.530
how many table spoons are in this recipe

354
15:25.530 --> 15:28.170
or how do I make chocolate chip cookies

355
15:28.170 --> 15:29.730
or something like that.

356
15:29.730 --> 15:30.690
But we actually just published

357
15:30.690 --> 15:33.150
our top 10 voice commands of 2024.

358
15:33.150 --> 15:36.360
And the top 10 were all device commands to the home.

359
15:36.360 --> 15:39.800
So turn on the lights, open close the shades,

360
15:39.800 --> 15:42.513
thermostat commands, music,

361
15:43.410 --> 15:47.160
just kind of ranging across your different devices

362
15:47.160 --> 15:49.920
and that ecosystem that is continuing to expand

363
15:49.920 --> 15:51.150
in the home as well.

364
15:51.150 --> 15:52.050
<v ->Okay, fantastic.</v>

365
15:52.050 --> 15:54.060
And the creating of routines is really a big one.

366
15:54.060 --> 15:56.430
We did some research in the past year around

367
15:56.430 --> 15:58.260
how many households are actually

368
15:58.260 --> 16:01.440
creating automations and routines between devices

369
16:01.440 --> 16:04.050
to get more to that whole home vision

370
16:04.050 --> 16:06.270
and of how a smart home can function.

371
16:06.270 --> 16:08.970
And just 40% of smart home device owners today

372
16:08.970 --> 16:12.360
are actually coordinating their devices in some way.

373
16:12.360 --> 16:13.530
There's still a lot of friction

374
16:13.530 --> 16:16.050
in trying to figure out how to make that happen.

375
16:16.050 --> 16:18.450
Paulus, tell us more about the Open Home Foundation.

376
16:18.450 --> 16:19.560
<v ->Yeah, good morning everyone.</v>

377
16:19.560 --> 16:20.850
My name is Paulus Schoutsen,

378
16:20.850 --> 16:23.478
I'm the president of the Open Home Foundation.

379
16:23.478 --> 16:27.150
We're better known for our work on Home Assistant.

380
16:27.150 --> 16:29.220
Home Assistant is a smart home platform

381
16:29.220 --> 16:31.260
that probably all the engineers at your company

382
16:31.260 --> 16:32.850
are always talking about.

383
16:32.850 --> 16:35.640
It's a very big platform,

384
16:35.640 --> 16:38.820
one of the most active open source project in the world

385
16:38.820 --> 16:40.920
and has a big focus on local control and privacy.

386
16:40.920 --> 16:43.020
So everybody can always run it at home.

387
16:43.020 --> 16:45.720
And we believe that users, they own their data,

388
16:45.720 --> 16:47.040
they can do with it what they want.

389
16:47.040 --> 16:49.020
So when it comes to AI,

390
16:49.020 --> 16:50.700
we've been very early adopters

391
16:50.700 --> 16:53.280
giving AI hooks into Home Assistant,

392
16:53.280 --> 16:55.350
let it read out information,

393
16:55.350 --> 16:58.350
read out historical data, control devices.

394
16:58.350 --> 17:01.440
We believe that right now our biggest use case

395
17:01.440 --> 17:03.900
that we see users actually use it for is voice.

396
17:03.900 --> 17:06.450
Because it's just nice that

397
17:06.450 --> 17:08.190
if you talk to your voice assistant,

398
17:08.190 --> 17:10.560
AI will make sure that it always understands

399
17:10.560 --> 17:11.550
what you're trying.

400
17:11.550 --> 17:14.220
And before it was like you need to say exactly

401
17:14.220 --> 17:17.130
the way Google planned for you to control your lights.

402
17:17.130 --> 17:19.140
Now you can be a bit more ambiguous.

403
17:19.140 --> 17:21.120
For example, the other day I said,

404
17:21.120 --> 17:23.460
I'm coming out of the shower, get my room ready,

405
17:23.460 --> 17:25.590
and it closed my blinds and turned on my light,

406
17:25.590 --> 17:28.290
without me saying anything of like that kind of thing.

407
17:28.290 --> 17:29.700
And so,

408
17:29.700 --> 17:32.700
making sure that voice commands are always successful,

409
17:32.700 --> 17:34.590
that's like a big hit.

410
17:34.590 --> 17:35.910
My son personally is like

411
17:35.910 --> 17:38.190
querying Pokemon stuff all the time with AI,

412
17:38.190 --> 17:40.470
which is also very good for.

413
17:40.470 --> 17:42.870
But we see actually a very bigger role for AI.

414
17:42.870 --> 17:44.760
We've already exposed it to, for example,

415
17:44.760 --> 17:45.840
our automation engine.

416
17:45.840 --> 17:48.030
So people will write automations,

417
17:48.030 --> 17:50.250
gather some events that are happening in the house

418
17:50.250 --> 17:53.130
and then ask an AI, is this a suspicious event?

419
17:53.130 --> 17:55.620
And for example, if a door is opening at night

420
17:55.620 --> 17:56.820
and you know that people are sleeping,

421
17:56.820 --> 17:58.830
the lights are off, that's suspicious,

422
17:58.830 --> 18:00.270
maybe we should wake up the homeowner.

423
18:00.270 --> 18:03.480
And so just getting from the AI simple yes, no,

424
18:03.480 --> 18:05.130
and then your automation can continue,

425
18:05.130 --> 18:07.230
that's been a big hit as well.

426
18:07.230 --> 18:08.770
So, yeah.

427
18:08.770 --> 18:11.400
<v ->Yeah, I think where you guys sit is so interesting,</v>

428
18:11.400 --> 18:14.627
just by the nature of kind of the open project

429
18:14.627 --> 18:15.720
that you're working with,

430
18:15.720 --> 18:17.460
you're dealing a lot with innovators

431
18:17.460 --> 18:19.530
who really know what they want,

432
18:19.530 --> 18:21.360
you know, out of the smart home.

433
18:21.360 --> 18:24.090
How does that influence what they're asking for

434
18:24.090 --> 18:26.700
when it comes to AI capabilities?

435
18:26.700 --> 18:28.230
<v ->Well the main thing they always ask for</v>

436
18:28.230 --> 18:29.400
is can we have all the data?

437
18:29.400 --> 18:31.140
And we're like, yes, here is all the data.

438
18:31.140 --> 18:32.520
But it also means that for example,

439
18:32.520 --> 18:34.470
there's model context protocol,

440
18:34.470 --> 18:37.650
which is a way of AI agents to talk to other systems,

441
18:37.650 --> 18:40.260
which is like something that Anthropic just standardized.

442
18:40.260 --> 18:41.370
Well, we've been adopting that

443
18:41.370 --> 18:45.030
and we make sure that when now people writing agents,

444
18:45.030 --> 18:47.460
which is gonna be the big thing I think in 2025,

445
18:47.460 --> 18:48.990
they can talk to Home Assistant,

446
18:48.990 --> 18:51.720
integrate that into whatever the agent is doing.

447
18:51.720 --> 18:52.800
I don't believe Home Assistant

448
18:52.800 --> 18:54.540
is gonna be the one running your agents

449
18:54.540 --> 18:56.670
just because there's so much more in your life, right?

450
18:56.670 --> 18:58.440
We are not locked into your work Slack,

451
18:58.440 --> 19:00.060
nor do I want to be Home Assistant

452
19:00.060 --> 19:01.650
have access to your work Slack,

453
19:01.650 --> 19:03.270
but maybe you want your AI agent

454
19:03.270 --> 19:05.400
to integrate that part of data as well.

455
19:05.400 --> 19:06.300
But yeah, we see,

456
19:06.300 --> 19:08.850
there's just so much stuff happening all the time

457
19:08.850 --> 19:11.130
and basically Home Assistant,

458
19:11.130 --> 19:13.500
because it's the only platform that is fully open,

459
19:13.500 --> 19:16.170
people are just fully getting all the data out

460
19:16.170 --> 19:17.003
and playing with it.

461
19:17.003 --> 19:18.660
We see a lot of cool stuff happening.

462
19:18.660 --> 19:19.800
<v ->Yeah, fantastic.</v>

463
19:19.800 --> 19:21.810
Okay, Paul, tell us about Nice Group

464
19:21.810 --> 19:23.910
and where you guys are really, you know,

465
19:23.910 --> 19:26.640
placing your bets and pulling in the power of AI.

466
19:26.640 --> 19:27.473
<v ->You bet, well, first of all,</v>

467
19:27.473 --> 19:28.710
thank you for inviting me again.

468
19:28.710 --> 19:31.170
I love these events, they're fantastic.

469
19:31.170 --> 19:32.490
My name is Paul Williams.

470
19:32.490 --> 19:34.590
I'm the global managing director

471
19:34.590 --> 19:36.630
for home management at Nice.

472
19:36.630 --> 19:39.060
And what that means is I have global responsibility

473
19:39.060 --> 19:39.893
for anything to do with

474
19:39.893 --> 19:42.630
smart home security and access control.

475
19:42.630 --> 19:45.360
We manufacture smart home solutions,

476
19:45.360 --> 19:50.360
everything from lighting control to HVAC, audio, video,

477
19:50.640 --> 19:53.070
create your feature functions including security systems

478
19:53.070 --> 19:56.010
to keep your home safe and secure at the same time too.

479
19:56.010 --> 19:58.590
So we're leveraging AI in several different ways right now

480
19:58.590 --> 20:01.050
with more coming into the future.

481
20:01.050 --> 20:05.070
We just released our new voice platform,

482
20:05.070 --> 20:07.437
which allows for natural voice control over the home

483
20:07.437 --> 20:09.060
and all the functions within the home

484
20:09.060 --> 20:11.400
that can be controlled with our solution.

485
20:11.400 --> 20:13.380
Really on two big foundational issues.

486
20:13.380 --> 20:14.820
First one was natural language

487
20:14.820 --> 20:17.880
to be able to just not have to say a command word

488
20:17.880 --> 20:19.440
and then remember exactly

489
20:19.440 --> 20:21.180
what that light was called over there

490
20:21.180 --> 20:22.170
because it won't listen to me

491
20:22.170 --> 20:25.860
unless I manage the exact name or say the exact name.

492
20:25.860 --> 20:27.660
We're intelligent, we know you're in the room,

493
20:27.660 --> 20:28.590
you say turn the lights on,

494
20:28.590 --> 20:30.210
we figure it's the lights in those room.

495
20:30.210 --> 20:31.920
So very contextual based.

496
20:31.920 --> 20:33.270
But also part of that

497
20:33.270 --> 20:36.060
is then making sure that it's safe and secure.

498
20:36.060 --> 20:38.820
So the data itself belongs to the consumer.

499
20:38.820 --> 20:42.120
We're not storing any personal information in the cloud.

500
20:42.120 --> 20:44.790
We're not monetizing the information that's in the cloud.

501
20:44.790 --> 20:46.290
That's very important to us is to make sure

502
20:46.290 --> 20:48.720
that we're providing a great customer experience

503
20:48.720 --> 20:50.370
with that voice solution.

504
20:50.370 --> 20:51.210
So that's the first way.

505
20:51.210 --> 20:54.150
Second way is we have on our touch panels.

506
20:54.150 --> 20:55.620
So touch panels is one of the things

507
20:55.620 --> 20:57.840
that we provide to the homeowners.

508
20:57.840 --> 21:00.330
Touch panels also have facial recognition

509
21:00.330 --> 21:02.460
and what we're able to do is personalization.

510
21:02.460 --> 21:03.750
So one of the age old problems,

511
21:03.750 --> 21:05.160
at least in this what I'll call

512
21:05.160 --> 21:08.730
the luxury or premium smart home solution space

513
21:08.730 --> 21:11.760
is that you get one size fits all in a lot of homes.

514
21:11.760 --> 21:13.740
So the user interface is the same

515
21:13.740 --> 21:15.960
for no matter who in the home needs to interact with it.

516
21:15.960 --> 21:17.580
And sometimes that's okay,

517
21:17.580 --> 21:19.050
but in a lot of cases it's not,

518
21:19.050 --> 21:21.540
because, yeah, it means extra key clicks,

519
21:21.540 --> 21:23.070
or I have to go through a different menu,

520
21:23.070 --> 21:24.870
or it doesn't even make any sense to me at all.

521
21:24.870 --> 21:27.930
And what we're able to do is with facial recognition,

522
21:27.930 --> 21:29.040
make it very personalized.

523
21:29.040 --> 21:30.570
So as a consumer walks up,

524
21:30.570 --> 21:33.660
if one person in the home walks up, it recognizes them,

525
21:33.660 --> 21:35.220
they get their user experience.

526
21:35.220 --> 21:37.890
So if I want buttons that are just for my playlist

527
21:37.890 --> 21:39.960
or from the lighting or whatever is I'm controlling,

528
21:39.960 --> 21:40.980
I see those.

529
21:40.980 --> 21:43.500
Next person walks up can be 10 seconds later

530
21:43.500 --> 21:44.790
they get a completely

531
21:44.790 --> 21:47.400
or can get a completely different user interface

532
21:47.400 --> 21:50.100
that's really personalized for that consumer.

533
21:50.100 --> 21:52.170
And so that way we're having a personalized experience

534
21:52.170 --> 21:53.730
for all the people that live in the home,

535
21:53.730 --> 21:55.680
not just one who usually

536
21:55.680 --> 21:57.180
in the past has been the one that sets it

537
21:57.180 --> 21:59.010
and everybody else just has to live with it.

538
21:59.010 --> 22:00.118
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

539
22:00.118 --> 22:02.310
Let's talk about the facial recognition point

540
22:02.310 --> 22:05.340
'cause this gets in a little bit to consumer acceptance

541
22:05.340 --> 22:07.437
of some of the really advanced technologies

542
22:07.437 --> 22:09.000
that are being built.

543
22:09.000 --> 22:13.350
And AI specifically, you know,

544
22:13.350 --> 22:16.500
there's this push pull of the benefits, you know,

545
22:16.500 --> 22:19.380
that we all see of developing and pulling in AI

546
22:19.380 --> 22:21.930
to drive that next feature set.

547
22:21.930 --> 22:23.940
But are we getting ahead of the consumer

548
22:23.940 --> 22:25.140
and where's consumer comfort?

549
22:25.140 --> 22:25.980
Is there anything you could share

550
22:25.980 --> 22:27.900
on the facial recognition part that you talked about?

551
22:27.900 --> 22:30.960
I mean, you're definitely solving some friction points

552
22:30.960 --> 22:33.870
and some pain points and getting to that personalization.

553
22:33.870 --> 22:35.660
What do you think consumer openness is?

554
22:35.660 --> 22:37.253
<v ->So it varies and we're still on that,</v>

555
22:37.253 --> 22:39.900
I would say on that adoption curve that's there right now.

556
22:39.900 --> 22:42.240
What we see is that people will put touch panels

557
22:42.240 --> 22:43.073
in rooms in their home

558
22:43.073 --> 22:44.070
and there's some rooms where they're not gonna be

559
22:44.070 --> 22:45.000
activated at all.

560
22:45.000 --> 22:46.710
And that's one of the options we give the consumer.

561
22:46.710 --> 22:49.890
They can turn on or off that facial recognition.

562
22:49.890 --> 22:51.450
So we're seeing in open spaces

563
22:51.450 --> 22:54.630
that they're more readily acceptable to have that in place

564
22:54.630 --> 22:55.680
where you don't want at your bedroom,

565
22:55.680 --> 22:59.010
because and bathrooms, I just I don't trust it, right?

566
22:59.010 --> 23:01.980
I don't wanna make sure that there's not a camera

567
23:01.980 --> 23:03.870
that somewhere can be found on the web

568
23:03.870 --> 23:05.340
or found in the cloud somewhere.

569
23:05.340 --> 23:07.650
And so we're seeing that acceptance though

570
23:07.650 --> 23:09.570
is actually increasing though.

571
23:09.570 --> 23:11.880
And so people are starting to see the benefit.

572
23:11.880 --> 23:15.030
It's much akin to if we take mobile phones, right?

573
23:15.030 --> 23:16.380
Mobile phones, we opened up,

574
23:16.380 --> 23:19.710
many of us have opened up huge gaps in our own privacy

575
23:19.710 --> 23:21.870
by having mobile devices in our pockets right now.

576
23:21.870 --> 23:24.600
We've all accepted that the benefit that it gives us

577
23:24.600 --> 23:27.510
is higher than the potential deficit

578
23:27.510 --> 23:29.580
of having that information potentially out there.

579
23:29.580 --> 23:31.440
And so we make those trade-offs.

580
23:31.440 --> 23:33.870
And I think consumers are starting to get to that point.

581
23:33.870 --> 23:35.910
We're not quite there to the tipping point I would say yet,

582
23:35.910 --> 23:37.560
but we're in that curve.

583
23:37.560 --> 23:39.900
<v ->Yeah, and Amalia, I'd love to go to you here too,</v>

584
23:39.900 --> 23:44.220
because you're working directly with older consumers

585
23:44.220 --> 23:47.460
who tend to be some of the least accepting

586
23:47.460 --> 23:50.610
of new technology broadly,

587
23:50.610 --> 23:55.110
though we very much believe that seniors do use technology

588
23:55.110 --> 23:56.940
and they tell us all the time that they do,

589
23:56.940 --> 24:00.960
but tend to be later accepters, right?

590
24:00.960 --> 24:03.360
With high concerns about things like AI

591
24:03.360 --> 24:05.850
and here you have a company that's leaning into it.

592
24:05.850 --> 24:07.500
Can you tell us a little bit about

593
24:07.500 --> 24:09.684
what you've learned about that relationship

594
24:09.684 --> 24:12.450
and how you,

595
24:12.450 --> 24:15.330
you know, foster that consumer acceptance?

596
24:15.330 --> 24:16.163
<v ->Sure.</v>

597
24:16.163 --> 24:18.090
So to your point,

598
24:18.090 --> 24:21.000
older adults definitely use technology,

599
24:21.000 --> 24:24.480
but it needs to be built with them in mind.

600
24:24.480 --> 24:26.700
I mean, they have different needs,

601
24:26.700 --> 24:28.980
they have different knowledge gaps,

602
24:28.980 --> 24:30.720
and when you build something

603
24:30.720 --> 24:34.410
that's really simple and easy to use, they use it.

604
24:34.410 --> 24:38.850
I mean, and I think when we market directly to older adults,

605
24:38.850 --> 24:41.790
because we have different audiences,

606
24:41.790 --> 24:46.790
we don't lean necessarily into the AI, into the innovation,

607
24:47.190 --> 24:51.450
but we lean into what they have to gain living with ElliQ.

608
24:51.450 --> 24:53.910
So we talk about all the different things

609
24:53.910 --> 24:55.320
that they can do with her.

610
24:55.320 --> 24:58.680
We talk about the weekly bingo nights,

611
24:58.680 --> 25:01.410
which allow them to interact with other older adults

612
25:01.410 --> 25:03.750
across the country and play live bingo.

613
25:03.750 --> 25:06.750
We talk about all the health and wellness features

614
25:06.750 --> 25:09.840
and the ability to really connect with family members

615
25:09.840 --> 25:11.850
that aren't necessarily near them.

616
25:11.850 --> 25:13.350
And sometimes they have trouble

617
25:13.350 --> 25:15.600
using FaceTime or using Zoom.

618
25:15.600 --> 25:18.060
And with ElliQ it's just so much easier.

619
25:18.060 --> 25:20.340
All they need to do is give her a voice command.

620
25:20.340 --> 25:23.010
Tell her, ElliQ, let's call Amalia,

621
25:23.010 --> 25:25.320
and then she just does that for them.

622
25:25.320 --> 25:28.950
So we see 56% of the users actually saying

623
25:28.950 --> 25:31.920
they feel more connected to the outside world

624
25:31.920 --> 25:34.710
ever since they've been living with ElliQ.

625
25:34.710 --> 25:35.733
So I think,

626
25:36.780 --> 25:40.080
first of all, when they see other older adults like them

627
25:40.080 --> 25:43.110
in our marketing material, in our ads,

628
25:43.110 --> 25:46.950
it does sort of foster a sense of security.

629
25:46.950 --> 25:50.070
And we just make it very relatable

630
25:50.070 --> 25:52.320
and very easy to understand the benefit

631
25:52.320 --> 25:54.150
without talking about the technology.

632
25:54.150 --> 25:57.870
For sure, there are issues and concerns about privacy,

633
25:57.870 --> 25:59.880
but we're super transparent.

634
25:59.880 --> 26:01.410
We always reassure them

635
26:01.410 --> 26:04.920
that we don't use any personalized data to train our models.

636
26:04.920 --> 26:06.930
We completely anonymize the data.

637
26:06.930 --> 26:10.410
Everything that we use on premise

638
26:10.410 --> 26:13.200
to sort of personalize the experience stays on premise.

639
26:13.200 --> 26:14.880
It doesn't train our models.

640
26:14.880 --> 26:18.150
So I think we try to be very transparent.

641
26:18.150 --> 26:20.790
We have an AI code of ethics that we share

642
26:20.790 --> 26:23.160
with all of our users, all of our partners,

643
26:23.160 --> 26:26.700
and hopefully that does ease a lot of the concerns.

644
26:26.700 --> 26:27.693
<v ->Yeah, okay.</v>

645
26:28.770 --> 26:31.380
So I'd love to actually talk more about

646
26:31.380 --> 26:32.790
the challenges of AI,

647
26:32.790 --> 26:35.006
maybe even from a product development standpoint.

648
26:35.006 --> 26:36.810
There's just the costs,

649
26:36.810 --> 26:38.070
you know, to start with

650
26:38.070 --> 26:40.830
when you decide that you want to,

651
26:40.830 --> 26:42.000
you know, pull in some of these features

652
26:42.000 --> 26:43.377
and especially as we get to generative AI

653
26:43.377 --> 26:45.780
and the compute power it takes,

654
26:45.780 --> 26:48.540
there's big competitive shifts in the market,

655
26:48.540 --> 26:50.100
cybersecurity vulnerabilities,

656
26:50.100 --> 26:53.520
intellectual property risks associated with AI,

657
26:53.520 --> 26:56.460
uncertain regulatory environment for sure.

658
26:56.460 --> 26:58.140
Arsham and then Casey,

659
26:58.140 --> 27:00.540
I'd love to go to you if you could talk a little bit about

660
27:00.540 --> 27:02.460
what are some of the biggest challenges

661
27:02.460 --> 27:04.020
as you're developing your new framework

662
27:04.020 --> 27:05.400
you were talking about, right,

663
27:05.400 --> 27:07.683
in AI for the business?

664
27:08.700 --> 27:11.520
<v ->So how you look at the financial side</v>

665
27:11.520 --> 27:14.130
really has to do with the stage of the company.

666
27:14.130 --> 27:16.470
There are companies that are quite okay

667
27:16.470 --> 27:18.960
playing the loss leader game.

668
27:18.960 --> 27:21.090
All they need are the numbers

669
27:21.090 --> 27:22.860
and you can buy up the market

670
27:22.860 --> 27:26.250
and then deliver the value at a later point.

671
27:26.250 --> 27:29.190
Unfortunately, not every company has that benefit.

672
27:29.190 --> 27:30.720
So we have to measure

673
27:30.720 --> 27:33.900
the value of the problem that we're solving versus the cost

674
27:33.900 --> 27:35.520
on an ongoing basis.

675
27:35.520 --> 27:40.520
So we deliberately pick which AI models

676
27:40.620 --> 27:42.360
do we move to the cloud

677
27:42.360 --> 27:45.630
and do we incur the recurring cost

678
27:45.630 --> 27:49.170
because there's a recurring value being generated.

679
27:49.170 --> 27:52.260
And which do we need to actually start

680
27:52.260 --> 27:54.000
innovating on the hardware side

681
27:54.000 --> 27:56.190
so that we can slowly shift

682
27:56.190 --> 27:59.700
smaller inference engines to the edge

683
27:59.700 --> 28:02.880
that will have access to a lot more data by the way.

684
28:02.880 --> 28:04.620
The amount of data that you can process

685
28:04.620 --> 28:06.400
on the edge in real time

686
28:07.410 --> 28:11.100
doesn't even come close to what you can shift to the cloud.

687
28:11.100 --> 28:13.560
So the reliability and the access to the data

688
28:13.560 --> 28:14.820
on the edge is a lot more,

689
28:14.820 --> 28:17.070
obviously your models are much simpler.

690
28:17.070 --> 28:18.660
So as long as you can carve out

691
28:18.660 --> 28:20.640
what problems do you solve on the edge,

692
28:20.640 --> 28:23.460
what problems do you solve on the server-side,

693
28:23.460 --> 28:27.300
then you can balance out your front up cost on a product,

694
28:27.300 --> 28:29.580
and then the recurring cost versus the value

695
28:29.580 --> 28:31.770
that's gonna be generated on the other side.

696
28:31.770 --> 28:36.060
So for us, it has to do with true value generation,

697
28:36.060 --> 28:39.303
not simply writing the buzzword.

698
28:40.140 --> 28:40.973
Believe it or not,

699
28:40.973 --> 28:42.810
actually using the term AI

700
28:42.810 --> 28:45.720
doesn't help your product sell better with the consumers.

701
28:45.720 --> 28:50.070
It does help your stock sell better with the analysts,

702
28:50.070 --> 28:53.340
but the consumer actually gets turned off.

703
28:53.340 --> 28:54.173
<v Jennifer>Yeah.</v>

704
28:55.020 --> 28:58.590
For UEI, when you think about the challenges

705
28:58.590 --> 29:00.930
in AI development for instance today,

706
29:00.930 --> 29:04.380
is cost the number one challenge or is there something else?

707
29:04.380 --> 29:05.938
Keeps you up at night?

708
29:05.938 --> 29:10.938
<v ->So our scope is typically residential environments,</v>

709
29:12.210 --> 29:14.940
either residential or light commercial,

710
29:14.940 --> 29:19.530
we do believe that users' attention

711
29:19.530 --> 29:23.640
will derive who and which brands and which ecosystems

712
29:23.640 --> 29:26.850
will have access to the largest amount of data

713
29:26.850 --> 29:30.390
and they will have a better opportunity

714
29:30.390 --> 29:32.820
to build a far better model

715
29:32.820 --> 29:36.810
than we ever could for a generalized home automation.

716
29:36.810 --> 29:40.200
So we focus on building out experts

717
29:40.200 --> 29:41.790
in a multi-assistant environment,

718
29:41.790 --> 29:46.440
experts that can achieve specific tasks so well

719
29:46.440 --> 29:49.260
that even a generalized assistant in the home

720
29:49.260 --> 29:51.000
will still rely on them

721
29:51.000 --> 29:53.820
for completing a specific task,

722
29:53.820 --> 29:57.300
from onboarding to predictive maintenance

723
29:57.300 --> 30:02.300
to ongoing troubleshooting to personalization and targeting

724
30:02.340 --> 30:05.100
in a private fashion, dot, dot, dot.

725
30:05.100 --> 30:07.650
So we focus on very specific use cases.

726
30:07.650 --> 30:10.410
We try to be the best at those,

727
30:10.410 --> 30:13.920
imagining how we need to either function

728
30:13.920 --> 30:16.260
as an independent product in the home

729
30:16.260 --> 30:18.870
or connect to the rest of the ecosystem.

730
30:18.870 --> 30:21.510
So useful as a standalone product

731
30:21.510 --> 30:23.490
and far better in an ecosystem

732
30:23.490 --> 30:25.740
that works with other assistants.

733
30:25.740 --> 30:27.000
<v ->Okay.</v>

734
30:27.000 --> 30:31.050
Josh, what are the challenges that are you're up against

735
30:31.050 --> 30:34.140
in all the development that you're doing with AI right now?

736
30:34.140 --> 30:34.980
<v ->Yeah.</v>

737
30:34.980 --> 30:36.480
Well, there's.

738
30:36.480 --> 30:37.313
<v ->Casey.</v>

739
30:37.313 --> 30:38.340
<v ->Yeah, Casey, Josh,</v>

740
30:38.340 --> 30:39.360
I respond to both.
<v ->I'm sorry.</v>

741
30:39.360 --> 30:41.370
<v ->Yeah, it's fine.</v>
<v ->Casey at Josh.</v>

742
30:41.370 --> 30:42.390
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Thank you.</v>

743
30:42.390 --> 30:43.540
<v ->You can call me Josh.</v>

744
30:44.430 --> 30:47.280
So yeah, the cost associated with AI,

745
30:47.280 --> 30:48.180
it's really interesting

746
30:48.180 --> 30:50.550
because we pay our cellphone bill, we pay our cable bill,

747
30:50.550 --> 30:53.730
we pay these monthly recurring fees for our services.

748
30:53.730 --> 30:55.080
However, the smart home hasn't really done

749
30:55.080 --> 30:57.090
a great job of implementing that yet.

750
30:57.090 --> 30:58.650
And we have at Josh,

751
30:58.650 --> 31:00.300
we've built a successful business model

752
31:00.300 --> 31:02.550
with a hardware sale, a software sale,

753
31:02.550 --> 31:06.420
and we offer monthly, annual, five-year and lifetime plans.

754
31:06.420 --> 31:10.020
And we've modeled out what that profitability is,

755
31:10.020 --> 31:11.700
what makes sense for us as a business

756
31:11.700 --> 31:14.700
given our users and all that good stuff.

757
31:14.700 --> 31:17.820
But it is important to note for a consumer,

758
31:17.820 --> 31:19.800
and just to kind of take a step back as well

759
31:19.800 --> 31:22.440
of you look at big tech out there,

760
31:22.440 --> 31:24.870
these are really affordable microphones

761
31:24.870 --> 31:27.390
or other devices on a shelf that can,

762
31:27.390 --> 31:29.430
you know, listen to you and,

763
31:29.430 --> 31:30.990
you know, execute commands in your home.

764
31:30.990 --> 31:32.280
However, you know,

765
31:32.280 --> 31:35.310
why is this device 50 bucks or 25 bucks?

766
31:35.310 --> 31:36.990
And it's because, you know,

767
31:36.990 --> 31:39.390
they're making money in another way,

768
31:39.390 --> 31:40.710
not necessarily, you know,

769
31:40.710 --> 31:42.450
by charging you for the experience.

770
31:42.450 --> 31:44.790
So for us,

771
31:44.790 --> 31:45.750
we are very conscious

772
31:45.750 --> 31:48.300
of all the different services that we use,

773
31:48.300 --> 31:49.890
whether it's the speech-to-text process,

774
31:49.890 --> 31:52.020
the speech recognition platforms,

775
31:52.020 --> 31:54.990
the LLMs and just various services that we use

776
31:54.990 --> 31:59.990
to facilitate the AI that Josh offers all of our clients.

777
32:00.330 --> 32:02.959
And by modeling that out,

778
32:02.959 --> 32:06.963
it's a fun math equation essentially to figure out,

779
32:09.085 --> 32:11.880
as we reach economies of scale, how these costs decrease.

780
32:11.880 --> 32:12.990
But it's a non-zero cost.

781
32:12.990 --> 32:16.170
I think that's an important thing for consumers to realize

782
32:16.170 --> 32:19.710
is that this experience is not just a la carte

783
32:19.710 --> 32:22.983
or it's not a free one that comes with this hardware.

784
32:24.420 --> 32:25.253
In addition to that,

785
32:25.253 --> 32:26.086
just, you know,

786
32:28.195 --> 32:29.340
I'd say that that pretty much covers it

787
32:29.340 --> 32:31.950
as far as the software cost.

788
32:31.950 --> 32:34.380
<v ->Yeah, it's kind of the story of the smart home</v>

789
32:34.380 --> 32:36.180
of trying to figure out

790
32:36.180 --> 32:38.580
what consumers will pay for an ongoing basis

791
32:38.580 --> 32:40.110
to cover the connectivity costs,

792
32:40.110 --> 32:42.210
and now really it's the intelligence costs,

793
32:42.210 --> 32:44.460
you know, as well.

794
32:44.460 --> 32:48.240
Some rumors that there's maybe some subscription

795
32:48.240 --> 32:51.450
coming from some of the big, you know, giants.

796
32:51.450 --> 32:53.100
And if so perhaps training consumers

797
32:53.100 --> 32:54.420
to think a little bit differently

798
32:54.420 --> 32:57.000
about what that premium tier

799
32:57.000 --> 32:59.266
that you pay for looks like, you know.

800
32:59.266 --> 33:02.640
It could be interesting on the competitive landscape too.

801
33:02.640 --> 33:06.420
Which Paulus I'd love to kind of get your thoughts on of

802
33:06.420 --> 33:09.900
how AI and generative AI in particular

803
33:09.900 --> 33:12.420
kind of redefine the competitive landscape

804
33:12.420 --> 33:16.680
and where smaller players or open players,

805
33:16.680 --> 33:19.953
you know, how you kind of compete in that environment?

806
33:20.820 --> 33:23.280
<v ->Well I think it has completely changed it, right?</v>

807
33:23.280 --> 33:25.710
Where we, five years ago it was like,

808
33:25.710 --> 33:26.820
how can we ever compete

809
33:26.820 --> 33:29.220
with Google and Amazon on their AI stuff

810
33:29.220 --> 33:30.570
because we can only access it

811
33:30.570 --> 33:33.090
through the voice assistants that they sell us

812
33:33.090 --> 33:36.420
and now we can just pick up an API and we're almost,

813
33:36.420 --> 33:39.270
we're better than the voice assistants of five years ago.

814
33:39.270 --> 33:41.490
Now because of that,

815
33:41.490 --> 33:44.490
it also is more interesting and important

816
33:44.490 --> 33:45.510
to build on top of it

817
33:45.510 --> 33:48.270
because everybody has access to the same LLMs, right?

818
33:48.270 --> 33:49.410
We have the same AI,

819
33:49.410 --> 33:51.600
so how do you differentiate?

820
33:51.600 --> 33:56.370
And so I think that the way we're competing has to change

821
33:56.370 --> 33:59.700
where everybody will be able to answer questions about

822
33:59.700 --> 34:01.920
the world or your recipes or these things

823
34:01.920 --> 34:03.870
because, well, an LLM can just do that

824
34:03.870 --> 34:06.150
if you pay for the biggest models.

825
34:06.150 --> 34:07.830
And so it will be really important

826
34:07.830 --> 34:10.950
what is the user experience that we can build on top of it?

827
34:10.950 --> 34:14.400
How can you make sure that it is tuned to the user?

828
34:14.400 --> 34:16.200
How can you use their local habits

829
34:16.200 --> 34:19.770
and integrate it into how they use the platform?

830
34:19.770 --> 34:21.720
And I think that's gonna be way more important.

831
34:21.720 --> 34:24.390
But until now it was more about like,

832
34:24.390 --> 34:26.370
how do we even get voice in a house,

833
34:26.370 --> 34:28.140
or like, it was very hard to compete.

834
34:28.140 --> 34:29.580
And so yeah, we're just making,

835
34:29.580 --> 34:32.280
we're gonna compete at a different level.

836
34:32.280 --> 34:34.410
<v ->Okay, so we only have about five minutes left.</v>

837
34:34.410 --> 34:36.480
There's one question we're getting asked actually

838
34:36.480 --> 34:39.480
quite a bit at this kind of stage of the game,

839
34:39.480 --> 34:41.310
which is it's a little bit of a wild west

840
34:41.310 --> 34:45.210
when it comes to the regulatory landscape for AI right now,

841
34:45.210 --> 34:46.890
but expectations, you know,

842
34:46.890 --> 34:48.840
that there could be more coming down the pipe.

843
34:48.840 --> 34:51.240
And I'm really interested to understand how you,

844
34:51.240 --> 34:52.980
you know, what you really have your eye on

845
34:52.980 --> 34:56.130
and how you're thinking about potential regulations,

846
34:56.130 --> 34:58.530
is it are you looking more at regulations

847
34:58.530 --> 35:00.030
around data privacy and security

848
35:00.030 --> 35:02.190
or intellectual property concerns

849
35:02.190 --> 35:03.660
or bias and discrimination?

850
35:03.660 --> 35:07.140
There are all sorts of kind of angles of AI development

851
35:07.140 --> 35:07.980
that's happening right now

852
35:07.980 --> 35:12.780
that are kind of raising the attention of regulators.

853
35:12.780 --> 35:14.160
So maybe Paul and then Arsham,

854
35:14.160 --> 35:16.590
if you have anything that you can comment about

855
35:16.590 --> 35:20.130
how you operate in this uncertain regulatory environment

856
35:20.130 --> 35:22.500
and what you're really preparing for.

857
35:22.500 --> 35:23.943
<v ->Yeah, so there's, as you mentioned,</v>

858
35:23.943 --> 35:25.350
it's kind of the wild west right now,

859
35:25.350 --> 35:26.700
at least in certain parts of the world.

860
35:26.700 --> 35:28.920
North America for sure.

861
35:28.920 --> 35:31.770
You go to Europe, Europeans in the audience.

862
35:31.770 --> 35:33.870
So GDPR has been in place for some time.

863
35:33.870 --> 35:35.250
I think it's a good model.

864
35:35.250 --> 35:37.650
And I think it's one of the things we're looking at to say

865
35:37.650 --> 35:40.260
what would the world look like if it was GDPR.

866
35:40.260 --> 35:42.570
And GDPR I think takes a very conservative view

867
35:42.570 --> 35:46.140
of making sure that we're protecting users' data.

868
35:46.140 --> 35:49.533
And that also extends into how are models being trained.

869
35:50.552 --> 35:52.650
What sources are using to train those models?

870
35:52.650 --> 35:55.050
There's been a lot of that come up recently

871
35:55.050 --> 35:56.580
where a lot of these models are being trained

872
35:56.580 --> 35:59.550
by just pulling images and other things off the internet,

873
35:59.550 --> 36:01.560
which could and most likely

874
36:01.560 --> 36:04.320
are violating privacy laws already.

875
36:04.320 --> 36:06.480
And so we wanna make sure we're not doing that.

876
36:06.480 --> 36:10.560
We also making sure that the user's privacy is secure.

877
36:10.560 --> 36:15.540
But a big part of that is that the consumer owns that data.

878
36:15.540 --> 36:17.727
And a big part of GDPR and a big part of what we're seeing

879
36:17.727 --> 36:18.780
and what we'll I think

880
36:18.780 --> 36:20.970
we're going to continue to see in North America

881
36:20.970 --> 36:24.090
is that I as a consumer have the right to tell you

882
36:24.090 --> 36:26.220
the person storing that data

883
36:26.220 --> 36:27.630
that I don't want you to store it.

884
36:27.630 --> 36:28.463
First of all,

885
36:28.463 --> 36:29.760
I wanna understand that you have to be explicit

886
36:29.760 --> 36:31.410
on how you're using that data,

887
36:31.410 --> 36:33.990
what you're using it for, and how you plan to use it,

888
36:33.990 --> 36:36.300
that I am aware of before I then volunteer

889
36:36.300 --> 36:37.500
that information to you.

890
36:37.500 --> 36:41.430
And then secondly, I have the ability to not only take it,

891
36:41.430 --> 36:42.530
but I can also transport it.

892
36:42.530 --> 36:44.430
It has to be provided in a way

893
36:44.430 --> 36:46.230
that it can bring down in code

894
36:46.230 --> 36:48.420
that I could transport that same data

895
36:48.420 --> 36:49.980
to somebody else's model.

896
36:49.980 --> 36:51.960
And I think it's a good way to be thinking about

897
36:51.960 --> 36:53.100
what's happening right now.

898
36:53.100 --> 36:55.140
We are seeing some states.

899
36:55.140 --> 36:55.973
Illinois has probably got

900
36:55.973 --> 36:58.170
the biggest facial recognition laws

901
36:58.170 --> 36:59.460
that are on the books today.

902
36:59.460 --> 37:01.470
There's personal damages that you can sue for

903
37:01.470 --> 37:03.660
if your images are used in the wrong ways.

904
37:03.660 --> 37:05.550
California, Texas, Washington

905
37:05.550 --> 37:08.910
all have some laws little less stringent than Illinois.

906
37:08.910 --> 37:11.020
But we continue to watch the landscape.

907
37:11.020 --> 37:13.890
I'm confident that we will see certainly

908
37:13.890 --> 37:15.960
in the next few years something happen

909
37:15.960 --> 37:18.330
in the United States and North America as a whole,

910
37:18.330 --> 37:19.620
that kind of tightens that up a little bit.

911
37:19.620 --> 37:20.670
And I think it's necessary

912
37:20.670 --> 37:22.320
because I think that consumers are expecting

913
37:22.320 --> 37:25.110
to have some control over this experience

914
37:25.110 --> 37:27.120
and they don't want it to be the wild west.

915
37:27.120 --> 37:28.080
<v Jennifer>Yeah, fantastic.</v>

916
37:28.080 --> 37:30.200
Arsham, did you wanna add there?

917
37:30.200 --> 37:33.881
<v ->On the privacy side, GDPR is a great example.</v>

918
37:33.881 --> 37:38.100
When we try to go after personalization, for example,

919
37:38.100 --> 37:41.310
we had to really lean on the edge

920
37:41.310 --> 37:44.880
to deliver majority of the personalization experiences

921
37:44.880 --> 37:49.440
with minimal dependency on the backend services,

922
37:49.440 --> 37:51.060
which are only temporal

923
37:51.060 --> 37:54.030
and they just disappear as soon as you use the service,

924
37:54.030 --> 37:56.580
this is how we can ship everywhere.

925
37:56.580 --> 37:59.040
But when I look at AI specifically,

926
37:59.040 --> 38:02.520
a lot of the talk around regulation

927
38:02.520 --> 38:05.010
is targeting last year's problem,

928
38:05.010 --> 38:07.830
not really what we're designing today.

929
38:07.830 --> 38:10.170
They are talking about some of the applications.

930
38:10.170 --> 38:13.710
The most interesting that we would like to see is

931
38:13.710 --> 38:16.380
when you think about an AI-enabled product

932
38:16.380 --> 38:17.910
that goes out of service

933
38:17.910 --> 38:20.130
and you don't update and maintain anymore,

934
38:20.130 --> 38:22.563
it's not similar to a utility,

935
38:23.935 --> 38:26.250
a product that had a fixed function,

936
38:26.250 --> 38:28.500
it will continue doing what it used to.

937
38:28.500 --> 38:33.180
An AI product that goes without service can be dangerous.

938
38:33.180 --> 38:34.830
So that is one of the biggest issues

939
38:34.830 --> 38:37.500
that are looking forward to seeing an outcome

940
38:37.500 --> 38:39.720
which will actually materially change

941
38:39.720 --> 38:43.271
how we serve our connected products in the long run.

942
38:43.271 --> 38:44.104
<v ->Okay.</v>

943
38:44.104 --> 38:45.900
All right, we have just a few minutes left,

944
38:45.900 --> 38:49.170
so I'd love to ask Amalia, Casey and Paulus,

945
38:49.170 --> 38:52.560
if you guys had advice for those in the crowd

946
38:52.560 --> 38:54.810
that are working on their own solutions,

947
38:54.810 --> 38:57.480
trying to keep up with the pace of innovation,

948
38:57.480 --> 38:58.830
which doesn't ever slow down,

949
38:58.830 --> 39:01.713
but somehow seems even more accelerated than normal,

950
39:02.850 --> 39:04.320
you know, what advice do you have

951
39:04.320 --> 39:08.190
as they consider how AI can maybe transform

952
39:08.190 --> 39:09.810
their products, their businesses,

953
39:09.810 --> 39:12.513
and they think about, you know, what's next for them?

954
39:13.560 --> 39:16.740
<v ->So what we always say is that</v>

955
39:16.740 --> 39:20.340
in order to really create an impact in a person's lives

956
39:20.340 --> 39:23.160
and really create a long-lasting relationship,

957
39:23.160 --> 39:26.070
and obviously retention based on that as well,

958
39:26.070 --> 39:29.160
it's important for the AI to be proactive.

959
39:29.160 --> 39:32.460
If you think about the relationships in our lives,

960
39:32.460 --> 39:34.830
they're not one way, they're not prompt-based.

961
39:34.830 --> 39:37.530
We don't just wait for a friend to call us

962
39:37.530 --> 39:41.430
and ask how we are, do we wanna meet,

963
39:41.430 --> 39:43.500
we wouldn't be very good friends doing that.

964
39:43.500 --> 39:45.660
So if we wanna create AIs

965
39:45.660 --> 39:47.580
that don't replace human relationships,

966
39:47.580 --> 39:50.610
but create sort of a new category of relationships,

967
39:50.610 --> 39:52.500
maybe sort of like a pet,

968
39:52.500 --> 39:56.310
we need to have an AI that's able to interact

969
39:56.310 --> 39:59.610
and initiate interactions and be proactive about it

970
39:59.610 --> 40:02.370
and really anticipate what the user needs.

971
40:02.370 --> 40:03.203
<v Jennifer>Okay, great.</v>

972
40:03.203 --> 40:04.560
Casey?

973
40:04.560 --> 40:06.588
<v ->Just to add on top of that,</v>

974
40:06.588 --> 40:08.010
or maybe put a different way,

975
40:08.010 --> 40:10.897
is what problem is this AI solving in a unique or,

976
40:10.897 --> 40:12.450
you know, special way?

977
40:12.450 --> 40:15.300
Because at Josh, our founders,

978
40:15.300 --> 40:18.330
the vision was there's not an AI,

979
40:18.330 --> 40:20.490
and this is before any other voice assistant

980
40:20.490 --> 40:21.323
was out as well,

981
40:21.323 --> 40:23.790
but our founding mission was,

982
40:23.790 --> 40:25.620
there's no smart home assistant

983
40:25.620 --> 40:27.720
with the contextual awareness, the natural language,

984
40:27.720 --> 40:30.210
the conversational understanding of

985
40:30.210 --> 40:33.330
what does it's too dark in here mean or I'm cold,

986
40:33.330 --> 40:35.760
and being able to adjust your lights, your thermostat.

987
40:35.760 --> 40:38.550
And since then we've built a lot more on top of that

988
40:38.550 --> 40:41.550
in terms of the device functionality integrations,

989
40:41.550 --> 40:43.530
the intelligence assistance as well.

990
40:43.530 --> 40:47.610
But from a competition standpoint,

991
40:47.610 --> 40:50.407
AI is here, it's definitely blown up and now it's,

992
40:50.407 --> 40:52.110
you know, the hot buzzword,

993
40:52.110 --> 40:53.850
and everybody's trying to figure out how to use it.

994
40:53.850 --> 40:56.730
But how do you use it in a impactful way

995
40:56.730 --> 40:59.460
that creates value for your business where,

996
40:59.460 --> 41:01.530
you know, I think we also just in talking about,

997
41:01.530 --> 41:05.190
you know, AI being a loss leader for some larger companies.

998
41:05.190 --> 41:06.023
If you're a smaller company,

999
41:06.023 --> 41:07.710
you can't really afford for it to be a loss leader

1000
41:07.710 --> 41:09.120
or else you're not gonna be around too long.

1001
41:09.120 --> 41:10.740
So how are you creating this experience

1002
41:10.740 --> 41:12.900
that is creating retention,

1003
41:12.900 --> 41:15.990
creating, you know, memorable experiences

1004
41:15.990 --> 41:18.510
or you know, utility,

1005
41:18.510 --> 41:20.583
that people want to continue to pay for.

1006
41:21.750 --> 41:23.490
<v Jennifer>Okay, great, and Paulus last word?</v>

1007
41:23.490 --> 41:26.190
<v ->Yeah, I think that if you're building AI</v>

1008
41:26.190 --> 41:29.190
then make sure that LLMs are not the only AI.

1009
41:29.190 --> 41:30.360
I mean you're talking about cost

1010
41:30.360 --> 41:33.900
and actually LLMs are the most expensive AI you can use.

1011
41:33.900 --> 41:35.370
You can already achieve so much

1012
41:35.370 --> 41:38.220
just by doing old school machine learning,

1013
41:38.220 --> 41:40.440
statistical analysis, looking at the data,

1014
41:40.440 --> 41:42.570
and there's so much stuff

1015
41:42.570 --> 41:44.340
you can actually run locally as well,

1016
41:44.340 --> 41:47.457
that you don't need a big GPU for it to run models.

1017
41:47.457 --> 41:49.470
And so don't think that

1018
41:49.470 --> 41:53.340
generative AI is the only AI tool in your toolbox.

1019
41:53.340 --> 41:56.010
There is many, many tools.

1020
41:56.010 --> 41:56.970
<v ->Okay, fantastic.</v>

1021
41:56.970 --> 42:00.982
Well please join me in thanking our kickoff panel today,

1022
42:00.982 --> 42:01.815
(audience applauding)

1023
42:01.815 --> 42:02.830
sharing their insights.

1024
42:03.719 --> 42:06.302
(upbeat music)
