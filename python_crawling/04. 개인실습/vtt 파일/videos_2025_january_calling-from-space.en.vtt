00:00.000 --> 00:02.583
(upbeat music)

00:10.950 --> 00:12.540
<v ->Good afternoon and welcome</v>

00:12.540 --> 00:14.490
to the "Calling from Space Session,"

00:14.490 --> 00:18.360
the last session as part of the space track at CES.

00:18.360 --> 00:21.360
My name is Sumaiya Najarali and I will be your moderator

00:21.360 --> 00:22.980
for today's session.

00:22.980 --> 00:25.440
So before we get started on this conversation,

00:25.440 --> 00:27.540
on direct-to-device connectivity,

00:27.540 --> 00:29.993
I'd like to give our panelists the opportunity

00:29.993 --> 00:34.021
to introduce themselves, a bit about their company's role

00:34.021 --> 00:36.480
in the direct-to-device market,

00:36.480 --> 00:38.880
as well as share some major events,

00:38.880 --> 00:40.277
milestones over the past year

00:40.277 --> 00:43.530
as we reflect on 2024.

00:43.530 --> 00:45.150
So perhaps, Barbee, we could start with you

00:45.150 --> 00:47.370
and then make our way down the line.

00:47.370 --> 00:49.020
<v ->Sure. So thank you, Sumaiya.</v>

00:49.020 --> 00:50.640
It's good to be with you again

00:50.640 --> 00:54.690
after a wonderful show in Paris back in September,

00:54.690 --> 00:57.063
so glad to continue the conversation.

00:58.080 --> 01:00.870
I'm Barbee Ponder, General Counsel

01:00.870 --> 01:04.320
and Vice President of Regulatory Affairs for Globalstar.

01:04.320 --> 01:07.650
Globalstar is a mobile satellite services company.

01:07.650 --> 01:10.341
We've been providing mobile satellite services now

01:10.341 --> 01:13.080
for over two decades.

01:13.080 --> 01:15.570
We own and operate our own constellation

01:15.570 --> 01:18.720
of low-earth-orbit satellites as well

01:18.720 --> 01:22.320
as a global infrastructure of ground stations

01:22.320 --> 01:25.623
around the world that support that constellation.

01:27.540 --> 01:30.720
Importantly, about two years ago

01:30.720 --> 01:33.951
we started providing D2D connectivity

01:33.951 --> 01:38.763
and we've been doing it now successfully in 17 countries.

01:39.690 --> 01:44.640
I'm proud to say that now there are tens of millions

01:44.640 --> 01:49.640
and I'm sure very soon a hundred million people

01:49.680 --> 01:51.990
with Globalstar at their fingertips

01:51.990 --> 01:54.210
for critical communications, you know,

01:54.210 --> 01:58.300
when they are in a rather desperate situation

01:59.250 --> 02:04.053
as quite frankly, we saw recently with our latest,

02:05.303 --> 02:07.800
the past hurricane season.

02:07.800 --> 02:12.723
So, you know, we have used the same spectrum.

02:13.710 --> 02:15.690
Well, I'm sure we'll get into that a little bit,

02:15.690 --> 02:20.343
but 2024 was a very busy year for us.

02:21.270 --> 02:23.320
We're just getting started quite frankly.

02:25.410 --> 02:28.110
We were successful in having the FCC

02:28.110 --> 02:32.100
reauthorize our HIBLEO-4 Constellation

02:32.100 --> 02:34.440
for another 15-year license term

02:34.440 --> 02:38.880
and we'll be launching eight new satellites

02:38.880 --> 02:43.470
later this year to help replenish that constellation.

02:43.470 --> 02:45.123
And finally,

02:46.650 --> 02:49.320
at the end of last year we announced

02:49.320 --> 02:52.260
an additional $1.7 billion investment

02:52.260 --> 02:55.110
that we'll be making in more satellites

02:55.110 --> 02:57.420
and more ground infrastructure

02:57.420 --> 02:59.190
over the next couple of years.

02:59.190 --> 03:01.530
So 2024 was busy.

03:01.530 --> 03:04.353
2025 will be just as busy. Thank you.

03:07.320 --> 03:08.550
<v ->Thanks Sumaiya.</v>

03:08.550 --> 03:11.100
Hi, everybody. I'm Tim Last.

03:11.100 --> 03:13.200
I'm the Executive Vice President of Sales

03:13.200 --> 03:14.450
and Marketing at Iridium.

03:16.260 --> 03:18.600
I think about 70% of Barbee's introduction

03:18.600 --> 03:20.790
probably applies to Iridium as well.

03:20.790 --> 03:22.740
If you don't know us,

03:22.740 --> 03:25.817
we are a global mobile satellite services company.

03:25.817 --> 03:27.810
We have a fleet

03:27.810 --> 03:30.180
of about 80 satellites in orbit

03:30.180 --> 03:31.650
in low earth orbit around the world.

03:31.650 --> 03:34.260
We've been in the satellite business for getting on

03:34.260 --> 03:36.390
for 30 years with the current constellation

03:36.390 --> 03:38.673
only being about four or five years old.

03:40.050 --> 03:41.850
And like Barbee's company,

03:41.850 --> 03:45.240
we provide direct-to-device connectivity today,

03:45.240 --> 03:48.750
one of the major changes for Iridium is that we're midway

03:48.750 --> 03:50.370
through the development and launch

03:50.370 --> 03:53.310
of a standard space direct-to-device connectivity.

03:53.310 --> 03:55.200
I think that's what most people are here

03:55.200 --> 03:57.090
to hear about and understand.

03:57.090 --> 04:01.140
We've been a leader in sort of proprietary connectivity

04:01.140 --> 04:02.250
for satellite networks

04:02.250 --> 04:06.690
and we've done that successfully across many major markets,

04:06.690 --> 04:09.753
verticals, geographies, both commercial and government.

04:10.830 --> 04:12.198
And we're excited about the opportunity

04:12.198 --> 04:17.198
to deliver that using more standards-based technology.

04:17.280 --> 04:20.190
For us, it's one of the probably two

04:20.190 --> 04:22.170
or three major capital programs underway

04:22.170 --> 04:23.220
in the company at the moment,

04:23.220 --> 04:26.280
so we're putting our money where our mouth is.

04:26.280 --> 04:27.360
Over the last year,

04:27.360 --> 04:30.660
we've successfully got Iridium's technology embedded

04:30.660 --> 04:33.193
into the next release of 3GPP.

04:33.193 --> 04:36.340
So we will be part of the standards-based

04:37.500 --> 04:40.245
sort of kit of options

04:40.245 --> 04:42.900
that consumer electronics,

04:42.900 --> 04:44.900
chip set companies and the like can use.

04:46.590 --> 04:48.900
Looking forward to 25, we'll be over the air

04:48.900 --> 04:52.350
middle of this year testing

04:52.350 --> 04:54.360
and prototyping and what have you

04:54.360 --> 04:57.090
and we're looking at market launch for our service

04:57.090 --> 05:00.150
by about the first month or two of 2026.

05:00.150 --> 05:01.890
So good to be here.

05:01.890 --> 05:05.013
Good to meet everybody and thanks for inviting us, Sumaiya.

05:06.990 --> 05:09.450
<v ->Thank you, Sumaiya. My name is Parth Trivedi.</v>

05:09.450 --> 05:12.030
I'm the CEO co-founder of Skylo,

05:12.030 --> 05:15.300
which is a global direct-to-device service operator

05:15.300 --> 05:19.050
that connects cellular devices directly over satellite

05:19.050 --> 05:21.183
so that customers never lose coverage.

05:22.050 --> 05:24.540
Skylo wears two hats.

05:24.540 --> 05:26.910
One, we're a technology developer

05:26.910 --> 05:29.580
that builds the underlying infrastructure

05:29.580 --> 05:32.670
that powers the direct-to-device solution

05:32.670 --> 05:37.050
using the 3GPP standards with our radio access network

05:37.050 --> 05:39.540
and our core now installed

05:39.540 --> 05:42.510
and operationalized within half a dozen

05:42.510 --> 05:45.570
different satellite partners that we work with

05:45.570 --> 05:49.270
across more than 10 Earth stations around the world

05:50.430 --> 05:53.670
and integrated with multiple carriers

05:53.670 --> 05:56.640
just as another roaming partner, if you will.

05:56.640 --> 05:59.460
So we play the role of a technology developer

05:59.460 --> 06:01.650
on the one hand and the other role that we play

06:01.650 --> 06:04.260
is of a service operator.

06:04.260 --> 06:08.370
So we operate our service live over four continents,

06:08.370 --> 06:11.190
more than 35 markets.

06:11.190 --> 06:15.180
2024 has been an incredible year with activating millions

06:15.180 --> 06:17.400
of devices on our network

06:17.400 --> 06:19.140
and scaling what is now

06:19.140 --> 06:22.800
the world's largest standards-based NTN.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.290
And we're really excited about the ecosystem

06:25.290 --> 06:28.170
that we're building, certifying everything

06:28.170 --> 06:30.346
from the chip set and the module

06:30.346 --> 06:33.270
all the way up to the device.

06:33.270 --> 06:36.316
And 2024 we called out certifications

06:36.316 --> 06:39.360
with Qualcomm's Snapdragon chip set.

06:39.360 --> 06:41.550
We announced partnership with Google

06:41.550 --> 06:44.310
across every Pixel smartphone

06:44.310 --> 06:47.160
and announced a partnership as well with Verizon

06:47.160 --> 06:50.070
so that we can bring this incredible capability

06:50.070 --> 06:53.100
to the consumer, to the enterprises

06:53.100 --> 06:55.460
and all types of use cases in between.

06:55.460 --> 06:59.220
And excited to share some of those stories with you today.

06:59.220 --> 07:00.053
<v ->Great, thank you.</v>

07:00.053 --> 07:02.220
And excited to have you all here as well.

07:02.220 --> 07:04.710
So I think busy defined it very well.

07:04.710 --> 07:08.370
Lots of momentum in the D2D space in 2024.

07:08.370 --> 07:10.980
We saw that on the satellite infrastructure side,

07:10.980 --> 07:12.900
so with some of the companies like AST

07:12.900 --> 07:15.990
and Starlink launching in the past year,

07:15.990 --> 07:17.430
also on the hardware side.

07:17.430 --> 07:18.480
So seeing, you know,

07:18.480 --> 07:21.360
more than 20 phone variants carrying both satellite

07:21.360 --> 07:24.810
and terrestrial compatibility globally.

07:24.810 --> 07:28.650
So as we look forward into 2025, we're really trying to see

07:28.650 --> 07:30.600
how we're getting the market developed

07:30.600 --> 07:33.330
and seeing how we can get services to market.

07:33.330 --> 07:35.130
So with satellite operators, you know,

07:35.130 --> 07:36.870
turning these addressable users

07:36.870 --> 07:39.840
of direct-to-device services into subscribers,

07:39.840 --> 07:41.940
what are some of the benefits and shortfalls

07:41.940 --> 07:43.860
of these go-to market strategies

07:43.860 --> 07:45.360
that US satellite operators,

07:45.360 --> 07:48.510
network providers are adopting, whether it be, you know,

07:48.510 --> 07:52.080
taking a hardware approach or partnering with MNOs.

07:52.080 --> 07:55.470
So perhaps, Tim, if you wanna get started there

07:55.470 --> 07:58.800
and discuss maybe a little bit about Iridium's approach.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.420
<v ->Yeah, sure.</v>

08:00.420 --> 08:02.160
I mean, I don't know that I can comment too much

08:02.160 --> 08:04.020
on the shortfalls or pitfalls.

08:04.020 --> 08:07.860
I mean, I think we are in the very early stages

08:07.860 --> 08:11.970
of development of this fairly nascent market opportunity,

08:11.970 --> 08:15.510
both for, you know, those of us in the satellite industry,

08:15.510 --> 08:18.891
but also for terrestrial companies and OEMs

08:18.891 --> 08:22.920
and chip set companies, anybody that sees the opportunity

08:22.920 --> 08:27.363
to develop and use this type of crossover technology.

08:28.650 --> 08:31.140
You know, we have a particular view

08:31.140 --> 08:33.930
of how best we can go to market

08:33.930 --> 08:35.790
by sort of providing

08:35.790 --> 08:38.640
a vertically integrated networking experience.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.370
We will look and feel like a roaming option

08:41.370 --> 08:42.870
for any MNO in the world that wants

08:42.870 --> 08:45.180
to use our capability and service.

08:45.180 --> 08:48.450
That's important because the, you know,

08:48.450 --> 08:50.670
the least amount of friction you can provide

08:50.670 --> 08:52.560
to the MNOs the more chance they are

08:52.560 --> 08:55.170
of adopting your capability.

08:55.170 --> 08:57.960
But it's also true, I think that, you know,

08:57.960 --> 09:01.080
nobody's gonna be kind of taking the whole market here.

09:01.080 --> 09:03.150
This is gonna be a choice of options

09:03.150 --> 09:04.953
for many of the mobile operators.

09:05.790 --> 09:08.340
We also have a pretty clear strategy

09:08.340 --> 09:11.670
that the market opportunity for Iridium is not only

09:11.670 --> 09:14.460
what you might consider direct-to-consumer devices,

09:14.460 --> 09:18.090
so to handsets, but also in IoT.

09:18.090 --> 09:21.210
For us, IoT has been a strong part of our market growth

09:21.210 --> 09:23.520
for the past 15 years or so.

09:23.520 --> 09:27.660
And while I think the, you know,

09:27.660 --> 09:29.610
the business case and the value proposition

09:29.610 --> 09:31.980
for consumers can sometimes be questioned.

09:31.980 --> 09:34.350
Nobody's paying much

09:34.350 --> 09:35.880
for this kind of capability today,

09:35.880 --> 09:38.580
at least not from a consumer perspective.

09:38.580 --> 09:42.210
It is clear that there's a very compelling use case

09:42.210 --> 09:44.486
and business case for many enterprises

09:44.486 --> 09:47.220
who have been crying out for a connectivity

09:47.220 --> 09:48.570
in places that they can't get to,

09:48.570 --> 09:49.770
whether you be automotive

09:49.770 --> 09:52.320
or oil and gas companies or many

09:52.320 --> 09:55.245
of the other industrial IoT markets.

09:55.245 --> 10:00.243
So I think there's money for everybody in that ecosystem.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.180
It gets tougher in the IoT market

10:03.180 --> 10:04.560
'cause there's less money to go around,

10:04.560 --> 10:08.130
but I think the next several years will reveal,

10:08.130 --> 10:09.780
you know, who's got the right

10:09.780 --> 10:11.100
kind of go-to-market approach

10:11.100 --> 10:14.610
and who may struggle because of, you know, what they control

10:14.610 --> 10:16.650
and what they don't control in that value chain.

10:16.650 --> 10:18.183
So thanks.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.300
<v ->Barbee, did you want to jump in there</v>

10:21.300 --> 10:24.510
and maybe just discuss Globalstar's go-to-market approach,

10:24.510 --> 10:25.745
you know, with partnering with Apple,

10:25.745 --> 10:27.320
but then also the path forward

10:27.320 --> 10:30.723
with the extended MSS network coverage?

10:31.560 --> 10:32.393
<v ->Sure.</v>

10:32.393 --> 10:35.550
So, you know, Globalstar not only, you know,

10:35.550 --> 10:38.100
owns and operates its own constellation of satellites,

10:38.100 --> 10:41.790
but we've developed internally quite a few

10:41.790 --> 10:44.670
of the products that operate over that system.

10:44.670 --> 10:47.087
One of those products we introduced in 2007,

10:47.087 --> 10:51.480
it's a consumer line of messaging devices

10:51.480 --> 10:55.950
called SPOT that has been incredibly successful.

10:55.950 --> 11:00.950
And we've always tried to make a device, you know,

11:01.020 --> 11:04.620
smaller, cheaper, incredibly easy to use,

11:04.620 --> 11:06.780
pull it out of your pocket, push a button,

11:06.780 --> 11:09.262
let your family know regardless of where you are

11:09.262 --> 11:10.830
that you're okay,

11:10.830 --> 11:13.233
or if you're in trouble, push the SOS.

11:14.100 --> 11:16.863
And so for us, when we were looking to,

11:17.790 --> 11:21.000
I think sort of, you know, pioneer a path forward

11:21.000 --> 11:25.770
to direct-to-device, it was a natural fit for us

11:25.770 --> 11:29.880
to partner with a smartphone manufacturer

11:29.880 --> 11:33.480
because we all understood the enormous public benefits

11:33.480 --> 11:37.750
that would be available if we could essentially

11:38.760 --> 11:40.090
shoehorn our technology

11:40.090 --> 11:42.060
and connectivity, you know,

11:42.060 --> 11:44.730
into one of their feature products.

11:44.730 --> 11:47.490
And it took a quite a bit of work,

11:47.490 --> 11:48.903
but we were able to do that.

11:49.770 --> 11:52.530
So, you know, that's how we ended up in market

11:52.530 --> 11:55.187
and now we don't have a go-to-market strategy,

11:55.187 --> 11:57.898
we need a stay-in-market strategy and execute that

11:57.898 --> 12:02.193
and we're gonna continue to invest in our network,

12:03.420 --> 12:07.140
innovate and evolve quite frankly

12:07.140 --> 12:10.260
and expand and make sure that we are able

12:10.260 --> 12:13.210
to continue to provide that level of connectivity

12:14.580 --> 12:18.840
that people want when they're off the grid,

12:18.840 --> 12:22.053
either voluntarily or not,

12:23.100 --> 12:25.330
and at a price point

12:26.370 --> 12:28.893
that they feel comfortable paying.

12:32.220 --> 12:36.990
<v ->I always like to start with the consumer experience</v>

12:36.990 --> 12:39.990
and just by a quick show of hands,

12:39.990 --> 12:44.580
how many of you have an iPhone 14 or above

12:44.580 --> 12:46.293
or a Google Pixel 9?

12:48.960 --> 12:49.793
Got it.

12:49.793 --> 12:51.843
So those who of you who have your hand up,

12:52.980 --> 12:55.590
I want to maybe ask you another follow-up question.

12:55.590 --> 12:59.100
How many of you have tried the satellite demo mode

12:59.100 --> 13:00.930
that is inherent in your device?

13:00.930 --> 13:02.070
Awesome.

13:02.070 --> 13:03.610
I'm glad I saw more hands

13:05.190 --> 13:07.020
versus the last time I did this,

13:07.020 --> 13:11.160
but I think that making a consumer aware

13:11.160 --> 13:13.650
of this capability is step one, right?

13:13.650 --> 13:16.129
It's blatantly present within your device,

13:16.129 --> 13:18.120
now how do you get access to it?

13:18.120 --> 13:20.670
What is the 1G of this look like

13:20.670 --> 13:23.910
when you try and access this non-terrestrial network

13:23.910 --> 13:25.020
for the first time

13:25.020 --> 13:28.890
and how can we make it a predictable user experience?

13:28.890 --> 13:30.127
So that was the starting point

13:30.127 --> 13:33.030
and frankly a lot of the focus for last year

13:33.030 --> 13:34.680
and the year before

13:34.680 --> 13:38.220
was establishing a common baseline for consumers

13:38.220 --> 13:40.680
that they could start to take for granted.

13:40.680 --> 13:43.440
I was in Redwood National Park in California

13:43.440 --> 13:46.350
and texting over satellite with my family

13:46.350 --> 13:48.570
and it was an incredible experience.

13:48.570 --> 13:52.770
But then as we think about the services beyond

13:52.770 --> 13:56.040
that baseline, peer-to-peer services, messaging,

13:56.040 --> 13:59.700
access to a constrained IP connection, et cetera,

13:59.700 --> 14:03.180
those start to look an awful lot like the carrier services

14:03.180 --> 14:04.860
that you're receiving today.

14:04.860 --> 14:07.560
So our approach is being

14:07.560 --> 14:11.460
a complimentary support network

14:11.460 --> 14:13.620
with the carrier being complimentary

14:13.620 --> 14:15.630
to the services that they're providing

14:15.630 --> 14:18.360
to consumers from a 5G perspective

14:18.360 --> 14:19.830
and making this appear

14:19.830 --> 14:23.160
to be minimal change in user behavior

14:23.160 --> 14:25.620
in accessing direct-to-device connectivity

14:25.620 --> 14:27.071
is a huge part of our focus.

14:27.071 --> 14:29.342
Whether that's the work that we do behind the scenes

14:29.342 --> 14:32.250
with Android on the user experience

14:32.250 --> 14:35.190
or whether that's the work that we do with the carriers

14:35.190 --> 14:38.703
around how they present this to the end users.

14:39.630 --> 14:42.300
<v ->And I think that's a good segue into user experience</v>

14:42.300 --> 14:45.540
and a lot of the conversation on what can users expect

14:45.540 --> 14:48.930
to see with satellite direct-to-device connectivity, right?

14:48.930 --> 14:50.040
Are we gonna be able to see

14:50.040 --> 14:52.290
the same broadband-type capabilities?

14:52.290 --> 14:53.450
And that's a lot of the conversation

14:53.450 --> 14:56.310
as that kind of fuels into who's paying for the service.

14:56.310 --> 14:59.670
So how do you as operators, network providers,

14:59.670 --> 15:02.550
intend on managing user expectations

15:02.550 --> 15:04.533
around D2D services?

15:07.140 --> 15:09.240
<v ->I can kick things off maybe.</v>

15:09.240 --> 15:11.070
So, you know, the first thing

15:11.070 --> 15:13.530
is understanding the market really well,

15:13.530 --> 15:14.919
understanding the user really well.

15:14.919 --> 15:18.770
And I wanted to share with you the results

15:18.770 --> 15:21.720
of a survey that we ran

15:21.720 --> 15:25.443
across a thousand Americans over the course of December.

15:27.150 --> 15:28.650
And we asked them

15:28.650 --> 15:30.960
some of the most common questions

15:30.960 --> 15:33.520
about the connectivity challenges that they face

15:34.860 --> 15:37.560
and the insights were quite fascinating.

15:37.560 --> 15:40.080
So two thirds of respondents

15:40.080 --> 15:42.510
of Americans across the country, by the way,

15:42.510 --> 15:45.630
not in any specific location,

15:45.630 --> 15:49.510
two thirds of Americans face connectivity issues

15:51.000 --> 15:53.460
and 20% actually face connectivity issues

15:53.460 --> 15:55.770
on almost a daily basis.

15:55.770 --> 15:57.300
I think the thing that struck me the most

15:57.300 --> 16:02.300
is that a majority of folks faced connectivity issues

16:02.539 --> 16:04.530
in their own neighborhood

16:04.530 --> 16:06.540
or on their commute to work

16:06.540 --> 16:08.430
or to see their friends and family.

16:08.430 --> 16:11.643
So it was a much higher percentage than I thought of.

16:12.494 --> 16:16.980
And the issue is quite real in terms of the pain point

16:16.980 --> 16:19.980
that the frustration that Americans experience

16:19.980 --> 16:23.550
when they don't have reception and connectivity available.

16:23.550 --> 16:26.340
So it's becoming more and more real

16:26.340 --> 16:29.520
around how this gets presented and monetized.

16:29.520 --> 16:31.770
But then you also think about the use cases

16:31.770 --> 16:33.570
to your question of is it, you know,

16:33.570 --> 16:37.020
what are the types of services that consumers care about?

16:37.020 --> 16:40.470
The other question we asked was around exactly that,

16:40.470 --> 16:43.560
what are the use cases that you intend to leverage?

16:43.560 --> 16:47.820
50% of respondents said that their biggest use case

16:47.820 --> 16:49.860
for non-terrestrial networks

16:49.860 --> 16:52.443
on their device was emergency contact.

16:53.640 --> 16:56.400
20% of users after that

16:56.400 --> 16:58.800
said that their biggest use case was navigation,

16:59.970 --> 17:01.143
followed by texting.

17:02.040 --> 17:04.470
And interestingly, social media

17:04.470 --> 17:06.450
and other internet use cases

17:06.450 --> 17:09.753
was less than 5% of respondents.

17:11.370 --> 17:13.350
And the other thing I'll maybe just conclude with

17:13.350 --> 17:17.940
is we are seeing a massive shift

17:17.940 --> 17:21.540
in how content on the internet is consumed.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.400
So where previously you would have gone

17:23.400 --> 17:26.310
and browsed multiple websites to gain an answer

17:26.310 --> 17:29.670
to your question, you now have ChatGPT,

17:29.670 --> 17:32.820
you have Perplexity, you are able to turn

17:32.820 --> 17:36.870
a previously pretty heavy data-intensive experience

17:36.870 --> 17:40.320
into frankly a text-based narrow-band experience

17:40.320 --> 17:41.370
that matters.

17:41.370 --> 17:43.380
That's a very important change

17:43.380 --> 17:45.600
that has happened over the past two years.

17:45.600 --> 17:49.020
And because we're building greenfield networks

17:49.020 --> 17:52.080
that haven't been designed or been built before,

17:52.080 --> 17:55.023
we're able to optimize for these use cases.

17:55.937 --> 17:57.180
What will the next set

17:57.180 --> 17:58.350
of not just peer-to-peer

17:58.350 --> 18:01.470
but also peer-to-AI interactions look like?

18:01.470 --> 18:04.320
So that's what we spend a lot of time also thinking about

18:05.640 --> 18:06.473
<v ->Certainly.</v>

18:06.473 --> 18:08.730
And any other thoughts on managing user expectations

18:08.730 --> 18:12.720
as we discussed different D2D capabilities?

18:12.720 --> 18:14.160
<v ->I think my first comment would be</v>

18:14.160 --> 18:15.750
keep their expectations low

18:15.750 --> 18:18.300
because that's probably where things will start.

18:18.300 --> 18:22.650
I mean, as Parth indicates, initial use cases

18:22.650 --> 18:26.200
and the consumer's pain points

18:27.480 --> 18:30.240
generally speaking are around basic connectivity

18:30.240 --> 18:33.963
and often text-based or very modest data needs.

18:35.040 --> 18:36.600
You know, we've known this from being

18:36.600 --> 18:39.870
in the satellite industry for 25 years

18:39.870 --> 18:44.400
to know how end users can find value

18:44.400 --> 18:47.580
without having endless bandwidth and capability.

18:47.580 --> 18:49.380
That doesn't mean it shouldn't be an aspiration

18:49.380 --> 18:51.180
or a target to aim for,

18:51.180 --> 18:54.130
but it's very different connecting to a satellite

18:54.990 --> 18:56.944
either 35,000 miles away

18:56.944 --> 18:59.940
or traveling at 18,000 miles an hour compared

18:59.940 --> 19:01.920
to connecting to a cell tower

19:01.920 --> 19:03.570
that's two miles down the street.

19:04.800 --> 19:06.450
But there are use cases

19:06.450 --> 19:08.637
which people will definitely pay for,

19:08.637 --> 19:12.210
find value in, even in those modest areas.

19:12.210 --> 19:14.914
You know, the example of texting, the example of, you know,

19:14.914 --> 19:19.020
basic tracking capability, find your friends capability,

19:19.020 --> 19:21.780
these are all things that people will find useful,

19:21.780 --> 19:24.630
particularly in those areas where they have dead spots.

19:24.630 --> 19:27.663
But I think from a quality and customer experience,

19:29.160 --> 19:31.410
you know, it will be different.

19:31.410 --> 19:33.810
You know, we strive, just like Parth does,

19:33.810 --> 19:36.210
to ensure that the customer experience

19:36.210 --> 19:39.240
is as close as possible to what they may have

19:39.240 --> 19:41.190
in their terrestrial use case.

19:41.190 --> 19:43.090
But we also know that sometimes

19:44.220 --> 19:45.780
it's challenging to make that happen

19:45.780 --> 19:47.310
when you're dealing with very different assets

19:47.310 --> 19:49.160
and infrastructure behind the scenes.

19:50.940 --> 19:54.360
<v ->You know, I think we're, at least I'd like to think</v>

19:54.360 --> 19:56.438
that we're changing the public's perception

19:56.438 --> 19:59.883
and their expectations on what it means to be connected.

20:01.410 --> 20:03.954
I think that that the public is going to expect

20:03.954 --> 20:06.840
that when they, you know, pull out their smartphone,

20:06.840 --> 20:10.830
it's going to work regardless of where they are,

20:10.830 --> 20:14.253
regardless of their situation or their predicament.

20:15.450 --> 20:17.430
And regardless of whether there is

20:17.430 --> 20:20.760
or was a terrestrial mobile network that was there

20:20.760 --> 20:22.503
that was to support them.

20:23.550 --> 20:27.573
So I think that, you know, that's where we're heading,

20:28.740 --> 20:32.280
a basic level of connectivity, you know,

20:32.280 --> 20:35.613
at a price point that that is affordable.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.707
And from there, you know, we move forward

20:39.707 --> 20:42.753
with further work, further innovation and service.

20:43.680 --> 20:46.353
But I saw a report this morning,

20:48.000 --> 20:52.320
I think it's the first public report

20:52.320 --> 20:56.460
of a rescue via satellite in Japan.

20:56.460 --> 20:59.550
Japan was the 17th country added

20:59.550 --> 21:03.000
to the emergency SOS via satellite family of countries

21:03.000 --> 21:04.470
where it's now available.

21:04.470 --> 21:07.110
And I think the first report was this morning

21:07.110 --> 21:09.390
and I think, you know, it's just, you know,

21:09.390 --> 21:12.840
people don't expect to be in a situation

21:12.840 --> 21:15.190
where they're gonna need satellite connectivity

21:17.010 --> 21:19.980
but they want it there when it's an emergency.

21:19.980 --> 21:21.600
So...

21:21.600 --> 21:22.433
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

21:22.433 --> 21:24.360
And I think as satellite connectivity, you know,

21:24.360 --> 21:27.030
becomes more integrated with terrestrial networks,

21:27.030 --> 21:30.060
we're looking at revenue-generating opportunities here.

21:30.060 --> 21:31.860
So what are some of the key

21:31.860 --> 21:34.890
revenue-generating opportunities you're focusing on

21:34.890 --> 21:37.124
and how are you going to monetize that?

21:37.124 --> 21:40.650
So really trying to see is justifying the business case here

21:40.650 --> 21:43.380
and curious also to know from an MNO perspective,

21:43.380 --> 21:45.900
so how they can be added to this plan

21:45.900 --> 21:49.200
of also expanding the services and then profiting from that.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.690
So you know, so far we're looking more at the freemium model

21:51.690 --> 21:53.130
or it's embedded in your phone.

21:53.130 --> 21:57.333
How is the path going forward with monetizing D2D services?

22:00.210 --> 22:02.040
<v ->Maybe I'll try to answer this one.</v>

22:02.040 --> 22:05.013
I think many and varied is the straight answer.

22:06.210 --> 22:07.980
We're building a capability

22:07.980 --> 22:11.220
just like our current network service today,

22:11.220 --> 22:14.360
which will serve a really wide variety

22:14.360 --> 22:18.630
of different use cases, vertical markets, customer types.

22:18.630 --> 22:20.550
The consumers, one of them clearly,

22:20.550 --> 22:22.440
and there'll be a certain expectation there

22:22.440 --> 22:25.020
and it's likely for most people

22:25.020 --> 22:28.740
that that experience will be managed through their carrier,

22:28.740 --> 22:31.440
their MNO, their cellular provider.

22:31.440 --> 22:34.636
So you'll be bundled in as part of that package

22:34.636 --> 22:37.260
or part of that monthly fee.

22:37.260 --> 22:39.570
Maybe it'll be a, you know,

22:39.570 --> 22:41.880
a small premium to have that capability.

22:41.880 --> 22:45.390
Maybe you get it because you buy the premium device,

22:45.390 --> 22:47.640
maybe the company a bit like the Apple example,

22:47.640 --> 22:50.340
they provide it free of charge for some period of time.

22:50.340 --> 22:52.170
Somebody somewhere will have to pay

22:52.170 --> 22:54.420
in order to monetize what the investment

22:54.420 --> 22:57.690
that companies like ours are making in that,

22:57.690 --> 22:59.640
you know, behind the scenes capability.

23:00.570 --> 23:03.690
Once you get into the IoT market, it varies hugely

23:03.690 --> 23:07.830
'cause there's so many different use cases and capability

23:07.830 --> 23:11.280
and business models that are being supported, you know.

23:11.280 --> 23:12.660
Certainly there's an awful lot

23:12.660 --> 23:14.730
of very low cost industrial IoT

23:14.730 --> 23:17.160
and if you're not within, you know,

23:17.160 --> 23:21.060
pennies of that expectation, even on cellular,

23:21.060 --> 23:22.980
the satellite industry won't be an option

23:22.980 --> 23:24.930
for many of these use cases.

23:24.930 --> 23:27.900
It doesn't matter that you are filling in the dead spots,

23:27.900 --> 23:29.790
if you can't get within spitting distance

23:29.790 --> 23:31.830
of their cost expectation,

23:31.830 --> 23:33.420
you're still not gonna make the market.

23:33.420 --> 23:37.258
There's other examples where there is an appetite

23:37.258 --> 23:41.460
to pay more for connectivity, whether it be backup

23:41.460 --> 23:44.490
or, you know, for dead zones

23:44.490 --> 23:46.740
and those will be the ones that, you know,

23:46.740 --> 23:49.770
companies like ours will all be trying to mine first.

23:49.770 --> 23:51.270
Where can we find the companies

23:51.270 --> 23:53.070
that are prepared to pay for that capability?

23:53.070 --> 23:56.460
We already do it today with our proprietary network.

23:56.460 --> 23:58.350
The market just gets a lot bigger

23:58.350 --> 24:01.197
once you're dealing with standards-based technology

24:01.197 --> 24:03.870
and it becomes much easier for those companies

24:03.870 --> 24:06.210
to simply add you into the mix.

24:06.210 --> 24:07.043
So...

24:08.640 --> 24:11.490
<v ->Yeah, I would say that our approach</v>

24:11.490 --> 24:15.540
is where wholesale B2B service operator,

24:15.540 --> 24:18.930
so we don't go to the end user directly,

24:18.930 --> 24:22.470
but we have a nuanced go-to-market approach as it relates

24:22.470 --> 24:24.600
to consumer as one vertical,

24:24.600 --> 24:26.790
as automotive, as another vertical,

24:26.790 --> 24:29.490
and IoT or enterprise as a third vertical.

24:29.490 --> 24:33.600
And each of these has its own nuances as it relates

24:33.600 --> 24:38.010
to the type of ecosystem that you have to activate

24:38.010 --> 24:42.210
in order to successfully bring a user online

24:42.210 --> 24:46.110
that looks very different across these three segments.

24:46.110 --> 24:48.600
So as an example, in the IoT segment,

24:48.600 --> 24:52.080
we have to work with a lot of module makers

24:52.080 --> 24:54.360
and, you know, folks who are building these end devices,

24:54.360 --> 24:56.520
get them certified on Skylo's network.

24:56.520 --> 25:00.280
We run the industry's only certification program for NTN

25:01.140 --> 25:02.640
using the 3GPP standards.

25:02.640 --> 25:06.300
So that's a large part of the supporting work that we do

25:06.300 --> 25:10.680
before carriers and MVNOs are able to realize the benefit

25:10.680 --> 25:14.340
of dual-mode connectivity on these IoT devices.

25:14.340 --> 25:16.740
Then you have to also educate them on, hey,

25:16.740 --> 25:20.310
here's the developer experience that you want,

25:20.310 --> 25:22.050
here's what you can expect.

25:22.050 --> 25:24.930
To Tim's point on setting expectations,

25:24.930 --> 25:28.800
you want developers to be able to access this new mode

25:28.800 --> 25:30.840
of connectivity much in the same way

25:30.840 --> 25:32.700
that they accessed cellular.

25:32.700 --> 25:34.590
What can they take for granted?

25:34.590 --> 25:36.450
What are the new things that they have to learn

25:36.450 --> 25:40.290
or set expectations around for their users?

25:40.290 --> 25:42.960
So that's the IoT market for the automotive market.

25:42.960 --> 25:45.810
As you can imagine, we work with chip set companies

25:45.810 --> 25:47.520
but also TCU vendors,

25:47.520 --> 25:50.400
folks who make the Sharkfin antenna in your car

25:50.400 --> 25:52.560
all the way up to the carrier.

25:52.560 --> 25:55.710
And again, there's different types of services

25:55.710 --> 25:58.950
that these three markets are interested in

25:58.950 --> 26:00.420
relative to each other.

26:00.420 --> 26:03.480
And consumer market I think gets a lot of oxygen

26:03.480 --> 26:05.529
because of the fact that it's so near

26:05.529 --> 26:09.360
and dear to the device that's already in your pocket.

26:09.360 --> 26:12.270
But for that market, it's again, entirely carrier-led

26:12.270 --> 26:16.350
with supporting OEMs setting the baseline for connectivity

26:16.350 --> 26:17.673
that you can access.

26:20.010 --> 26:20.843
<v ->Certainly.</v>

26:20.843 --> 26:23.370
So we talk a lot about upside potential strategies

26:23.370 --> 26:26.760
with go-to-market, spectrum, momentum in the industry,

26:26.760 --> 26:30.090
monetization now, kinda looking at challenges in the market.

26:30.090 --> 26:31.890
So what are some of the biggest issues

26:31.890 --> 26:34.290
that you think will break or make the market

26:34.290 --> 26:38.430
and result in the success of D2D as everyone sees it?

26:38.430 --> 26:39.720
Barbee, you wanna kickstart us off

26:39.720 --> 26:41.793
with some of the challenges that you see?

26:42.660 --> 26:44.553
<v ->I guess, you know,</v>

26:46.269 --> 26:51.120
Globalstar and Iridium are pioneers in MSS,

26:51.120 --> 26:53.130
we've been doing this a while

26:53.130 --> 26:56.587
and I think one for us, one of the challenges is,

26:56.587 --> 26:59.793
you know, where are we not, right?

27:01.020 --> 27:03.930
We have mobile satellites,

27:03.930 --> 27:06.600
MSS spectrum, mobile satellite services spectrum

27:06.600 --> 27:11.010
is ITU-allocated, globally harmonized.

27:11.010 --> 27:14.100
And so we were able

27:14.100 --> 27:18.823
to serve very large regions of the Earth quickly

27:18.823 --> 27:20.553
with our capabilities.

27:21.746 --> 27:23.790
I think for us, you know,

27:23.790 --> 27:28.790
one of the challenges is to continuously open up new markets

27:29.296 --> 27:32.290
and new regions to our services

27:33.358 --> 27:37.770
that historically have have not been perhaps as welcome.

27:37.770 --> 27:40.380
And so that for us will be, I think,

27:40.380 --> 27:45.380
a major focus over, you know, the next couple of years

27:45.390 --> 27:48.480
as we move forward with, you know,

27:48.480 --> 27:52.770
our D2D connectivity and an enormous amount of,

27:52.770 --> 27:53.910
you know, public benefit

27:53.910 --> 27:57.513
that comes with that to open,

27:58.470 --> 28:00.640
quite frankly, countries that that

28:06.516 --> 28:10.080
we have not been able to serve so far.

28:10.080 --> 28:12.693
<v ->I think Barbee touched on regulatory,</v>

28:13.530 --> 28:15.030
I'll perhaps build on that

28:15.030 --> 28:18.480
and say that it takes a village to go to market.

28:18.480 --> 28:20.970
In telecom, it really takes a huge amount

28:20.970 --> 28:23.068
of work to build an ecosystem

28:23.068 --> 28:25.680
that results in a predictable,

28:25.680 --> 28:28.263
reliable experience for the end user.

28:29.100 --> 28:30.300
And doing that is challenging.

28:30.300 --> 28:33.720
You know, you're getting multiple different behemoths

28:33.720 --> 28:36.570
in line to activate a solution

28:36.570 --> 28:39.033
with a particular standard is not easy.

28:40.320 --> 28:44.580
And the second thing I'll say is that usage

28:44.580 --> 28:48.370
is very closely tied to user experience.

28:48.370 --> 28:51.870
So as an example, how can we make access

28:51.870 --> 28:53.896
to even a basic service like messaging

28:53.896 --> 28:56.820
as frictionless as possible?

28:56.820 --> 28:59.760
How can we end up, in fact, it's part of our roadmap,

28:59.760 --> 29:01.590
how can we end up in a future scenario

29:01.590 --> 29:04.740
where the phone rings while it's in your pocket

29:04.740 --> 29:08.610
as you're in your car driving at highway speeds?

29:08.610 --> 29:11.580
Enabling that requires a ton of work.

29:11.580 --> 29:14.280
And of course there's technical challenges involved,

29:14.280 --> 29:15.720
but I feel,

29:15.720 --> 29:18.960
and given my experience in this so far,

29:18.960 --> 29:20.580
working with the ecosystem

29:20.580 --> 29:23.081
and bringing a predictable user experience online

29:23.081 --> 29:26.223
that you can take for granted is super difficult.

29:28.050 --> 29:29.950
<v ->Tim, any anything to add on to that?</v>

29:30.840 --> 29:33.300
<v ->I think one of the challenges we have as an industry</v>

29:33.300 --> 29:36.480
is to not oversell the opportunity.

29:36.480 --> 29:41.480
I mean, you know, we obviously want want to encourage

29:41.610 --> 29:45.480
as many, you know, participants in this ecosystem

29:45.480 --> 29:48.330
that feel they can get value

29:48.330 --> 29:51.810
from having satellite connectivity as part of the solution.

29:51.810 --> 29:54.330
But we shouldn't be overselling that

29:54.330 --> 29:57.090
because the, you know, there are certain capabilities

29:57.090 --> 30:01.088
that are currently out of reach of satellite operators,

30:01.088 --> 30:03.180
the technology that's available today,

30:03.180 --> 30:04.410
That doesn't mean you can't dream

30:04.410 --> 30:06.150
and try and aspire to something,

30:06.150 --> 30:10.170
but I think having some realism about what capabilities

30:10.170 --> 30:12.600
and use cases are available is kind of important

30:12.600 --> 30:16.710
because, you know, we can burn a lot of goodwill

30:16.710 --> 30:20.790
and, you know, a lot of reputation in the market

30:20.790 --> 30:21.720
by promising the earth

30:21.720 --> 30:25.083
and only delivering knee-high level services.

30:27.450 --> 30:30.510
I mean, beyond that, I think spectrum broadly

30:30.510 --> 30:32.340
for the industry, it's the same challenge

30:32.340 --> 30:33.480
in the terrestrial world.

30:33.480 --> 30:36.221
Spectrum will continue to be, I say, a challenge.

30:36.221 --> 30:38.550
It'll be a challenge because A,

30:38.550 --> 30:40.953
there's never enough of it to go round.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.930
B, not every spectrum is equal to each other.

30:45.930 --> 30:49.140
Different capabilities, different services are possible.

30:49.140 --> 30:51.900
And there's also a lot of different competing use cases

30:51.900 --> 30:54.840
for that spectrum, even within the satellite world.

30:54.840 --> 30:57.510
Companies today are trying to find ways

30:57.510 --> 30:58.950
to monetize that spectrum

30:58.950 --> 31:03.480
and what today might be a apparently attractive D2D use case

31:03.480 --> 31:06.270
tomorrow might become very attractive

31:06.270 --> 31:07.339
to monetize in a different way.

31:07.339 --> 31:10.950
So I think, you know, we have to figure out fairly quickly

31:10.950 --> 31:13.320
how to monetize it confidently,

31:13.320 --> 31:15.510
otherwise that spectrum is gonna get repurposed

31:15.510 --> 31:19.290
into other things, other use cases, other industries.

31:19.290 --> 31:20.280
So...

31:20.280 --> 31:21.120
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

31:21.120 --> 31:24.660
And before we carry forward to some of the other topics,

31:24.660 --> 31:26.850
just gonna give the audience an opportunity

31:26.850 --> 31:31.293
to ask any questions that they may have for our panelists.

31:34.620 --> 31:35.550
Yep. In the back.

31:35.550 --> 31:36.600
I could either pass you the mic

31:36.600 --> 31:39.150
or if you can project loud enough then..

31:39.150 --> 31:40.680
<v Attendee>Yeah, I'm wondering, you know,</v>

31:40.680 --> 31:43.164
right now it sounds like, you know,

31:43.164 --> 31:45.892
the focus is providing text

31:45.892 --> 31:47.809
or other low data uses,

31:49.384 --> 31:53.550
but eventually it will seem like consumers will dream

31:53.550 --> 31:57.780
about (indistinct) faster connectivity.

31:57.780 --> 32:01.380
Will the result simply be that the satellites

32:01.380 --> 32:03.210
will need to get bigger and bigger?

32:03.210 --> 32:04.983
Is that sort of an inevitable,

32:07.362 --> 32:09.364
you know, outlook if you're looking

32:09.364 --> 32:12.567
out three, four, or five years?

32:12.567 --> 32:14.520
<v ->I don't know that bigger and bigger</v>

32:14.520 --> 32:15.690
is necessarily the case.

32:15.690 --> 32:17.250
I mean certainly there are some aspects

32:17.250 --> 32:19.260
of satellite technology.

32:19.260 --> 32:23.970
I mean, there are operators today

32:23.970 --> 32:26.049
that have, you know, more legacy technology

32:26.049 --> 32:27.720
that is not as capable.

32:27.720 --> 32:30.690
There are new companies, companies like AST Space

32:30.690 --> 32:33.330
that are promoting very large antenna arrays

32:33.330 --> 32:36.690
that can make up for some of the shortcomings

32:36.690 --> 32:38.490
of trying to connect to cellular devices.

32:38.490 --> 32:41.280
One of the things that, you know, you know,

32:41.280 --> 32:44.820
while this device in your pocket may seem to be amazing

32:44.820 --> 32:46.593
and fantastic and wonderful,

32:47.730 --> 32:49.560
for, you know, engineers,

32:49.560 --> 32:52.350
and probably you guys will agree with this in,

32:52.350 --> 32:53.760
you know, they're really crappy

32:53.760 --> 32:55.890
at connecting to things a long way away.

32:55.890 --> 32:57.270
You know, it's really difficult

32:57.270 --> 33:00.750
to close a reliable high-quality connection

33:00.750 --> 33:03.150
with the quality of antennas and devices

33:03.150 --> 33:04.680
that are installed in some of these things.

33:04.680 --> 33:08.010
What makes it low cost and so competitive

33:08.010 --> 33:10.380
and easy in the terrestrial world

33:10.380 --> 33:12.960
equally makes it a challenging connecting

33:12.960 --> 33:14.760
to assets like satellites.

33:14.760 --> 33:18.360
So I think some of that will be mitigated by different,

33:18.360 --> 33:20.520
newer, bigger satellites maybe

33:20.520 --> 33:23.010
and some of it will be other technologies

33:23.010 --> 33:25.500
that evolve other, technologies within the core network.

33:25.500 --> 33:30.240
I mean, the good news is that most of this transition

33:30.240 --> 33:32.580
or, you know, appetite around

33:32.580 --> 33:35.070
to direct-to-device is persuading much

33:35.070 --> 33:37.860
of the satellite industry to move much

33:37.860 --> 33:39.090
of its core infrastructure

33:39.090 --> 33:41.760
more onto a standard space footing.

33:41.760 --> 33:43.223
If you go back 20 or 30 years,

33:43.223 --> 33:45.330
all of the satellite companies in the world,

33:45.330 --> 33:48.240
pretty much most of them had a load

33:48.240 --> 33:50.850
of proprietary technology all the way through their network,

33:50.850 --> 33:53.430
all the way from the core right to the edge,

33:53.430 --> 33:54.780
and that's no longer the case,

33:54.780 --> 33:56.070
including companies like Iridium.

33:56.070 --> 34:00.453
So I think that can only bring benefits of integration.

34:01.410 --> 34:03.510
Whether it really closes the gap

34:03.510 --> 34:04.770
to that consumer experience,

34:04.770 --> 34:07.520
I think it's gonna take a little while to work through.

34:11.640 --> 34:14.043
<v ->Any other questions from the audience?</v>

34:15.095 --> 34:16.517
Yep, we have one in the back.

34:16.517 --> 34:19.609
(attendee speaking faintly)

34:19.609 --> 34:23.448
<v Attendee>800 megahertz, and this is really realistic</v>

34:23.448 --> 34:27.254
to think of 5G as, especially, like, C band, you know,

34:27.254 --> 34:32.254
you push a 4.3 kilohertz circuit (speaking faintly)

34:33.165 --> 34:34.723
I mean, I can't make that circuit work.

34:34.723 --> 34:37.140
I don't know if you guys can.

34:37.990 --> 34:41.231
<v ->Happy to trade notes on that offline, sir.</v>

34:41.231 --> 34:43.950
<v Attendee>I'm just gonna say, I'm the same way-</v>

34:43.950 --> 34:46.280
<v ->We operate with a fade margin of seven</v>

34:46.280 --> 34:48.690
or 10 DB depending on the device,

34:48.690 --> 34:51.600
so it's not a flaky connection, you know?

34:51.600 --> 34:53.760
When you use it outdoors,

34:53.760 --> 34:56.220
you obviously don't try this when you're deep

34:56.220 --> 34:57.990
inside your garage underground.

34:57.990 --> 34:59.040
But again,

34:59.040 --> 35:00.900
setting the right expectations is important

35:00.900 --> 35:02.009
if you can do that.

35:02.009 --> 35:05.676
(attendee speaking faintly)

35:09.300 --> 35:12.200
Yeah, no, would love to trade notes after this. Thank you.

35:13.500 --> 35:14.350
<v ->Yeah, go ahead.</v>

35:15.958 --> 35:18.570
<v Attendee>I'm curious about the automotive industry.</v>

35:18.570 --> 35:22.520
So I think we're talking maybe 2026 at the soonest for NTN

35:22.520 --> 35:27.003
to be available potentially in a car somewhere,

35:27.900 --> 35:29.130
but how do you see that unfolding?

35:29.130 --> 35:31.230
Do you see the carriers controlling that implementation

35:31.230 --> 35:33.960
or do you see the wireless,

35:33.960 --> 35:35.670
I'm sorry, the satellite industry

35:35.670 --> 35:37.820
engaging directly with the automators?

35:39.537 --> 35:41.169
<v ->Happy to take a quick crack at it.</v>

35:41.169 --> 35:44.340
I think that the things

35:44.340 --> 35:47.190
that play out in automotive are very similar

35:47.190 --> 35:50.943
to the way things play out in consumer with a lag.

35:52.140 --> 35:56.400
So I think you should expect to see a similar rollout

35:56.400 --> 35:58.650
as you have seen for consumer handsets

35:58.650 --> 36:03.063
in that the first innings of this might very well be

36:03.063 --> 36:06.360
with a baseline that the OEM helps set

36:06.360 --> 36:07.871
so that they can set an expectation

36:07.871 --> 36:12.390
with their drivers and passengers that hey, you're covered

36:12.390 --> 36:14.730
with a certain basic element irrespective

36:14.730 --> 36:17.490
of the market in which you buy the car

36:17.490 --> 36:18.600
or the truck, you know,

36:18.600 --> 36:20.970
if you're talking commercial vehicle.

36:20.970 --> 36:23.970
Then the next innings is about those enhanced services,

36:23.970 --> 36:26.340
which, frankly, I'm an automaker,

36:26.340 --> 36:31.020
I don't really care about the services revenue that accrue

36:31.020 --> 36:33.690
from a service that an MNO

36:33.690 --> 36:38.370
in that country is much more adequately equipped to sell,

36:38.370 --> 36:42.570
distribute, and support than the OEM.

36:42.570 --> 36:44.820
So I think that's the way it see it play out.

36:44.820 --> 36:47.490
<v Attendee>All right, quick follow up,</v>

36:47.490 --> 36:50.132
any thoughts on when a regulatory requirement

36:50.132 --> 36:55.080
for next gen 911 or next gen eCall might require

36:55.080 --> 36:57.510
satellite connectivity in parts?

36:57.510 --> 36:58.800
<v ->You know, it's interesting,</v>

36:58.800 --> 37:00.960
and thank you for bringing that up.

37:00.960 --> 37:04.020
If you look at the regulations in Europe

37:04.020 --> 37:05.970
as an example, they're very tight.

37:05.970 --> 37:07.740
So to meet some of those SLAs,

37:07.740 --> 37:09.300
it becomes incredibly important

37:09.300 --> 37:12.480
to have a high nines reliable network connection,

37:12.480 --> 37:15.750
especially when you're doing cross-border 3PL.

37:15.750 --> 37:17.640
In India, as an example,

37:17.640 --> 37:20.730
there's a regulation called AIS 140

37:20.730 --> 37:24.450
that applies to logistics, tracking devices, and trucks,

37:24.450 --> 37:27.210
which is also quite stringent

37:27.210 --> 37:29.229
around in enhancing the level of visibility,

37:29.229 --> 37:31.350
observability, and safety.

37:31.350 --> 37:33.616
So I do think that carriers around the world

37:33.616 --> 37:36.540
are going to take satellite

37:36.540 --> 37:40.170
more and more seriously as a part of the total offering

37:40.170 --> 37:41.823
to the 3PL providers.

37:43.680 --> 37:44.513
<v ->Yeah, I agree.</v>

37:44.513 --> 37:49.020
I mean, it's more of a regional issue.

37:49.020 --> 37:50.430
That one, I mean, eCall in Europe

37:50.430 --> 37:52.800
has been developing a lot faster,

37:52.800 --> 37:55.230
even though it's developing at a fairly slow pace

37:55.230 --> 37:57.240
compared to the rest of the world.

37:57.240 --> 38:01.230
Similar to past Indian example, Brazil for example, today,

38:01.230 --> 38:03.420
even prior to NTN technology,

38:03.420 --> 38:06.733
Brazil is a pretty fertile market for satellite connectivity

38:06.733 --> 38:09.480
because of the relatively poorer coverage

38:09.480 --> 38:12.960
and the combination of regulatory action,

38:12.960 --> 38:15.753
insurance companies, and that kind of thing.

38:16.710 --> 38:19.440
So we're gonna see these sort of different pockets play out,

38:19.440 --> 38:22.230
I think, and some of them will be a great use case

38:22.230 --> 38:25.350
for satellite, which will help pull this along.

38:25.350 --> 38:27.900
I think the one thing with automotive is true

38:27.900 --> 38:31.590
that I think the OEM in the, you know,

38:31.590 --> 38:34.410
consumer automotive world will try

38:34.410 --> 38:36.780
to control experience as much as possible.

38:36.780 --> 38:39.209
So regardless of how they procure the connectivity

38:39.209 --> 38:41.797
in the back end, they will be controlling that experience.

38:41.797 --> 38:45.450
That will be very different in industrial markets.

38:45.450 --> 38:49.110
Industrial markets usually start out with a myriad

38:49.110 --> 38:52.200
of aftermarket solutions first 'cause they can prove it out

38:52.200 --> 38:55.650
and move a lot faster than an OEM ever can.

38:55.650 --> 38:58.050
You don't get quite the same aftermarket

38:58.050 --> 39:00.930
kind of experience these days in automotive.

39:00.930 --> 39:04.350
It's not like people are buying GPS devices

39:04.350 --> 39:06.840
and stick them in their cars other than their smartphone.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.730
So I think it'll take a while for that

39:08.730 --> 39:11.610
to really take hold, but it's a market that I do think

39:11.610 --> 39:13.980
is still a significant one for this sort

39:13.980 --> 39:15.980
of satellite direct-to-device, for sure.

39:17.040 --> 39:18.103
<v ->Thank you. Thanks for the answer.</v>

39:18.103 --> 39:20.820
So I think that actually takes us very close

39:20.820 --> 39:22.770
to the end of our session.

39:22.770 --> 39:25.410
So I'd like to thank you all for attending.

39:25.410 --> 39:27.750
I'd like to give a special thanks to our panelists

39:27.750 --> 39:29.550
for the insightful discussion,

39:29.550 --> 39:31.680
of course our audience members for their questions,

39:31.680 --> 39:34.890
and I hope you enjoy the rest of your time at CES.

39:34.890 --> 39:36.463
Thank you.

39:36.463 --> 39:39.046
(upbeat music)
