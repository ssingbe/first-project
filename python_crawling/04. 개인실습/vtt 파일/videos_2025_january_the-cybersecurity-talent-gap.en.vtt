1
00:00.120 --> 00:02.703
(upbeat music)

2
00:11.760 --> 00:12.780
<v ->Good morning, everybody,</v>

3
00:12.780 --> 00:14.460
or I should say good afternoon.

4
00:14.460 --> 00:15.780
It's already one o'clock.

5
00:15.780 --> 00:18.540
The time is going by so quickly.

6
00:18.540 --> 00:21.180
I wanna welcome you all here today.

7
00:21.180 --> 00:25.230
We're gonna talk about the cyber security talent gap

8
00:25.230 --> 00:27.750
that we're experiencing globally,

9
00:27.750 --> 00:31.920
but we have two U.S. or individuals here,

10
00:31.920 --> 00:33.990
so we'll probably talk a lot also

11
00:33.990 --> 00:36.870
about the situation in the United States.

12
00:36.870 --> 00:38.490
First, I'd like to introduce myself.

13
00:38.490 --> 00:39.660
My name's Jennifer Taylor.

14
00:39.660 --> 00:41.520
I'm the president and CEO

15
00:41.520 --> 00:44.070
of the Northern Virginia Technology Council.

16
00:44.070 --> 00:48.120
We're one of the largest tech councils in the country,

17
00:48.120 --> 00:50.400
and we've been around for 35 years.

18
00:50.400 --> 00:53.400
And what we do is we really drive

19
00:53.400 --> 00:55.470
innovation and economic growth

20
00:55.470 --> 00:57.060
in the Northern Virginia region,

21
00:57.060 --> 00:59.970
which sits right across the river

22
00:59.970 --> 01:02.910
from the capital of the United States, Washington, D.C.,

23
01:02.910 --> 01:06.390
so we really unite and bring together

24
01:06.390 --> 01:10.320
our full tech ecosystem in the national capital region,

25
01:10.320 --> 01:11.880
our nation's capital.

26
01:11.880 --> 01:13.560
Prior to this role, I actually worked

27
01:13.560 --> 01:15.810
at the Consumer Technology Association,

28
01:15.810 --> 01:18.240
where I was VP of Industry Affairs,

29
01:18.240 --> 01:21.330
and one of my roles was to lead

30
01:21.330 --> 01:24.120
all of our workforce development programming

31
01:24.120 --> 01:27.330
and policy work, so that's why I'm here today.

32
01:27.330 --> 01:31.530
Today's panel topic is titled The Cybersecurity Talent Gap.

33
01:31.530 --> 01:35.160
And this topic is really relevant and timely today,

34
01:35.160 --> 01:38.400
considering that cybersecurity talent shortages.

35
01:38.400 --> 01:40.860
This shortage has never been more pressing.

36
01:40.860 --> 01:44.340
I'm sure you're all aware of recent cyber attacks,

37
01:44.340 --> 01:46.140
such as the Salt Typhoon

38
01:46.140 --> 01:48.300
targeting the U.S. telecom industry,

39
01:48.300 --> 01:50.190
and the Volt Typhoon,

40
01:50.190 --> 01:52.650
the Chinese State-sponsored hacker group

41
01:52.650 --> 01:55.080
that has threatened critical infrastructure,

42
01:55.080 --> 01:56.310
including power, water,

43
01:56.310 --> 01:58.770
military facilities, and supply chains.

44
01:58.770 --> 02:02.250
So all of this underscores escalating risk.

45
02:02.250 --> 02:05.430
And these are just two of the more well known.

46
02:05.430 --> 02:08.913
We know companies are dealing with cyber attacks every day.

47
02:10.080 --> 02:12.570
So what I'd like to do now

48
02:12.570 --> 02:14.760
is just set the table for our discussion

49
02:14.760 --> 02:16.740
and share some general statistics with you

50
02:16.740 --> 02:19.050
about the cyber workforce.

51
02:19.050 --> 02:21.480
In the U.S., we are currently experiencing

52
02:21.480 --> 02:24.360
a significant shortage of cyber professionals

53
02:24.360 --> 02:26.640
with thousands of positions unfilled.

54
02:26.640 --> 02:29.970
And this gap poses, I find this really interesting,

55
02:29.970 --> 02:32.370
substantial risks to our organizations,

56
02:32.370 --> 02:34.710
our industries and governments

57
02:34.710 --> 02:37.260
because the lack of skilled personnel

58
02:37.260 --> 02:40.410
is predicted to account for more than half

59
02:40.410 --> 02:43.515
of significant cybersecurity incidents worldwide,

60
02:43.515 --> 02:45.003
so we need more people.

61
02:47.970 --> 02:50.880
To address the talent gap,

62
02:50.880 --> 02:54.420
there are various initiatives underway, which is great.

63
02:54.420 --> 02:57.900
We're seeing organizations map skills training

64
02:57.900 --> 02:59.850
to emerging threats.

65
02:59.850 --> 03:02.460
We're offering more continuous learning opportunities

66
03:02.460 --> 03:05.460
for staff or employees.

67
03:05.460 --> 03:09.000
Their organizations are providing more clear pathways,

68
03:09.000 --> 03:10.710
career pathways.

69
03:10.710 --> 03:14.460
We're attracting talent from more diverse populations

70
03:14.460 --> 03:18.900
and through non-traditional educational pathways,

71
03:18.900 --> 03:21.330
like apprenticeship, at least in our country.

72
03:21.330 --> 03:24.630
And we're collaborating more with public agencies

73
03:24.630 --> 03:26.970
and through national campaigns.

74
03:26.970 --> 03:30.630
So in today's discussion, we're going to do three things.

75
03:30.630 --> 03:32.340
We're gonna understand what are the factors

76
03:32.340 --> 03:36.570
that are driving the demand for cybersecurity talent.

77
03:36.570 --> 03:39.420
We're going to discuss how the increased demand for cyber

78
03:39.420 --> 03:40.923
is impacting companies,

79
03:42.030 --> 03:44.730
specifically how they're filling their talent pipelines.

80
03:44.730 --> 03:45.960
And then we're gonna showcase

81
03:45.960 --> 03:48.630
how tech companies are addressing these challenges

82
03:48.630 --> 03:51.660
through innovative and unconventional ways.

83
03:51.660 --> 03:54.390
So what I'm gonna do now is introduce

84
03:54.390 --> 03:56.880
our two subject matter experts.

85
03:56.880 --> 03:58.530
First, we have Torrell Funderburk.

86
03:58.530 --> 04:01.440
He's the CISO at Sealed Air.

87
04:01.440 --> 04:06.180
And he focuses on cyber resilience and innovation

88
04:06.180 --> 04:08.370
in the face of evolving security threats.

89
04:08.370 --> 04:10.950
He has a background in software development

90
04:10.950 --> 04:12.960
and a passion for digital transformation

91
04:12.960 --> 04:14.670
and emerging technology.

92
04:14.670 --> 04:16.770
Today, he's dedicated to bridging the gap

93
04:16.770 --> 04:21.090
between business objectives and cybersecurity strategies.

94
04:21.090 --> 04:22.680
So we're gonna talk about that.

95
04:22.680 --> 04:24.840
For those of you who are unaware of Sealed Air,

96
04:24.840 --> 04:27.330
they're now branded as C.

97
04:27.330 --> 04:28.393
Do you say C or S-E-E?

98
04:28.393 --> 04:30.000
<v ->C.</v>
<v ->C, yeah.</v>

99
04:30.000 --> 04:31.800
And they're a packaging company.

100
04:31.800 --> 04:33.840
They're known for their innovative solutions

101
04:33.840 --> 04:36.390
in product protection, food safety, and security.

102
04:36.390 --> 04:38.970
They're headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina,

103
04:38.970 --> 04:41.880
and you'll know some of their popular brands,

104
04:41.880 --> 04:45.280
well-known brands such as Bubble Wrap and Cryovac

105
04:46.170 --> 04:47.733
for food Packaging.

106
04:49.020 --> 04:51.140
Now, we also have Vishal Chawla.

107
04:51.140 --> 04:52.500
Am I saying that correctly?

108
04:52.500 --> 04:54.360
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->Okay. (laughs)</v>

109
04:54.360 --> 04:57.600
And he's the founder and CEO of BluOcean.

110
04:57.600 --> 05:00.720
He brings over 30 years of cybersecurity expertise,

111
05:00.720 --> 05:05.400
combining his big four experience as a global cyber leader

112
05:05.400 --> 05:09.180
and a senior partner serving global Fortune 100 clients

113
05:09.180 --> 05:11.820
in the financial services and healthcare industry.

114
05:11.820 --> 05:14.880
He's now the founder and CEO of BluOcean Cyber.

115
05:14.880 --> 05:16.680
They're located in Northern Virginia,

116
05:16.680 --> 05:20.380
where he's created a product called RiskGPS.

117
05:21.390 --> 05:23.490
It's a cyber risk governance platform

118
05:23.490 --> 05:26.340
and it helps companies dominate their competition

119
05:26.340 --> 05:27.990
by redefining cybersecurity

120
05:27.990 --> 05:31.350
as a critical strategic business asset.

121
05:31.350 --> 05:32.880
And he'll tell us more about that as well.

122
05:32.880 --> 05:35.257
And he's been published in "The Wall Street Journal,"

123
05:35.257 --> 05:38.310
"The MIT Review" and many other publications.

124
05:38.310 --> 05:40.706
So thank you both for being here today.

125
05:40.706 --> 05:41.650
<v ->Thank you for having us.</v>

126
05:41.650 --> 05:44.730
<v ->Okay, so we will take time for a few questions at the end,</v>

127
05:44.730 --> 05:47.130
so if you have any, you know,

128
05:47.130 --> 05:48.330
we look forward to hearing from you.

129
05:48.330 --> 05:51.120
So we're gonna start with Torrell and then Vishal.

130
05:51.120 --> 05:54.870
So based on your respective experiences,

131
05:54.870 --> 05:57.750
at Sealed Air and Deloitte, when you were working with them,

132
05:57.750 --> 06:00.660
Vishal, what do you believe are the main factors

133
06:00.660 --> 06:04.263
driving the increased demand for cybersecurity strategies?

134
06:07.110 --> 06:08.160
what's driving the demand?

135
06:08.160 --> 06:10.560
<v ->This is like an incredible question,</v>

136
06:10.560 --> 06:12.170
and I like this question

137
06:12.170 --> 06:14.883
because I think it's a combination of many factors.

138
06:15.750 --> 06:19.530
I think one, obvious for large publicly traded companies,

139
06:19.530 --> 06:21.780
is the new SEC regulations

140
06:21.780 --> 06:23.940
and trying to aim for regulatory compliance

141
06:23.940 --> 06:25.470
and shared accountability and ownership

142
06:25.470 --> 06:26.670
at the leadership level.

143
06:27.780 --> 06:31.320
But on top of that, I think the general awareness

144
06:31.320 --> 06:34.770
for the cyber securities is being raised across industry.

145
06:34.770 --> 06:35.820
So more people are aware of it,

146
06:35.820 --> 06:38.040
more people kind of understand

147
06:38.040 --> 06:40.893
that they need their collective strategies towards cyber.

148
06:41.850 --> 06:45.390
And I think as a side effect of that,

149
06:45.390 --> 06:49.353
it almost feels as if through that focus,

150
06:50.580 --> 06:52.710
there's a realization that cyber can also de-risk

151
06:52.710 --> 06:54.600
and enable the business as well,

152
06:54.600 --> 06:58.623
because of the unique nature that cyber has to play.

153
06:59.520 --> 07:02.550
So, if a business has a strategy

154
07:02.550 --> 07:04.290
that they're driving towards,

155
07:04.290 --> 07:06.720
how can cyber be leveraged to de-risk that

156
07:06.720 --> 07:09.180
while maintain kind of operational resilience

157
07:09.180 --> 07:13.380
for their current operations effectively?

158
07:13.380 --> 07:15.210
So I think a combination of all those three things

159
07:15.210 --> 07:18.660
is really what's driving the need and demand

160
07:18.660 --> 07:21.270
for effective cyber strategies

161
07:21.270 --> 07:23.820
and also demand for cyber strategy

162
07:23.820 --> 07:25.080
to be communicated effectively,

163
07:25.080 --> 07:27.540
which is also a challenge in our industry.

164
07:27.540 --> 07:28.590
<v Jennifer>Yeah.</v>

165
07:28.590 --> 07:31.080
What are your thoughts, Vishal?

166
07:31.080 --> 07:32.910
<v ->No, those are great points, Torrell.</v>

167
07:32.910 --> 07:35.553
I'll add few aspects to it.

168
07:36.510 --> 07:38.220
I would pick about four things.

169
07:38.220 --> 07:40.660
One, I think what we have seen is

170
07:42.030 --> 07:44.850
the cyber criminals are not anymore...

171
07:44.850 --> 07:46.830
I joke like two men in a truck,

172
07:46.830 --> 07:49.200
door wrangler, just try to come in.

173
07:49.200 --> 07:51.045
They have become organized.

174
07:51.045 --> 07:51.878
<v Jennifer>Yeah.</v>

175
07:51.878 --> 07:53.730
<v ->Ransomware as a service, like LockBit.</v>

176
07:53.730 --> 07:56.160
These companies have HR department,

177
07:56.160 --> 07:58.740
you get paid, you come in nine to six,

178
07:58.740 --> 07:59.730
you hack all day-
<v ->Unbelievable.</v>

179
07:59.730 --> 08:00.750
<v ->You go home.</v>

180
08:00.750 --> 08:02.730
So they are businesses.

181
08:02.730 --> 08:04.890
They are not just two people

182
08:04.890 --> 08:07.710
just trying to see sitting in a basement or a dorm room

183
08:07.710 --> 08:08.820
trying to break in.

184
08:08.820 --> 08:13.200
So that shifts like bringing the professionalism,

185
08:13.200 --> 08:15.720
if you think about it, to attacking,

186
08:15.720 --> 08:18.600
to hacking companies and holding them hostage.

187
08:18.600 --> 08:21.090
So that is a big shift we are seeing.

188
08:21.090 --> 08:25.770
The number two is definitely when you look at

189
08:25.770 --> 08:30.030
in terms of automation and everything, what's going on.

190
08:30.030 --> 08:35.030
We are seeing a lot more stuff like cloud and SaaS.

191
08:35.610 --> 08:38.730
Especially after COVID, we saw this huge shift,

192
08:38.730 --> 08:39.563
we gotta move.

193
08:40.470 --> 08:41.970
But cloud and SaaS means

194
08:41.970 --> 08:44.460
now you gotta go out of your perimeter.

195
08:44.460 --> 08:46.860
You don't have that control, right?

196
08:46.860 --> 08:49.860
<v ->Right.</v>
<v ->So, that creates now</v>

197
08:49.860 --> 08:52.050
a very open-ended environment,

198
08:52.050 --> 08:55.950
like I call it why you need to come into a house

199
08:55.950 --> 08:58.060
when your house is actually outside or-

200
08:58.060 --> 08:59.130
<v Jennifer>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

201
08:59.130 --> 09:01.410
<v ->Or the other way I look at it is,</v>

202
09:01.410 --> 09:03.870
we used to always call it what happens in Vegas,

203
09:03.870 --> 09:04.829
stays in Vegas.

204
09:04.829 --> 09:06.840
(Jennifer laughs)
Not anymore.

205
09:06.840 --> 09:09.390
It's on a SaaS cloud sitting somewhere,

206
09:09.390 --> 09:11.040
which we have no clue.

207
09:11.040 --> 09:12.570
And they don't need to come in,

208
09:12.570 --> 09:14.190
they just hack in and those things,

209
09:14.190 --> 09:15.960
so it's changing that whole thing.

210
09:15.960 --> 09:17.220
<v ->I love these analogies.</v>

211
09:17.220 --> 09:19.400
Like I like that house is outside of the house.

212
09:19.400 --> 09:20.880
<v ->It is, everything is out, right?</v>

213
09:20.880 --> 09:24.360
You can go ahead Salesforce for any of these tech company

214
09:24.360 --> 09:26.670
outside, you don't need to come into the parameter.

215
09:26.670 --> 09:29.280
And I think the third biggest thing we are seeing,

216
09:29.280 --> 09:32.820
which is third biggest thing we are seeing is

217
09:32.820 --> 09:35.160
the attack pattern has shifted

218
09:35.160 --> 09:40.160
because earlier, the people wanted to go attack for data.

219
09:40.530 --> 09:44.250
Every one of our information had some value,

220
09:44.250 --> 09:46.560
but that value has gone down considerably.

221
09:46.560 --> 09:49.110
So when Ticketmaster got hacked,

222
09:49.110 --> 09:52.020
I think they got half a billion record, I think,

223
09:52.020 --> 09:54.570
and they asked for 400,000.

224
09:54.570 --> 09:55.620
That's less than-
<v ->Dollars.</v>

225
09:55.620 --> 09:59.430
<v ->That's less than a penny for each of our record.</v>

226
09:59.430 --> 10:00.330
That's it.

227
10:00.330 --> 10:01.890
But what they are shifted is

228
10:01.890 --> 10:04.410
they are going after business disruption.

229
10:04.410 --> 10:06.930
How I disrupt business, like change healthcare,

230
10:06.930 --> 10:09.690
how I go, like, don't want to name the companies,

231
10:09.690 --> 10:13.650
but companies we are disrupt the business, shut it down,

232
10:13.650 --> 10:17.223
so I hold them hostage and they gotta pay me now.

233
10:18.781 --> 10:20.940
And the last part I would say which has changed

234
10:20.940 --> 10:24.930
the attack pattern is everything we look in CTM is

235
10:24.930 --> 10:27.060
I'm sure we are enjoying CES, right?

236
10:27.060 --> 10:28.413
Every technology we see.

237
10:29.550 --> 10:31.890
As fast the technology is moving,

238
10:31.890 --> 10:33.210
like we were talking about Abbott,

239
10:33.210 --> 10:36.480
when I was looking at the device, the hacker is moving too.

240
10:36.480 --> 10:40.620
And the more technology-enabled company we become,

241
10:40.620 --> 10:44.340
the more opening is for hackers to go after us.

242
10:44.340 --> 10:46.456
So I think these four factors-

243
10:46.456 --> 10:48.870
<v ->It's very well said.</v>
<v ->are creating an ecosystem,</v>

244
10:48.870 --> 10:52.710
which is creating this talent gap also

245
10:52.710 --> 10:54.990
because it's not where we were,

246
10:54.990 --> 10:58.320
it's like, your hockey, where the puck is going,

247
10:58.320 --> 11:00.660
that's moving too fast, it's going somewhere else

248
11:00.660 --> 11:02.575
and we are still kind of moving slowly towards it

249
11:02.575 --> 11:06.450
<v Jennifer>So the skills, the talent pipeline</v>

250
11:06.450 --> 11:09.600
has to keep up with the pace of technology.

251
11:09.600 --> 11:10.830
<v Torrell>Yeah, I love the analogy</v>

252
11:10.830 --> 11:12.660
because I use it internally.

253
11:12.660 --> 11:14.100
<v Jennifer>I'm seeing the technology,</v>

254
11:14.100 --> 11:15.810
you know, have the hockey stick.

255
11:15.810 --> 11:17.310
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->And then the hackers.</v>

256
11:17.310 --> 11:19.200
But the talent has to-
<v ->Correct.</v>

257
11:19.200 --> 11:21.326
<v ->Go along with it.</v>
<v ->Skate to the puck.</v>

258
11:21.326 --> 11:22.290
<v ->Yeah.</v>

259
11:22.290 --> 11:23.310
<v Jennifer>Absolutely.</v>

260
11:23.310 --> 11:25.560
So I'm gonna go to my next question.

261
11:25.560 --> 11:30.560
So how has increased demand for cyber security impacted C?

262
11:30.810 --> 11:33.600
Like what are the conversations you're having as the CISO

263
11:33.600 --> 11:36.274
with your CEO and your leadership team?

264
11:36.274 --> 11:38.100
<v ->I think kind of what I touched on earlier,</v>

265
11:38.100 --> 11:41.040
and that's leveraging kind of the capabilities

266
11:41.040 --> 11:43.080
that we've established at our company

267
11:43.080 --> 11:45.240
to actually de-risk the business strategy, right?

268
11:45.240 --> 11:48.660
So we're elevating our integration into the organization.

269
11:48.660 --> 11:51.090
So it's not just this back office project function.

270
11:51.090 --> 11:53.070
It is how we align with the business

271
11:53.070 --> 11:54.240
to de-risk that strategy

272
11:54.240 --> 11:56.530
and the expectations and outcomes that come with that.

273
11:56.530 --> 11:58.000
So it is raising the bar

274
11:59.150 --> 12:00.930
for the expectations of security

275
12:00.930 --> 12:03.630
in terms of helping driving outcomes,

276
12:03.630 --> 12:06.960
but also more visibility

277
12:06.960 --> 12:10.440
in terms of our readiness for operational disruption,

278
12:10.440 --> 12:11.400
as Vishal mentioned.

279
12:11.400 --> 12:14.370
<v Jennifer>So are you able to give us a specific example?</v>

280
12:14.370 --> 12:16.350
I don't know if it's proprietary,

281
12:16.350 --> 12:19.710
but of de-risking a specific strategy.

282
12:19.710 --> 12:21.583
So, like what might be-

283
12:25.620 --> 12:27.240
<v ->I'll give you an example.</v>

284
12:27.240 --> 12:30.150
So Vishal gave a great example.

285
12:30.150 --> 12:34.500
So, there's an increase in attack posture,

286
12:34.500 --> 12:36.930
attack surface with the boom of the devices

287
12:36.930 --> 12:38.130
and emerging technology.

288
12:38.130 --> 12:42.090
So you have AI, you have IoT and manufacturing.

289
12:42.090 --> 12:43.890
There's this I4.0 revolution, right?

290
12:43.890 --> 12:44.723
<v Jennifer>That's right.</v>

291
12:44.723 --> 12:45.556
<v ->So a lot of connected devices,</v>

292
12:45.556 --> 12:47.347
smart manufacturing, digital twins, all this.

293
12:47.347 --> 12:51.570
<v ->Right, so I'm visualizing C's manufacturing operations</v>

294
12:51.570 --> 12:53.634
as you're describing that, and this is massive.

295
12:53.634 --> 12:56.103
<v ->Yeah, yeah, so-</v>
<v ->And I'm sure it's global,</v>

296
12:56.103 --> 12:58.710
<v ->It's a global footprint.</v>
<v ->Yep, yep.</v>

297
12:58.710 --> 13:00.930
<v ->So from a security standpoint,</v>

298
13:00.930 --> 13:04.530
how do we align with the major stakeholders in the business

299
13:04.530 --> 13:07.080
that are driving this strategy

300
13:07.080 --> 13:11.760
for more digital operation to de-risk it

301
13:11.760 --> 13:15.450
in terms of like building secure by design models?

302
13:15.450 --> 13:18.030
So we have a clearly understood model

303
13:18.030 --> 13:21.300
to onboard this emerging technology onto our operation

304
13:21.300 --> 13:23.640
that not only protects

305
13:23.640 --> 13:26.010
against like existing or emerging risks,

306
13:26.010 --> 13:27.030
but it also improves

307
13:27.030 --> 13:28.013
the performance of our current operation as well.

308
13:28.013 --> 13:29.445
<v Jennifer>Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay.</v>

309
13:29.445 --> 13:32.460
<v ->So, I think the days of just expecting it</v>

310
13:32.460 --> 13:34.050
to be secure is gone.

311
13:34.050 --> 13:35.670
It's like, okay, secure and what?

312
13:35.670 --> 13:38.760
Secure and more efficient, more cost efficient,

313
13:38.760 --> 13:40.800
more operational resilient.

314
13:40.800 --> 13:45.600
So I think the more integration to business outcomes

315
13:45.600 --> 13:48.600
is kind of what I'm seeing.
<v ->Gotcha. Wow.</v>

316
13:48.600 --> 13:50.160
<v ->Yeah.</v>

317
13:50.160 --> 13:54.570
<v ->And so, how, how is it impacting-</v>

318
13:54.570 --> 13:55.410
<v ->Talent side?</v>
<v ->What?</v>

319
13:55.410 --> 13:56.553
<v Vishal>The talent?</v>

320
13:57.420 --> 13:59.640
<v Jennifer>Well, so this increased demand</v>

321
13:59.640 --> 14:01.380
for cybersecurity.

322
14:01.380 --> 14:02.730
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->How is it impacting?</v>

323
14:02.730 --> 14:06.570
How are you seeing companies respond from your perspective,

324
14:06.570 --> 14:07.537
either while you were working,

325
14:07.537 --> 14:10.410
you know, with the big four or with BluOcean?

326
14:10.410 --> 14:11.243
<v ->I think-</v>

327
14:12.450 --> 14:13.775
<v ->How are companies responding to any these four-</v>

328
14:13.775 --> 14:15.480
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
<v ->trends you just outlined?</v>

329
14:15.480 --> 14:17.700
<v ->So, when I take those trends</v>

330
14:17.700 --> 14:20.460
and I think back to Torrell's great point

331
14:20.460 --> 14:22.710
about the business-centric kind of thinking,

332
14:22.710 --> 14:26.430
I think what it's creating is I step back

333
14:26.430 --> 14:28.680
and been I've consultant for so long.

334
14:28.680 --> 14:31.110
When I look at the problem from outside in,

335
14:31.110 --> 14:33.570
I see we have a talent issue

336
14:33.570 --> 14:36.300
at about four different dimensions to it.

337
14:36.300 --> 14:39.000
I'll start with the first one is,

338
14:39.000 --> 14:41.250
what Torrell and I were talking a few minutes ago

339
14:41.250 --> 14:45.090
is just the security leadership.

340
14:45.090 --> 14:47.460
Is the security leadership trained enough

341
14:47.460 --> 14:49.770
to understand the mission and the business-

342
14:49.770 --> 14:51.933
<v ->Okay.</v>
<v ->and very business-centric?</v>

343
14:53.190 --> 14:55.140
Back to the SEC regulation.

344
14:55.140 --> 14:57.640
They want you to focus on the business centricity.

345
14:58.890 --> 15:02.040
Because the criminal looks at your business to attack you.

346
15:02.040 --> 15:05.310
So there's a huge demand on security leadership,

347
15:05.310 --> 15:07.170
how to train themselves

348
15:07.170 --> 15:09.480
to move more toward the business side of the gap.

349
15:09.480 --> 15:11.340
So that's some of the companies are pushing

350
15:11.340 --> 15:14.580
their security leaders to be more strategic.

351
15:14.580 --> 15:17.520
And what I call it, we were great

352
15:17.520 --> 15:20.520
as a professional cybersecurity leader

353
15:20.520 --> 15:24.750
used to be a good defender and a technologist.

354
15:24.750 --> 15:27.690
As I remember a bank in Virginia,

355
15:27.690 --> 15:30.840
they hired someone and he was phenomenal in technology,

356
15:30.840 --> 15:34.050
how to transition to cloud, but then they get hacked.

357
15:34.050 --> 15:37.650
Not his fault, but again, that's how they used to hire.

358
15:37.650 --> 15:40.410
And now, they have to move to hiring people

359
15:40.410 --> 15:43.500
who are more strategists and collaborator.

360
15:43.500 --> 15:44.970
<v ->Okay.</v>
<v ->So you gotta shift</v>

361
15:44.970 --> 15:47.190
from technologist and defender

362
15:47.190 --> 15:49.230
to building new additional muscles

363
15:49.230 --> 15:54.210
of a strategist and collaborator.

364
15:54.210 --> 15:55.260
So that's number one.

365
15:55.260 --> 15:57.850
The number two I would pick, Jen, is

366
15:59.310 --> 16:01.590
it's really the skill side

367
16:01.590 --> 16:04.680
where companies are investing into

368
16:04.680 --> 16:08.040
back to, yes, we need certain skills,

369
16:08.040 --> 16:11.700
but what exactly the skills are gonna be needed

370
16:11.700 --> 16:13.830
for the future where things are going.

371
16:13.830 --> 16:17.100
So, we can be great with the skills we have,

372
16:17.100 --> 16:21.210
but we gotta shift that skill pattern to, oh, you got AI.

373
16:21.210 --> 16:23.070
Now, you got SaaS application,

374
16:23.070 --> 16:26.700
which security never had to really deal with application

375
16:26.700 --> 16:29.640
too much because it was inside the...

376
16:29.640 --> 16:31.500
But there's no more wall,

377
16:31.500 --> 16:33.330
there's no more around the company anymore,

378
16:33.330 --> 16:36.690
so everything is outside, so you gotta change the skillset.

379
16:36.690 --> 16:39.630
I think the third big thing which we are seeing,

380
16:39.630 --> 16:43.470
and you will see, like if you guys align with NACD

381
16:43.470 --> 16:44.310
and the board,

382
16:44.310 --> 16:47.160
there's a huge pressure on the board of directors

383
16:47.160 --> 16:47.998
<v Jennifer>Yes.</v>

384
16:47.998 --> 16:50.460
<v ->to bring some cyber security skills at the leadership.</v>

385
16:50.460 --> 16:52.117
<v Jennifer>Okay. Even into the board.</v>

386
16:52.117 --> 16:53.010
<v ->Even into the board.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

387
16:53.010 --> 16:54.900
<v ->And actually, interestingly,</v>

388
16:54.900 --> 16:59.900
there's a senator out of state of Washington, I think.

389
17:00.360 --> 17:03.750
He has proposed, actually put something on the table,

390
17:03.750 --> 17:05.310
which I don't think this is gonna get passed,

391
17:05.310 --> 17:09.171
but we're holding criminally.

392
17:09.171 --> 17:10.004
<v Jennifer>Yes, I remember reading that.</v>

393
17:10.004 --> 17:11.040
<v ->The board and the CISOs</v>

394
17:11.040 --> 17:12.990
start getting accountable for it.

395
17:12.990 --> 17:14.730
So there is a huge pressure on the board

396
17:14.730 --> 17:16.860
that if you're gonna do the governance,

397
17:16.860 --> 17:18.360
this is a risk you need to manage.

398
17:18.360 --> 17:20.130
So that's the third skill gap

399
17:20.130 --> 17:22.080
which companies are trying to address.

400
17:22.080 --> 17:25.620
And the fourth one I feel is awareness.

401
17:25.620 --> 17:27.300
As we know, what?

402
17:27.300 --> 17:31.950
80% or so cyber attacks happens because of human errors?

403
17:31.950 --> 17:32.783
80?

404
17:32.783 --> 17:35.220
So how are we gonna become savvy?

405
17:35.220 --> 17:37.200
It's just like when you purchase a car,

406
17:37.200 --> 17:39.360
you learn how to manage the car, right?

407
17:39.360 --> 17:41.820
Now you got all these devices,

408
17:41.820 --> 17:43.800
like, I don't wanna put anyone like

409
17:43.800 --> 17:45.750
I go and ask this question sometime.

410
17:45.750 --> 17:49.350
Like, go and open your Venmo and see

411
17:49.350 --> 17:50.790
who all is paying to whom.

412
17:50.790 --> 17:52.050
Can you see that?

413
17:52.050 --> 17:53.100
And if you can't see that,

414
17:53.100 --> 17:55.560
that means you have that personal information,

415
17:55.560 --> 17:57.480
which you don't need to know because it's all there.

416
17:57.480 --> 17:59.550
So you gotta understand technology.

417
17:59.550 --> 18:02.010
<v ->Okay, so wait, let's talk about this example.</v>

418
18:02.010 --> 18:04.500
So when I go into my Venmo, what did you say?

419
18:04.500 --> 18:07.140
I can see everybody that I paid, right?

420
18:07.140 --> 18:10.050
<v ->And all your friends who you're paying, anyone.</v>

421
18:10.050 --> 18:11.550
<v ->Oh, absolutely.</v>

422
18:11.550 --> 18:13.170
<v ->It's like why I need to know.</v>

423
18:13.170 --> 18:14.820
<v ->I put my thing on private.</v>

424
18:14.820 --> 18:16.620
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Because I remember seeing</v>

425
18:16.620 --> 18:18.480
a friend from high school-
<v ->Yeah.</v>

426
18:18.480 --> 18:21.870
<v ->That said that she paid a tutor for her daughter.</v>

427
18:21.870 --> 18:24.750
And I went, "Hmm, her daughter must need help with math."

428
18:24.750 --> 18:26.820
Why do I need to know that eight states away?

429
18:26.820 --> 18:28.290
That's weird, you know? But yeah,

430
18:28.290 --> 18:30.090
<v ->If you go back to,</v>

431
18:30.090 --> 18:32.280
I'm sure everyone has watched "Home Alone," right?

432
18:32.280 --> 18:33.213
<v ->Yes. Love it.</v>

433
18:34.290 --> 18:38.100
<v ->People had to go and go to the house</v>

434
18:38.100 --> 18:40.740
to figure out is someone gonna leave the house,

435
18:40.740 --> 18:42.382
so I can come and commit the crime.

436
18:42.382 --> 18:43.215
<v ->Now you don't need to do that.</v>

437
18:43.215 --> 18:44.550
<v ->Now, you don't need to do anything.</v>

438
18:44.550 --> 18:45.390
You can check on the phone.

439
18:45.390 --> 18:47.460
Okay, they just bought their tickets.

440
18:47.460 --> 18:49.410
Okay, what I need to do next?
<v ->That's right.</v>

441
18:49.410 --> 18:50.273
<v ->So we need to become,</v>

442
18:50.273 --> 18:53.070
I think that's where my fourth aspect is becoming

443
18:53.070 --> 18:54.720
at a human level, we need to become

444
18:54.720 --> 18:56.940
more aware of the technology.

445
18:56.940 --> 18:59.970
We need to become aware of how our information can be used.

446
18:59.970 --> 19:02.040
<v ->Our digital footprint.</v>
<v ->And how to digital footprint</v>

447
19:02.040 --> 19:03.690
and bring it down.

448
19:03.690 --> 19:06.330
So that's what I see companies are becoming more,

449
19:06.330 --> 19:07.590
they're investing a lot more

450
19:07.590 --> 19:09.780
in security awareness and training.

451
19:09.780 --> 19:12.060
They are pushing the boards to transition.

452
19:12.060 --> 19:16.080
They are asking cyber leadership to becoming more strategic,

453
19:16.080 --> 19:18.570
and then really investing in talent from AI.

454
19:18.570 --> 19:20.580
So those are the four aspects I will touch on.

455
19:20.580 --> 19:22.320
<v ->And I would like to add to that too,</v>

456
19:22.320 --> 19:24.450
about the kind of people you're looking for

457
19:24.450 --> 19:25.320
to solve these problems.

458
19:25.320 --> 19:26.940
If we know we have the risk with the,

459
19:26.940 --> 19:28.740
the human risk, the human element

460
19:28.740 --> 19:32.550
and the scenario we just played out,

461
19:32.550 --> 19:35.460
why is that public and not private by default?

462
19:35.460 --> 19:38.010
And it goes back to the secure by design discussion

463
19:38.010 --> 19:39.450
and the technology adoption.

464
19:39.450 --> 19:42.120
Like, are we securing that before we adopt it?

465
19:42.120 --> 19:44.190
Or do we adopt it and then scramble

466
19:44.190 --> 19:45.390
to try to figure it out afterwards?

467
19:45.390 --> 19:48.450
So the talent that you need to do that needs to be aligned

468
19:48.450 --> 19:50.550
with the outcome of that secure by design thinking

469
19:50.550 --> 19:53.130
and not defending.

470
19:53.130 --> 19:54.870
<v ->And it's a great point actually,</v>

471
19:54.870 --> 19:56.310
just to add one thing to it,

472
19:56.310 --> 19:58.980
if you look at most of the people,

473
19:58.980 --> 20:02.130
how many people are like in technology company

474
20:02.130 --> 20:06.873
or technology, or how many are financial services and stuff?

475
20:07.740 --> 20:08.573
Not much.

476
20:08.573 --> 20:11.310
Or retail or manufacturing?

477
20:11.310 --> 20:12.143
Yeah.

478
20:14.040 --> 20:16.350
Probably you guys are already seeing a big shift

479
20:16.350 --> 20:19.020
where a lot more technology decision,

480
20:19.020 --> 20:20.400
back to Torrell's point,

481
20:20.400 --> 20:22.470
is getting done at the business level

482
20:22.470 --> 20:25.260
with CIOs are not even involved

483
20:25.260 --> 20:29.010
and they're purchasing these SaaS products like this.

484
20:29.010 --> 20:30.330
I mean, we are working with a company,

485
20:30.330 --> 20:32.430
they have 1,200 of these.

486
20:32.430 --> 20:34.290
And then we go into their Slack,

487
20:34.290 --> 20:37.740
and the Slack is talking to another 500 applications.

488
20:37.740 --> 20:39.720
It's like, do you know where your data is?

489
20:39.720 --> 20:41.040
What you're gonna do?

490
20:41.040 --> 20:42.840
And when you don't know anything,

491
20:42.840 --> 20:44.160
so that's what is happening,

492
20:44.160 --> 20:46.200
the technology is coming so fast.

493
20:46.200 --> 20:47.033
<v Jennifer>Right.</v>

494
20:47.033 --> 20:51.120
<v ->So we need products to become more secure,</v>

495
20:51.120 --> 20:52.350
like security by design,

496
20:52.350 --> 20:55.920
because the business is saying, "I need this tech.

497
20:55.920 --> 20:59.907
I saw CES Conference, I'm gonna bring it in

498
20:59.907 --> 21:01.172
and I'm gonna use it tomorrow morning.

499
21:01.172 --> 21:02.130
(Jennifer laughs)

500
21:02.130 --> 21:04.410
And the CIO was like, "No, no, no, I don't know."

501
21:04.410 --> 21:06.120
I was like, "What do you mean by you don't know?

502
21:06.120 --> 21:07.920
Just sit back." Right?

503
21:07.920 --> 21:10.770
Because you wanna move forward and you want to move fast

504
21:10.770 --> 21:12.390
and there's a competition, the growth.

505
21:12.390 --> 21:15.390
So I think that's where the security by design

506
21:15.390 --> 21:18.240
is gonna become more, I think the seesaw,

507
21:18.240 --> 21:21.180
which is the big, it's not a regulatory body,

508
21:21.180 --> 21:23.250
but Center for Information Security.

509
21:23.250 --> 21:28.140
And they have been pushing for this SBOM,

510
21:28.140 --> 21:29.820
Software Bill of Material,

511
21:29.820 --> 21:33.180
which is you should be able to just like you buy...

512
21:33.180 --> 21:36.900
Actually, my boys also look at the water where it came from,

513
21:36.900 --> 21:38.430
but no.

514
21:38.430 --> 21:40.920
But it's the bill of material on everything software.

515
21:40.920 --> 21:44.520
So you know, how it was tested, how it was coded,

516
21:44.520 --> 21:46.860
how it was set up, how it was done.

517
21:46.860 --> 21:50.100
And if you have that SBOM, that changes the game too.

518
21:50.100 --> 21:52.950
So I think we are gonna see those pressure pretty hard,

519
21:52.950 --> 21:55.410
moving SBOM, security by design,

520
21:55.410 --> 21:58.172
so these products are inherently secured.

521
21:58.172 --> 21:59.850
<v Torrell>Mm-hmm.</v>

522
21:59.850 --> 22:00.840
<v Jennifer>This is fascinating.</v>

523
22:00.840 --> 22:05.190
So at C, how many employees do you need?

524
22:05.190 --> 22:09.570
Or you know, how many do you need?

525
22:09.570 --> 22:11.290
What type of skills do they need?

526
22:11.290 --> 22:12.123
<v Torrell>This is also interesting.</v>

527
22:12.123 --> 22:12.956
<v Jennifer>Do you have lots of open jobs?</v>

528
22:12.956 --> 22:14.080
<v ->Cheryl is gonna take resume on the-</v>

529
22:14.080 --> 22:14.973
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

530
22:15.930 --> 22:20.790
Like, how does it look from your perspective?

531
22:20.790 --> 22:22.050
<v ->This is also a great question</v>

532
22:22.050 --> 22:24.450
because I think it also can be a trap

533
22:24.450 --> 22:26.040
for a lot of security programs

534
22:26.040 --> 22:28.650
because they would make this decree

535
22:28.650 --> 22:33.573
for infinite number of people, resources,

536
22:34.830 --> 22:37.680
but are those resources deployed at the right problem

537
22:37.680 --> 22:38.880
that align to the business?

538
22:38.880 --> 22:43.680
So the first question is kind of what is our mission

539
22:43.680 --> 22:46.140
and why are we doing what we're doing?

540
22:46.140 --> 22:48.450
If we're here to manage and mitigate

541
22:48.450 --> 22:50.460
and kind of de-risk the business strategy

542
22:50.460 --> 22:52.920
and maintain our current operations, and how do we do that?

543
22:52.920 --> 22:56.250
What are those critical processes like solutions to do that?

544
22:56.250 --> 22:57.270
And then this back

545
22:57.270 --> 23:00.210
into kinda who do we need to get that done

546
23:00.210 --> 23:02.160
per that demand?

547
23:02.160 --> 23:07.160
So, for us, I think we are doing a really good job at that.

548
23:08.640 --> 23:10.860
And then you can leverage these emerging technologies

549
23:10.860 --> 23:13.560
with kind of AI and automation to handle

550
23:13.560 --> 23:18.360
kind of the, we call it L1, L1 procedural task.

551
23:18.360 --> 23:21.960
And then raise expectations for the people you do have,

552
23:21.960 --> 23:24.810
if it's more constrained resources

553
23:24.810 --> 23:27.060
to focus on like a much higher-level outcomes

554
23:27.060 --> 23:29.940
versus just tactical day-to-day things, right?

555
23:29.940 --> 23:34.080
So, with the emerging technology kind of coming to fruition,

556
23:34.080 --> 23:39.030
we are able to push some of the tactical day-to-day stuff

557
23:39.030 --> 23:42.450
to the technology, but elevating the people

558
23:42.450 --> 23:43.890
to oversee that technology

559
23:43.890 --> 23:44.907
and then focus on the high-level outcomes.

560
23:44.907 --> 23:47.400
<v Jennifer>And so are you doing,</v>

561
23:47.400 --> 23:50.113
like, are you upskilling and training your people?

562
23:50.113 --> 23:51.330
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

563
23:51.330 --> 23:52.980
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

564
23:52.980 --> 23:53.850
<v Jennifer>And how are you doing that?</v>

565
23:53.850 --> 23:56.800
<v ->So Vishal made a credible point earlier</v>

566
23:57.660 --> 24:02.640
about if you're skating to where the puck is going

567
24:02.640 --> 24:05.910
and the puck is going to, say, cloud computing

568
24:05.910 --> 24:08.460
or quantum computing or whatever, application,

569
24:08.460 --> 24:09.710
whatever you're going to,

570
24:11.220 --> 24:15.000
largely, you're not gonna find analysts

571
24:15.000 --> 24:19.803
right outta undergrad to solve that larger problem.

572
24:21.240 --> 24:22.920
What I do, what I prefer to do

573
24:22.920 --> 24:26.490
is understand people who are already in cloud computing.

574
24:26.490 --> 24:27.720
They may be cloud architects.

575
24:27.720 --> 24:30.450
They may be software reliability engineers.

576
24:30.450 --> 24:31.283
<v Jennifer>Interesting.</v>

577
24:31.283 --> 24:33.300
So the ones who have built it.

578
24:33.300 --> 24:34.867
<v ->Correct.</v>
<v ->Okay.</v>

579
24:34.867 --> 24:36.810
Designed or craft, okay.

580
24:36.810 --> 24:39.660
<v ->If there's an upcoming demand for SBOM, Bill of Materials,</v>

581
24:39.660 --> 24:40.500
how do we get that?

582
24:40.500 --> 24:43.020
Well, that's just technology integration

583
24:43.020 --> 24:46.110
into things that they've already been doing to collect that.

584
24:46.110 --> 24:47.850
So it's more of taking them and re-skilling them

585
24:47.850 --> 24:52.320
and placing their focus and capabilities

586
24:52.320 --> 24:54.600
on security focus like topics.

587
24:54.600 --> 24:59.600
But to do that, I think is you have to build that pathway

588
24:59.940 --> 25:02.220
to make them kind of want to do that

589
25:02.220 --> 25:04.260
and then have some sort of career development.

590
25:04.260 --> 25:05.640
<v Jennifer>So, that's like an investment</v>

591
25:05.640 --> 25:07.050
inside your company.
<v ->Yes.</v>

592
25:07.050 --> 25:10.650
<v ->Like, you know, so making those career pathways</v>

593
25:10.650 --> 25:14.130
and, you know, continuous learning within your company.

594
25:14.130 --> 25:14.974
<v ->Yeah, but it also-</v>

595
25:14.974 --> 25:16.080
<v ->Which takes time and resources.</v>

596
25:16.080 --> 25:17.880
<v ->But also strategically,</v>

597
25:17.880 --> 25:20.610
if your security program is aligned to your company,

598
25:20.610 --> 25:22.470
your company's business, these are the perfect people

599
25:22.470 --> 25:23.597
to pull into your security program

600
25:23.597 --> 25:27.060
'cause they intimately understand the company itself.

601
25:27.060 --> 25:29.280
<v ->And you guys were talking about that</v>

602
25:29.280 --> 25:31.170
before we came here,

603
25:31.170 --> 25:33.660
you know, the importance of the employees

604
25:33.660 --> 25:35.033
understanding the mission.
<v ->Mission correct.</v>

605
25:35.033 --> 25:36.030
<v Jennifer>And the vision.</v>

606
25:36.030 --> 25:38.460
Well, let's talk about that a little bit more.

607
25:38.460 --> 25:42.270
Why does that matter so much?

608
25:42.270 --> 25:44.460
<v ->I think the big part-</v>
<v ->Does it help them</v>

609
25:44.460 --> 25:48.093
identify things more easily, like threats or-

610
25:49.230 --> 25:52.200
<v ->It's definitely, I think it's a multifold</v>

611
25:52.200 --> 25:57.000
because the security is sitting at this silo,

612
25:57.000 --> 25:58.410
to some extent.

613
25:58.410 --> 26:02.040
And I call it we gotta get security

614
26:02.040 --> 26:05.340
to be on the grownup table a lot of time

615
26:05.340 --> 26:09.330
because it's sitting on the side table, the kids' table.

616
26:09.330 --> 26:13.920
And, if they understand the strategy and the mission,

617
26:13.920 --> 26:16.050
then it starts changing the game.

618
26:16.050 --> 26:17.450
I've got a very good friend,

619
26:18.420 --> 26:20.220
she's been CISO for all her life

620
26:20.220 --> 26:22.710
and she's very business-centric.

621
26:22.710 --> 26:24.720
And I asked her, "Why did you became business-centric?"

622
26:24.720 --> 26:28.050
She's like, "I like expensive stuff

623
26:28.050 --> 26:30.378
and I that's why I wanted to get paid more."

624
26:30.378 --> 26:31.211
<v Jennifer>Okay.</v>

625
26:31.211 --> 26:33.270
<v ->"So I started speaking the executive language</v>

626
26:33.270 --> 26:35.460
and that got me to the strategy table."

627
26:35.460 --> 26:37.860
But then her team started becoming,

628
26:37.860 --> 26:39.330
the side effect was

629
26:39.330 --> 26:41.910
the team feels like we are protecting a mission.

630
26:41.910 --> 26:42.743
<v Jennifer>Yes.</v>

631
26:42.743 --> 26:45.570
<v ->So if you are, like we were turn</v>

632
26:45.570 --> 26:46.890
and I were talking a few minutes ago,

633
26:46.890 --> 26:50.610
we were doing some work with the hospital and I'm like,

634
26:50.610 --> 26:52.770
okay, so what exactly are you doing?

635
26:52.770 --> 26:54.510
And what is exactly the...

636
26:54.510 --> 26:56.400
Oh, we are doing this security, this, this, this.

637
26:56.400 --> 26:58.770
I said, "But your CEO wants patient safety."

638
26:58.770 --> 27:00.007
<v Jennifer>That's right.</v>

639
27:00.007 --> 27:01.627
<v ->"So what you're doing for patient safety?"</v>

640
27:01.627 --> 27:03.660
"Oh, we got multifactor authentication."

641
27:03.660 --> 27:05.700
We don't do, no, no, no.

642
27:05.700 --> 27:07.470
Let's go back again.

643
27:07.470 --> 27:09.000
Start from patient safety.

644
27:09.000 --> 27:10.320
So, the challenge was

645
27:10.320 --> 27:12.000
because if you're not mission-oriented,

646
27:12.000 --> 27:14.760
then you're not gonna get the support of the leadership,

647
27:14.760 --> 27:15.727
then they're gonna say,

648
27:15.727 --> 27:18.107
"I gotta just keep moving and I'll deal with it." Right?

649
27:18.107 --> 27:19.860
<v Jennifer>Right, so what it's like moving</v>

650
27:19.860 --> 27:22.620
from just doing a transactional job

651
27:22.620 --> 27:24.120
to serving a higher purpose.

652
27:24.120 --> 27:24.953
<v ->The higher purpose.</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>

653
27:24.953 --> 27:27.273
<v ->And I think to build those skills,</v>

654
27:28.440 --> 27:30.840
back to Torrell, your point, I think

655
27:30.840 --> 27:33.570
it's thinking from that mission.

656
27:33.570 --> 27:36.810
And I think if we do mission-based model

657
27:36.810 --> 27:39.030
and we have seen it, there are models,

658
27:39.030 --> 27:42.060
what I call it skill to risk.

659
27:42.060 --> 27:43.980
So what I call it skill to risk

660
27:43.980 --> 27:46.110
or skill to value kind of model.

661
27:46.110 --> 27:47.910
It's a model which has been used,

662
27:47.910 --> 27:50.130
which some of the companies have started doing

663
27:50.130 --> 27:53.763
because no one is gonna be able to hire talent,

664
27:55.500 --> 27:56.333
what you need.

665
27:56.333 --> 28:00.300
But on the other side, after COVID and working remote,

666
28:00.300 --> 28:01.860
we have ability to hire people,

667
28:01.860 --> 28:03.053
the best people wherever we want.

668
28:03.053 --> 28:05.460
I mean, you can be company in Charlotte

669
28:05.460 --> 28:07.650
and you can have someone working from California

670
28:07.650 --> 28:09.690
and they don't have to be there, right?

671
28:09.690 --> 28:12.600
So skill to risk model, that's what I call it.

672
28:12.600 --> 28:15.873
So if you understand where your biggest risks are,

673
28:16.800 --> 28:19.500
whether it is, hey, I'm a health tech company,

674
28:19.500 --> 28:24.500
and we tell everyone, "Give us your data and trust us."

675
28:26.640 --> 28:29.370
Because people are giving you their data

676
28:29.370 --> 28:31.830
to know all thing about your health

677
28:31.830 --> 28:33.870
and what they care most about.

678
28:33.870 --> 28:35.740
If that data goes out in public and knows everyone-

679
28:35.740 --> 28:38.430
<v Jennifer>Right, so like for example, like an EMR,</v>

680
28:38.430 --> 28:40.110
like an electronic medical record.

681
28:40.110 --> 28:41.940
<v ->Think about like your health tech devices</v>

682
28:41.940 --> 28:42.967
we were talking about, right?
<v ->Yes, we were.</v>

683
28:42.967 --> 28:44.850
<v ->They know your blood pressure,</v>

684
28:44.850 --> 28:48.120
what happens to your blood pressure, what makes you this.

685
28:48.120 --> 28:49.470
You can do anything you want.

686
28:49.470 --> 28:51.480
So people are giving that information

687
28:51.480 --> 28:54.750
because they expect secrecy and trust.

688
28:54.750 --> 28:57.510
That trust is based on keeping its secrecy.

689
28:57.510 --> 29:00.480
So when you drive the skill to risk model is

690
29:00.480 --> 29:01.650
you understand your mission,

691
29:01.650 --> 29:03.060
you understand what your risks are,

692
29:03.060 --> 29:06.030
and you hire to the skills, hire skills

693
29:06.030 --> 29:08.370
which require to manage that risk.

694
29:08.370 --> 29:11.100
And then the lower risk things,

695
29:11.100 --> 29:15.120
you can start looking at talent globally like offshoring,

696
29:15.120 --> 29:16.770
outsourcing, whatever you want to do,

697
29:16.770 --> 29:18.930
and then you can outsource certain things.

698
29:18.930 --> 29:20.700
And what we have seen is the companies

699
29:20.700 --> 29:23.133
who start moving skill to risk model,

700
29:24.240 --> 29:26.310
they train talent better

701
29:26.310 --> 29:28.410
because they are training for a mission,

702
29:28.410 --> 29:31.590
and those people can go into other career fields also,

703
29:31.590 --> 29:34.410
like becoming a CTO and other career path.

704
29:34.410 --> 29:36.390
They are not just-
<v ->Stuck in, yeah.</v>

705
29:36.390 --> 29:38.430
<v ->Just look at protector, protector.</v>

706
29:38.430 --> 29:40.500
I get it. But why?

707
29:40.500 --> 29:42.840
And the second thing we start seeing is actually

708
29:42.840 --> 29:44.700
the talent demand.

709
29:44.700 --> 29:48.390
The talent needed is going down generally

710
29:48.390 --> 29:50.970
goes down by 20 to 30%.

711
29:50.970 --> 29:54.720
So we have seen companies go reduce their talent need by 30%

712
29:54.720 --> 29:57.550
because they are hiring for skill to risk.

713
29:57.550 --> 29:59.820
<v ->Okay.</v>
<v ->And the medium risk one,</v>

714
29:59.820 --> 30:01.200
okay, what I need to do.

715
30:01.200 --> 30:03.150
Okay, I can outsource or something.

716
30:03.150 --> 30:05.790
And this one, that's okay.

717
30:05.790 --> 30:07.110
I understand it's there.

718
30:07.110 --> 30:09.900
I don't need to go manage everything

719
30:09.900 --> 30:11.913
because that risk is so low, who cares?

720
30:11.913 --> 30:13.320
<v Jennifer>Okay.</v>

721
30:13.320 --> 30:16.920
<v ->Versus trying to be like we were working with one client,</v>

722
30:16.920 --> 30:19.677
it's like back to this RiskGPS we were doing.

723
30:19.677 --> 30:22.170
And like, but can you find out if anyone,

724
30:22.170 --> 30:23.910
one of my servers is patched?

725
30:23.910 --> 30:26.760
I'm like, what is on that server is more important

726
30:26.760 --> 30:29.040
before you worry about whether that server,

727
30:29.040 --> 30:30.540
that machine is patched or not.

728
30:30.540 --> 30:32.610
<v Jennifer>Okay. Was there vital information on it?</v>

729
30:32.610 --> 30:34.050
<v ->Yeah, if you don't.</v>

730
30:34.050 --> 30:36.240
So firstly, understanding the skill to risk

731
30:36.240 --> 30:38.280
is firstly understand where my risk is,

732
30:38.280 --> 30:40.170
what the ecosystem I need to protect,

733
30:40.170 --> 30:41.970
what mission I need to protect,

734
30:41.970 --> 30:45.150
and then creating job description based on that,

735
30:45.150 --> 30:47.070
and then hiring the talent,

736
30:47.070 --> 30:49.290
that starts the strategy from top down.

737
30:49.290 --> 30:51.660
<v ->I love that kind of motto.</v>

738
30:51.660 --> 30:53.310
And as you were talking, I was kind of categorizing,

739
30:53.310 --> 30:54.233
it's like three different sectors, right?

740
30:54.233 --> 30:55.066
<v ->Yeah.</v>

741
30:55.066 --> 30:59.820
<v ->The skill to risk and to summarize the first group</v>

742
30:59.820 --> 31:01.800
of like highly skilled people.

743
31:01.800 --> 31:03.540
The thing that highly skilled people love the most

744
31:03.540 --> 31:05.667
is purpose, right?
<v ->Yeah.</v>

745
31:05.667 --> 31:07.920
<v ->And if your strategy is aligned to the business,</v>

746
31:07.920 --> 31:09.570
it gives them a vision and a purpose

747
31:09.570 --> 31:11.187
for why they're doing what they're doing.

748
31:11.187 --> 31:13.830
And that medium tier is your partner collaboration.

749
31:13.830 --> 31:14.700
Like who are your partners

750
31:14.700 --> 31:17.026
that help you solve those medium risk?

751
31:17.026 --> 31:19.860
And then below that, your AI and automation, right?

752
31:19.860 --> 31:21.630
So I love that.

753
31:21.630 --> 31:23.583
<v ->I like that phrase too.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

754
31:23.583 --> 31:24.750
<v Jennifer>Like I'm always amazed</v>

755
31:24.750 --> 31:26.033
how the time goes by so quickly.

756
31:26.033 --> 31:27.660
<v ->Wow.</v>
<v ->So we have nine minutes.</v>

757
31:27.660 --> 31:29.537
And I do wanna take a few questions, if there are.

758
31:29.537 --> 31:30.810
<v ->Sure.</v>

759
31:30.810 --> 31:34.770
<v ->Let's talk about the entry level and like talent</v>

760
31:34.770 --> 31:36.150
that's coming in.

761
31:36.150 --> 31:39.450
In Northern Virginia, just by way of background,

762
31:39.450 --> 31:41.640
George Mason University is the largest university

763
31:41.640 --> 31:43.920
in our state, and they were the first in our state

764
31:43.920 --> 31:46.740
to have a cybersecurity degree.

765
31:46.740 --> 31:48.210
Am I right on that?
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

766
31:48.210 --> 31:49.043
<v ->Yeah.</v>

767
31:49.043 --> 31:50.850
And so in our region,

768
31:50.850 --> 31:51.960
because of the collaboration

769
31:51.960 --> 31:54.810
with a lot of our government agencies,

770
31:54.810 --> 31:58.980
there's been a need to have this curriculum.

771
31:58.980 --> 32:00.810
And I think the school graduates

772
32:00.810 --> 32:02.360
a few thousand students a year.

773
32:05.010 --> 32:09.120
How can we get more students to,

774
32:09.120 --> 32:14.120
you know, pursue a degree in cyber

775
32:14.130 --> 32:19.130
or, you know, pursue an apprenticeship in cyber?

776
32:19.620 --> 32:22.290
Do you think that we should have increased awareness

777
32:22.290 --> 32:25.020
about this career path?
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

778
32:25.020 --> 32:27.753
<v ->We have a need for more people to study it, right?</v>

779
32:27.753 --> 32:30.180
<v ->Yeah, I think it's absolutely needed.</v>

780
32:30.180 --> 32:33.030
And I agree with what you're saying.

781
32:33.030 --> 32:36.750
I would say not because we are associated with you

782
32:36.750 --> 32:38.220
in Northern Virginia Techno,

783
32:38.220 --> 32:40.020
but I think what we are in Northern Virginia,

784
32:40.020 --> 32:41.700
we need to do more in other states.

785
32:41.700 --> 32:42.533
<v ->Yes.</v>

786
32:42.533 --> 32:44.040
<v ->Because you have created a collaboration</v>

787
32:44.040 --> 32:47.640
between industry and the academia.

788
32:47.640 --> 32:48.473
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->Right?</v>

789
32:48.473 --> 32:51.000
So that's the number one important aspect.

790
32:51.000 --> 32:53.040
The third big collaboration is you gotta bring

791
32:53.040 --> 32:54.420
the government into it

792
32:54.420 --> 32:58.470
because there have a lot of demand,

793
32:58.470 --> 33:01.440
but there are also a lot of things which are happening,

794
33:01.440 --> 33:03.780
which they can motivate in terms of how government

795
33:03.780 --> 33:06.810
is trying to dive into the school education system.

796
33:06.810 --> 33:08.251
So we are still doing George Mason,

797
33:08.251 --> 33:10.380
and I wanna go back to schools actually.

798
33:10.380 --> 33:14.370
So, when I was building, this is for Deloitte,

799
33:14.370 --> 33:16.560
I was building their offshore,

800
33:16.560 --> 33:20.250
their delivery capability centers around the world.

801
33:20.250 --> 33:22.687
We used to hire people and someone will come,

802
33:22.687 --> 33:26.190
"Oh, I just do IBM, XYZ product."

803
33:26.190 --> 33:28.170
And you, so, "No, no.

804
33:28.170 --> 33:30.480
Tomorrow we are gonna work with this product

805
33:30.480 --> 33:33.720
and I will put them in the team and four weeks later,

806
33:33.720 --> 33:35.630
they are back to IBM XYZ.

807
33:35.630 --> 33:36.937
So I started saying like,

808
33:36.937 --> 33:39.960
"Okay, I got a lot of people who are like a,

809
33:39.960 --> 33:42.120
they adjust their hammer for a nail.

810
33:42.120 --> 33:43.830
And if it's a three-inch nail,

811
33:43.830 --> 33:45.810
then they don't know what to do with it.

812
33:45.810 --> 33:47.490
<v ->Okay.</v>
<v ->How we shifted</v>

813
33:47.490 --> 33:49.770
and what we did was exactly what you talked about.

814
33:49.770 --> 33:54.120
We shifted everything to bring people from campus,

815
33:54.120 --> 33:57.660
and then have a very structured hands-on training program

816
33:57.660 --> 33:59.283
for six weeks, like a bootcamp.

817
34:00.480 --> 34:02.100
You put them through the process

818
34:02.100 --> 34:05.370
and work through their model, put them into the training,

819
34:05.370 --> 34:07.320
and when they come out,

820
34:07.320 --> 34:09.660
they understand a lot more about cyber.

821
34:09.660 --> 34:11.040
And then what I call it,

822
34:11.040 --> 34:15.270
it's more like a hourglass kind of a career model.

823
34:15.270 --> 34:18.870
Don't start with getting into the swim lane quickly,

824
34:18.870 --> 34:22.740
but start broad and then slowly you learn everything

825
34:22.740 --> 34:24.780
and then you become more mission-oriented,

826
34:24.780 --> 34:27.750
you understand the risk, you understand criminal behavior,

827
34:27.750 --> 34:30.367
criminal thinking versus saying,

828
34:30.367 --> 34:32.520
"I understand how to find hacker."

829
34:32.520 --> 34:34.777
Okay, what are you gonna do after that?

830
34:34.777 --> 34:37.418
"I don't know. That team.

831
34:37.418 --> 34:38.607
<v ->Okay.</v>

832
34:38.607 --> 34:39.780
<v ->No, you gotta understand.</v>

833
34:39.780 --> 34:42.480
So I think we are seeing that model

834
34:42.480 --> 34:43.830
played out in Northern Virginia.

835
34:43.830 --> 34:46.410
And actually there are about two countries

836
34:46.410 --> 34:48.780
and I'm connected with one.

837
34:48.780 --> 34:53.010
Israel, I do work with a lot of their cyber product too.

838
34:53.010 --> 34:54.630
Israel and Estonia.

839
34:54.630 --> 34:56.040
Those are two countries actually

840
34:56.040 --> 35:00.900
who are famous for building cyber talent from ground up.

841
35:00.900 --> 35:01.770
<v ->Really?</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

842
35:01.770 --> 35:04.260
They have built that model very unique.

843
35:04.260 --> 35:06.180
And it's basically exactly on those.

844
35:06.180 --> 35:08.330
They have a...

845
35:09.450 --> 35:11.460
Educate all the way from school time,

846
35:11.460 --> 35:13.050
all the way to the college,

847
35:13.050 --> 35:15.630
cyber is part of the curriculum, basic education

848
35:15.630 --> 35:17.040
and then you go deep.

849
35:17.040 --> 35:19.110
Very strong cross collaboration

850
35:19.110 --> 35:21.030
between the government, academia

851
35:21.030 --> 35:24.600
and industry councils like NVTC,

852
35:24.600 --> 35:28.620
and then lot more investment on hands-on training.

853
35:28.620 --> 35:31.680
You look at most of the cyber product companies

854
35:31.680 --> 35:34.500
from Israel, a lot of those people actually work

855
35:34.500 --> 35:35.862
in Israel Army.

856
35:35.862 --> 35:36.703
<v ->Okay, okay.</v>

857
35:36.703 --> 35:39.420
<v ->Most of these CISOs work from there.</v>

858
35:39.420 --> 35:40.410
And even on our side,

859
35:40.410 --> 35:42.577
if you look at some of the phenomenal companies,

860
35:42.577 --> 35:44.100
I think you and I were talking about,

861
35:44.100 --> 35:47.670
like CrowdStrike and MiniAn,

862
35:47.670 --> 35:49.260
these companies were started by people

863
35:49.260 --> 35:51.990
who came from that mission thinking of how to deal with it,

864
35:51.990 --> 35:54.780
so that's why they, they moved so fast

865
35:54.780 --> 35:55.770
because they're trying to deal.

866
35:55.770 --> 35:58.200
So I think that's the collaborate hands-on training.

867
35:58.200 --> 35:59.490
So I think those three aspect

868
35:59.490 --> 36:03.160
of cross collaboration, education

869
36:04.439 --> 36:07.230
and then last one I would say is constantly upskilling

870
36:07.230 --> 36:11.190
because if we depend too much on AI, that is the challenge,

871
36:11.190 --> 36:12.030
we are gonna get it.

872
36:12.030 --> 36:13.650
Oh, AI will figure it out.

873
36:13.650 --> 36:14.760
I can do this.

874
36:14.760 --> 36:17.940
Pretty soon, we're gonna be like, okay.

875
36:17.940 --> 36:22.940
But the AI is what I call, it's a very deterministic model.

876
36:22.980 --> 36:25.260
You do A plus B equal to C.

877
36:25.260 --> 36:27.720
The criminal operate on a probabilistic model.

878
36:27.720 --> 36:29.430
Okay, what is the probability this person

879
36:29.430 --> 36:31.320
is not gonna watch this so I go attack them?

880
36:31.320 --> 36:32.153
<v Jennifer>Right.</v>

881
36:32.153 --> 36:33.720
<v ->So we need that critical thinking</v>

882
36:33.720 --> 36:35.850
and stuff into the model.
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

883
36:35.850 --> 36:36.683
Good, good.

884
36:37.650 --> 36:40.470
All right, are there any questions from the audience?

885
36:40.470 --> 36:42.070
Feel free to come up to the mic.

886
36:43.980 --> 36:45.570
<v Participant>So a more basic question,</v>

887
36:45.570 --> 36:48.120
just is there enough technology people

888
36:48.120 --> 36:49.920
to fill all the roles?

889
36:49.920 --> 36:53.280
Or is it a question of people

890
36:53.280 --> 36:55.740
just don't wanna do cybersecurity work?

891
36:55.740 --> 36:57.720
So I'm an IP and IT council.

892
36:57.720 --> 37:02.340
So from the IP side, I've noticed I've lost a lot of people.

893
37:02.340 --> 37:03.540
Well, I don't say I personally,

894
37:03.540 --> 37:05.790
but the industry has lost a lot of people

895
37:05.790 --> 37:09.120
where traditionally if you didn't wanna work in research

896
37:09.120 --> 37:13.140
or industry, patents were like a side branch.

897
37:13.140 --> 37:14.520
But now we're losing a lot of people

898
37:14.520 --> 37:17.340
to private equity and venture capitalists

899
37:17.340 --> 37:18.990
because they're using those skills.

900
37:18.990 --> 37:21.000
It's very valuable for those guys.

901
37:21.000 --> 37:23.940
And so, we're seeing a shift from,

902
37:23.940 --> 37:25.830
instead of just being a patent attorney,

903
37:25.830 --> 37:27.990
it's like, okay, I could be working venture capital

904
37:27.990 --> 37:29.100
or I could be a patent attorney,

905
37:29.100 --> 37:31.671
and so you've cut down the pool of people by 50%.

906
37:31.671 --> 37:32.504
<v ->Wow.</v>

907
37:32.504 --> 37:34.530
<v Participant>So I'm just throwing numbers out there,</v>

908
37:34.530 --> 37:37.770
but are you seeing something similar in your profession

909
37:37.770 --> 37:40.290
that either people are being shunted off

910
37:40.290 --> 37:41.130
to different professions

911
37:41.130 --> 37:43.770
or they don't wanna do cybersecurity work?

912
37:43.770 --> 37:45.840
<v ->I have an opinion, but I'll let Torrell start with that.</v>

913
37:45.840 --> 37:49.890
<v ->Honestly, because I think that's like a, I don't know,</v>

914
37:49.890 --> 37:51.723
a complex question.

915
37:52.740 --> 37:55.800
So I think the people that are very successful

916
37:55.800 --> 37:56.790
in cybersecurity

917
37:56.790 --> 37:59.610
are normally those high agency IT professionals.

918
37:59.610 --> 38:03.690
But what comes with that is like a seven-post accountability

919
38:03.690 --> 38:06.600
that makes them susceptible to burnout, right?

920
38:06.600 --> 38:09.120
So you have really good people that come into cybersecurity

921
38:09.120 --> 38:10.623
that kind of burn out.

922
38:11.790 --> 38:15.543
But to directly answer your question,

923
38:19.982 --> 38:22.370
I think that if we changed the problem

924
38:24.120 --> 38:26.310
from a cybersecurity technology problem

925
38:26.310 --> 38:28.560
to like an innovation problem,

926
38:28.560 --> 38:31.530
I think we have better candidates of selling the innovation

927
38:31.530 --> 38:33.270
and opportunity to innovate and solve

928
38:33.270 --> 38:35.460
and within a very dynamic space.

929
38:35.460 --> 38:37.350
I think it solves that problem.

930
38:37.350 --> 38:39.630
I think if we try to scope it to cybersecurity,

931
38:39.630 --> 38:41.820
you run into that problem, but-

932
38:41.820 --> 38:44.040
<v ->So position the career-</v>
<v ->As innovative.</v>

933
38:44.040 --> 38:46.680
<v ->As one that's innovative and solving problems</v>

934
38:46.680 --> 38:50.040
and evolving, and it has a creative aspect to it.

935
38:50.040 --> 38:51.150
<v ->Correct, yeah, correct.</v>

936
38:51.150 --> 38:53.430
<v ->Yeah, but I mean, from what I'm reading, what I see,</v>

937
38:53.430 --> 38:55.590
we don't have enough workers.

938
38:55.590 --> 38:59.283
So there's so many strategies to attack that.

939
39:00.270 --> 39:04.530
And in our region, there's many approaches,

940
39:04.530 --> 39:08.760
but is getting industry and government

941
39:08.760 --> 39:11.070
involved with the academic aspect?

942
39:11.070 --> 39:14.370
But then also, we have to start in high school.

943
39:14.370 --> 39:17.310
And like what we do as a tech council,

944
39:17.310 --> 39:20.520
we work with our regional school districts

945
39:20.520 --> 39:23.490
and we have career exploration days.

946
39:23.490 --> 39:25.950
We bring the students to the offices,

947
39:25.950 --> 39:30.950
we bring some of the staff to the classrooms,

948
39:31.320 --> 39:34.684
so that they understand that these careers are available.

949
39:34.684 --> 39:35.670
<v ->Yeah.</v>

950
39:35.670 --> 39:39.540
<v ->So, it's a challenge,</v>

951
39:39.540 --> 39:43.020
but we have to encourage more kids to pursue,

952
39:43.020 --> 39:44.460
you know, jobs in tech.

953
39:44.460 --> 39:46.410
So anyway, go ahead.

954
39:46.410 --> 39:47.700
<v Participant>I have a question.</v>

955
39:47.700 --> 39:50.040
At Internet 2.0, Michael Kove had mentioned

956
39:50.040 --> 39:54.300
in a conversation with Microsoft that due generative AI,

957
39:54.300 --> 39:57.480
85% of the software engineers were no longer required.

958
39:57.480 --> 40:00.000
So my suggestion or question is,

959
40:00.000 --> 40:02.820
are you looking to leverage all of those engineers

960
40:02.820 --> 40:05.130
losing their jobs to copilot,

961
40:05.130 --> 40:07.740
to turn them into security professionals.

962
40:07.740 --> 40:09.900
Because that would be phenomenal.

963
40:09.900 --> 40:11.220
<v ->I don't know if they will lose the job.</v>

964
40:11.220 --> 40:15.483
I still don't believe it because I think we are,

965
40:16.588 --> 40:18.870
with a bunch of people, I'm sure in this room,

966
40:18.870 --> 40:21.063
where we have seen the dot-com days, right?

967
40:22.050 --> 40:26.130
It took 7, 8, 10 years before we realized the power of it

968
40:26.130 --> 40:27.780
and then we needed all those skills.

969
40:27.780 --> 40:31.290
I think we are with AI like version 0.1 or 0.5,

970
40:31.290 --> 40:32.640
whatever you wanna call it.

971
40:32.640 --> 40:33.990
We don't even know where it is gonna go.

972
40:33.990 --> 40:36.270
So it's gonna take more people

973
40:36.270 --> 40:38.670
with a lot of critical thinking skills.

974
40:38.670 --> 40:41.640
And I think that's where, back to when Torrell was saying

975
40:41.640 --> 40:45.750
that the security by design.

976
40:45.750 --> 40:48.240
So we're gonna see, I completely agree with you.

977
40:48.240 --> 40:51.870
In my view, even one of the reason

978
40:51.870 --> 40:55.650
when I moved out of my big four and building my company,

979
40:55.650 --> 41:00.480
I bring, I've got software developers, engineer, consultant,

980
41:00.480 --> 41:01.950
and someone who has been in industry,

981
41:01.950 --> 41:04.560
all four just attacking one single problem.

982
41:04.560 --> 41:07.500
And you will always find much better solution

983
41:07.500 --> 41:09.740
when you have the diversity of skillset.

984
41:09.740 --> 41:10.890
So I completely agree with you.

985
41:10.890 --> 41:13.770
The more diverse skillset we bring,

986
41:13.770 --> 41:15.120
we are gonna be much better

987
41:15.120 --> 41:18.000
because the hackers do the same thing, right?

988
41:18.000 --> 41:22.290
I call it, I do a talk "Thinking Like a Criminal,"

989
41:22.290 --> 41:24.660
but I use actually how many,

990
41:24.660 --> 41:26.850
I'm sure "Ocean's Eleven" movie.

991
41:26.850 --> 41:28.860
I use that as a framework.

992
41:28.860 --> 41:30.960
And we have analyzed that framework.

993
41:30.960 --> 41:34.162
It did not require one person, it required 11,

994
41:34.162 --> 41:39.162
and those 11 had 11 unique skills to make that crime happen.

995
41:39.960 --> 41:43.860
And so same way, we need to be thinking on the other side is

996
41:43.860 --> 41:45.780
where I need to bring developer engineer.

997
41:45.780 --> 41:47.940
And back to your point and what you were saying,

998
41:47.940 --> 41:51.360
that will also create very interesting career models

999
41:51.360 --> 41:53.190
because then you don't have to remain

1000
41:53.190 --> 41:54.900
just in a cyber field over time.

1001
41:54.900 --> 41:56.760
You may go become a CTO.

1002
41:56.760 --> 41:58.380
You may go become a product lead

1003
41:58.380 --> 42:01.680
because you understand how things are built from bottom up.

1004
42:01.680 --> 42:02.513
So I agree with you.

1005
42:02.513 --> 42:04.260
I think more engineers we can bring in,

1006
42:04.260 --> 42:06.780
but statistically the numbers are anywhere from like,

1007
42:06.780 --> 42:09.720
I think what Jen mentioned earlier, like half a million

1008
42:09.720 --> 42:12.780
to a couple of million people shortage.

1009
42:12.780 --> 42:13.650
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Great point.</v>

1010
42:13.650 --> 42:14.730
<v Torrell>Yeah, if this does happen,</v>

1011
42:14.730 --> 42:17.310
I would definitely welcome it.
(all laugh)

1012
42:17.310 --> 42:18.387
<v Jennifer>Yeah.</v>

1013
42:18.387 --> 42:19.620
<v Crew>No, actually.</v>

1014
42:19.620 --> 42:20.907
<v Jennifer>Can we take one more question?</v>

1015
42:20.907 --> 42:21.740
<v ->No.</v>
<v ->No?</v>

1016
42:21.740 --> 42:24.900
Okay. Well, thank you all for being here with us

1017
42:24.900 --> 42:27.870
and I hope you enjoyed the last two days of CES,

1018
42:27.870 --> 42:28.703
day and a half.

1019
42:28.703 --> 42:31.246
(upbeat music)
