00:00.387 --> 00:02.970
(bright music)

2
00:10.830 --> 00:11.820
<v ->Welcome everyone.</v>

3
00:11.820 --> 00:12.653
I'm Mike Bergman,

4
00:12.653 --> 00:15.210
I'm Vice President of Technology and Standards

5
00:15.210 --> 00:18.450
for the Consumer Technology Association,

6
00:18.450 --> 00:20.220
owner and producer of CES.

7
00:20.220 --> 00:23.640
Welcome to this amazing event this week

8
00:23.640 --> 00:28.260
and to a session devoted to something else amazing

9
00:28.260 --> 00:31.443
that's been going on, the United States Cyber Trust Mark.

10
00:32.430 --> 00:33.900
It's my distinct pleasure

11
00:33.900 --> 00:36.780
to welcome White House Deputy National Security Advisor

12
00:36.780 --> 00:41.040
for Cyber and Emerging Technologies, Anne Neuberger today.

13
00:41.040 --> 00:43.890
I'm also delighted to be able to welcome

14
00:43.890 --> 00:46.620
the Federal Communications Commission Chairwoman,

15
00:46.620 --> 00:47.943
Jessica Rosenworcel.

16
00:49.140 --> 00:51.000
I'd also like to welcome the newly announced

17
00:51.000 --> 00:54.930
lead administrator for the US Cyber Trust Mark US Solutions

18
00:54.930 --> 00:57.270
represented by Global Vice President

19
00:57.270 --> 01:00.960
and General Manager, Identity Management and Security,

20
01:00.960 --> 01:02.163
Chante Maurio.

21
01:03.120 --> 01:04.743
Best Buy Senior Director,

22
01:05.583 --> 01:09.990
Head of Enterprise Privacy and Data Protection,

23
01:09.990 --> 01:11.760
Michael Dolan is here

24
01:11.760 --> 01:14.580
as is Amazon Vice President Steve Downer,

25
01:14.580 --> 01:17.580
and they're also here to speak about this important program.

26
01:18.660 --> 01:22.410
We will have a panel following some opening remarks

27
01:22.410 --> 01:25.230
with subject matter experts on this program.

28
01:25.230 --> 01:28.683
But first ladies and gentlemen, Anne Neuberger.

29
01:29.789 --> 01:32.956
(audience applauding)

30
01:38.070 --> 01:39.720
<v ->Hi everyone.</v>

31
01:39.720 --> 01:40.553
Good morning.

32
01:40.553 --> 01:42.300
It's really great to be here with everyone

33
01:42.300 --> 01:43.680
and to talk about this program

34
01:43.680 --> 01:46.680
with key partners in this program.

35
01:46.680 --> 01:48.600
So first, connected devices bring

36
01:48.600 --> 01:49.920
so much value to our lives.

37
01:49.920 --> 01:52.260
You just have to walk around the CES floor

38
01:52.260 --> 01:55.110
and you see everybody's eyes light up as they think about,

39
01:55.110 --> 01:58.380
oh, that cool connected device, whether it's a connect,

40
01:58.380 --> 02:00.690
whether it's large or whether it's small,

41
02:00.690 --> 02:02.820
whether it's a personal device

42
02:02.820 --> 02:06.630
or a large scale commercial environment.

43
02:06.630 --> 02:09.360
And as we think about the value connected devices

44
02:09.360 --> 02:12.390
bring into our homes from a national security space,

45
02:12.390 --> 02:14.610
you know, we look at the threats, we look at the risks

46
02:14.610 --> 02:17.640
and those threats and risks come both from countries.

47
02:17.640 --> 02:19.710
We know, for example, China has a well-resourced,

48
02:19.710 --> 02:21.690
sophisticated offensive cyber programs

49
02:21.690 --> 02:23.340
and it comes from criminals.

50
02:23.340 --> 02:24.540
And we see the impact

51
02:24.540 --> 02:27.600
of criminal cyber attacks on hospitals in the country

52
02:27.600 --> 02:31.830
and on connected devices across hospitals as a good example.

53
02:31.830 --> 02:34.680
So as we think about how to give American consumers,

54
02:34.680 --> 02:36.104
consumers around the world,

55
02:36.104 --> 02:38.520
but this is a program focused first on American consumers,

56
02:38.520 --> 02:40.650
the confidence know they can bring all kinds

57
02:40.650 --> 02:43.680
of connected devices into their homes commercially into

58
02:43.680 --> 02:46.710
companies knowing that those risks from countries,

59
02:46.710 --> 02:49.950
adversarial countries or criminals can be managed.

60
02:49.950 --> 02:52.170
That is where US Cyber Trust Mark comes in

61
02:52.170 --> 02:55.500
and it connects consumers who want to buy secure

62
02:55.500 --> 02:57.510
because they love the tech and they wanna feel there.

63
02:57.510 --> 03:00.120
It can protect their privacy, it can protect their data

64
03:00.120 --> 03:02.760
with companies who know that they want

65
03:02.760 --> 03:05.280
to deliver a more cyber secure product,

66
03:05.280 --> 03:06.870
but they want a way to show consumers

67
03:06.870 --> 03:08.400
that they've done the effort, they've done this,

68
03:08.400 --> 03:10.530
it's been tested, and the US government,

69
03:10.530 --> 03:12.390
which wants to keep consumers safe

70
03:12.390 --> 03:15.600
and wants to ensure innovation can be a part of our lives.

71
03:15.600 --> 03:17.640
So Cyber Trust Mark connects the three of those.

72
03:17.640 --> 03:19.620
Any companies whose products meet

73
03:19.620 --> 03:22.680
the National Institute for Standard standard

74
03:22.680 --> 03:25.560
and are tested to it can bear the government label,

75
03:25.560 --> 03:28.620
and we're really thrilled to have Best Buy and Amazon here

76
03:28.620 --> 03:32.010
to help us with the consumer education part of that.

77
03:32.010 --> 03:33.810
A final comment, it's particularly exciting

78
03:33.810 --> 03:35.610
to have US solutions selected

79
03:35.610 --> 03:37.320
as the lead administrator first

80
03:37.320 --> 03:40.950
because of the name recognition, the Trust UL Solutions has

81
03:40.950 --> 03:42.930
because of the work you're already doing

82
03:42.930 --> 03:44.880
and testing devices for.

83
03:44.880 --> 03:47.640
So we want to leverage that as much as possible to jumpstart

84
03:47.640 --> 03:50.490
and rapidly bring labeled products to the market.

85
03:50.490 --> 03:52.080
And because it fills that key loop

86
03:52.080 --> 03:53.400
and tie between government

87
03:53.400 --> 03:56.880
and the private sector, a huge thank you in closing

88
03:56.880 --> 04:00.600
to FCC commission chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel

89
04:00.600 --> 04:02.250
for her leadership throughout this program

90
04:02.250 --> 04:05.580
and really the team across the FCC, across NIST

91
04:05.580 --> 04:07.440
and across the White House who've worked

92
04:07.440 --> 04:10.680
for the last two years to bring this into fruition.

93
04:10.680 --> 04:13.530
So with thanks to everybody who is speaking today,

94
04:13.530 --> 04:16.020
I want to turn it over to FCC chairwoman,

95
04:16.020 --> 04:17.681
Jessica Rosenworcel.

96
04:17.681 --> 04:20.848
(audience applauding)

97
04:29.010 --> 04:32.100
<v ->Thank you so much Anne, and good morning.</v>

98
04:32.100 --> 04:33.450
It is so terrific

99
04:33.450 --> 04:37.680
to be here at the Premier Consumer Technology Showcase.

100
04:37.680 --> 04:40.110
I'm sure all of you have had the opportunity to walk around

101
04:40.110 --> 04:42.660
on the floor and you saw just what Anne described,

102
04:42.660 --> 04:46.080
connected devices everywhere.

103
04:46.080 --> 04:48.870
Those devices bring all kinds of conveniences

104
04:48.870 --> 04:51.000
to our daily lives,

105
04:51.000 --> 04:55.050
but they also introduce all kinds of cyber vulnerabilities

106
04:55.050 --> 04:56.910
and that's what we're here to talk about today

107
04:56.910 --> 04:59.100
with the US Cyber Trust Mark.

108
04:59.100 --> 05:01.110
And when I talk about these issues, I always like

109
05:01.110 --> 05:03.630
to tell this story from a writer

110
05:03.630 --> 05:06.960
who wrote about cyber crime named Misha Glenn

111
05:06.960 --> 05:09.243
and Misha Glenn writes about a bank,

112
05:10.200 --> 05:13.350
and this was a bank that had spared no expense

113
05:13.350 --> 05:14.970
when it came to cybersecurity

114
05:14.970 --> 05:17.070
because of course they're dealing day to day

115
05:17.070 --> 05:21.330
with the transfer of funds and security means all.

116
05:21.330 --> 05:23.850
So they had spent lots of money on their networks,

117
05:23.850 --> 05:28.020
on their systems with risk assessment and risk management.

118
05:28.020 --> 05:29.940
They had a lot of confidence

119
05:29.940 --> 05:33.300
that every fund transfer at their institution

120
05:33.300 --> 05:34.353
would be secure.

121
05:35.250 --> 05:37.833
But of course pride often comes before the fall.

122
05:38.760 --> 05:40.500
And it didn't take very long for a hacker

123
05:40.500 --> 05:43.250
to find their way into this bank and into this network,

124
05:44.100 --> 05:45.240
and it didn't move through any

125
05:45.240 --> 05:48.090
of those fancy systems they had put in place.

126
05:48.090 --> 05:50.523
Instead, they found a vending machine,

127
05:51.480 --> 05:54.840
like with chips and chocolate.

128
05:54.840 --> 05:56.820
You know, the one where you go in mid-afternoon,

129
05:56.820 --> 05:58.800
because you need a little salt or sugar

130
05:58.800 --> 06:01.620
to keep yourself going as an employee.

131
06:01.620 --> 06:04.060
Well, that vending machine had an IP address

132
06:05.340 --> 06:07.800
and that IP address was not on their regular system

133
06:07.800 --> 06:11.040
for updates for patches.

134
06:11.040 --> 06:12.720
And I think that story is such a good one

135
06:12.720 --> 06:16.020
because it reminds us that there is so much in our lives

136
06:16.020 --> 06:19.050
that is connected, the things we think about

137
06:19.050 --> 06:21.480
and the things we don't think about

138
06:21.480 --> 06:24.240
and the vulnerabilities are only gonna expand

139
06:24.240 --> 06:27.750
as we expand the number of connected things.

140
06:27.750 --> 06:30.900
Right now, we've got about 18 billion internet of things

141
06:30.900 --> 06:32.160
devices in the world.

142
06:32.160 --> 06:35.433
There's gonna be 25 billion by the end of the decade.

143
06:36.330 --> 06:38.460
All those devices you see on the floor, they're growing,

144
06:38.460 --> 06:40.080
they're expanding rapidly.

145
06:40.080 --> 06:42.150
So we've gotta expand our efforts to make sure

146
06:42.150 --> 06:45.690
that every one of those connections is secure.

147
06:45.690 --> 06:46.980
Whatever you bring into your homes

148
06:46.980 --> 06:48.510
and whatever you bring into your businesses

149
06:48.510 --> 06:50.070
should be secure.

150
06:50.070 --> 06:53.043
I mean, just imagine you're shopping for a baby monitor.

151
06:53.880 --> 06:55.650
When you bring that device into your home,

152
06:55.650 --> 06:58.230
you wanna know it's not inviting malware

153
06:58.230 --> 07:02.310
or someone monitoring what you're doing in your house.

154
07:02.310 --> 07:04.890
How can we make it possible for consumers

155
07:04.890 --> 07:07.050
and businesses to have that security?

156
07:07.050 --> 07:09.690
And that's what the US Cyber Trust Mark is all about,

157
07:09.690 --> 07:11.430
which is getting going right now.

158
07:11.430 --> 07:12.690
And I appreciate the work

159
07:12.690 --> 07:14.610
that we've done across the administration

160
07:14.610 --> 07:17.340
and with the private sector to make this happen.

161
07:17.340 --> 07:20.010
It started back in 2022 when we went to the White House

162
07:20.010 --> 07:22.077
and we all gathered and talked about these issues

163
07:22.077 --> 07:23.670
and I went back to the FCC

164
07:23.670 --> 07:26.550
and said, we've been doing this for a long time.

165
07:26.550 --> 07:30.000
We've been setting up relationships with the private sector

166
07:30.000 --> 07:33.630
to make sure that radio frequency devices are secure.

167
07:33.630 --> 07:37.140
We can do more using those relationships

168
07:37.140 --> 07:39.180
and develop the Cyber Trust Mark.

169
07:39.180 --> 07:42.180
So I really want to thank UL Solutions for stepping up

170
07:42.180 --> 07:45.480
to be the administrator of this Cyber Trust Mark.

171
07:45.480 --> 07:47.430
And what we're aiming for is something akin

172
07:47.430 --> 07:50.610
to the Energy Star logo, which you might know

173
07:50.610 --> 07:52.380
because when you buy a washer or dryer,

174
07:52.380 --> 07:54.600
if you look for that logo, you know that

175
07:54.600 --> 07:59.370
that is an environmentally safe product to purchase.

176
07:59.370 --> 08:02.130
Our goal is to make the US Cyber Trust Mark similar.

177
08:02.130 --> 08:04.470
So when you bring all those Internet of Things devices

178
08:04.470 --> 08:06.870
into your house, you can look for

179
08:06.870 --> 08:08.760
that logo and have confidence.

180
08:08.760 --> 08:10.590
And the more companies that wanna use it,

181
08:10.590 --> 08:12.930
the more consumers are gonna wanna request it.

182
08:12.930 --> 08:15.840
And we're gonna have a virtuous cycle that makes more

183
08:15.840 --> 08:18.039
of these Internet of Things devices

184
08:18.039 --> 08:19.440
more safe and more secure.

185
08:19.440 --> 08:23.880
This is not a small task, but it's worth the effort

186
08:23.880 --> 08:25.890
because if we do this,

187
08:25.890 --> 08:28.800
we are gonna have innovation opportunities like the ones

188
08:28.800 --> 08:31.080
you see on the floor here that are gonna be expand

189
08:31.080 --> 08:32.850
and we are gonna connect more things,

190
08:32.850 --> 08:36.330
probably more vending machines, but lots of other things

191
08:36.330 --> 08:39.060
and get lots of intelligence and utility

192
08:39.060 --> 08:40.860
and convenience from them as a result.

193
08:40.860 --> 08:44.370
But we'll be able to do it safely and securely.

194
08:44.370 --> 08:45.480
So thank you so much

195
08:45.480 --> 08:48.420
and I think I've gotta ask UL Solutions our administrator

196
08:48.420 --> 08:51.573
to come up here and join us for some remarks.

197
08:51.573 --> 08:54.740
(audience applauding)

198
09:04.890 --> 09:07.080
<v ->So good morning everyone.</v>

199
09:07.080 --> 09:11.430
It's such an honor to be here today to recognize the talent

200
09:11.430 --> 09:15.150
and hard work that's been required to develop this program

201
09:15.150 --> 09:16.680
that will equip, qualify

202
09:16.680 --> 09:20.670
and smart products with a cybersecurity safety label.

203
09:20.670 --> 09:22.800
From the dedication of the White House

204
09:22.800 --> 09:26.160
through Deputy Neuberger to the leadership

205
09:26.160 --> 09:29.280
and execution by Chairwoman Rosenworcel,

206
09:29.280 --> 09:33.600
congratulations on the success of a multi-year journey

207
09:33.600 --> 09:36.840
in launching a public-private partnership

208
09:36.840 --> 09:40.650
to address a significant cybersecurity need.

209
09:40.650 --> 09:43.140
I also want to highlight the many hours

210
09:43.140 --> 09:46.410
that industry has already contributed to the development

211
09:46.410 --> 09:47.913
of the Cyber Trust program.

212
09:48.750 --> 09:52.080
We should all be thankful to CTA

213
09:52.080 --> 09:55.020
and to the guidance that Mike Bergman in particular

214
09:55.020 --> 09:58.380
has provided for leading work on the technical

215
09:58.380 --> 10:02.223
and logistical needs for an IoT labeling program.

216
10:03.240 --> 10:05.010
So a little bit about UL Solutions.

217
10:05.010 --> 10:09.570
For 130 years, UL Solutions has been empowering trust

218
10:09.570 --> 10:11.850
and pioneering technologies.

219
10:11.850 --> 10:16.440
What started as testing of electrical wiring has grown

220
10:16.440 --> 10:18.750
to include the enablement of 5G

221
10:18.750 --> 10:21.420
and grid scale renewable energy.

222
10:21.420 --> 10:24.450
We're excited to continue our mission of working

223
10:24.450 --> 10:28.440
for a safer world, bringing the legacy to the security

224
10:28.440 --> 10:29.910
of the connected products

225
10:29.910 --> 10:32.913
that are now everywhere in our homes.

226
10:34.230 --> 10:37.290
UL Solutions would like to commend the FCC

227
10:37.290 --> 10:39.750
for recognizing the role conformity assessment

228
10:39.750 --> 10:42.150
must play in labeling program.

229
10:42.150 --> 10:45.480
Testing and certification are efficient means

230
10:45.480 --> 10:47.850
for maintaining a level playing field,

231
10:47.850 --> 10:51.960
providing consistency in the applications of standards

232
10:51.960 --> 10:55.890
and enabling enforcement and identifying bad actors.

233
10:55.890 --> 10:59.820
In short, it's the process that helps ensure

234
10:59.820 --> 11:02.940
that consumers can trust in the program

235
11:02.940 --> 11:05.823
and the products that carry the Cyber Trust Mark.

236
11:07.380 --> 11:09.720
It's funny you mentioned the Energy Star program

237
11:09.720 --> 11:13.800
because we also believe that just as the Energy Star program

238
11:13.800 --> 11:18.300
educated the public and created incentives for manufacturers

239
11:18.300 --> 11:21.750
to offer more energy efficient appliances,

240
11:21.750 --> 11:25.470
our cybersecurity labeling program will pave the way

241
11:25.470 --> 11:28.053
for more secure smart products.

242
11:29.070 --> 11:31.050
We're honored to serve as the lead administrator

243
11:31.050 --> 11:32.130
for the program.

244
11:32.130 --> 11:36.060
As those of you who have followed the FCC's developments

245
11:36.060 --> 11:40.530
of the program know the next 90 days will be busy ones.

246
11:40.530 --> 11:41.910
It's only January 9th

247
11:41.910 --> 11:44.163
and I think we're all already very tired.

248
11:45.330 --> 11:48.150
Over this time, we'll be working with stakeholders

249
11:48.150 --> 11:50.730
to develop recommendations that will serve

250
11:50.730 --> 11:53.700
as the Cyber Trust Mark's technical requirements

251
11:53.700 --> 11:56.493
for an initial chosen class of products.

252
11:57.690 --> 12:00.750
While this will be a sprint, we intend this work

253
12:00.750 --> 12:04.350
to be guided by five core principles in alignment

254
12:04.350 --> 12:06.030
with the FCC's vision.

255
12:06.030 --> 12:09.180
The first is to create a rigorous program

256
12:09.180 --> 12:12.360
that will meaningfully impact security.

257
12:12.360 --> 12:16.320
The second is that we want to leverage existing work

258
12:16.320 --> 12:18.360
that stakeholders have developed

259
12:18.360 --> 12:21.870
that has been guided by NIST 8425.

260
12:21.870 --> 12:26.490
The third is that we want to work toward global alignment,

261
12:26.490 --> 12:28.680
wherever that is possible.

262
12:28.680 --> 12:32.100
The fourth, we want to involve a balanced group

263
12:32.100 --> 12:34.710
of stakeholders in the process.

264
12:34.710 --> 12:37.080
And finally, we want to focus

265
12:37.080 --> 12:40.173
on the long-term sustainability of the program.

266
12:41.400 --> 12:44.940
The 90-day process will rely on stakeholder committees

267
12:44.940 --> 12:48.810
to develop requirements for testing the renewal process

268
12:48.810 --> 12:50.550
and the label itself.

269
12:50.550 --> 12:53.670
We encourage stakeholders with experience

270
12:53.670 --> 12:58.290
and expertise in these areas to apply to join.

271
12:58.290 --> 13:00.900
Please go to the new section

272
13:00.900 --> 13:03.990
of the UL Solutions website to learn more.

273
13:03.990 --> 13:06.240
The application window is really short

274
13:06.240 --> 13:08.460
because our timeline is very tight

275
13:08.460 --> 13:12.420
and we do intend to hold the first workshop the last week

276
13:12.420 --> 13:15.360
of January and that workshop is going

277
13:15.360 --> 13:19.290
to focus on the development of technical requirements.

278
13:19.290 --> 13:22.350
Even after the 90-day process concludes,

279
13:22.350 --> 13:24.390
there will still be a significant amount

280
13:24.390 --> 13:25.920
of work ahead of us.

281
13:25.920 --> 13:29.730
However, we're looking forward to being the organization

282
13:29.730 --> 13:32.670
that not only helps launch the program,

283
13:32.670 --> 13:36.600
but also makes sure it becomes a durable force

284
13:36.600 --> 13:40.920
for improving security for many, many years to come.

285
13:40.920 --> 13:42.690
So thanks so much for your time today.

286
13:42.690 --> 13:45.540
I think I need to pass the mic to you, Mike.

287
13:45.540 --> 13:47.073
Best Buy's senior director.

288
13:48.150 --> 13:51.317
(audience applauding)

289
13:52.260 --> 13:53.910
<v ->All right, good morning everybody.</v>

290
13:53.910 --> 13:55.590
I'll be pretty brief here.

291
13:55.590 --> 13:58.140
First off, Mike and I talked a little bit about this

292
13:58.140 --> 14:03.000
and so to the two of you, thank you for your service.

293
14:03.000 --> 14:05.160
Thank you for your initiative and support of this program.

294
14:05.160 --> 14:06.390
And I have request for the room.

295
14:06.390 --> 14:07.950
Could y'all please give a round of applause

296
14:07.950 --> 14:10.653
and the congratulations for their success?

297
14:10.653 --> 14:14.220
(everyone applauding)

298
14:14.220 --> 14:16.530
All right, so now as I was thinking about this talk,

299
14:16.530 --> 14:18.990
this very brief talk I was thinking about, okay,

300
14:18.990 --> 14:20.400
what does this room want to know?

301
14:20.400 --> 14:22.200
What are the people who are here in support of this program?

302
14:22.200 --> 14:23.820
What do you really wanna know?

303
14:23.820 --> 14:24.653
What I'll tell you is

304
14:24.653 --> 14:28.560
that Best Buy believes in the promise of this program.

305
14:28.560 --> 14:30.240
I am here because Best Buy believes

306
14:30.240 --> 14:31.920
in the promise of this program.

307
14:31.920 --> 14:34.110
If you pursue this label with your products,

308
14:34.110 --> 14:36.330
our intention is to support you in that effort

309
14:36.330 --> 14:38.160
and to help you distinguish your product

310
14:38.160 --> 14:40.230
through the various channels that we work with, right?

311
14:40.230 --> 14:42.660
We've got our blue shirts at over a thousand stores.

312
14:42.660 --> 14:44.460
We have our Geek Squads agents in thousands

313
14:44.460 --> 14:47.460
of homes every day, our website with billions of impressions

314
14:47.460 --> 14:49.830
and the most downloaded app over Black Friday,

315
14:49.830 --> 14:51.360
that's for sales.

316
14:51.360 --> 14:53.550
So we have these channels, we have these abilities,

317
14:53.550 --> 14:55.313
and we're there to help you with it.

318
14:56.197 --> 14:57.960
This is real.

319
14:57.960 --> 14:59.220
This isn't vaporware.

320
14:59.220 --> 15:01.350
This is a great opportunity for success.

321
15:01.350 --> 15:04.320
And look, I'm here, Amazon is here.

322
15:04.320 --> 15:05.730
Interestingly enough, neither one

323
15:05.730 --> 15:07.290
of us are governed affairs people.

324
15:07.290 --> 15:08.700
We're not the kind of people that usually do this

325
15:08.700 --> 15:10.260
kind of stuff, right?

326
15:10.260 --> 15:13.890
I'm the privacy guy, he's VP of huge sales

327
15:13.890 --> 15:15.300
and he'll explain his title later.

328
15:15.300 --> 15:17.280
But the bottom line is, it means something

329
15:17.280 --> 15:19.230
that we are here and we're in support.

330
15:19.230 --> 15:22.560
So I thank you to CTA, thank you Mike Bergman,

331
15:22.560 --> 15:25.205
and I hope you all enjoy the conference.

332
15:25.205 --> 15:28.372
(audience applauding)

333
15:36.000 --> 15:37.170
<v ->Good morning.</v>

334
15:37.170 --> 15:40.410
I hope everyone is having a fantastic CES.

335
15:40.410 --> 15:45.210
I have found this to be an absolutely amazing year for CES

336
15:45.210 --> 15:47.550
and I look at this forum

337
15:47.550 --> 15:49.470
and I think what an amazing venue

338
15:49.470 --> 15:51.120
to talk about such an important topic

339
15:51.120 --> 15:53.853
as the US Cyber Security Trust Mark.

340
15:54.780 --> 15:55.770
My name is Steve Downer

341
15:55.770 --> 15:57.060
and I'm the Vice President

342
15:57.060 --> 15:59.463
for Consumer Electronics at Amazon.

343
16:00.510 --> 16:04.710
In addition to providing a vast selection to all

344
16:04.710 --> 16:07.890
of our customers in the consumer electronics category,

345
16:07.890 --> 16:10.923
I also serve the greater consumer technology,

346
16:13.440 --> 16:16.560
this greater consumer technology community

347
16:16.560 --> 16:20.520
as the chairman of the Consumer Technology Association,

348
16:20.520 --> 16:22.290
their executive board.

349
16:22.290 --> 16:25.710
And it's really through both of these lenses that I'm here

350
16:25.710 --> 16:29.640
to offer our support for the US Cyber Trust Mark.

351
16:29.640 --> 16:33.000
We believe that our customers will value

352
16:33.000 --> 16:34.800
the US Cyber Trust Mark

353
16:34.800 --> 16:37.740
and the confidence it will bring to packages

354
16:37.740 --> 16:39.930
as they're delivered to your doorstep

355
16:39.930 --> 16:42.000
or while you're shopping online.

356
16:42.000 --> 16:46.230
It's funny because as a former major appliances executive,

357
16:46.230 --> 16:50.250
your reference to the Energy Star program, it is spot on

358
16:50.250 --> 16:52.530
and that is what we should all be envisioning

359
16:52.530 --> 16:55.470
for this program as it moves forward.

360
16:55.470 --> 16:57.270
It's taken many leaders

361
16:57.270 --> 17:01.140
and a great amount of collaboration across many groups

362
17:01.140 --> 17:03.360
to get the program to this point.

363
17:03.360 --> 17:06.060
The government has prioritized the importance

364
17:06.060 --> 17:08.250
of smart home security.

365
17:08.250 --> 17:11.370
The private sector is stewarding the implementation

366
17:11.370 --> 17:14.130
of the program and civil society

367
17:14.130 --> 17:17.070
and standards organizations like the CTA

368
17:17.070 --> 17:20.580
have created the technical foundational framework

369
17:20.580 --> 17:22.740
for this important program.

370
17:22.740 --> 17:24.960
I'd like to thank Anne

371
17:24.960 --> 17:29.490
and the National Security Council, the FCC

372
17:29.490 --> 17:33.660
and the CTA for pulling this event together today

373
17:33.660 --> 17:35.520
and creating this forum for what will be

374
17:35.520 --> 17:36.870
a wonderful discussion.

375
17:36.870 --> 17:38.460
Thank you for having us here today

376
17:38.460 --> 17:40.563
and I wish you all a wonderful CES.

377
17:41.648 --> 17:44.815
(audience applauding)

378
17:52.860 --> 17:55.600
<v ->I would like to echo the thanks to</v>

379
17:57.030 --> 17:59.940
Deputy National Security Advisor Neuberger

380
17:59.940 --> 18:04.110
and FCC Chairwoman Rosenworcel for your leadership,

381
18:04.110 --> 18:07.530
driving this forward, leading the program effort

382
18:07.530 --> 18:11.970
in both the White House and at the FCC,

383
18:11.970 --> 18:15.480
the owner of the program, Chante, UL stepping up

384
18:15.480 --> 18:17.619
as the lead administrator and our manufacturers

385
18:17.619 --> 18:21.930
and retailers, the industry represented

386
18:21.930 --> 18:23.583
by Best Buy and Amazon today.

387
18:25.320 --> 18:29.700
I want to add one more and that is NIST.

388
18:29.700 --> 18:31.680
For a long time now, NIST has been working

389
18:31.680 --> 18:35.100
on the foundational technologies

390
18:35.100 --> 18:37.608
that establish baseline security.

391
18:37.608 --> 18:39.090
What is baseline security for IoT?

392
18:39.090 --> 18:42.600
Because the original intent of this program was

393
18:42.600 --> 18:46.140
to get a solid base of security

394
18:46.140 --> 18:48.088
for as many devices as possible.

395
18:48.088 --> 18:50.838
Something that could be rolled out and applied quickly.

396
18:52.530 --> 18:55.770
NIST was led by a team

397
18:55.770 --> 18:59.490
that included their chief technical gun, Mike Fagan.

398
18:59.490 --> 19:02.280
I'd like to invite Mike to join us here on stage.

399
19:02.280 --> 19:04.500
He's going to be one of our panelists.

400
19:04.500 --> 19:07.470
With Mike Fagan, Dr. Mike Fagan.

401
19:07.470 --> 19:09.660
We have Adam Goldberg,

402
19:09.660 --> 19:13.590
who is a subject matter expert on cybersecurity for Sony.

403
19:13.590 --> 19:16.090
Grace Burkard, who's director of operations

404
19:17.315 --> 19:21.270
for IOXT, a cybersecurity certification entity,

405
19:21.270 --> 19:25.950
and recently announced CLA, Cybersecurity Labeling Authority

406
19:25.950 --> 19:30.090
for this program, designated so by the FCC

407
19:30.090 --> 19:31.230
and Scott Register,

408
19:31.230 --> 19:34.620
whose Keysight organization is developing test software

409
19:34.620 --> 19:37.070
compatible with the requirements for the program.

410
19:38.250 --> 19:40.440
In addition, all of these individuals

411
19:40.440 --> 19:43.740
have contributed many hours of their own time

412
19:43.740 --> 19:48.740
to build the technical foundations of,

413
19:52.980 --> 19:56.763
any day now, the technical foundation of this effort.

414
19:58.890 --> 20:01.890
I will briefly say, I'm going to do

415
20:01.890 --> 20:04.545
a very, very quick dive into this,

416
20:04.545 --> 20:08.703
but the CTA's technical standards bodies,

417
20:11.370 --> 20:13.980
which is an ASC accredited standards effort

418
20:13.980 --> 20:16.030
led by Alexander Blaskin.

419
20:17.640 --> 20:21.340
The working groups have been developing

420
20:22.530 --> 20:25.800
proposed documents with many, many

421
20:25.800 --> 20:27.540
of the deep dive details necessary

422
20:27.540 --> 20:29.700
to make a program like this work.

423
20:29.700 --> 20:32.160
In the basic concept,

424
20:32.160 --> 20:34.680
which generally is I would call the plan of record

425
20:34.680 --> 20:37.200
for almost everybody involved in this program.

426
20:37.200 --> 20:38.490
There's a QR code

427
20:38.490 --> 20:42.330
and an FCC trademark protected,

428
20:42.330 --> 20:46.950
a US PTO protected certification mark on the package.

429
20:46.950 --> 20:50.340
An analogous thing on an eCommerce website,

430
20:50.340 --> 20:54.930
the QR code provides a link to first a consumer friendly,

431
20:54.930 --> 20:56.760
mobile friendly page.

432
20:56.760 --> 20:59.010
You can scan this with your smartphone

433
20:59.010 --> 21:01.650
and pull up the consumer friendly page.

434
21:01.650 --> 21:03.930
A number of pieces of information, I'm not gonna go

435
21:03.930 --> 21:06.210
through them in detail, but a number of pieces

436
21:06.210 --> 21:08.580
of information that are listed in

437
21:08.580 --> 21:10.860
the FCC's report in order.

438
21:10.860 --> 21:13.350
In addition, there's a second page, which is for

439
21:13.350 --> 21:15.210
the technical ecosystem

440
21:15.210 --> 21:17.850
to help improve cybersecurity overall.

441
21:17.850 --> 21:19.740
These two pieces of information are available

442
21:19.740 --> 21:21.150
from any one of these packages

443
21:21.150 --> 21:23.253
through the smartphone QR code reader.

444
21:26.040 --> 21:30.120
Big picture wise, this is a voluntary program hosted

445
21:30.120 --> 21:34.890
by the FCC administered by their designee UL Solutions,

446
21:34.890 --> 21:35.723
that should say.

447
21:37.140 --> 21:39.690
The standards and test procedures are going to be developed

448
21:39.690 --> 21:43.773
as Chante mentioned, over the next 90 days ish.

449
21:44.850 --> 21:46.230
Well, there's an opportunity

450
21:46.230 --> 21:49.413
to extend the program a little bit if necessary.

451
21:51.600 --> 21:53.550
And there's accreditation

452
21:53.550 --> 21:55.830
for all the important entities involved.

453
21:55.830 --> 21:58.800
The administrators of the program, the CLAs,

454
21:58.800 --> 22:01.383
and for the test labs themselves.

455
22:03.660 --> 22:07.350
NISTIR 8425 is the foundational document.

456
22:07.350 --> 22:09.360
This is the consumer profile

457
22:09.360 --> 22:13.920
of the NIST IoT cybersecurity baseline.

458
22:13.920 --> 22:18.240
Mentioned that Dr. Mike Fagan led the technical effort

459
22:18.240 --> 22:19.740
to develop both of those tracks.

460
22:19.740 --> 22:24.450
The 8259 baseline and 8425.

461
22:24.450 --> 22:26.670
The CTA technical working groups have been developing

462
22:26.670 --> 22:28.800
a framework that takes 8425

463
22:28.800 --> 22:32.100
and puts in more prescriptive detail exactly tracking it,

464
22:32.100 --> 22:34.980
leaving nothing out, adding as little as possible,

465
22:34.980 --> 22:37.530
but trying to make sure that it's a viable, workable,

466
22:37.530 --> 22:41.430
detailed piece that leverages exactly what's in 8425.

467
22:41.430 --> 22:43.500
And every one of the people on the stage has been

468
22:43.500 --> 22:46.410
participating in helping develop that.

469
22:46.410 --> 22:47.670
It is IoT product.

470
22:47.670 --> 22:50.250
The consumer is protected best if we look not only

471
22:50.250 --> 22:53.370
at the hardware device, but also at the app in the cloud.

472
22:53.370 --> 22:56.880
And I mentioned the working groups process from here,

473
22:56.880 --> 22:59.080
lead administrator program, we talked about,

474
23:00.840 --> 23:03.720
there will be a number of additional public notices

475
23:03.720 --> 23:08.720
to take the lead administrator developed recommendations

476
23:09.900 --> 23:13.410
and bring them into the public record into law.

477
23:13.410 --> 23:17.310
And then finally, I'll say what CTA is trying to do.

478
23:17.310 --> 23:18.750
We believe that it's possible

479
23:18.750 --> 23:22.260
to see certified products at this event next year.

480
23:22.260 --> 23:26.130
So I wanna thank everybody who has contributed to this,

481
23:26.130 --> 23:29.610
our five opening remarks people, the panelists, a host

482
23:29.610 --> 23:32.673
of people in the background, and check with us next year.

483
23:33.960 --> 23:38.130
So let's talk about the requirements.

484
23:38.130 --> 23:40.540
The goal of this panel is to talk about

485
23:42.690 --> 23:44.700
getting ready for certification.

486
23:44.700 --> 23:47.370
And if you look at the top level requirements, you start off

487
23:47.370 --> 23:49.080
with developing your product, of course,

488
23:49.080 --> 23:50.520
but then you make an application.

489
23:50.520 --> 23:52.200
So we're gonna do this a little bit backwards

490
23:52.200 --> 23:55.050
and talk about the application requirements,

491
23:55.050 --> 23:59.700
the responsibilities of the entity that gets the grant

492
23:59.700 --> 24:03.510
of certification from the FCC through their designees.

493
24:03.510 --> 24:05.133
And we just lost our screen.

494
24:07.380 --> 24:09.930
So let's not stress over that.

495
24:09.930 --> 24:10.763
Oh, there we go.

496
24:10.763 --> 24:11.596
There we go.

497
24:12.750 --> 24:15.180
So Grace,

498
24:15.180 --> 24:19.380
IOXT is already deeply involved in accepting applications

499
24:19.380 --> 24:20.217
for your own program.

500
24:20.217 --> 24:23.130
And I think you probably have a really good feel for,

501
24:23.130 --> 24:24.270
you know, all the give and take

502
24:24.270 --> 24:26.070
and can you talk about this a little bit?

503
24:26.070 --> 24:27.690
What's gonna be required for someone

504
24:27.690 --> 24:29.340
who's applying for the mark?

505
24:29.340 --> 24:34.050
<v Grace>Yeah, so as IOXT, we do a bunch of certifications</v>

506
24:34.050 --> 24:35.670
for IOT products.

507
24:35.670 --> 24:38.220
We really focus on smart home,

508
24:38.220 --> 24:41.970
smart building, mobile applications, and cellular IoT.

509
24:41.970 --> 24:43.860
For this program, obviously we're focusing

510
24:43.860 --> 24:45.780
on smart home even more.

511
24:45.780 --> 24:49.260
And so what we see on a day-to-day basis

512
24:49.260 --> 24:51.120
is what do they need to do?

513
24:51.120 --> 24:55.260
It's usually manufacturers, sometimes it's OEMs or ODMs,

514
24:55.260 --> 24:56.970
but a lot of manufacturers.

515
24:56.970 --> 25:00.780
And so that is going to be really relevant here.

516
25:00.780 --> 25:02.040
So what do they need to do?

517
25:02.040 --> 25:05.270
First, just start with the application process, right?

518
25:05.270 --> 25:08.190
You need to submit an application,

519
25:08.190 --> 25:11.670
complete the attestation process

520
25:11.670 --> 25:13.800
that you will then receive the mark.

521
25:13.800 --> 25:16.080
Once you receive the mark, you're on the hook

522
25:16.080 --> 25:18.900
for any complaints that might come through.

523
25:18.900 --> 25:22.320
These will be validated of course.

524
25:22.320 --> 25:24.240
And so what that looks like is they'll need

525
25:24.240 --> 25:26.730
to investigate those complaints.

526
25:26.730 --> 25:30.210
There is a 20 day period where they need

527
25:30.210 --> 25:33.570
to report the results of that investigation.

528
25:33.570 --> 25:36.660
That's big because 20 days is not a lot of time,

529
25:36.660 --> 25:38.280
so it's gonna be a pretty quick turnaround.

530
25:38.280 --> 25:40.053
And the focus on that is great.

531
25:41.490 --> 25:43.680
There are other common responsibilities

532
25:43.680 --> 25:45.930
that you see on an ongoing basis.

533
25:45.930 --> 25:48.990
So that's going to be, you know, maintaining records

534
25:48.990 --> 25:51.570
and continued compliance.

535
25:51.570 --> 25:53.730
But some of the new ones that maybe not everybody

536
25:53.730 --> 25:57.600
is aware of is keeping the registry

537
25:57.600 --> 26:01.293
or API updated if there's any,

538
26:02.490 --> 26:04.800
we have our own registry I should start with.

539
26:04.800 --> 26:06.540
And so you can go to our website,

540
26:06.540 --> 26:09.390
you can see which products are already certified.

541
26:09.390 --> 26:12.210
You can see how they're certified.

542
26:12.210 --> 26:15.660
And so I'm sure there will be probably multiple registries

543
26:15.660 --> 26:17.430
at this point for the CLAs.

544
26:17.430 --> 26:19.980
So the manufacturers will have that responsibility

545
26:19.980 --> 26:22.680
to make sure that that is up to date with any new versions

546
26:22.680 --> 26:23.913
or software updates.

547
26:25.230 --> 26:29.550
There's also going to be point of contact for everyone,

548
26:29.550 --> 26:32.710
all the manufacturers, where they will be able to have

549
26:33.720 --> 26:35.070
individuals, you know,

550
26:35.070 --> 26:37.320
you hear about vulnerability disclosure programs

551
26:37.320 --> 26:41.610
and so individuals can submit disputes or complaints.

552
26:41.610 --> 26:43.620
And so that will be important of having

553
26:43.620 --> 26:45.540
that point of contact.

554
26:45.540 --> 26:47.250
We'll talk about that a little bit later,

555
26:47.250 --> 26:49.623
but that's a big one going forward.

556
26:50.627 --> 26:52.020
And then another big one

557
26:52.020 --> 26:55.260
is going to be actually educating customers.

558
26:55.260 --> 26:57.660
And this is a big task

559
26:57.660 --> 27:00.690
because it's slightly out there.

560
27:00.690 --> 27:02.580
We'd like to see more of it happen.

561
27:02.580 --> 27:05.280
And so in that instance, we are really looking for

562
27:05.280 --> 27:09.000
what do customers need to do when it comes to configuration

563
27:09.000 --> 27:11.580
or product security.

564
27:11.580 --> 27:14.100
And then especially a big one that's coming up

565
27:14.100 --> 27:15.300
and you'll hear a lot more about it

566
27:15.300 --> 27:19.230
is the software support period, right?

567
27:19.230 --> 27:22.320
There's not a whole lot that do it currently.

568
27:22.320 --> 27:23.460
I mean there are some,

569
27:23.460 --> 27:25.290
but the ones we like to see more of it.

570
27:25.290 --> 27:26.970
And the ones that are doing it,

571
27:26.970 --> 27:29.670
that support period really ranges.

572
27:29.670 --> 27:33.780
It could be one year, two years, 10 years, 20 years.

573
27:33.780 --> 27:37.890
So I think it's really great for consumer transparency

574
27:37.890 --> 27:40.110
to understand what they're signing up for

575
27:40.110 --> 27:43.533
and then to have some accountability as well.

576
27:44.790 --> 27:46.700
<v ->That's a lot.</v>
<v ->Yeah, sorry.</v>

577
27:46.700 --> 27:49.320
<v Michael>So there's requirements going in.</v>

578
27:49.320 --> 27:51.420
Including a successful test report

579
27:51.420 --> 27:54.210
and then there's some ongoing compliance requirements.

580
27:54.210 --> 27:56.010
Well, let's talk about the technical requirements

581
27:56.010 --> 27:57.600
going into this.

582
27:57.600 --> 27:59.250
What does the product need to do?

583
28:00.540 --> 28:03.810
So the first thing that caught my eye

584
28:03.810 --> 28:06.027
when I was first introduced to the baseline requirements

585
28:06.027 --> 28:07.683
was the asset identification.

586
28:09.990 --> 28:11.913
Basically some identifier.

587
28:14.970 --> 28:15.803
Scott.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

588
28:15.803 --> 28:17.133
So I'll take that, right?

589
28:18.075 --> 28:21.000
So asset identification really means that every component

590
28:21.000 --> 28:25.020
of your IoT product has a unique identifier

591
28:25.020 --> 28:27.380
that the product maintains an inventory of all

592
28:27.380 --> 28:30.360
of the unique identifiers or the components of the product.

593
28:30.360 --> 28:33.960
When I say components could be sensors, smartphone apps,

594
28:33.960 --> 28:35.580
thermostats, you know, whatever.

595
28:35.580 --> 28:38.160
And that that inventory is available

596
28:38.160 --> 28:40.800
to authorized entities, right?

597
28:40.800 --> 28:41.910
So why do we have that?

598
28:41.910 --> 28:44.760
Well, having a unique identifier

599
28:44.760 --> 28:46.680
for some kind of entity is really important

600
28:46.680 --> 28:47.550
for security, right?

601
28:47.550 --> 28:50.250
When you log onto your bank account,

602
28:50.250 --> 28:52.650
your username is your unique identifier.

603
28:52.650 --> 28:55.500
So if you're John Smith at, you know, Bank of America,

604
28:55.500 --> 28:58.140
there's not another John Smith with that username.

605
28:58.140 --> 29:02.010
And so when you log in, you see exactly your bank account.

606
29:02.010 --> 29:04.260
It's also really handy if you're doing forensics,

607
29:04.260 --> 29:07.395
like if there is a security event, you want to be able

608
29:07.395 --> 29:10.680
to uniquely identify all of the different devices,

609
29:10.680 --> 29:12.030
let's say on a network.

610
29:12.030 --> 29:14.640
So you can see which ones were impacted, go back,

611
29:14.640 --> 29:16.860
maybe see was there firmware modified

612
29:16.860 --> 29:19.020
and things like that.

613
29:19.020 --> 29:21.090
One kind of important note there,

614
29:21.090 --> 29:26.090
if that unique identifier is exposed,

615
29:26.460 --> 29:30.510
if that causes a security issue, then you have

616
29:30.510 --> 29:31.620
to protect it, right?

617
29:31.620 --> 29:35.220
Like, so if the identifier for your device gets exposed

618
29:35.220 --> 29:36.930
and that's a problem, you have to make sure

619
29:36.930 --> 29:37.980
that that is protected.

620
29:37.980 --> 29:41.490
Like if you've for some reason built that into a password

621
29:41.490 --> 29:42.663
or something like that.

622
29:43.680 --> 29:47.580
Now this caused, I think hearing this requirement

623
29:47.580 --> 29:48.870
caused maybe a little concern

624
29:48.870 --> 29:50.640
because there was maybe some concern

625
29:50.640 --> 29:54.150
with manufacturers, oh, does this mean every device has

626
29:54.150 --> 29:56.910
to roll off, you know, the assembly line

627
29:56.910 --> 29:59.820
with a unique identifier, a globally unique identifier,

628
29:59.820 --> 30:03.000
and you know, how do you manage that?

629
30:03.000 --> 30:04.260
It's actually not that bad

630
30:04.260 --> 30:06.300
because manufacturers get to decide sort of

631
30:06.300 --> 30:08.250
how they manage that process.

632
30:08.250 --> 30:10.290
And that unique identifier can be sort

633
30:10.290 --> 30:12.540
of unique within a deployment, right?

634
30:12.540 --> 30:15.253
So I can have a, you know,

635
30:15.253 --> 30:18.030
a webcam deployment at my house called, I don't know,

636
30:18.030 --> 30:20.010
I could name it THX 1138.

637
30:20.010 --> 30:22.740
And then I could have camera one, camera two,

638
30:22.740 --> 30:24.420
camera three inside that.

639
30:24.420 --> 30:27.570
Now Adam down the street could also have camera one,

640
30:27.570 --> 30:30.300
camera two, camera three in his deployment.

641
30:30.300 --> 30:32.610
But because the top level name is different,

642
30:32.610 --> 30:33.810
he calls it Adam's network

643
30:33.810 --> 30:36.210
or whatever, then those are unique, right?

644
30:36.210 --> 30:38.160
Because you combine the deployment name, the camera name,

645
30:38.160 --> 30:39.460
so it's really pretty easy

646
30:40.401 --> 30:43.110
to meet that requirement.
<v ->So just to clarify,</v>

647
30:43.110 --> 30:44.130
when you say components,

648
30:44.130 --> 30:47.130
you mean the top level components like the hardware box,

649
30:47.130 --> 30:50.220
the software app, the cloud services.

650
30:50.220 --> 30:52.200
Not the chips.
<v ->That's right.</v>

651
30:52.200 --> 30:53.460
That's right.
<v ->Okay, great, great.</v>

652
30:53.460 --> 30:54.390
Got it. Got it.

653
30:54.390 --> 30:56.310
Cool, cool, cool. Thank you.

654
30:56.310 --> 30:57.410
Product configuration,

655
30:58.260 --> 30:59.370
what does that mean?
<v ->Happy to give</v>

656
30:59.370 --> 31:00.840
a little bit background on that.

657
31:00.840 --> 31:03.810
And actually to add on the last one, I think just

658
31:03.810 --> 31:05.190
to reiterate what Scott said

659
31:05.190 --> 31:08.880
and the need for asset ID from this perspective,

660
31:08.880 --> 31:10.980
like the example given this morning by the chairwoman

661
31:10.980 --> 31:14.310
about the vending machine and how it kind of gets lost

662
31:14.310 --> 31:16.410
in the mix as just another IP address.

663
31:16.410 --> 31:19.890
The ability to identify like Scott was reflecting

664
31:19.890 --> 31:21.090
can support even a business

665
31:21.090 --> 31:23.130
that's using this kind of technology

666
31:23.130 --> 31:24.390
to be able to manage their network.

667
31:24.390 --> 31:26.670
Now, that wasn't a main goal, of course, as being

668
31:26.670 --> 31:31.260
for consumers, but that kind of cross sector,

669
31:31.260 --> 31:33.840
if you wanna call it that use of

670
31:33.840 --> 31:35.880
consumer IoT was something that's been

671
31:35.880 --> 31:37.980
on our minds.
<v ->Terrific, terrific.</v>

672
31:37.980 --> 31:39.157
Well how about

673
31:39.157 --> 31:40.140
product configuration?
<v ->And so with</v>

674
31:40.140 --> 31:41.940
product configuration.
<v ->Is this software?</v>

675
31:41.940 --> 31:42.840
<v ->No, no, no.</v>

676
31:42.840 --> 31:45.660
Not how you configure the software in your system

677
31:45.660 --> 31:46.770
or on your backend.

678
31:46.770 --> 31:48.090
I know we just mentioned like clouds

679
31:48.090 --> 31:50.760
or even the mobile applications configuration

680
31:50.760 --> 31:53.760
in the sense of what libraries it might use.

681
31:53.760 --> 31:55.170
Here we're talking about the settings

682
31:55.170 --> 31:57.930
that you would see in a product.

683
31:57.930 --> 31:58.980
You know, Scott mentioned the ability

684
31:58.980 --> 32:00.150
to change the password.

685
32:00.150 --> 32:01.170
So to set that password

686
32:01.170 --> 32:03.270
or to set the identifier to something

687
32:03.270 --> 32:05.580
that would be unique in your configuration,

688
32:05.580 --> 32:08.310
or excuse me in your environment,

689
32:08.310 --> 32:10.710
is the kinds of settings we're talking about here.

690
32:10.710 --> 32:12.270
So product level settings

691
32:12.270 --> 32:16.020
that might then apply across all those high level components

692
32:16.020 --> 32:17.520
like we were mentioning before.

693
32:17.520 --> 32:19.320
And built into this is also this

694
32:19.320 --> 32:20.940
concept of a secure default.

695
32:20.940 --> 32:23.910
So when you open it up, you plug it into your network,

696
32:23.910 --> 32:25.980
either you're immediately prompted as a user

697
32:25.980 --> 32:29.310
to take certain actions to configure certain settings,

698
32:29.310 --> 32:32.700
changing a default password for example.

699
32:32.700 --> 32:36.090
Or it is already secure by some measure of the program

700
32:36.090 --> 32:38.610
or somebody else there that you know,

701
32:38.610 --> 32:39.443
maybe you don't even have

702
32:39.443 --> 32:41.370
to touch it.
<v ->So you got the option</v>

703
32:41.370 --> 32:42.570
to go back to a secure default

704
32:42.570 --> 32:45.270
even if the configuration settings are messed up.

705
32:45.270 --> 32:47.370
Very cool, data protection.

706
32:47.370 --> 32:48.510
Okay, this one I think everybody has

707
32:48.510 --> 32:51.903
an intuitive feel for.
<v ->Do you though?</v>

708
32:55.860 --> 32:58.920
So for data protection, I mean, you know,

709
32:58.920 --> 33:02.740
it sort of includes a bunch of sensible things like

710
33:03.720 --> 33:06.750
don't store passwords in clear text and memory

711
33:06.750 --> 33:08.313
and things like that.

712
33:09.360 --> 33:13.890
But more broadly, I suppose that that whatever data

713
33:13.890 --> 33:18.600
is stored gets appropriate security for that data.

714
33:18.600 --> 33:21.510
So passwords and you know, user name passwords,

715
33:21.510 --> 33:22.560
credentials like that,

716
33:22.560 --> 33:25.867
of course we've gotta be, you know,

717
33:25.867 --> 33:29.340
have a different sort of security to it than, you know,

718
33:29.340 --> 33:32.160
cached website data or something.

719
33:32.160 --> 33:33.260
But on the other hand,

720
33:36.232 --> 33:39.240
things that are sensitive to you,

721
33:39.240 --> 33:42.050
things like personally identifiable information

722
33:42.050 --> 33:46.350
or things like that are stored securely

723
33:46.350 --> 33:48.390
and maintained securely.

724
33:48.390 --> 33:51.930
And I think there's a real need

725
33:51.930 --> 33:56.930
for that in terms of being robust to somebody trying

726
33:59.790 --> 34:01.840
to exfiltrate that sort of data

727
34:03.352 --> 34:07.230
but also part of the data protection

728
34:07.230 --> 34:11.100
is to sanitize inputs.

729
34:11.100 --> 34:15.120
Make sure that the data

730
34:15.120 --> 34:19.270
that the device or product is processing

731
34:20.190 --> 34:24.690
is not able to do things it shouldn't be able to do.

732
34:24.690 --> 34:28.080
There's an XKCD from a number of years ago

733
34:28.080 --> 34:31.990
that that talks about a woman who named her kid

734
34:32.940 --> 34:36.960
an SQL string, like drop, you know, drop students

735
34:36.960 --> 34:39.033
or something to delete the database.

736
34:40.537 --> 34:43.050
And so it's things like that where you, you know,

737
34:43.050 --> 34:47.670
if it's a text field, there shouldn't be any way to,

738
34:47.670 --> 34:50.460
you know, insert SQL commands into it in a way

739
34:50.460 --> 34:52.290
that they actually work.

740
34:52.290 --> 34:57.290
And there's a whole set of these sort of things

741
34:57.300 --> 34:59.790
and related things like cross side scripting and stuff.

742
34:59.790 --> 35:04.790
So it's important that the products

743
35:10.500 --> 35:14.040
only do what they mean to do and not allow,

744
35:14.040 --> 35:17.340
you know, injection of some sort of programmatic

745
35:17.340 --> 35:20.250
or otherwise things

746
35:20.250 --> 35:24.030
that could be disruptive.
<v ->And what about</v>

747
35:24.030 --> 35:28.800
transmission of data?
<v ->Well, yes, for sure.</v>

748
35:28.800 --> 35:30.153
Oh yes, thanks Mike.

749
35:31.350 --> 35:34.440
So among the sets of requirements is, you know,

750
35:34.440 --> 35:38.580
the things be secure, but the data be secured

751
35:38.580 --> 35:43.020
in a non deprecated manner.

752
35:43.020 --> 35:45.870
So for example, you know, I mean if, depending on

753
35:45.870 --> 35:49.570
how far back you can remember, SSL 1.0

754
35:49.570 --> 35:51.600
and 1.1, like the very beginnings

755
35:51.600 --> 35:54.753
of secure internet traffic,

756
35:58.170 --> 36:00.033
their usefulness has long passed.

757
36:00.971 --> 36:02.830
And the current ones

758
36:05.259 --> 36:07.020
are the only ones that should be used.

759
36:07.020 --> 36:10.170
Everything prior, which was deprecated for one reason

760
36:10.170 --> 36:13.080
or another because there was some vulnerability

761
36:13.080 --> 36:15.720
or the better way to do things or et cetera

762
36:15.720 --> 36:17.310
that those things aren't used.

763
36:17.310 --> 36:20.610
So with respect to data protection,

764
36:20.610 --> 36:22.170
you gotta actually protect the data

765
36:22.170 --> 36:24.619
and not just look like it.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

766
36:24.619 --> 36:26.970
And I know CTA has a list of deprecated protocols

767
36:26.970 --> 36:27.900
that's gonna be submitted

768
36:27.900 --> 36:30.309
to the 90 days stakeholder processes,

769
36:30.309 --> 36:33.750
potentially a template for don't use these.

770
36:33.750 --> 36:34.593
Great, great.

771
36:36.510 --> 36:38.160
Interface access control.

772
36:38.160 --> 36:39.810
I know what all those words mean.

773
36:41.526 --> 36:43.840
<v ->So the sort of simple explanation is</v>

774
36:45.210 --> 36:47.940
any ways into your device, any network ports

775
36:47.940 --> 36:51.960
or physical interfaces, access to those is restricted

776
36:51.960 --> 36:52.980
and controlled, right?

777
36:52.980 --> 36:55.650
So practically what does it mean?

778
36:55.650 --> 36:59.523
If you have a physical kind of interface on your device,

779
37:00.510 --> 37:04.740
you don't want someone to be able to walk up to it

780
37:04.740 --> 37:06.120
and plug into it

781
37:06.120 --> 37:08.640
with some commonly available tool and take it over.

782
37:08.640 --> 37:09.473
Right?

783
37:09.473 --> 37:11.700
Now if it's a proprietary interface

784
37:11.700 --> 37:13.800
or you have to have some special protocol to attack,

785
37:13.800 --> 37:15.750
you're probably fine, but you don't want someone just

786
37:15.750 --> 37:18.360
walking up with like a serial port and plugging in

787
37:18.360 --> 37:21.120
and taking it over because you don't know where all

788
37:21.120 --> 37:23.460
of these devices are deployed.

789
37:23.460 --> 37:25.860
Now, on the network side, which is typically

790
37:25.860 --> 37:29.430
how these things are accessed, you want to make sure,

791
37:29.430 --> 37:31.380
first of all that you're not exposing

792
37:31.380 --> 37:33.480
any unnecessary services.

793
37:33.480 --> 37:37.650
So for example, if you're building an IoT product

794
37:37.650 --> 37:39.780
that's based on Android, you wanna make sure

795
37:39.780 --> 37:42.300
that the Android debug interface isn't turned on

796
37:42.300 --> 37:44.497
because that--
<v ->Or FTP.</v>

797
37:44.497 --> 37:47.880
Insecure services.
<v ->Yeah insecure services</v>

798
37:47.880 --> 37:51.690
that aren't needed for device setup or management.

799
37:51.690 --> 37:53.520
So if you don't need it, it should be turned off.

800
37:53.520 --> 37:55.710
I mean that's because if you can

801
37:55.710 --> 37:57.780
make the attack surface smaller,

802
37:57.780 --> 37:59.160
it's harder to get into, right?

803
37:59.160 --> 38:01.980
Really sort of basic stuff.

804
38:01.980 --> 38:05.520
And then you want to also make sure

805
38:05.520 --> 38:07.290
that you have good passwords, right?

806
38:07.290 --> 38:09.930
So access to any interface needs

807
38:09.930 --> 38:12.660
to be authenticated and that means, you know,

808
38:12.660 --> 38:14.340
doing so in a good way.

809
38:14.340 --> 38:15.930
So what does a good password mean?

810
38:15.930 --> 38:18.870
Basically things like passwords should be changed

811
38:18.870 --> 38:23.335
on first use or they have to be randomly generated

812
38:23.335 --> 38:25.290
and strong, right?

813
38:25.290 --> 38:27.210
Long special characters, things like that.

814
38:27.210 --> 38:29.790
Why do we need something like that?

815
38:29.790 --> 38:32.550
If you think back to like the Mirai Botnet, right?

816
38:32.550 --> 38:35.010
Which took down huge chunks of the internet,

817
38:35.010 --> 38:36.270
why was that successful?

818
38:36.270 --> 38:37.710
It wasn't super sophisticated,

819
38:37.710 --> 38:41.670
but there were hundreds of thousands of IoT devices,

820
38:41.670 --> 38:45.810
webcams, set up boxes, et cetera, that were still running

821
38:45.810 --> 38:48.150
with a password they left the factory with, right?

822
38:48.150 --> 38:51.150
And so if you just gathered up a list of half dozen

823
38:51.150 --> 38:53.790
or so with those passwords, you could take over lots

824
38:53.790 --> 38:56.580
and lots of devices and we don't want that to happen again.

825
38:56.580 --> 38:57.860
That's one of the big goals of the program

826
38:57.860 --> 38:59.697
is sort of protecting the internet, right?

827
38:59.697 --> 39:01.350
And so if you have good passwords,

828
39:01.350 --> 39:04.353
then that's a lot less likely to to happen.

829
39:05.310 --> 39:07.803
And then one of the last things, oh what, sorry,

830
39:09.153 --> 39:10.380
quickly, so input validation,

831
39:10.380 --> 39:13.080
and Adam touched on a lot of this, you wanna make sure

832
39:13.080 --> 39:14.700
that you're not receiving data

833
39:14.700 --> 39:16.290
that can mess up your device, right?

834
39:16.290 --> 39:19.440
So if someone can't pass a string that's too long,

835
39:19.440 --> 39:23.313
that writes stuff into executable memory, like malware,

836
39:24.240 --> 39:26.640
that could let someone again, take over the device.

837
39:26.640 --> 39:28.620
We saw that recently with a smart plug, right?

838
39:28.620 --> 39:32.760
Where that was the case.
<v ->Terrific. Terrific.</v>

839
39:32.760 --> 39:34.170
Yeah, I just wanna ask our panelists

840
39:34.170 --> 39:36.330
to pick up the pace a little bit,

841
39:36.330 --> 39:38.130
make sure that we get everything in.

842
39:40.200 --> 39:41.033
Okay.

843
39:41.033 --> 39:42.720
Software update, this is great.

844
39:42.720 --> 39:43.860
There's only one bullet item here,

845
39:43.860 --> 39:45.120
so it must be easy to do, right?

846
39:45.120 --> 39:46.740
<v Grace>Yes, I can take that one.</v>

847
39:46.740 --> 39:49.955
That is actually, it's gonna be very quick, right?

848
39:49.955 --> 39:53.790
So software product components should be able to be updated

849
39:53.790 --> 39:58.710
by authorized individuals or services using a secure

850
39:58.710 --> 40:00.840
and configurable mechanism.

851
40:00.840 --> 40:03.030
So what does that really mean?

852
40:03.030 --> 40:04.830
That they would be able to,

853
40:04.830 --> 40:08.940
the component essentially can receive, verify

854
40:08.940 --> 40:11.040
and apply the update

855
40:11.040 --> 40:15.600
and then also that mechanism, how it's done,

856
40:15.600 --> 40:18.450
essentially, is it going to be automatic?

857
40:18.450 --> 40:19.710
Which would be great

858
40:19.710 --> 40:21.660
because then it could just happen

859
40:21.660 --> 40:23.790
when the manufacturer updates.

860
40:23.790 --> 40:27.090
Or another way is to provide a push notification

861
40:27.090 --> 40:29.160
to customers and then wait for the customer

862
40:29.160 --> 40:30.540
to manually go in

863
40:30.540 --> 40:32.760
and update it.
<v ->Terrific, terrific.</v>

864
40:32.760 --> 40:34.680
And I have to say that this is,

865
40:34.680 --> 40:36.660
to me, this is one of the most important elements

866
40:36.660 --> 40:39.300
of this program overall because we mark a boundary

867
40:39.300 --> 40:43.050
between a requirement that the device just work

868
40:43.050 --> 40:47.880
and the next generation led by the US Cyber Trust Mark,

869
40:47.880 --> 40:49.800
the requirement is the product has to work

870
40:49.800 --> 40:52.500
and be updated when it's hacked.

871
40:52.500 --> 40:56.043
And that is even they think it's hacked.

872
40:58.680 --> 41:00.060
Okay, moving on.

873
41:00.060 --> 41:01.950
Cybersecurity state awareness.

874
41:01.950 --> 41:03.963
<v ->I can grab this one quick.</v>
<v ->Sure.</v>

875
41:04.800 --> 41:06.390
<v ->So the idea like it says in the slide is</v>

876
41:06.390 --> 41:08.670
to support some kind of logging in the device

877
41:08.670 --> 41:10.530
or the product I should say.

878
41:10.530 --> 41:15.000
The goal here is to support even folk ad hoc forensics

879
41:15.000 --> 41:16.440
by the user perhaps,

880
41:16.440 --> 41:18.570
but not necessarily the baseline is

881
41:18.570 --> 41:19.860
that this data's collected somewhere

882
41:19.860 --> 41:21.930
within the product ecosystem.

883
41:21.930 --> 41:24.780
So if a update were to fail, say,

884
41:24.780 --> 41:29.040
or if it for some reason a encryption algorithm defaulted

885
41:29.040 --> 41:33.000
to something that wasn't acceptable to the particular user

886
41:33.000 --> 41:36.810
or some other context of the ecosystem, it's captured

887
41:36.810 --> 41:40.770
and that data can then be accessed and we know it's secure.

888
41:40.770 --> 41:42.150
We know that that data can be trusted

889
41:42.150 --> 41:43.650
by some forensics entity.

890
41:43.650 --> 41:45.360
Might be the manufacturer themselves,

891
41:45.360 --> 41:47.070
might be another third party looking into something

892
41:47.070 --> 41:49.020
that happened.
<v ->Or even, you know,</v>

893
41:49.020 --> 41:51.660
multiple attempts to log in with the wrong password.

894
41:51.660 --> 41:53.549
<v ->Certainly yes.</v>
<v ->Right.</v>

895
41:53.549 --> 41:55.810
But the key is to be able to have

896
41:58.740 --> 42:01.260
an effective forensic investigation

897
42:01.260 --> 42:04.740
and figure out what happened where the problem was

898
42:04.740 --> 42:06.000
so that it can be fixed.

899
42:06.000 --> 42:09.330
<v ->Exactly.</v>
<v ->And now does the consumer,</v>

900
42:09.330 --> 42:10.200
I think there was something

901
42:10.200 --> 42:12.000
about the manufacturer.
<v ->Yeah, I mentioned</v>

902
42:12.000 --> 42:12.833
at the top, you know,

903
42:12.833 --> 42:15.090
a consumer may have a reason to access this

904
42:15.090 --> 42:17.730
for some products, but for many products,

905
42:17.730 --> 42:20.790
especially the full scope of what would be captured

906
42:20.790 --> 42:24.770
to support forensics, effective forensics user wouldn't need

907
42:24.770 --> 42:26.106
or should not be able

908
42:26.106 --> 42:27.300
to access that.
<v ->But the manufacturer</v>

909
42:27.300 --> 42:30.240
should be getting data,

910
42:30.240 --> 42:32.390
I mean this is unfortunately this is the, you know,

911
42:32.390 --> 42:34.410
ET is phoning home again,

912
42:34.410 --> 42:36.120
issue that people have with privacy.

913
42:36.120 --> 42:39.600
But the manufacturer getting data that says, you know,

914
42:39.600 --> 42:42.030
this particular thing is happening across the board

915
42:42.030 --> 42:44.160
to many of my devices,

916
42:44.160 --> 42:45.930
it's a call to action for the developers.

917
42:45.930 --> 42:47.580
<v ->Exactly.</v>
<v ->Terrific. Terrific.</v>

918
42:47.580 --> 42:49.030
I think this one is a little,

919
42:50.190 --> 42:52.200
was one of the most difficult ones for me to appreciate

920
42:52.200 --> 42:54.630
and I appreciate the clarity.

921
42:54.630 --> 42:55.463
All right, let's talk about

922
42:55.463 --> 42:56.820
the non-technical requirements.

923
42:56.820 --> 42:59.820
So that was a quick walk through the six major categories

924
42:59.820 --> 43:03.150
of technical requirements from the 8259 baseline

925
43:03.150 --> 43:06.420
that migrated into the 8425 consumer profile.

926
43:06.420 --> 43:07.530
These are NIST documents,

927
43:07.530 --> 43:09.930
so you can find them online very easily.

928
43:09.930 --> 43:12.663
8425 is the key document for this program.

929
43:13.590 --> 43:15.557
But what does the organization need to do.

930
43:15.557 --> 43:16.500
<v ->Right?</v>
<v ->I can take</v>

931
43:16.500 --> 43:17.450
this one too, Mike.

932
43:18.750 --> 43:20.280
So we're talking about non-technical now,

933
43:20.280 --> 43:22.440
these are things the organization would be doing,

934
43:22.440 --> 43:24.874
doesn't necessarily be reflected through the products,

935
43:24.874 --> 43:26.790
features or functions.

936
43:26.790 --> 43:29.870
One of the core non-technical capabilities we talk about

937
43:29.870 --> 43:33.783
in 8425 is documentation, excuse me,

938
43:34.800 --> 43:36.900
this is sets of information collected,

939
43:36.900 --> 43:39.180
what we say pre-market and post-market.

940
43:39.180 --> 43:41.400
So throughout the entire life cycle of a product

941
43:41.400 --> 43:43.290
that show all sorts of different things,

942
43:43.290 --> 43:45.090
it's contextual to the product, right?

943
43:45.090 --> 43:48.510
A few examples of what is required across the border.

944
43:48.510 --> 43:52.290
Given on the slide here for pre-market, for, well for both

945
43:52.290 --> 43:53.700
of them, but I'm gonna stick to the pre-market,

946
43:53.700 --> 43:55.020
just to keep it short.

947
43:55.020 --> 43:56.850
The list of the IoT components like we were talking about

948
43:56.850 --> 43:58.560
earlier, where is the cloud?

949
43:58.560 --> 44:01.770
What is it, what kind of app are you using to support it,

950
44:01.770 --> 44:02.880
the product itself.

951
44:02.880 --> 44:05.250
And then of course as what we were just discussing,

952
44:05.250 --> 44:08.160
how you might meet those baseline product criteria,

953
44:08.160 --> 44:09.630
particularly the technical ones.

954
44:09.630 --> 44:11.460
What kind of data protection do you use?

955
44:11.460 --> 44:13.350
What kind of configuration is available?

956
44:13.350 --> 44:14.730
How can you set the asset ID

957
44:14.730 --> 44:16.260
or what kind of asset ID is used?

958
44:16.260 --> 44:17.850
For example.
<v ->Right, right, right, right.</v>

959
44:17.850 --> 44:22.850
So this is an example of ongoing compliance

960
44:23.520 --> 44:24.723
in the post market.

961
44:26.597 --> 44:28.923
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>
<v ->Okay, great.</v>

962
44:30.150 --> 44:32.853
Information and query reception.

963
44:33.810 --> 44:36.900
Grace is looking at me.
<v ->I can help with this one.</v>

964
44:36.900 --> 44:39.010
So essentially what this means

965
44:39.930 --> 44:43.333
is information intake, right?

966
44:43.333 --> 44:45.450
So essentially the manufacturer having

967
44:45.450 --> 44:49.230
some type of program we usually refer to them

968
44:49.230 --> 44:51.810
as vulnerability disclosure program

969
44:51.810 --> 44:54.660
or bug bounty program, CVE.

970
44:54.660 --> 44:58.710
And so that program allows individuals to

971
44:58.710 --> 45:02.920
report complaints or issues or incidents

972
45:03.940 --> 45:06.480
and usually cybersecurity incidents.

973
45:06.480 --> 45:07.650
I need to make that clear

974
45:07.650 --> 45:11.580
because this is not feature issues, right?

975
45:11.580 --> 45:14.580
It's not, oh, I'm locked out of my account,

976
45:14.580 --> 45:17.760
I forgot my password, I have a broken part.

977
45:17.760 --> 45:20.700
These are cybersecurity incidents.

978
45:20.700 --> 45:24.150
So you're looking at your bugs, your vulnerabilities,

979
45:24.150 --> 45:28.020
and I believe that if you have these programs in place,

980
45:28.020 --> 45:30.030
which there could be more,

981
45:30.030 --> 45:34.233
and having a point of contact to be able to report those,

982
45:35.070 --> 45:36.990
that's going to be really important.

983
45:36.990 --> 45:38.400
It helps with, you know,

984
45:38.400 --> 45:41.753
some market surveillance, which is great.

985
45:41.753 --> 45:43.770
And then also if anything is found, it's going

986
45:43.770 --> 45:46.800
to help boost the security of those devices

987
45:46.800 --> 45:48.450
because when we go back to software updates,

988
45:48.450 --> 45:51.180
you can make those updates and push them out and make

989
45:51.180 --> 45:53.443
the products more secure.
<v ->Well then there's</v>

990
45:53.443 --> 45:56.220
a specific advertised point of contact

991
45:56.220 --> 46:01.220
for security researchers to say, hey, I found this thing.

992
46:01.410 --> 46:03.120
A lot of that exists now,

993
46:03.120 --> 46:05.310
but it's sometimes a problem for a researcher

994
46:05.310 --> 46:06.420
to reach the right people,

995
46:06.420 --> 46:08.490
especially in very large companies.

996
46:08.490 --> 46:09.323
<v Grace>Right.</v>

997
46:09.323 --> 46:10.200
And it could be something as simple

998
46:10.200 --> 46:13.350
as security@company.com, right?

999
46:13.350 --> 46:15.090
It doesn't need to be, oh,

1000
46:15.090 --> 46:17.880
contact this person at this time, these days.

1001
46:17.880 --> 46:19.590
I mean, just a general inbox

1002
46:19.590 --> 46:21.300
would be great.
<v ->Yeah, we recommend</v>

1003
46:21.300 --> 46:23.730
security at domain name

1004
46:23.730 --> 46:25.830
as just the easiest, simplest way.

1005
46:25.830 --> 46:28.170
And that's actually what researchers have told me

1006
46:28.170 --> 46:32.490
they usually do first is they just put the word security at

1007
46:32.490 --> 46:33.780
and then the domain of the company

1008
46:33.780 --> 46:36.021
and then see if that gets a response.

1009
46:36.021 --> 46:41.021
Okay, so that's information reception,

1010
46:41.640 --> 46:44.370
taking in security information

1011
46:44.370 --> 46:46.020
from the ecosystem.
<v ->Yes.</v>

1012
46:46.020 --> 46:48.600
And then you have information dissemination,

1013
46:48.600 --> 46:51.870
and this is pushing out information.

1014
46:51.870 --> 46:54.690
So this is where manufacturers

1015
46:54.690 --> 46:57.450
for any cyber security relevant information

1016
46:57.450 --> 47:01.293
that may come across specifically maybe from these queries.

1017
47:02.220 --> 47:05.370
So then this is where they are pushing that information out

1018
47:05.370 --> 47:07.980
to relevant people, right?

1019
47:07.980 --> 47:09.990
So that's your customers.

1020
47:09.990 --> 47:12.930
If there's a breach and something happens

1021
47:12.930 --> 47:14.940
and there are steps that need to be taken

1022
47:14.940 --> 47:18.510
or actions to rectify that, then they need to make

1023
47:18.510 --> 47:21.570
that information available and put that out there.

1024
47:21.570 --> 47:25.050
Likewise, it's not, I mean that could also be

1025
47:25.050 --> 47:29.040
mitigation operations, it could be maintenance operations,

1026
47:29.040 --> 47:31.050
could be terms of support or service.

1027
47:31.050 --> 47:32.760
So there's a lot of different things

1028
47:32.760 --> 47:35.850
that it could be, but not just customers.

1029
47:35.850 --> 47:38.700
You also wanna look at your external stakeholders.

1030
47:38.700 --> 47:42.360
So that includes, you know, third party support,

1031
47:42.360 --> 47:46.770
any supply chain partners, certifiers, you know,

1032
47:46.770 --> 47:47.880
whoever it's going to impact

1033
47:47.880 --> 47:49.630
and needs to have this information.

1034
47:51.228 --> 47:54.060
So a good way to think about it is like, okay,

1035
47:54.060 --> 47:58.260
we need to have information being brought in

1036
47:58.260 --> 47:59.910
and then based on that information

1037
47:59.910 --> 48:02.940
and if it is verified, what do we,

1038
48:02.940 --> 48:04.380
what do the manufacturers need to do

1039
48:04.380 --> 48:06.780
and communicate to everybody else in order

1040
48:06.780 --> 48:09.930
to let everybody know.
<v ->So I find out that</v>

1041
48:09.930 --> 48:11.670
log 4J affects my products

1042
48:11.670 --> 48:15.030
and I need to send out an advisory to, you know,

1043
48:15.030 --> 48:20.030
the test lab and to my customers and Chairwoman Rosenworcel.

1044
48:23.393 --> 48:25.920
<v ->Yeah, exactly.</v>
<v ->And when those,</v>

1045
48:25.920 --> 48:29.160
when problems are found in open source that's used

1046
48:29.160 --> 48:31.110
by lots of folks that it get fed back

1047
48:31.110 --> 48:32.580
into the open source process.

1048
48:32.580 --> 48:34.320
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->And again,</v>

1049
48:34.320 --> 48:37.260
raising security across the board.

1050
48:37.260 --> 48:38.093
Terrific.

1051
48:38.093 --> 48:39.270
What's the risk assessment thing?

1052
48:41.340 --> 48:43.613
<v ->I can give some details on that if you like.</v>

1053
48:44.520 --> 48:46.290
So risk assessment

1054
48:46.290 --> 48:50.580
as we're the CTA 2119 effort landed is recommended

1055
48:50.580 --> 48:52.950
but not required to be certified.

1056
48:52.950 --> 48:55.710
So if you meet all the other requirements, you may not need

1057
48:55.710 --> 48:59.220
to produce the risk assessment or threat model

1058
48:59.220 --> 49:01.470
or whatever you might call it for your product.

1059
49:01.470 --> 49:04.960
But from this perspective, we feel that your application

1060
49:05.943 --> 49:07.950
of any cybersecurity is gonna be undergirded by

1061
49:07.950 --> 49:10.800
that threat model or that risk assessment.

1062
49:10.800 --> 49:13.530
How you are securing the broader ecosystem

1063
49:13.530 --> 49:15.780
and how you might imagine your customers are gonna secure

1064
49:15.780 --> 49:19.470
the product and the consumer space, you know, that's ad hoc.

1065
49:19.470 --> 49:22.110
There's not a CSF that consumers are gonna be using

1066
49:22.110 --> 49:23.880
that you can look to, to understand their

1067
49:23.880 --> 49:25.470
exact requirements and needs.

1068
49:25.470 --> 49:29.520
Which is why I think the good work that's gone into 2119

1069
49:29.520 --> 49:31.350
helps demonstrate a lot of the kind of security

1070
49:31.350 --> 49:33.030
that you would expect across the board.

1071
49:33.030 --> 49:38.010
But in some cases there may be products that need

1072
49:38.010 --> 49:40.380
to communicate a risk assessment

1073
49:40.380 --> 49:44.070
as far as information dissemination as part of the process

1074
49:44.070 --> 49:48.030
of being certified for one reason or another,

1075
49:48.030 --> 49:50.940
they're doing it differently.
<v ->Okay, terrific.</v>

1076
49:50.940 --> 49:52.440
I mean, risk assessment's part

1077
49:52.440 --> 49:53.760
of a secure development life cycle.

1078
49:53.760 --> 49:55.830
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->And you start off saying,</v>

1079
49:55.830 --> 49:58.773
what am I at risk for here in the first place?

1080
49:59.632 --> 50:01.080
Okay, thank you.

1081
50:01.080 --> 50:02.883
Product education and awareness.

1082
50:03.892 --> 50:06.400
Bring us home.

1083
50:06.400 --> 50:08.190
Bring us home.
<v ->Bring us home.</v>

1084
50:08.190 --> 50:09.023
Thank you.

1085
50:10.092 --> 50:12.660
So in addition to all of these other things

1086
50:12.660 --> 50:17.660
that it's important to provide consumers information

1087
50:18.750 --> 50:22.200
that they need about this whole, what the label means

1088
50:22.200 --> 50:27.200
and what the implications of that are.

1089
50:28.200 --> 50:30.600
Things like what they need

1090
50:30.600 --> 50:33.240
to know about changing configuration settings,

1091
50:33.240 --> 50:37.710
requirements system passwords and other access controls.

1092
50:37.710 --> 50:42.030
The fact that software updates are, you know, available

1093
50:42.030 --> 50:46.120
and for how long and what the mechanism is

1094
50:47.460 --> 50:50.314
for those updates to happen either automatically

1095
50:50.314 --> 50:54.660
or you know, periodically, you might get notified

1096
50:54.660 --> 50:57.960
that there's an update available, click here to do it.

1097
50:57.960 --> 50:58.910
That sort of thing.

1098
51:00.540 --> 51:05.020
And that, you know, all of this sort of includes

1099
51:07.380 --> 51:09.150
how the maintenance of the product works,

1100
51:09.150 --> 51:11.310
including what happens after this.

1101
51:11.310 --> 51:15.690
The support period is over, you know, it's possible

1102
51:15.690 --> 51:18.040
that security updates persist beyond

1103
51:21.210 --> 51:26.100
other warranty issues or shorter even.

1104
51:26.100 --> 51:29.490
And so to explain to consumers

1105
51:29.490 --> 51:34.490
what all the details, benefits and maybe cautionary tales

1106
51:36.210 --> 51:41.210
about how to operate the product

1107
51:41.370 --> 51:43.650
that has the certification.
<v ->All good. All good.</v>

1108
51:43.650 --> 51:44.760
Thank you. Thank you.

1109
51:44.760 --> 51:48.270
I'm gonna jump to one last slide, get your cameras out.

1110
51:48.270 --> 51:52.890
This slide has a QR code that goes to a CTA landing page

1111
51:52.890 --> 51:54.930
with more information about the program.

1112
51:54.930 --> 51:56.130
We will be updating that

1113
51:56.130 --> 51:59.010
with some information from UL Solutions.

1114
51:59.010 --> 52:00.690
Chante and I will need to coordinate on that.

1115
52:00.690 --> 52:02.790
But to make sure that you can get into that effort,

1116
52:02.790 --> 52:05.680
the 90 day stakeholder process, there's our

1117
52:07.590 --> 52:10.530
contact points, standards@CTA.tech if you're interested

1118
52:10.530 --> 52:12.120
in that part of the process.

1119
52:12.120 --> 52:15.150
And finally, the FCC has a booth

1120
52:15.150 --> 52:16.860
for the US Cyber Trust Mark.

1121
52:16.860 --> 52:19.980
It's the second level of the Venetian,

1122
52:19.980 --> 52:21.750
it's at the top of the escalators.

1123
52:21.750 --> 52:23.400
When you get to the top of the escalators, turn around

1124
52:23.400 --> 52:25.380
and go back a little bit and you'll see it there.

1125
52:25.380 --> 52:27.930
And they've got flyers and information

1126
52:27.930 --> 52:30.930
and people to talk to you about the US Cyber Trust Mark.

1127
52:30.930 --> 52:34.500
So that's level two at the Venetian, it's SUL-2

1128
52:34.500 --> 52:35.970
and you can also find it in your app.

1129
52:35.970 --> 52:37.350
There are multiple FCCs in the app,

1130
52:37.350 --> 52:39.030
so make sure you find the right one.

1131
52:39.030 --> 52:44.030
I want to thank my panelists for the brilliant analysis

1132
52:44.220 --> 52:46.590
and update for everyone here today.

1133
52:46.590 --> 52:49.170
I want to thank our esteemed guests

1134
52:49.170 --> 52:52.890
and I also want to thank all the media who got up and left

1135
52:52.890 --> 52:54.720
after our esteemed guests spoke,

1136
52:54.720 --> 52:56.903
because that was actually pretty amusing to see.

1137
52:57.840 --> 53:00.980
So ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for coming.

1138
53:00.980 --> 53:04.089
(audience applauding)

1139
53:04.089 --> 53:06.672
(bright music)
