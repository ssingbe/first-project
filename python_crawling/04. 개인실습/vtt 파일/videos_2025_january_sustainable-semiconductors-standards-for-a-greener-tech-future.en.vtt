00:00.216 --> 00:02.883
(bright music)

2
00:12.330 --> 00:15.210
<v ->Hello, everyone, welcome to our panel</v>

3
00:15.210 --> 00:17.670
on sustainable semiconductors.

4
00:17.670 --> 00:19.470
I am Syed Alam.

5
00:19.470 --> 00:21.720
I'm a partner at McKinsey &amp; Company

6
00:21.720 --> 00:24.303
with focus on semiconductors.

7
00:25.500 --> 00:29.130
We should start with some introduction of our panel.

8
00:29.130 --> 00:30.690
Veronica, we can start with you.

9
00:30.690 --> 00:34.050
<v ->Absolutely, yeah, hi, everyone, I'm Veronica Lancaster.</v>

10
00:34.050 --> 00:36.330
I am the vice president of standards

11
00:36.330 --> 00:39.210
at the Consumer Technology Association.

12
00:39.210 --> 00:41.640
I'm also the president

13
00:41.640 --> 00:43.920
of the US National Committee of the IEC

14
00:43.920 --> 00:47.040
which is a global standards organization.

15
00:47.040 --> 00:48.870
Standards are near and dear to my heart,

16
00:48.870 --> 00:52.200
so I'll talk a little bit about standards today

17
00:52.200 --> 00:55.320
and how those can play a critical role

18
00:55.320 --> 00:57.690
when it comes to sustainability.

19
00:57.690 --> 00:58.680
In addition to that,

20
00:58.680 --> 01:01.470
I'm on the American National Standards

21
01:01.470 --> 01:02.700
Institute Board of Directors

22
01:02.700 --> 01:04.080
and the IAC Board of Directors,

23
01:04.080 --> 01:06.300
so it's a passion for me.

24
01:06.300 --> 01:08.821
I'm happy to be here, yeah, thank you.

25
01:08.821 --> 01:10.530
<v Syed>Welcome, thank you, Nancy?</v>

26
01:10.530 --> 01:12.660
<v ->Hi, I'm Nancy Greco at IBM</v>

27
01:12.660 --> 01:14.550
and I've been there for 40 years.

28
01:14.550 --> 01:16.350
So I came in as a chemist

29
01:16.350 --> 01:18.240
and started developing processes,

30
01:18.240 --> 01:20.160
and never thought I'd stay,

31
01:20.160 --> 01:21.510
but 40 years went by

32
01:21.510 --> 01:24.120
and I've developed every type of semiconductor process.

33
01:24.120 --> 01:26.580
and automation for the last 15 years,

34
01:26.580 --> 01:29.160
I went into research to do AI

35
01:29.160 --> 01:32.100
'cause semiconductor always had a big data problem

36
01:32.100 --> 01:36.180
and so working on AI that led into large language models.

37
01:36.180 --> 01:38.430
So I really do feel I've been growing up

38
01:38.430 --> 01:41.220
with the semiconductor and AI industry

39
01:41.220 --> 01:42.690
and with the CHIPS Act,

40
01:42.690 --> 01:46.140
I was so excited that semiconductor is cool again.

41
01:46.140 --> 01:47.580
So I do a lot of recruiting

42
01:47.580 --> 01:49.890
for students to come into semiconductor

43
01:49.890 --> 01:51.663
and just excited to be here today.

44
01:53.310 --> 01:56.340
<v ->Hi, I'm Sujata Neidig with NXP Semiconductors.</v>

45
01:56.340 --> 02:00.240
I've also grown up in the semiconductor world over 30 years

46
02:00.240 --> 02:02.460
and I'm a director of marketing

47
02:02.460 --> 02:04.800
on our wireless connectivity portfolio.

48
02:04.800 --> 02:07.590
I also am, standards are near and dear to my heart

49
02:07.590 --> 02:09.210
too on the wireless connectivity side.

50
02:09.210 --> 02:11.700
I serve for NXP on the board of directors

51
02:11.700 --> 02:14.310
for Connectivity Standards Alliance and Thread Group.

52
02:14.310 --> 02:16.530
And really excited, we've had some pre-discussion.

53
02:16.530 --> 02:19.890
I think this is gonna be a fascinating panel discussion.

54
02:19.890 --> 02:21.420
<v Syed>Thank you, Deok-kee?</v>

55
02:21.420 --> 02:23.877
<v ->Hi, my name is Deok-kee Kim.</v>

56
02:23.877 --> 02:26.880
I'm honored to be invited

57
02:26.880 --> 02:31.880
to this CES panel on sustainable semiconductors.

58
02:32.700 --> 02:34.410
I'm currently a professor

59
02:34.410 --> 02:37.140
at Sejong University in Seoul, Korea,

60
02:37.140 --> 02:39.510
and previously I also worked

61
02:39.510 --> 02:42.720
for IBM Micro Electronics Division

62
02:42.720 --> 02:47.490
and also Samsung Semiconductors for approximately 10 years,

63
02:47.490 --> 02:49.568
and my career in semiconductor field

64
02:49.568 --> 02:54.060
is about 25 years after my PhD.

65
02:54.060 --> 02:57.450
I also have some government jobs as a program director

66
02:57.450 --> 03:00.510
at National Research Foundation of Korea

67
03:00.510 --> 03:03.600
in the division of semiconductors.

68
03:03.600 --> 03:05.160
Currently I'm also involved

69
03:05.160 --> 03:07.923
with some of the standardization work.

70
03:08.880 --> 03:11.310
I'm involved with two committees.

71
03:11.310 --> 03:14.610
One is IEC-TC 47 semiconductors.

72
03:14.610 --> 03:19.610
The other one is IEC-TC 124 wearable Devices.

73
03:19.830 --> 03:21.990
Happy to meet you, thank you.

74
03:21.990 --> 03:25.050
<v ->Thank you. Deok-kee, this topic is very interesting</v>

75
03:25.050 --> 03:28.380
because semiconductor plays such a unique role

76
03:28.380 --> 03:30.780
in the overall technology ecosystem.

77
03:30.780 --> 03:35.780
Semiconductors are enabling all the greener technologies,

78
03:36.000 --> 03:38.490
smart and energy-efficient products.

79
03:38.490 --> 03:40.020
At the same time,

80
03:40.020 --> 03:41.910
it takes a lot of energy

81
03:41.910 --> 03:45.000
and water to actually produce the semiconductors also

82
03:45.000 --> 03:46.350
and in our panel discussion

83
03:46.350 --> 03:49.683
we'll cover both aspects of these topics.

84
03:50.520 --> 03:52.560
Maybe we can start with the topic

85
03:52.560 --> 03:55.830
around how semiconductors are enabling

86
03:55.830 --> 03:58.980
the greener technology and sustainable products?

87
03:58.980 --> 04:00.570
Sujata, maybe you can elaborate on that?

88
04:00.570 --> 04:02.820
<v ->Yeah, sure, first of all, about semiconductors,</v>

89
04:02.820 --> 04:04.650
I'll say when I started in semiconductors,

90
04:04.650 --> 04:05.760
nobody in my family

91
04:05.760 --> 04:08.010
or friends knew what a semiconductor was.

92
04:08.010 --> 04:09.150
And now after Covid,

93
04:09.150 --> 04:10.740
it's everybody in CHIPS Act,

94
04:10.740 --> 04:11.760
everybody knows what it is.

95
04:11.760 --> 04:14.790
So it is exciting to see that people understand

96
04:14.790 --> 04:18.600
the technologies that are driving the way they live, work,

97
04:18.600 --> 04:20.430
engage in the world,

98
04:20.430 --> 04:23.910
and semiconductors, I was a product engineer at one time

99
04:23.910 --> 04:26.370
and spent a lot of time in fabs.

100
04:26.370 --> 04:28.020
It does require a lot of resources.

101
04:28.020 --> 04:30.720
At NXP and I think all of the semiconductor companies,

102
04:30.720 --> 04:33.540
there's quite a bit of work investment

103
04:33.540 --> 04:36.330
in how do we maximize efficiencies?

104
04:36.330 --> 04:38.250
How do we reduce the energy use?

105
04:38.250 --> 04:41.010
I know water is a big aspect

106
04:41.010 --> 04:42.450
and Nancy will speak to this,

107
04:42.450 --> 04:45.570
but how to reuse water, recycle water.

108
04:45.570 --> 04:47.250
So those are all areas that companies

109
04:47.250 --> 04:48.690
like NXP are working on,

110
04:48.690 --> 04:51.570
but as I said, I'm on the product side

111
04:51.570 --> 04:54.150
and building chips is one thing,

112
04:54.150 --> 04:57.060
and how we're building chips to not just be faster,

113
04:57.060 --> 04:59.880
but lower power, enable more capabilities

114
04:59.880 --> 05:02.340
so that the end products they go into

115
05:02.340 --> 05:05.280
can be lower power footprint.

116
05:05.280 --> 05:08.010
And then the products that we are looking at

117
05:08.010 --> 05:11.160
and equipping with is the IoT market.

118
05:11.160 --> 05:13.740
So all these Internet of Things devices

119
05:13.740 --> 05:15.300
being connected all the time,

120
05:15.300 --> 05:19.560
I know that that puts a lot of weight

121
05:19.560 --> 05:21.540
on the servers and stuff,

122
05:21.540 --> 05:23.610
but we really are driving things

123
05:23.610 --> 05:25.290
to have intelligence at the edge

124
05:25.290 --> 05:27.630
and bringing more intelligence to the edge

125
05:27.630 --> 05:29.730
so that processing of the data

126
05:29.730 --> 05:32.460
and taking action on that can be done at the edge

127
05:32.460 --> 05:34.350
and give the immediate result

128
05:34.350 --> 05:37.560
without having to use the servers.

129
05:37.560 --> 05:39.210
And then to standards,

130
05:39.210 --> 05:41.040
that's an area that I've spent a lot of time

131
05:41.040 --> 05:42.630
over the last 10 years.

132
05:42.630 --> 05:43.860
These are tough challenges

133
05:43.860 --> 05:46.800
and if we don't address them together as an industry,

134
05:46.800 --> 05:48.660
it makes it nearly impossible.

135
05:48.660 --> 05:51.540
So at NXP, we have invested

136
05:51.540 --> 05:54.870
a lot more in standards and open standards

137
05:54.870 --> 05:56.460
and I think we see this shift

138
05:56.460 --> 05:59.850
from building proprietary ecosystems of devices

139
05:59.850 --> 06:01.830
to more open standards.

140
06:01.830 --> 06:04.230
So if you're not familiar on the connectivity side,

141
06:04.230 --> 06:09.180
Matter is a wireless protocol that enables devices

142
06:09.180 --> 06:11.910
to all be able to speak the same language to each other

143
06:11.910 --> 06:16.110
regardless of what brand the company is that makes it.

144
06:16.110 --> 06:18.990
In our booth, at the NXP booth here,

145
06:18.990 --> 06:23.430
we have a intelligent energy home demonstration

146
06:23.430 --> 06:27.420
to really show how being able to monitor the energy usage

147
06:27.420 --> 06:29.490
of the different devices in the home

148
06:29.490 --> 06:31.380
and what is going on on the grid,

149
06:31.380 --> 06:33.270
and being able to leverage that information

150
06:33.270 --> 06:35.730
and make intelligent automated decisions

151
06:35.730 --> 06:39.000
without having to put that burden on the user.

152
06:39.000 --> 06:41.040
And this is in the smart home environment,

153
06:41.040 --> 06:43.980
but it really scales into buildings.

154
06:43.980 --> 06:45.750
I remember a couple of years ago,

155
06:45.750 --> 06:48.870
somebody from Schneider I was talking to made this comment

156
06:48.870 --> 06:51.270
about I think 85% of the buildings

157
06:51.270 --> 06:55.050
that exist in 30 years are ones that exist today.

158
06:55.050 --> 06:57.420
So there's not a lot of new construction

159
06:57.420 --> 07:00.210
and the only way that we can make buildings

160
07:00.210 --> 07:04.950
more efficient is through IoT and wireless connectivity

161
07:04.950 --> 07:06.600
because you can't go

162
07:06.600 --> 07:08.550
and rewire things in buildings

163
07:08.550 --> 07:09.990
and tear down walls, right?

164
07:09.990 --> 07:14.400
So we really look at this from a holistic,

165
07:14.400 --> 07:17.820
a more system-level approach on how do we build chips

166
07:17.820 --> 07:19.680
that can enable these technologies?

167
07:19.680 --> 07:23.640
And then how do product manufacturers

168
07:23.640 --> 07:27.030
build products that help users,

169
07:27.030 --> 07:27.990
whether it's in your home

170
07:27.990 --> 07:31.410
or buildings where you work, be more efficient?

171
07:31.410 --> 07:33.630
And I think that is an important aspect

172
07:33.630 --> 07:35.040
because as much work as we do

173
07:35.040 --> 07:37.470
on the semiconductor manufacturing side,

174
07:37.470 --> 07:41.550
the demand is going to be there to drive these use cases

175
07:41.550 --> 07:43.650
and experiences for users.

176
07:43.650 --> 07:46.350
And the more that we can automate

177
07:46.350 --> 07:49.050
and bring intelligence without having to put

178
07:49.050 --> 07:50.910
that burden on the user,

179
07:50.910 --> 07:53.340
the more impact we can make.

180
07:53.340 --> 07:56.640
<v ->Thank you, I think you brought to life very good examples</v>

181
07:56.640 --> 08:01.050
of how semiconductors are enabling greener technologies

182
08:01.050 --> 08:02.310
and it's driving the demand.

183
08:02.310 --> 08:03.750
So building on that,

184
08:03.750 --> 08:06.270
there's a lot of demand for the semiconductor chips

185
08:06.270 --> 08:08.280
based on the requirements

186
08:08.280 --> 08:12.060
for greener, smart, energy-efficient products,

187
08:12.060 --> 08:15.180
plus AI and all the compute needs.

188
08:15.180 --> 08:17.460
Also some of the geopolitical factors,

189
08:17.460 --> 08:19.440
all of these things are driving

190
08:19.440 --> 08:22.770
a lot of fabs getting built around the globe.

191
08:22.770 --> 08:27.420
Maybe, Nancy, you can talk about how a lot of these fabs

192
08:27.420 --> 08:30.240
getting built impacts the environment.

193
08:30.240 --> 08:32.250
<v ->Sure, with the excitement of AI,</v>

194
08:32.250 --> 08:34.350
every country wants to make sure

195
08:34.350 --> 08:36.840
they have access to AI chips.

196
08:36.840 --> 08:39.630
So what we've been seeing over the past couple of years,

197
08:39.630 --> 08:41.850
heavy investments now going

198
08:41.850 --> 08:44.550
into not just a few countries like the US,

199
08:44.550 --> 08:46.830
but many, many countries.

200
08:46.830 --> 08:48.030
So in the US alone,

201
08:48.030 --> 08:52.350
we're gonna 3X the semiconductor capacity by next year

202
08:52.350 --> 08:56.250
or actually it's 2025, by this year, 3X.

203
08:56.250 --> 08:59.280
Worldwide, the prediction is because other countries

204
08:59.280 --> 09:00.870
are building their own semiconductor,

205
09:00.870 --> 09:02.970
that's gonna increase to 10X.

206
09:02.970 --> 09:05.220
So on one hand, as a semiconductor engineer,

207
09:05.220 --> 09:07.290
it's like yay, we're cool.

208
09:07.290 --> 09:09.330
But be honest, as an environmentalist,

209
09:09.330 --> 09:11.520
I'm very concerned, why?

210
09:11.520 --> 09:15.300
A typical semiconductor fab the size of TSMC

211
09:15.300 --> 09:20.300
will use 75 million gallons of water a day.

212
09:21.300 --> 09:24.180
Today, if you take all the semiconductor collectively,

213
09:24.180 --> 09:25.680
they're consuming 2%

214
09:25.680 --> 09:29.430
of the entire electricity available today.

215
09:29.430 --> 09:31.560
And then of course waste.

216
09:31.560 --> 09:33.690
Unfortunately semiconductor, and I've developed

217
09:33.690 --> 09:38.640
processes using fluorinated gases, heavily used PFAs.

218
09:38.640 --> 09:40.890
They're called the forever chemical.

219
09:40.890 --> 09:42.270
We can't get rid of it.

220
09:42.270 --> 09:44.250
There's just no way, in my opinion,

221
09:44.250 --> 09:46.710
in my lifetime that we're gonna remove it.

222
09:46.710 --> 09:48.240
So as an environmentalist,

223
09:48.240 --> 09:50.700
it's great that we're bringing on this capacity.

224
09:50.700 --> 09:53.910
AI is fascinating, it's gonna help humans

225
09:53.910 --> 09:55.980
do things they've never done before,

226
09:55.980 --> 09:58.260
but we're gonna need to use that AI

227
09:58.260 --> 10:00.660
to understand how to build them

228
10:00.660 --> 10:03.033
with no impact on the environment.

229
10:03.988 --> 10:07.290
<v ->And Nancy, AI can also be used in the factories</v>

230
10:07.290 --> 10:12.290
and processes to help create more efficiencies.

231
10:12.930 --> 10:15.420
<v ->Absolutely, let me just touch on that for a second.</v>

232
10:15.420 --> 10:16.980
So one of the challenges you had,

233
10:16.980 --> 10:18.480
there's regulations coming out

234
10:18.480 --> 10:22.110
and saying you got to reduce water, or energy, or PFAs.

235
10:22.110 --> 10:23.850
And rightly so, I'll be honest,

236
10:23.850 --> 10:26.707
the semiconductor clients are saying,

237
10:26.707 --> 10:28.380
"I don't know how much I'm using."

238
10:28.380 --> 10:31.920
All right, I use 75 million gallons of water a day.

239
10:31.920 --> 10:33.720
How would I reduce that by 10%?

240
10:33.720 --> 10:35.250
I don't know who's using it.

241
10:35.250 --> 10:37.830
So we've been developing AI analytics

242
10:37.830 --> 10:40.320
that can go right down to the tool level.

243
10:40.320 --> 10:41.153
How do we do that?

244
10:41.153 --> 10:42.300
It's not that hard actually.

245
10:42.300 --> 10:43.133
You pull the data

246
10:43.133 --> 10:46.140
right off a water flow controller through a PLC

247
10:46.140 --> 10:47.400
or up through the SCADA.

248
10:47.400 --> 10:48.270
It's not that hard.

249
10:48.270 --> 10:50.070
Just never thought to do it before.

250
10:50.070 --> 10:52.230
Now that we're quantifying that data,

251
10:52.230 --> 10:55.230
we're saying okay, reduce here, reduce there,

252
10:55.230 --> 10:57.570
and so tool vendors are coming together

253
10:57.570 --> 11:00.600
and I think the real solution as an environmentalist,

254
11:00.600 --> 11:02.430
we have to come together.

255
11:02.430 --> 11:04.830
And what I like about semiconductor,

256
11:04.830 --> 11:06.930
we actually have the scientific

257
11:06.930 --> 11:11.400
and engineering horsepower to create sustainable processes.

258
11:11.400 --> 11:12.270
And I'll be honest,

259
11:12.270 --> 11:14.430
it's more unique than any other industries.

260
11:14.430 --> 11:17.850
Think of what it takes to create an AI chip

261
11:17.850 --> 11:22.290
where the interconnect is 1,000 times smaller than a hair.

262
11:22.290 --> 11:25.650
That's the brilliance and capability semiconductor has.

263
11:25.650 --> 11:28.653
We need to turn that on to sustainability.

264
11:29.520 --> 11:31.560
<v ->Yeah, I think you brought up a very good point</v>

265
11:31.560 --> 11:35.130
in terms of the PFAs

266
11:35.130 --> 11:37.830
and the process improvement.

267
11:37.830 --> 11:41.730
What are the steps the industry is taking

268
11:41.730 --> 11:44.130
and what are the things that industry

269
11:44.130 --> 11:46.230
or the semiconductor companies are doing

270
11:46.230 --> 11:49.950
to help alleviate some of these concerns?

271
11:49.950 --> 11:51.960
<v ->So let me take the PFAs first.</v>

272
11:51.960 --> 11:54.420
So there was regulation in the US that said

273
11:54.420 --> 11:55.770
by January of this year,

274
11:55.770 --> 11:57.960
you have to report all your PFA use.

275
11:57.960 --> 11:59.520
Whole bunch of lawyers were hired

276
11:59.520 --> 12:00.990
and that got extended.

277
12:00.990 --> 12:03.030
Now but looking at that regulation,

278
12:03.030 --> 12:04.830
it wasn't doable, right?

279
12:04.830 --> 12:05.910
How do you know what you're using?

280
12:05.910 --> 12:07.620
Just the same example with water.

281
12:07.620 --> 12:09.210
At least you can see that.

282
12:09.210 --> 12:13.020
But now what we're doing is working to instrument the tools

283
12:13.020 --> 12:14.730
to understand what they're using

284
12:14.730 --> 12:17.130
and I know in IBM research and others,

285
12:17.130 --> 12:18.007
we're starting to say,

286
12:18.007 --> 12:20.460
"I can't not use the fluorinated gases."

287
12:20.460 --> 12:23.130
Just can't, it takes 10 years qualified process

288
12:23.130 --> 12:24.330
if you didn't use it,

289
12:24.330 --> 12:26.250
but we're looking at the byproduct

290
12:26.250 --> 12:27.930
and what happens with a lot of the stuff,

291
12:27.930 --> 12:29.730
it has come up through a scrubber.

292
12:29.730 --> 12:32.370
Start introducing new chemicals

293
12:32.370 --> 12:35.190
that break it down in these new scrubbers

294
12:35.190 --> 12:38.100
and so that again, is we can figure out

295
12:38.100 --> 12:39.660
how to build the process.

296
12:39.660 --> 12:42.630
I think we can figure out how to render it,

297
12:42.630 --> 12:43.740
we call it abatement,

298
12:43.740 --> 12:46.710
to the point it's inert to the environment.

299
12:46.710 --> 12:48.810
So PFAs is a high level of focus.

300
12:48.810 --> 12:50.400
The regulation didn't help,

301
12:50.400 --> 12:52.020
but now research is coming in

302
12:52.020 --> 12:53.790
and saying we can do this.

303
12:53.790 --> 12:56.820
Water conservation and recycling is huge.

304
12:56.820 --> 12:58.650
A lot of the semiconductors doing that

305
12:58.650 --> 13:00.210
because you have to.

306
13:00.210 --> 13:03.990
And then energy, interesting enough, like Sujata said,

307
13:03.990 --> 13:06.930
a lot of the processes we've developed in semiconductor

308
13:06.930 --> 13:09.180
actually are core into solar

309
13:09.180 --> 13:11.700
and other types of renewable energy.

310
13:11.700 --> 13:13.650
But I would have to say right now,

311
13:13.650 --> 13:16.890
until you quantify it, they're not listening.

312
13:16.890 --> 13:19.920
It's like I use 75 million gallons of water a day?

313
13:19.920 --> 13:20.820
It's like yeah, you do,

314
13:20.820 --> 13:21.690
and you're in an area

315
13:21.690 --> 13:23.670
that there's not a lot of water, and guess what?

316
13:23.670 --> 13:26.820
The humans are noticing the lake is going down.

317
13:26.820 --> 13:30.030
So I think giving them data, quantify it,

318
13:30.030 --> 13:33.360
and now unleash your engineering, and AI,

319
13:33.360 --> 13:36.390
and quantum to figure out how to do this

320
13:36.390 --> 13:38.400
to be kind to the environment.

321
13:38.400 --> 13:42.243
<v ->What about in terms of electricity, power consumption,</v>

322
13:43.980 --> 13:44.970
what can we do about it

323
13:44.970 --> 13:47.760
in terms of one, renewable energy usage

324
13:47.760 --> 13:50.790
and second, just to reduce less of it?

325
13:50.790 --> 13:53.670
<v ->Well, first of all, in a semiconductor factory,</v>

326
13:53.670 --> 13:57.840
these tools have to stay powered on 24-7.

327
13:57.840 --> 13:59.190
If you turn them off

328
13:59.190 --> 14:02.580
and accidentally, drop at it, they're shut off,

329
14:02.580 --> 14:04.140
they don't function correctly.

330
14:04.140 --> 14:06.450
All sorts of chaos occurs.

331
14:06.450 --> 14:09.060
It's like your freezer not having electricity

332
14:09.060 --> 14:11.010
for two days, it's a mess.

333
14:11.010 --> 14:13.020
But what we can do is start looking

334
14:13.020 --> 14:16.260
at semiconductor has huge redundancy of tools.

335
14:16.260 --> 14:17.880
You don't buy one litho tool.

336
14:17.880 --> 14:21.540
You'll buy five or you'll buy 10 tools.

337
14:21.540 --> 14:23.970
If we start looking at the efficiency

338
14:23.970 --> 14:25.920
that you're using these tools,

339
14:25.920 --> 14:28.230
do the maintenance, keep them up and running,

340
14:28.230 --> 14:29.370
do the WHIP analysis,

341
14:29.370 --> 14:32.520
one approach is can I reduce the number of tools?

342
14:32.520 --> 14:34.530
The other is again, looking at it,

343
14:34.530 --> 14:35.730
and I'll just be honest,

344
14:35.730 --> 14:38.610
reducing energy in semiconductors' gonna be tough

345
14:38.610 --> 14:40.380
because you can't turn the tool off.

346
14:40.380 --> 14:42.030
But there's ways we're looking at

347
14:42.030 --> 14:43.447
and vendors are coming in saying,

348
14:43.447 --> 14:45.870
"I can consume less power."

349
14:45.870 --> 14:47.310
But as Sujata said too,

350
14:47.310 --> 14:50.640
we're creating the chips that can help analyze that

351
14:50.640 --> 14:52.410
to reduce the data centers,

352
14:52.410 --> 14:53.760
to reduce the machines.

353
14:53.760 --> 14:55.170
And we'll get there.

354
14:55.170 --> 14:58.050
It's kind of like gas consumption on a car.

355
14:58.050 --> 15:01.620
It's tough in semiconductor to reduce our energy,

356
15:01.620 --> 15:04.320
but now we're getting the capability to do that,

357
15:04.320 --> 15:07.890
but it's not gonna be coming in the next one to three years.

358
15:07.890 --> 15:10.110
<v ->Yeah, you brought up a interesting point.</v>

359
15:10.110 --> 15:12.090
The chips that we are manufacturing in the fabs

360
15:12.090 --> 15:14.250
will actually enable to make it

361
15:14.250 --> 15:17.193
in an energy-efficient way, cool.

362
15:18.540 --> 15:22.200
I think given that standards can help have

363
15:22.200 --> 15:25.590
a consistent, unified approach to these challenges,

364
15:25.590 --> 15:28.230
what do you think, Veronica, with your background,

365
15:28.230 --> 15:30.000
how standards can help with all of this?

366
15:30.000 --> 15:33.450
<v ->Yeah, so actually I thought it was a great segue</v>

367
15:33.450 --> 15:36.450
when you just mentioned all of the different learnings

368
15:36.450 --> 15:38.850
that the individual companies

369
15:38.850 --> 15:41.910
and the scientists, the chemists are figuring out

370
15:41.910 --> 15:43.590
how to use AI tools,

371
15:43.590 --> 15:45.060
how to get down to the tool level

372
15:45.060 --> 15:49.500
and figure out where do we make it more efficient?

373
15:49.500 --> 15:52.170
Where do we get rid of some of these forever chemicals?

374
15:52.170 --> 15:53.310
How can we do this?

375
15:53.310 --> 15:54.510
The more we do that

376
15:54.510 --> 15:55.530
and the more that we share

377
15:55.530 --> 15:58.230
with each other in standards development,

378
15:58.230 --> 16:03.120
then that's industry driving change, right, together.

379
16:03.120 --> 16:05.700
So I think that there's a lot that we can do there.

380
16:05.700 --> 16:07.710
Definitely energy efficiency standards,

381
16:07.710 --> 16:10.290
we're already doing work in that.

382
16:10.290 --> 16:13.650
And what I think is interesting is that there's such a,

383
16:13.650 --> 16:16.230
I know we said we're not gonna get too political up here,

384
16:16.230 --> 16:21.230
but at least when we started in the speaker room,

385
16:21.450 --> 16:23.340
but I think what's interesting

386
16:23.340 --> 16:26.010
is that when it comes to energy efficiency,

387
16:26.010 --> 16:31.010
we do find that the government does send a lot of engineers

388
16:31.290 --> 16:33.630
to the standards development arena

389
16:33.630 --> 16:36.720
because I think what they can do is learn from the chemist.

390
16:36.720 --> 16:39.570
They can learn from the engineers and the scientists

391
16:39.570 --> 16:42.300
and figure out well, what is the best way to do this?

392
16:42.300 --> 16:44.400
Rather than just coming up with it on their own.

393
16:44.400 --> 16:48.660
So I like that it's a very inclusive environment for that,

394
16:48.660 --> 16:49.493
but there's certainly lots of other areas we can get into.

395
16:49.493 --> 16:54.493
<v ->Veronica, also to your point, having industry involved</v>

396
16:54.870 --> 16:57.420
'cause governments can make regulations,

397
16:57.420 --> 17:00.120
but they can't make them deployable.

398
17:00.120 --> 17:03.390
They can't be deployed easily unless industry is there

399
17:03.390 --> 17:05.700
providing the inputs on what is reality

400
17:05.700 --> 17:09.210
on how to actually implement this legislation.

401
17:09.210 --> 17:11.520
I know there's been the Cyber Resilience Act.

402
17:11.520 --> 17:13.710
There's been climate change,

403
17:13.710 --> 17:15.690
lowering the carbon footprint goals in Europe

404
17:15.690 --> 17:19.140
that are really driving the IoT efforts too in buildings,

405
17:19.140 --> 17:20.160
that's what I said earlier,

406
17:20.160 --> 17:23.010
that they cannot meet these standards

407
17:23.010 --> 17:24.570
that have been set by the governments

408
17:24.570 --> 17:27.030
without adopting new technologies

409
17:27.030 --> 17:32.030
and making more intelligent and automated infrastructures.

410
17:33.390 --> 17:36.930
<v ->Right, right, so what's the end goal for us</v>

411
17:36.930 --> 17:40.020
is if we're able to get all of our manufacturers together

412
17:40.020 --> 17:44.160
and create the benchmarks, right, together,

413
17:44.160 --> 17:46.290
and then the government can then reference

414
17:46.290 --> 17:48.360
those different standards that we've written.

415
17:48.360 --> 17:50.910
That's a win because then industries had the opportunity

416
17:50.910 --> 17:52.380
to set those benchmarks

417
17:52.380 --> 17:53.970
and the government refers to them

418
17:53.970 --> 17:55.770
seeing the sound science so.

419
17:55.770 --> 17:59.070
<v ->What's gonna motivate them to do that, the companies?</v>

420
17:59.070 --> 18:00.000
We get them together

421
18:00.000 --> 18:02.190
and say, "Help us create these standards."

422
18:02.190 --> 18:04.080
<v ->Well, from my point of view,</v>

423
18:04.080 --> 18:06.750
I think it's everything that you mentioned, right?

424
18:06.750 --> 18:08.940
It's the challenges that we need to address

425
18:08.940 --> 18:10.680
in getting rid of the forever chemicals

426
18:10.680 --> 18:14.820
and addressing how to manage the water, right?

427
18:14.820 --> 18:15.780
Because there are things

428
18:15.780 --> 18:19.110
that we need to use in creating chips

429
18:19.110 --> 18:20.490
and that's not gonna change,

430
18:20.490 --> 18:23.373
so how might we recycle, reuse?

431
18:24.360 --> 18:25.530
<v Nancy>Sharing knowledge standard.</v>

432
18:25.530 --> 18:27.087
<v ->Sharing knowledge, exactly.</v>

433
18:27.087 --> 18:28.650
<v Nancy>And it's all kind of,</v>

434
18:28.650 --> 18:29.820
hate to say it so bluntly,

435
18:29.820 --> 18:31.650
but it's all driven by the bottom line, right?

436
18:31.650 --> 18:34.800
These companies, not only can they not achieve the goals

437
18:34.800 --> 18:36.510
that have been set for them,

438
18:36.510 --> 18:39.390
but they have to have their business model support,

439
18:39.390 --> 18:40.223
they have to support

440
18:40.223 --> 18:42.240
their business model and generate profit.

441
18:42.240 --> 18:44.850
And they're learning that they can't do that on their own

442
18:44.850 --> 18:47.970
because the market isn't growing, it's too fragmented.

443
18:47.970 --> 18:49.350
So by joining together

444
18:49.350 --> 18:52.890
and investing their resources towards standards,

445
18:52.890 --> 18:55.680
yeah, it makes the market grow faster.

446
18:55.680 --> 18:56.943
<v ->Yeah, I totally agree.</v>

447
18:58.050 --> 19:00.030
The more that we can learn from each other, the better.

448
19:00.030 --> 19:02.850
<v ->What are the areas for benchmarking?</v>

449
19:02.850 --> 19:04.350
We talk about companies coming together.

450
19:04.350 --> 19:05.880
What are the areas for benchmarking

451
19:05.880 --> 19:08.250
and how it can help?

452
19:08.250 --> 19:11.400
<v ->Yeah, there's definitely a lot of different areas</v>

453
19:11.400 --> 19:14.370
and there are lots of different industry associations

454
19:14.370 --> 19:15.720
and consortia that are working on that.

455
19:15.720 --> 19:18.720
And I know my friend, Deok-kee Kim,

456
19:18.720 --> 19:20.070
will talk a little bit about what we're doing

457
19:20.070 --> 19:22.740
in the IEC and TC-47.

458
19:22.740 --> 19:24.870
But there's definitely things that we can do

459
19:24.870 --> 19:28.050
to start looking at the environment,

460
19:28.050 --> 19:33.050
the ethics, certainly social responsibility,

461
19:33.240 --> 19:35.770
and you can address all of those in standards

462
19:36.690 --> 19:38.100
and you can get down

463
19:38.100 --> 19:41.550
into just the different consortia.

464
19:41.550 --> 19:44.520
Semi's one that you mentioned earlier.

465
19:44.520 --> 19:46.890
There's the World Semiconductor Council,

466
19:46.890 --> 19:49.080
collaborative research and innovation

467
19:49.080 --> 19:53.148
that we can do working together at the educational level

468
19:53.148 --> 19:58.148
which I know as Deok-kee Kim mentioned, he's a professor.

469
19:59.130 --> 20:01.290
So you might have some insights into that

470
20:01.290 --> 20:04.470
and some of the current research that's happening.

471
20:04.470 --> 20:07.680
<v Syed>And maybe, Deok-kee, you can start with just,</v>

472
20:07.680 --> 20:10.050
Veronica mentioned IEC TC-437,

473
20:10.050 --> 20:13.410
so you can talk about what is IEC, what is IEC TC-47,

474
20:13.410 --> 20:14.370
and maybe we can start there.

475
20:14.370 --> 20:16.800
<v ->Before I talk about that one,</v>

476
20:16.800 --> 20:19.980
I wanna talk a little bit about what Nancy

477
20:19.980 --> 20:21.870
and the others talked about.

478
20:21.870 --> 20:24.810
I guess, Syed, it's going to be very difficult

479
20:24.810 --> 20:29.430
to completely remove the fluorinated gases actually.

480
20:29.430 --> 20:32.280
If I look at the semiconductor history

481
20:32.280 --> 20:34.860
for the last 50 and 60 years,

482
20:34.860 --> 20:38.010
semiconductor industry manufacturing has been

483
20:38.010 --> 20:40.380
developed in collaboration

484
20:40.380 --> 20:42.330
with the research and development.

485
20:42.330 --> 20:44.070
Without the research and development

486
20:44.070 --> 20:48.480
in this semiconductor industry, nothing can happen.

487
20:48.480 --> 20:53.430
So for this, I guess completely removing the fluorinated gas

488
20:53.430 --> 20:55.050
may be very difficult,

489
20:55.050 --> 20:58.680
but I guess the semiconductor industry

490
20:58.680 --> 21:02.130
has always been together with the research and development.

491
21:02.130 --> 21:05.490
So there are many research and development,

492
21:05.490 --> 21:08.700
always are trying to improve the power efficiency

493
21:08.700 --> 21:12.120
and then also some of the new technologies

494
21:12.120 --> 21:15.570
like quantum computing and the neuroFIT devices

495
21:15.570 --> 21:19.050
and also some of the biodegradable materials.

496
21:19.050 --> 21:24.050
Those things actually can help sustain the semiconductors.

497
21:24.690 --> 21:29.690
And also if I come back to Syed's question on IEC,

498
21:32.310 --> 21:37.310
IEC is International Electrotechnical Commission.

499
21:37.680 --> 21:42.680
This is one of the standards developing organization

500
21:43.830 --> 21:48.830
and IEC TC-47 is actually semiconductor devices.

501
21:49.680 --> 21:54.680
This IEC TC-47 is one of the biggest committee within IEC.

502
21:56.670 --> 22:01.410
It has foursome committees and six working groups.

503
22:01.410 --> 22:06.410
SC 47A, Subcommittees 47A covering integral circuit

504
22:07.380 --> 22:12.380
and SC 47D is covering packaging technology.

505
22:13.110 --> 22:16.830
SC 47E is discreet semiconductor devices

506
22:16.830 --> 22:18.990
such as sensors or IOs

507
22:18.990 --> 22:23.313
and 47F is about the MEMS devices.

508
22:24.570 --> 22:26.177
If I look at the 47,

509
22:27.139 --> 22:29.070
IEC TC-47 has been focusing

510
22:29.070 --> 22:32.850
on developing standards of the characterization

511
22:32.850 --> 22:36.430
and reliability of already developed product

512
22:37.860 --> 22:42.480
and mostly reliability aspects.

513
22:42.480 --> 22:46.170
But recently there is some activities

514
22:46.170 --> 22:49.380
try to do some pre-standardization

515
22:49.380 --> 22:51.720
on next generation technologies

516
22:51.720 --> 22:55.800
and also TC-47 has formed a new working group

517
22:55.800 --> 22:59.430
on wide bandgap technologies

518
22:59.430 --> 23:04.000
which is power conversion devices a couple of years ago

519
23:06.780 --> 23:08.220
to reflect the importance

520
23:08.220 --> 23:11.463
of the power conversion devices recently.

521
23:12.360 --> 23:15.133
<v ->Okay. and how, I mean, thank you for explaining this.</v>

522
23:15.133 --> 23:17.400
That was a very important background.

523
23:17.400 --> 23:21.270
How these standards, specifically TC-47,

524
23:21.270 --> 23:23.470
how is helping the industry

525
23:25.050 --> 23:26.220
and what are the effects?

526
23:26.220 --> 23:30.360
How much industry is involved in setting up these standards?

527
23:30.360 --> 23:34.320
<v ->Okay, actually TC-47 is actually covering</v>

528
23:34.320 --> 23:37.530
various aspects of the semiconductors.

529
23:37.530 --> 23:38.673
So if I look at it,

530
23:39.570 --> 23:42.780
there is some separation

531
23:42.780 --> 23:45.993
between the research community and industry.

532
23:47.580 --> 23:51.450
The countries like EU and US,

533
23:51.450 --> 23:54.300
actually mostly industry experts

534
23:54.300 --> 23:56.040
are developing the standards

535
23:56.040 --> 23:58.530
of the already developed products.

536
23:58.530 --> 24:00.660
And then the countries like Korea,

537
24:00.660 --> 24:02.250
we are actually more focused

538
24:02.250 --> 24:04.900
on the next generation technologies

539
24:05.850 --> 24:07.560
such as neuroFIT devices

540
24:07.560 --> 24:11.043
and then some of the manufacturing aspects as well.

541
24:12.690 --> 24:17.580
But I guess in order

542
24:17.580 --> 24:21.753
for the semiconductor industry to go forward,

543
24:22.740 --> 24:26.340
industry and academia or the research community

544
24:26.340 --> 24:29.520
needs to get together to develop

545
24:29.520 --> 24:31.980
reasonable standards in various areas

546
24:31.980 --> 24:35.610
including the next generation emerging

547
24:35.610 --> 24:38.670
and critical areas as well.

548
24:38.670 --> 24:39.907
I think which is what the CHIPS

549
24:39.907 --> 24:44.058
and Science Act in the USA is also trying to support

550
24:44.058 --> 24:47.460
the next generation technologies as well.

551
24:47.460 --> 24:49.200
<v ->Yeah, and maybe I can help to explain</v>

552
24:49.200 --> 24:50.970
a little bit on the IEC side.

553
24:50.970 --> 24:54.480
So the IEC is one of three

554
24:54.480 --> 24:58.410
major global standards development organizations, right?

555
24:58.410 --> 25:01.270
You've got ISO, IEC, in the ITU

556
25:02.130 --> 25:04.230
and within the IEC,

557
25:04.230 --> 25:07.290
we've got different technical committees that are addressing

558
25:07.290 --> 25:09.450
a lot of different areas.

559
25:09.450 --> 25:12.900
And what's very interesting is that we all come together

560
25:12.900 --> 25:15.840
and we bring our expertise from industry

561
25:15.840 --> 25:18.990
into our national committee, right, our national body.

562
25:18.990 --> 25:20.130
So as the president of,

563
25:20.130 --> 25:22.620
oops, sorry, I forgot about the microphone, sorry.

564
25:22.620 --> 25:26.460
As the president of the US National Committee,

565
25:26.460 --> 25:30.360
what we do is we get all of the expertise,

566
25:30.360 --> 25:32.250
all of the experts that participate

567
25:32.250 --> 25:34.050
in the different technical committees,

568
25:34.050 --> 25:36.330
they bring their votes in

569
25:36.330 --> 25:40.170
and they vote on the next levels of these projects

570
25:40.170 --> 25:42.030
or they submit the projects themselves.

571
25:42.030 --> 25:44.940
So it's a great way for industry to come together,

572
25:44.940 --> 25:47.250
but also to be represented in a global basis.

573
25:47.250 --> 25:48.840
So it brings that.

574
25:48.840 --> 25:51.540
<v ->I would also add that bringing industry in</v>

575
25:51.540 --> 25:52.830
brings in the perspective

576
25:52.830 --> 25:55.410
of what are the problems we're trying to solve?

577
25:55.410 --> 25:57.390
It's not engineering for engineering's sake.

578
25:57.390 --> 25:58.920
It's what are the priorities

579
25:58.920 --> 26:00.900
and the problems that we are trying to address?

580
26:00.900 --> 26:03.810
'Cause there's always trade offs in where we invest, right?

581
26:03.810 --> 26:05.790
So bringing industry in brings,

582
26:05.790 --> 26:08.940
'cause they're connected more to the the end user, right?

583
26:08.940 --> 26:11.640
And so that helps bring that focus.

584
26:11.640 --> 26:13.920
<v ->Exactly, and then so if you think about</v>

585
26:13.920 --> 26:16.050
how we're doing that here in the US,

586
26:16.050 --> 26:18.690
within the IEC, we're taking our knowledge in the US

587
26:18.690 --> 26:20.550
and then bringing it globally,

588
26:20.550 --> 26:23.460
and Professor Kim also brings knowledge from Korea

589
26:23.460 --> 26:24.510
and takes that globally

590
26:24.510 --> 26:26.550
so then we're able to work together

591
26:26.550 --> 26:29.280
and hopefully solve global challenges.

592
26:29.280 --> 26:32.160
<v ->And I think the global perspective is very important</v>

593
26:32.160 --> 26:35.880
because a lot of large semi companies are global

594
26:35.880 --> 26:38.340
so they want to have a consistent standard

595
26:38.340 --> 26:40.260
and a framework that they could deploy

596
26:40.260 --> 26:42.450
across their fabs around the globe.

597
26:42.450 --> 26:43.650
Companies would want to have

598
26:43.650 --> 26:45.720
oh, this standard in this country

599
26:45.720 --> 26:46.860
and some other standard in another country.

600
26:46.860 --> 26:48.129
<v Nancy>Exactly, it's not scalable.</v>

601
26:48.129 --> 26:49.950
<v ->It's not scalable and it's easy to deploy</v>

602
26:49.950 --> 26:51.000
and stuff like that.

603
26:51.000 --> 26:53.940
And then I think, Sujata, to your point earlier,

604
26:53.940 --> 26:55.710
industry participation also helps.

605
26:55.710 --> 26:58.260
Is it implementable, is it deployable, right?

606
26:58.260 --> 27:00.210
How practical it is to do something,

607
27:00.210 --> 27:03.690
so from that perspective it's also important.

608
27:03.690 --> 27:07.050
One of the things I wanted to ask the panel,

609
27:07.050 --> 27:08.800
we touched about PFA quite a bit

610
27:10.170 --> 27:11.850
and I think the role of research,

611
27:11.850 --> 27:14.340
R&amp;D you talked about, Deok-kee, also.

612
27:14.340 --> 27:18.390
Are alternate chemistry being researched?

613
27:18.390 --> 27:21.360
Is is there your path research?

614
27:21.360 --> 27:23.670
Maybe not in the very near-term,

615
27:23.670 --> 27:25.380
but is there a research

616
27:25.380 --> 27:29.190
or a path towards elevating some of the usage of PFAs

617
27:29.190 --> 27:30.023
and things like that?

618
27:30.023 --> 27:32.700
<v ->I'll start, absolutely, I know even IBM research,</v>

619
27:32.700 --> 27:35.820
that is one of our focus areas to look at that,

620
27:35.820 --> 27:39.120
and using AI and understanding the chemistries.

621
27:39.120 --> 27:42.330
A real benefit will be when we start using quantum.

622
27:42.330 --> 27:44.310
So quantum can actually get down

623
27:44.310 --> 27:47.280
to the molecular behavior of the molecule.

624
27:47.280 --> 27:50.580
So we can start to understand can we create new processes

625
27:50.580 --> 27:52.560
where if I have this byproduct,

626
27:52.560 --> 27:54.180
how can I break it down?

627
27:54.180 --> 27:55.200
So that is coming.

628
27:55.200 --> 27:57.180
It's an area of focus,

629
27:57.180 --> 27:59.610
even though the PFA regulations

630
27:59.610 --> 28:02.040
got pushed out by a bunch of lawyers

631
28:02.040 --> 28:03.877
because genuinely people are saying,

632
28:03.877 --> 28:05.820
"We have to do something."

633
28:05.820 --> 28:08.250
Now semiconductor of course uses PFAs

634
28:08.250 --> 28:09.207
and I'm telling you,

635
28:09.207 --> 28:11.730
for 40 years we've used fluorinated gases.

636
28:11.730 --> 28:13.650
I don't see a way of getting around it,

637
28:13.650 --> 28:17.400
but we're gonna look very hard how to render it inert.

638
28:17.400 --> 28:18.570
But on the other hand,

639
28:18.570 --> 28:20.310
everybody who does cooking,

640
28:20.310 --> 28:22.080
guess what's in your frying pan?

641
28:22.080 --> 28:25.410
PFAs, clothes, it's everywhere.

642
28:25.410 --> 28:28.320
And what I'm hoping semiconductor can do

643
28:28.320 --> 28:30.150
and I wanna help do this too,

644
28:30.150 --> 28:31.770
we have the know-how to go

645
28:31.770 --> 28:33.510
and figure out how to do this.

646
28:33.510 --> 28:36.330
Quantify it, use AI, use quantum,

647
28:36.330 --> 28:37.980
and figure out how to render,

648
28:37.980 --> 28:40.830
whatever we create, render it inert.

649
28:40.830 --> 28:42.420
We call it cradle to,

650
28:42.420 --> 28:46.338
or again, what do I say, grave to grave.

651
28:46.338 --> 28:47.790
You create it, you grow it,

652
28:47.790 --> 28:48.780
and then put it back,

653
28:48.780 --> 28:50.400
and so that's what we're really trying to do.

654
28:50.400 --> 28:52.710
So I give a lot of folks credit.

655
28:52.710 --> 28:54.930
It's not based on regulations

656
28:54.930 --> 28:57.480
which can sway with the politics,

657
28:57.480 --> 28:59.100
but people wanna do the right thing

658
28:59.100 --> 29:00.510
and we just got to help them.

659
29:00.510 --> 29:02.310
<v ->And semi industry has a tradition</v>

660
29:02.310 --> 29:06.690
or a history of very fact driven, science oriented,

661
29:06.690 --> 29:08.880
and I mean, the kind of work that we do,

662
29:08.880 --> 29:10.440
as you were talking about it,

663
29:10.440 --> 29:12.390
making the chips at three nanometer,

664
29:12.390 --> 29:14.160
two nanometer is like this

665
29:14.160 --> 29:17.673
because of all the science-driven kind of a mindset.

666
29:19.620 --> 29:22.410
We touched about, I think the panel touched about

667
29:22.410 --> 29:24.360
on regulation a couple of times.

668
29:24.360 --> 29:26.943
Let me ask a overarching questions.

669
29:28.260 --> 29:32.343
Do we need some regulation specific to semi manufacturing?

670
29:35.220 --> 29:36.053
<v ->Well, I could start then.</v>

671
29:36.053 --> 29:37.173
<v ->Yeah, yeah, go ahead.</v>

672
29:38.250 --> 29:40.590
<v ->It's almost a yes-no.</v>

673
29:40.590 --> 29:41.940
You need the regulation,

674
29:41.940 --> 29:44.310
but it's important to have the standards.

675
29:44.310 --> 29:46.290
So if you're gonna have a regulation,

676
29:46.290 --> 29:50.100
make sure it's discoverable and doable.

677
29:50.100 --> 29:51.600
The PFA one came out,

678
29:51.600 --> 29:53.700
how could anybody adhere to it?

679
29:53.700 --> 29:55.530
So I think put the regulation

680
29:55.530 --> 29:58.910
and bring in the community of scientists

681
29:58.910 --> 30:01.290
to really influence, all right, here's the problem,

682
30:01.290 --> 30:03.240
here's how you discover it, measure it,

683
30:03.240 --> 30:06.150
and here's how you can abate it or remove it.

684
30:06.150 --> 30:08.070
And that's gonna be really important.

685
30:08.070 --> 30:11.940
One concern I do have is how do you motivate people?

686
30:11.940 --> 30:14.130
So if you don't have regulations,

687
30:14.130 --> 30:16.560
will they have that motivation to do the right thing?

688
30:16.560 --> 30:17.970
<v Veronica>Exactly what I was thinking.</v>

689
30:17.970 --> 30:20.940
<v ->Tax credits can only go so far</v>

690
30:20.940 --> 30:25.380
and it may have to come down to it has to be mandated now.

691
30:25.380 --> 30:27.030
I was in Malaysia a few months ago

692
30:27.030 --> 30:29.310
and asking them, "You're gonna have regulations

693
30:29.310 --> 30:31.380
for a semiconductor, they're gonna boom."

694
30:31.380 --> 30:32.880
And they're like, "What?"

695
30:32.880 --> 30:34.380
They're like, "No, we don't have enough water.

696
30:34.380 --> 30:36.960
We're just gonna have to manage it out of the gate."

697
30:36.960 --> 30:39.180
So it's a perspective.

698
30:39.180 --> 30:42.810
I think regulations supported by standards.

699
30:42.810 --> 30:45.480
I hope humans do want to do the right thing.

700
30:45.480 --> 30:47.760
You are up against profit

701
30:47.760 --> 30:49.380
and that's going to be a problem,

702
30:49.380 --> 30:53.280
and maybe regulations helps open the door and squash profits

703
30:53.280 --> 30:55.530
and say environment first.

704
30:55.530 --> 30:56.580
<v ->In a sense, a bar too,</v>

705
30:56.580 --> 31:00.240
a common bar for everybody to shoot for and work together,

706
31:00.240 --> 31:02.670
and that's where the standards come in to help.

707
31:02.670 --> 31:04.170
<v ->I mean, it helps with the bottom line also.</v>

708
31:04.170 --> 31:05.003
You talked about it,

709
31:05.003 --> 31:06.750
if you're using less power,

710
31:06.750 --> 31:09.960
it helps reduce the power expenses also, right?

711
31:09.960 --> 31:11.493
So there is a,

712
31:12.360 --> 31:14.733
it's helpful from multiple angles also.

713
31:16.800 --> 31:18.780
I also wanna touch upon,

714
31:18.780 --> 31:20.880
I wanna get everyone's opinion on this,

715
31:20.880 --> 31:23.010
is are we doing enough?

716
31:23.010 --> 31:26.010
Are we acting with a sense of urgency?

717
31:26.010 --> 31:26.843
What do you all think?

718
31:26.843 --> 31:28.974
I think we can go around the panel to talk about it.

719
31:28.974 --> 31:30.630
<v ->I'll jump in, I think there's always more</v>

720
31:30.630 --> 31:32.010
that we can be doing, right?

721
31:32.010 --> 31:34.620
Especially when it comes to standardization.

722
31:34.620 --> 31:35.490
When you talk about

723
31:35.490 --> 31:38.130
some of the heavy challenges that we have,

724
31:38.130 --> 31:40.830
the more that we can get industry together

725
31:40.830 --> 31:45.120
to talk about how they might be solving different issues,

726
31:45.120 --> 31:50.070
whether it's chemical usage, or water usage, or power.

727
31:50.070 --> 31:52.800
We've talked about power a lot as well.

728
31:52.800 --> 31:55.260
And if we're able to learn from each other

729
31:55.260 --> 31:58.050
and then hopefully set some of those benchmarks

730
31:58.050 --> 32:00.240
for other companies to follow,

731
32:00.240 --> 32:02.010
as we were talking about earlier with regulation,

732
32:02.010 --> 32:03.420
hopefully at that point,

733
32:03.420 --> 32:06.330
regulation can then point to that standard

734
32:06.330 --> 32:08.640
and say, "Follow that standard,"

735
32:08.640 --> 32:11.790
and we're already getting to a better level.

736
32:11.790 --> 32:14.640
So we can always look at different areas

737
32:14.640 --> 32:17.430
and do better in each individual area.

738
32:17.430 --> 32:19.410
<v ->Okay, Nancy, what do you think?</v>

739
32:19.410 --> 32:22.170
<v ->I'm gonna say no, we're not doing enough.</v>

740
32:22.170 --> 32:24.390
Obviously the focus has been on capacity,

741
32:24.390 --> 32:26.250
get the capacity up and running.

742
32:26.250 --> 32:28.500
And during that build out,

743
32:28.500 --> 32:30.840
some companies were very responsible

744
32:30.840 --> 32:33.630
and they started to build in the environmental conditions,

745
32:33.630 --> 32:35.220
but was there a whole lot of motivation?

746
32:35.220 --> 32:37.230
No, you got this money, build this factory,

747
32:37.230 --> 32:38.250
get it up and running.

748
32:38.250 --> 32:40.440
And I think that at least in the US

749
32:40.440 --> 32:43.110
we have that firmly on its way,

750
32:43.110 --> 32:45.540
we need to focus on the environmental conditions.

751
32:45.540 --> 32:47.640
So I'm gonna say no.

752
32:47.640 --> 32:50.280
I understand why we focus on capacity,

753
32:50.280 --> 32:54.360
but we need a lot of funding to say get rid of PFAs,

754
32:54.360 --> 32:56.670
water usage, energy usage.

755
32:56.670 --> 32:57.620
There's more to do.

756
32:58.770 --> 33:00.870
<v ->Yeah, I think I would say yes and no.</v>

757
33:00.870 --> 33:05.670
I think I really see that we've accelerated

758
33:05.670 --> 33:09.570
the efforts in the last five, even just five years.

759
33:09.570 --> 33:10.800
Even working at NXP,

760
33:10.800 --> 33:13.110
the amount of awareness there is

761
33:13.110 --> 33:16.380
around how to build more sustainable semiconductors

762
33:16.380 --> 33:18.753
and the efforts that are going on in fabs.

763
33:19.800 --> 33:21.960
And even when I work with customers,

764
33:21.960 --> 33:25.170
they ask us for information about our products,

765
33:25.170 --> 33:26.940
and the carbon footprint,

766
33:26.940 --> 33:29.580
and energy consumption for building the products.

767
33:29.580 --> 33:30.720
So there's more awareness

768
33:30.720 --> 33:32.520
and now we have to continue

769
33:32.520 --> 33:35.070
to drive the semiconductor processes.

770
33:35.070 --> 33:38.280
But I will also say I think from the end product side,

771
33:38.280 --> 33:42.420
we're making huge advancements in AI,

772
33:42.420 --> 33:43.950
like you said, all these technologies

773
33:43.950 --> 33:48.390
to help us better understand the energy usage

774
33:48.390 --> 33:53.133
and be able to apply intelligence to reduce that.

775
33:55.020 --> 33:57.120
<v ->So if I add a little bit.</v>

776
33:57.120 --> 34:00.090
If I look at the semiconductor manufacturing,

777
34:00.090 --> 34:03.510
previously for the last 50 and 60 years,

778
34:03.510 --> 34:07.320
US actually started the semiconductor manufacturing

779
34:07.320 --> 34:09.600
and then they intentionally I think

780
34:09.600 --> 34:12.420
moved that to Japan and then Korea

781
34:12.420 --> 34:15.180
and then finally to China.

782
34:15.180 --> 34:16.627
And then those are,

783
34:18.030 --> 34:21.780
Korea, even if I look at the Korea, the initial days,

784
34:21.780 --> 34:25.620
they didn't really think about the environmental aspects.

785
34:25.620 --> 34:28.170
And then there was some diseases

786
34:28.170 --> 34:30.690
from the semiconductor processing as well.

787
34:30.690 --> 34:33.600
But now USC is actually considering

788
34:33.600 --> 34:36.420
that semiconductor technology is very, very important

789
34:36.420 --> 34:37.253
and they're bringing

790
34:37.253 --> 34:41.130
that semiconductor manufacturing back to US.

791
34:41.130 --> 34:44.310
And now I think US will be more interested

792
34:44.310 --> 34:46.170
in the research and development.

793
34:46.170 --> 34:48.060
US has a very good capability

794
34:48.060 --> 34:50.010
of the research and capability.

795
34:50.010 --> 34:55.010
I hope that we will find better solutions in the near future

796
34:55.230 --> 34:57.000
with all the capabilities.

797
34:57.000 --> 34:59.610
<v ->Thank you, I think at this time,</v>

798
34:59.610 --> 35:01.350
we have a few minutes

799
35:01.350 --> 35:03.960
left for any questions from the audience.

800
35:03.960 --> 35:05.970
If you have any questions,

801
35:05.970 --> 35:08.310
please come up to the mic over here

802
35:08.310 --> 35:10.083
and so that it could be recorded.

803
35:11.250 --> 35:13.350
Any questions from the audience?

804
35:13.350 --> 35:16.200
<v Questioner One>I had a, sorry, a question on the,</v>

805
35:16.200 --> 35:18.050
there has been a lot of reshoring

806
35:18.050 --> 35:20.280
of semiconductor into the US

807
35:20.280 --> 35:23.460
and one of my questions was what sustainability

808
35:23.460 --> 35:26.160
and government environmental obstacles

809
35:26.160 --> 35:29.340
have been most daunting,

810
35:29.340 --> 35:33.030
especially with our environmental regulations

811
35:33.030 --> 35:35.103
in the US versus other countries?

812
35:36.810 --> 35:38.520
<v ->Nancy, you wanna start?</v>

813
35:38.520 --> 35:41.250
<v ->Sure, I think in the US,</v>

814
35:41.250 --> 35:43.200
of course, the water was gonna be a concern.

815
35:43.200 --> 35:45.270
The PFAS came right up on the top.

816
35:45.270 --> 35:49.380
But until it was doable, energy is also a big one.

817
35:49.380 --> 35:51.930
So I think there's some federal regulations,

818
35:51.930 --> 35:53.790
but then the states have to look at it.

819
35:53.790 --> 35:55.140
Can they actually support it?

820
35:55.140 --> 35:57.420
And as we're indicating, water's a big one.

821
35:57.420 --> 36:00.240
I don't think we can put too many more factories

822
36:00.240 --> 36:05.240
in the South here, West to be able to do that.

823
36:05.280 --> 36:06.960
So I think in that case,

824
36:06.960 --> 36:08.760
we're trying to work with the government.

825
36:08.760 --> 36:11.940
We have to get this capacity online.

826
36:11.940 --> 36:13.980
We're rules bent, I don't know,

827
36:13.980 --> 36:17.610
but I do start looking at the data, kind of questioning it.

828
36:17.610 --> 36:20.610
EU I work with, they're real tough.

829
36:20.610 --> 36:22.530
They're not gonna bend, no, boom,

830
36:22.530 --> 36:26.310
and I'd like to see if we can get there, but collectively.

831
36:26.310 --> 36:29.040
You have to put something in place that's really doable

832
36:29.040 --> 36:31.860
and invest in more research.

833
36:31.860 --> 36:33.780
And I think Syed mentioned,

834
36:33.780 --> 36:35.460
it doesn't necessarily mean

835
36:35.460 --> 36:37.590
you're gonna decrease your profit

836
36:37.590 --> 36:40.200
because a lot of times the way they're calculating profit,

837
36:40.200 --> 36:42.510
they're not calculating the entire pipeline

838
36:42.510 --> 36:43.620
of what you've done.

839
36:43.620 --> 36:46.500
Are you taking into account the waste

840
36:46.500 --> 36:48.030
and what the impact of the waste is

841
36:48.030 --> 36:49.410
and if you get sued

842
36:49.410 --> 36:50.820
or if you're non-compliant?

843
36:50.820 --> 36:53.040
When you start looking at all that,

844
36:53.040 --> 36:55.593
doing the right thing will be profitable.

845
36:56.430 --> 36:58.290
<v ->Deok-kee, any observation from outside?</v>

846
36:58.290 --> 37:02.190
<v ->Yeah, when I was working for some government jobs,</v>

847
37:02.190 --> 37:03.810
I actually had a chance to meet

848
37:03.810 --> 37:06.600
with some of the officials from EU.

849
37:06.600 --> 37:08.370
Actually the first question they asked me

850
37:08.370 --> 37:11.293
is can you get rid of the PFA,

851
37:11.293 --> 37:15.660
especially the Samsung Electronics or (indistinct) actually.

852
37:15.660 --> 37:18.690
But I guess like Nancy said,

853
37:18.690 --> 37:22.139
I think currently it's impossible to get rid

854
37:22.139 --> 37:24.450
of the fluorinated gases completely

855
37:24.450 --> 37:27.450
and I guess they set the target about 2050.

856
37:27.450 --> 37:31.620
Currently they don't really look at seriously within Korea,

857
37:31.620 --> 37:33.540
but they started to look at it.

858
37:33.540 --> 37:37.743
So I think we have to see whether we can really,

859
37:39.000 --> 37:44.000
I guess a little bit we may be able to reduce

860
37:44.430 --> 37:45.870
and then we should reduce

861
37:45.870 --> 37:49.143
some of the fluorinated gas use in the manufacturing, yeah.

862
37:52.410 --> 37:54.570
<v Questioner Two>How do the semiconductor companies</v>

863
37:54.570 --> 37:58.530
plan to achieve carbon-neutral goals?

864
37:58.530 --> 38:00.570
Do you prefer or prioritize

865
38:00.570 --> 38:03.750
reducing the carbon emission yourself

866
38:03.750 --> 38:07.173
or purchasing carbon credits on the market?

867
38:10.740 --> 38:14.640
<v ->Yeah, yeah, yeah, actually these people may know better,</v>

868
38:14.640 --> 38:19.080
but I guess in order to prepare this panel,

869
38:19.080 --> 38:21.810
I also became interested

870
38:21.810 --> 38:24.480
in the semiconductor sustainability.

871
38:24.480 --> 38:27.130
And then semiconductor companies I think are doing

872
38:27.990 --> 38:32.990
various things to use the renewable energies

873
38:33.090 --> 38:36.423
and also trying to use many,

874
38:38.100 --> 38:41.147
using the AI, the optimization

875
38:41.147 --> 38:43.560
of the manufacturing process, et cetera,

876
38:43.560 --> 38:46.200
to reduce the carbon emission.

877
38:46.200 --> 38:48.420
And then a little bit,

878
38:48.420 --> 38:49.930
but currently I guess it's very difficult

879
38:49.930 --> 38:52.290
to do the net-zero carbon.

880
38:52.290 --> 38:53.760
<v ->Yeah, I agree with that.</v>

881
38:53.760 --> 38:56.580
I think NXP, we have sustainability reports

882
38:56.580 --> 38:58.530
that we started issuing to show

883
38:58.530 --> 39:00.810
where are the areas that we've invested

884
39:00.810 --> 39:03.270
and evaluated on the energy consumption

885
39:03.270 --> 39:05.013
and how we can improve that.

886
39:06.150 --> 39:09.120
It's gonna take time to get to a net-zero.

887
39:09.120 --> 39:10.710
I don't know if that's feasible or not,

888
39:10.710 --> 39:13.800
but just working towards that is definitely something

889
39:13.800 --> 39:16.408
I think all the semiconductor companies are doing.

890
39:16.408 --> 39:17.880
<v ->I think there's a broad set of things</v>

891
39:17.880 --> 39:19.740
going on in this space.

892
39:19.740 --> 39:22.980
First, usage of renewable sources.

893
39:22.980 --> 39:26.880
Second is this how can we use less energy?

894
39:26.880 --> 39:30.120
And then the OEE topic that we talked about.

895
39:30.120 --> 39:30.960
<v ->And the reuse.</v>

896
39:30.960 --> 39:34.950
<v ->And the reuse, so there is a broad set of things</v>

897
39:34.950 --> 39:37.413
that collectively could help us get there.

898
39:39.110 --> 39:40.470
<v ->Yeah, and I think companies</v>

899
39:40.470 --> 39:43.110
can also set these benchmarks themselves

900
39:43.110 --> 39:46.320
and then I know I've preached standards,

901
39:46.320 --> 39:48.600
but I think the more that we set the benchmarks

902
39:48.600 --> 39:52.920
on how we might get to a better sustainable world, right?

903
39:52.920 --> 39:54.120
Especially when we're talking

904
39:54.120 --> 39:57.480
about the manufacturing of semiconductors, right?

905
39:57.480 --> 40:00.390
Then what we can do is share that learning with each other

906
40:00.390 --> 40:02.250
and then hopefully create some standards,

907
40:02.250 --> 40:03.883
so that's what we hope for.

908
40:03.883 --> 40:05.760
<v ->I just wanted to add one key here</v>

909
40:05.760 --> 40:07.560
is typically an organization

910
40:07.560 --> 40:11.460
or a factory is measuring the total amount of energy used?

911
40:11.460 --> 40:12.630
Where was it used?

912
40:12.630 --> 40:15.210
And then they calculate the emissions.

913
40:15.210 --> 40:17.340
That's too macro level in my opinion.

914
40:17.340 --> 40:18.570
What tools are using it?

915
40:18.570 --> 40:20.460
Do you have a tool starting to go rogue

916
40:20.460 --> 40:22.470
that's just taking too much energy?

917
40:22.470 --> 40:25.050
And this is why OEE is so important.

918
40:25.050 --> 40:28.140
Monitor each tool and then aggregate it

919
40:28.140 --> 40:30.810
'cause otherwise it's so difficult to drill it down.

920
40:30.810 --> 40:33.210
So in my view, get this dashboard,

921
40:33.210 --> 40:34.230
build in the ability,

922
40:34.230 --> 40:35.940
and we're doing that to drill it down.

923
40:35.940 --> 40:38.550
What tools are using all this energy and why?

924
40:38.550 --> 40:40.230
And is there any opportunity

925
40:40.230 --> 40:42.003
to reduce the energy they're using?

926
40:43.080 --> 40:44.250
<v Syed>With that, I think we are-</v>

927
40:44.250 --> 40:45.810
<v ->Oh, one more comment.</v>

928
40:45.810 --> 40:46.710
<v Syed>Go ahead.</v>

929
40:47.790 --> 40:48.759
<v Nancy>We're out of time.</v>

930
40:48.759 --> 40:49.800
<v Syed>We are out of time.</v>

931
40:49.800 --> 40:52.110
Thank you, panel, for a very thought provoking

932
40:52.110 --> 40:56.070
and at the same time, very actionable kind of discussion.

933
40:56.070 --> 40:57.134
Thank you.

934
40:57.134 --> 40:59.717
(bright music)
