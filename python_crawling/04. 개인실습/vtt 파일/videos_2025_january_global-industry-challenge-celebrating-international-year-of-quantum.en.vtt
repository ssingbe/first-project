00:00.306 --> 00:02.973
(upbeat music)

2
00:11.670 --> 00:13.770
<v ->Good morning, everybody.</v>

3
00:13.770 --> 00:16.320
For those of you that stayed on from the last session,

4
00:16.320 --> 00:17.310
thank you,

5
00:17.310 --> 00:21.090
and welcome to the new folks who have kind of walked in.

6
00:21.090 --> 00:24.270
I'm really, really excited about the second session

7
00:24.270 --> 00:26.970
where we will go into a little bit more detail

8
00:26.970 --> 00:29.820
about something we launched last year

9
00:29.820 --> 00:31.800
called The Global Industry Challenge.

10
00:31.800 --> 00:34.980
And I'm thrilled to have a number of luminaries

11
00:34.980 --> 00:36.540
who are gonna join me on stage

12
00:36.540 --> 00:38.965
to kind of talk through what this is.

13
00:38.965 --> 00:42.720
So without much further ado, my name is George Thomas,

14
00:42.720 --> 00:45.106
I'm President and CEO of Connected DMV.

15
00:45.106 --> 00:46.920
We are the organizers of the Quantum World Congress,

16
00:46.920 --> 00:48.960
and we are thrilled to be here

17
00:48.960 --> 00:53.013
to showcase the Quantum Means Business track at CES.

18
00:53.981 --> 00:57.660
The Global Industry Challenge is something, as I said,

19
00:57.660 --> 01:00.630
we launched late last year

20
01:00.630 --> 01:03.540
at the Quantum World Congress,

21
01:03.540 --> 01:07.140
and it is a platform that we are using

22
01:07.140 --> 01:10.650
to drive industry use cases into the market.

23
01:10.650 --> 01:15.650
So if you think about any technology-based innovation,

24
01:16.890 --> 01:19.560
there's a set of communities that make that happen.

25
01:19.560 --> 01:20.970
The people we tend to focus on

26
01:20.970 --> 01:22.590
are what we call the builders,

27
01:22.590 --> 01:27.150
the people who make the things that underline what we do

28
01:27.150 --> 01:28.200
and use them for,

29
01:28.200 --> 01:31.890
anything from televisions to cars to phones

30
01:31.890 --> 01:33.540
that are the builder communities.

31
01:34.680 --> 01:35.970
And then on the other side of it,

32
01:35.970 --> 01:38.940
there's the users and the buyers, sometimes in one bucket,

33
01:38.940 --> 01:40.650
sometimes two separate buckets.

34
01:40.650 --> 01:42.390
And supporting these two, the builders

35
01:42.390 --> 01:43.830
and the users and the buyers

36
01:43.830 --> 01:45.780
are a number of other participants.

37
01:45.780 --> 01:47.310
People who develop talent,

38
01:47.310 --> 01:48.840
people who are responsible for policy,

39
01:48.840 --> 01:51.300
people who are responsible for standards,

40
01:51.300 --> 01:53.675
people who are responsible for commercialization.

41
01:53.675 --> 01:56.280
So that's what makes up an ecosystem.

42
01:56.280 --> 01:58.530
And when anything new comes along,

43
01:58.530 --> 02:01.440
there's a number of companies, private companies

44
02:01.440 --> 02:03.750
or government funded labs that are the builders

45
02:03.750 --> 02:06.030
that are developing these tools and technologies.

46
02:06.030 --> 02:08.490
And sometimes those tools and technologies,

47
02:08.490 --> 02:09.450
after they're developed,

48
02:09.450 --> 02:11.910
they go and find clients or markets for it.

49
02:11.910 --> 02:14.550
And this creates kind of like a cycle of vacuum,

50
02:14.550 --> 02:16.530
of a higher risk profile

51
02:16.530 --> 02:20.370
for what things can have more of a chance of success.

52
02:20.370 --> 02:22.800
So the Global Industry Challenge was intended

53
02:22.800 --> 02:24.810
to allow the users and the buyers,

54
02:24.810 --> 02:26.430
think of them as industry players

55
02:26.430 --> 02:29.940
in some of these industries like space and life sciences

56
02:29.940 --> 02:32.730
to kind of be at the forefront of defining

57
02:32.730 --> 02:34.800
what is of value for their industry.

58
02:34.800 --> 02:39.800
So if I am a CFO/CEO of an industry organization in biotech

59
02:40.530 --> 02:44.310
or space, I don't care as much that the solution

60
02:44.310 --> 02:46.290
is solved by quantum.

61
02:46.290 --> 02:47.760
For me that is a tool.

62
02:47.760 --> 02:50.130
I care that my mission is satisfied.

63
02:50.130 --> 02:52.110
So by having them lead the discussion,

64
02:52.110 --> 02:53.850
we really wanna kind of drive towards

65
02:53.850 --> 02:55.830
what that community engagement means.

66
02:55.830 --> 02:57.030
So the Global Industry Challenge

67
02:57.030 --> 03:00.810
was essentially seeded from wanting to do

68
03:00.810 --> 03:03.360
this kind of format to move forward.

69
03:03.360 --> 03:07.140
So this is the framework of what that looks like.

70
03:07.140 --> 03:11.400
So we'll have industry partners in these five categories

71
03:11.400 --> 03:14.100
who are going to bring forward challenges,

72
03:14.100 --> 03:16.770
which are basically problems that need to be solved

73
03:16.770 --> 03:18.300
to the pot.

74
03:18.300 --> 03:20.640
And these challenges can then,

75
03:20.640 --> 03:23.880
people can apply globally to participate in it.

76
03:23.880 --> 03:24.720
So there'll be a way

77
03:24.720 --> 03:26.790
if you want to kind of be a participant

78
03:26.790 --> 03:28.956
in any one of the challenges

79
03:28.956 --> 03:30.600
that you can sign up as a participant.

80
03:30.600 --> 03:33.210
So when the challenge registration opens,

81
03:33.210 --> 03:35.820
and once that opens, you can have access

82
03:35.820 --> 03:37.530
to what the challenges are,

83
03:37.530 --> 03:40.920
and through our partners from qBraid and Aqora,

84
03:40.920 --> 03:44.460
they then have access to backend computing systems

85
03:44.460 --> 03:46.530
to actually showcase the finalists

86
03:46.530 --> 03:48.120
who get through the process will have access

87
03:48.120 --> 03:49.710
to backend computing systems

88
03:49.710 --> 03:51.780
to be able to validate what they are.

89
03:51.780 --> 03:53.640
And the winners who go through the process

90
03:53.640 --> 03:55.800
for each of these industry challenges will be awarded

91
03:55.800 --> 03:58.050
and presented at the next Quantum World Congress.

92
03:58.050 --> 04:00.540
So structurally that is what we are trying to do,

93
04:00.540 --> 04:03.180
and some of the impacts of what we want to drive

94
04:03.180 --> 04:05.520
is the box on the very right.

95
04:05.520 --> 04:08.130
We want to drive real world applications

96
04:08.130 --> 04:12.333
that are use inspired by the industries that they represent.

97
04:13.200 --> 04:15.720
We want to accelerate commercialization possibilities

98
04:15.720 --> 04:17.970
of some of these solutions that come up.

99
04:17.970 --> 04:19.350
Like some of the challenges,

100
04:19.350 --> 04:21.300
depending on who the participants are

101
04:21.300 --> 04:25.290
and who the finalists are, will end up being supported

102
04:25.290 --> 04:26.610
by the industry partners

103
04:26.610 --> 04:29.220
to develop whatever they've come up with further.

104
04:29.220 --> 04:31.230
There might be options to commercialize.

105
04:31.230 --> 04:35.400
There might be opportunities to join them in either,

106
04:35.400 --> 04:38.040
you know, fellowships or actually as employees

107
04:38.040 --> 04:40.027
to kind of move forward.

108
04:40.027 --> 04:41.580
So that's kinda like the pattern that we expect

109
04:41.580 --> 04:42.900
through the process.

110
04:42.900 --> 04:46.110
We also want to use this mechanism,

111
04:46.110 --> 04:49.710
this being, 2025 being the international year of Quantum,

112
04:49.710 --> 04:51.660
which was, you know, designated this year

113
04:51.660 --> 04:53.310
by the United Nations.

114
04:53.310 --> 04:55.020
It's a fantastic opportunity for us

115
04:55.020 --> 04:57.750
to increase awareness of Quantum in the market.

116
04:57.750 --> 04:59.400
So a good portion of this mechanism

117
04:59.400 --> 05:02.700
is to increase that awareness within the market,

118
05:02.700 --> 05:03.960
and you'll see a set

119
05:03.960 --> 05:06.990
of what we call organized participant cohorts.

120
05:06.990 --> 05:08.910
There are some of them that are mentioned here.

121
05:08.910 --> 05:11.130
These are higher universities,

122
05:11.130 --> 05:13.020
higher education institutions,

123
05:13.020 --> 05:16.230
some of them with significant quantum breadth and product

124
05:16.230 --> 05:20.790
and talent that are self-organizing cohorts to participate

125
05:20.790 --> 05:24.000
in addition to anybody worldwide who can join.

126
05:24.000 --> 05:26.850
So the plan is to kind of have a depth

127
05:26.850 --> 05:28.800
of existing quantum talent

128
05:28.800 --> 05:30.510
that can help the industry use cases

129
05:30.510 --> 05:31.980
move the needle forward.

130
05:31.980 --> 05:35.910
So if I'm an industry person, I am able to take my problem

131
05:35.910 --> 05:37.770
and have the world look at it.

132
05:37.770 --> 05:40.470
If I'm a participant, I'm able to participate in things

133
05:40.470 --> 05:43.620
that are real, that are needed by industry participants.

134
05:43.620 --> 05:45.270
If I'm these education institutions,

135
05:45.270 --> 05:46.590
it gives me another avenue

136
05:46.590 --> 05:49.050
for education and talent development.

137
05:49.050 --> 05:51.480
So that's kinda like the base structure at the bottom.

138
05:51.480 --> 05:52.830
And then sitting at the top of it

139
05:52.830 --> 05:57.830
is global impact nodes.

140
05:58.112 --> 06:01.170
And you'll hear from a couple of our partners

141
06:01.170 --> 06:02.003
within this as well,

142
06:02.003 --> 06:04.971
but we are planning to deploy this globally

143
06:04.971 --> 06:07.500
to launch this on World Quantum day.

144
06:07.500 --> 06:09.750
So if I go back to the timeline for a second,

145
06:11.640 --> 06:15.900
so we are here now announcing what this thing is.

146
06:15.900 --> 06:17.640
Participants will start being able to register

147
06:17.640 --> 06:21.000
by the end of this month and then the global impact nodes

148
06:21.000 --> 06:23.340
will start to activate, will activate

149
06:23.340 --> 06:25.440
on World Quantum Day, which is April 14th.

150
06:26.421 --> 06:27.870
The challenge itself will be online

151
06:27.870 --> 06:30.480
for the next 10 weeks for participants.

152
06:30.480 --> 06:32.280
And then out of that there will be a process

153
06:32.280 --> 06:34.230
to select finalists and make awards.

154
06:34.230 --> 06:37.260
And the final list will be announced

155
06:37.260 --> 06:38.583
at Quantum World Congress.

156
06:39.540 --> 06:43.440
So the five impact nodes you see at the very end,

157
06:43.440 --> 06:44.790
at the very top of it

158
06:44.790 --> 06:47.770
are the five that are confirmed at this point in time.

159
06:47.770 --> 06:48.972
There are a number of others,

160
06:48.972 --> 06:51.480
you'll hear more about it in upcoming sessions.

161
06:51.480 --> 06:52.770
So that's the structure

162
06:52.770 --> 06:54.810
and the format of what we are trying to do.

163
06:54.810 --> 06:57.570
So with that, I want to kind of, you know, invite

164
06:57.570 --> 06:59.460
two folks up on stage.

165
06:59.460 --> 07:00.630
The whole structure of this

166
07:00.630 --> 07:02.850
is underneath the international year of Quantum.

167
07:02.850 --> 07:04.170
And to hear more about this,

168
07:04.170 --> 07:08.550
I would like to invite on stage Paul Cadden-Zimansky,

169
07:08.550 --> 07:10.410
who is on the Executive Committee

170
07:10.410 --> 07:12.120
of the International Year of Quantum

171
07:12.120 --> 07:14.910
and Marsha Maxwell from APS.

172
07:14.910 --> 07:15.743
Thank you both.

173
07:17.132 --> 07:21.150
(audience applauding)

174
07:21.150 --> 07:21.983
<v ->Thank you, everyone.</v>

175
07:21.983 --> 07:22.980
Thank you, George.

176
07:22.980 --> 07:24.240
So I'm a physics professor

177
07:24.240 --> 07:25.530
and one of the global coordinators

178
07:25.530 --> 07:27.300
for the international year.

179
07:27.300 --> 07:29.640
I know that at CES, one of the exciting things is

180
07:29.640 --> 07:31.620
what's being unveiled today,

181
07:31.620 --> 07:32.760
what's being launched this week,

182
07:32.760 --> 07:34.620
what's on tap for this year.

183
07:34.620 --> 07:37.890
But I want for a moment to think on the 100 year timescale,

184
07:37.890 --> 07:39.720
the century timescale,

185
07:39.720 --> 07:42.060
the once in a lifetime timescale.

186
07:42.060 --> 07:47.060
So this year, 2025 marks 100 years of quantum mechanics.

187
07:47.730 --> 07:49.170
And for those of you who don't know,

188
07:49.170 --> 07:52.440
quantum mechanics is humanity's best theory

189
07:52.440 --> 07:55.860
for understanding the physical world, period.

190
07:55.860 --> 07:58.740
It's the most well-tested, it's the most wide ranging,

191
07:58.740 --> 08:00.140
it tells us the most things.

192
08:01.110 --> 08:04.170
Now this is the consumer electronic show, right?

193
08:04.170 --> 08:06.450
And the thing is that quantum is here.

194
08:06.450 --> 08:09.390
It's always been here, but it's hidden.

195
08:09.390 --> 08:11.640
It's right there in the name electronics.

196
08:11.640 --> 08:13.860
Every single thing that you will see at the show

197
08:13.860 --> 08:16.810
is based on manipulating electrons.

198
08:16.810 --> 08:18.090
And if you wanna manipulate electrons,

199
08:18.090 --> 08:20.730
you gotta talk to quantum mechanics first.

200
08:20.730 --> 08:24.240
So this entire industry has a hidden hero,

201
08:24.240 --> 08:26.820
and that's quantum mechanics, quantum science.

202
08:26.820 --> 08:29.850
And though there are all these exciting new areas

203
08:29.850 --> 08:31.020
of quantum innovation,

204
08:31.020 --> 08:32.490
you heard about in the last session,

205
08:32.490 --> 08:35.850
quantum computing or quantum sensing in the next session,

206
08:35.850 --> 08:38.820
quantum is something that has been here for 100 years,

207
08:38.820 --> 08:40.110
but it's hidden.

208
08:40.110 --> 08:41.220
It's the hidden sponsor.

209
08:41.220 --> 08:44.220
It's the one thing whose name is not in lights at this show.

210
08:45.207 --> 08:47.970
So those of us who knew and understood

211
08:47.970 --> 08:51.690
how important quantum science technology is and has been

212
08:51.690 --> 08:54.480
and will continue to be to the world

213
08:54.480 --> 08:57.090
thought that on the occasion of its 100th birthday,

214
08:57.090 --> 08:59.253
we should throw a global birthday party.

215
09:00.094 --> 09:03.000
So we got together, first some scientists,

216
09:03.000 --> 09:05.070
then scientific organizations from all over the world.

217
09:05.070 --> 09:07.230
Then we started approaching countries.

218
09:07.230 --> 09:08.730
We went to UNESCO where we got support

219
09:08.730 --> 09:12.240
from over 60 countries sponsoring a recommendation

220
09:12.240 --> 09:13.140
that includes countries

221
09:13.140 --> 09:16.590
like both Russia and Ukraine co-sponsored that bill.

222
09:16.590 --> 09:18.300
Then we went to the United Nations,

223
09:18.300 --> 09:21.660
and every single country in the entire world met,

224
09:21.660 --> 09:23.970
and for the first time in the 78-year history

225
09:23.970 --> 09:26.430
of the United Nations discussed quantum mechanics

226
09:26.430 --> 09:28.620
and said this is gonna be the year.

227
09:28.620 --> 09:31.298
This is going to be the international year

228
09:31.298 --> 09:32.220
of quantum science technology.

229
09:32.220 --> 09:35.610
The resolution to do that was unanimously agreed to.

230
09:35.610 --> 09:39.930
It was sponsored by 72 countries, including the US, China,

231
09:39.930 --> 09:42.423
India, representing over 5 billion people.

232
09:43.380 --> 09:45.990
So what is the recommendation for the UN?

233
09:45.990 --> 09:48.750
The top line recommendation is that this year

234
09:48.750 --> 09:52.170
should be marked by activities at all levels,

235
09:52.170 --> 09:55.770
helping raise awareness and understanding among the public

236
09:55.770 --> 09:58.590
for the impact that quantum science and technology

237
09:58.590 --> 10:01.997
has had, is having and will continue to have.

238
10:01.997 --> 10:05.520
So what we're here to ask for is your help, right,

239
10:05.520 --> 10:07.860
in making that a reality

240
10:07.860 --> 10:09.360
because the United Nations also says

241
10:09.360 --> 10:11.580
that all contributions should be voluntary.

242
10:11.580 --> 10:15.212
So we have worked to put together networks of governments,

243
10:15.212 --> 10:18.480
industry, academia, all this,

244
10:18.480 --> 10:20.160
but we're still putting more and more together

245
10:20.160 --> 10:22.050
with a lot of high level events all over the world,

246
10:22.050 --> 10:25.230
but also events that happen just at the local level.

247
10:25.230 --> 10:27.000
And so we're encouraging everybody

248
10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
who understands the importance of quantum science technology

249
10:30.000 --> 10:31.140
to help with this effort

250
10:31.140 --> 10:34.290
and to mark the birthday of quantum mechanics

251
10:34.290 --> 10:37.890
and make it go from a hidden hero

252
10:37.890 --> 10:40.170
to a hero that everybody knows about.

253
10:40.170 --> 10:42.570
So Marsha Maxwell is here from APS Corporate Relations.

254
10:42.570 --> 10:44.753
She's gonna tell you some of the ways you can help.

255
10:46.020 --> 10:47.940
<v ->Hi, folks, good morning.</v>

256
10:47.940 --> 10:50.220
Marsha Maxwell, American Physical Society.

257
10:50.220 --> 10:52.110
So our responsibility

258
10:52.110 --> 10:54.960
apart from being one of the founding societies

259
10:54.960 --> 10:59.610
around the initiative is to work with various organizations

260
10:59.610 --> 11:02.850
across industry, academia, philanthropy and academia

261
11:02.850 --> 11:05.853
around garnering sponsorship support

262
11:05.853 --> 11:07.920
to support the initiative.

263
11:07.920 --> 11:12.090
So they're able to roll out the global programs,

264
11:12.090 --> 11:14.610
support the media awareness campaign

265
11:14.610 --> 11:16.230
that will be going on throughout the year,

266
11:16.230 --> 11:19.530
which is incredibly important to bring the conversation

267
11:19.530 --> 11:21.840
as to what quantum mechanics can do

268
11:21.840 --> 11:24.570
or quantum science can do for society.

269
11:24.570 --> 11:28.140
So we have been very lucky to work

270
11:28.140 --> 11:30.900
and gain the commitment from various folks from industry,

271
11:30.900 --> 11:34.350
including Microsoft, Google, and many more.

272
11:34.350 --> 11:37.230
And in the conversations that I've been having with them

273
11:37.230 --> 11:40.680
before they committed, they just wanna understand like,

274
11:40.680 --> 11:43.380
you know, apart from them giving their dollars

275
11:43.380 --> 11:45.600
and of course being part of the initiative,

276
11:45.600 --> 11:47.130
like what's in it for them, right?

277
11:47.130 --> 11:51.120
So as a company, I know that several organizations

278
11:51.120 --> 11:55.140
are looking for, have their various goals in being involved

279
11:55.140 --> 11:56.850
with this initiative

280
11:56.850 --> 11:59.520
and specifically around supporting quantum science

281
11:59.520 --> 12:00.353
and technology.

282
12:00.353 --> 12:04.201
So obviously big part of that is visibility.

283
12:04.201 --> 12:07.830
Being a supporter or a partner of IYQ

284
12:07.830 --> 12:11.366
enables you to have visibility and global visibility

285
12:11.366 --> 12:13.740
in the quantum ecosystem.

286
12:13.740 --> 12:16.920
And this is your brand and your company showing up

287
12:16.920 --> 12:18.750
at these global events,

288
12:18.750 --> 12:20.340
acknowledged at these global events,

289
12:20.340 --> 12:23.460
being part of the Omnichannel awareness campaign

290
12:23.460 --> 12:26.040
that's running throughout the year,

291
12:26.040 --> 12:29.220
as well as being able to participate

292
12:29.220 --> 12:33.120
and be part of those global activities as needed.

293
12:33.120 --> 12:35.340
In my conversations with them,

294
12:35.340 --> 12:37.920
a huge benefit of course is being in the room.

295
12:37.920 --> 12:40.740
I think a lot of companies want to make sure

296
12:40.740 --> 12:43.290
that it's all about access and getting connections

297
12:43.290 --> 12:46.050
and many of you do have your peers

298
12:46.050 --> 12:47.880
and other companies that you're partnered with

299
12:47.880 --> 12:49.320
and connections.

300
12:49.320 --> 12:50.790
But, you know, as Paul mentioned,

301
12:50.790 --> 12:53.820
this is truly a global exercise

302
12:53.820 --> 12:56.280
and a global and collaborative initiative.

303
12:56.280 --> 12:59.190
So being in the room and having access to individuals

304
12:59.190 --> 13:03.120
that are setting policy, funding and partnership,

305
13:03.120 --> 13:04.830
I think, is gonna be incredibly important.

306
13:04.830 --> 13:09.180
And this amplifies that access for you as a company

307
13:09.180 --> 13:11.640
and as an organization.

308
13:11.640 --> 13:15.930
Additionally, it's about having your voice

309
13:15.930 --> 13:20.250
and your research and your perspective heard.

310
13:20.250 --> 13:23.760
I mentioned the multichannel awareness campaign

311
13:23.760 --> 13:25.110
that's running throughout the year.

312
13:25.110 --> 13:27.800
You know, obviously we're going to be leaning into

313
13:27.800 --> 13:29.250
our supporting partners to talk about

314
13:29.250 --> 13:32.190
what you're currently researching, what you're doing,

315
13:32.190 --> 13:34.230
your thought leadership throughout the year.

316
13:34.230 --> 13:38.400
So, you know, we have a lot of huge, I mean it's,

317
13:38.400 --> 13:41.160
hey we're doing this to better society.

318
13:41.160 --> 13:42.420
I'm gonna put that out there

319
13:42.420 --> 13:45.960
that ultimately this is going to make a difference

320
13:45.960 --> 13:47.430
and going to improve our lives.

321
13:47.430 --> 13:48.510
I'm gonna make a big statement,

322
13:48.510 --> 13:50.400
but you know, we wanna make sure

323
13:50.400 --> 13:52.230
that we have all the key players,

324
13:52.230 --> 13:54.000
and we have your involvement and support

325
13:54.000 --> 13:56.490
because it will not happen without that.

326
13:56.490 --> 13:58.863
So how you can support, we have many ways

327
13:58.863 --> 14:00.780
that you can get involved.

328
14:00.780 --> 14:02.880
I'm happy to answer any questions

329
14:02.880 --> 14:05.880
and many benefits that come with that involvement

330
14:05.880 --> 14:09.090
all the way from sort of standard awareness and branding

331
14:09.090 --> 14:11.490
all the way to a seat on the steering committee,

332
14:11.490 --> 14:14.220
although those higher levels are sold, I will say that.

333
14:14.220 --> 14:16.200
So we're very happy about the support

334
14:16.200 --> 14:18.430
from those companies like Microsoft.

335
14:18.430 --> 14:21.330
But we have other opportunities and other ways

336
14:21.330 --> 14:23.520
that you can get involved and support.

337
14:23.520 --> 14:25.890
And so we're looking for you to really be part

338
14:25.890 --> 14:28.860
of this historic initiative and gain that access

339
14:28.860 --> 14:32.460
and have that visibility and really support this effort.

340
14:32.460 --> 14:35.820
So should you have any questions of myself and Paul,

341
14:35.820 --> 14:37.320
we'll be hanging out after the session.

342
14:37.320 --> 14:39.870
We're happy to answer any questions that you may have.

343
14:39.870 --> 14:42.363
All right, Paul?

344
14:43.650 --> 14:45.750
<v ->I'll just add that the big kickoff event</v>

345
14:45.750 --> 14:48.660
is the opening ceremony in Paris at UNESCO headquarters

346
14:48.660 --> 14:49.650
on the fourth and fifth.

347
14:49.650 --> 14:51.540
I can say that stage time is already booked,

348
14:51.540 --> 14:54.440
but there's still, seats in the audience may be available.

349
14:56.135 --> 14:59.385
(audience applauding)

350
15:00.480 --> 15:01.920
<v George>Thank you, guys.</v>

351
15:01.920 --> 15:04.320
I'd like to invite up on the stage Nick and Philippe

352
15:04.320 --> 15:08.133
to talk about the regional impact nodes.

353
15:10.787 --> 15:14.037
(audience applauding)

354
15:17.010 --> 15:17.910
<v ->Thanks, George.</v>

355
15:17.910 --> 15:18.900
Good morning, everyone.

356
15:18.900 --> 15:20.100
My name's Nick Werstiuk.

357
15:20.100 --> 15:22.410
I'm the CEO of Quantum Valley Ideas Lab

358
15:22.410 --> 15:24.960
based in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

359
15:24.960 --> 15:27.930
So Philippe and I are, if you saw on that chart,

360
15:27.930 --> 15:30.750
we're here to represent sort of the international segment

361
15:30.750 --> 15:35.750
of this conversation around how this activity can roll out.

362
15:36.480 --> 15:38.700
Let me start with kind of the,

363
15:38.700 --> 15:39.900
I'm gonna sort of tag team this,

364
15:39.900 --> 15:42.120
so I'll cover kind of the, some of the background

365
15:42.120 --> 15:44.340
of how we all got involved,

366
15:44.340 --> 15:48.330
and then we'll describe kind of our regional organizations.

367
15:48.330 --> 15:51.060
And then Philippe will talk a bit about the connection

368
15:51.060 --> 15:53.550
to the Global Industry Challenge.

369
15:53.550 --> 15:57.100
So, you know, we as a community,

370
15:57.100 --> 15:59.160
were brought together actually by George

371
15:59.160 --> 16:01.950
about a year and a bit ago

372
16:01.950 --> 16:03.840
to try and build relationships

373
16:03.840 --> 16:07.200
between some of the large developed quantum hubs

374
16:07.200 --> 16:08.670
around the world.

375
16:08.670 --> 16:12.510
So my hub, and the goal there is to sort of build

376
16:12.510 --> 16:14.310
sort of grassroots interaction

377
16:14.310 --> 16:16.680
between the research communities,

378
16:16.680 --> 16:19.470
the commercialization communities, the end users,

379
16:19.470 --> 16:24.470
and try and advance the activities of quantum, you know,

380
16:24.720 --> 16:28.222
across the globe because the recognition is that the,

381
16:28.222 --> 16:29.880
you know, global collaboration

382
16:29.880 --> 16:32.790
amongst like-minded nations will be critical to the success

383
16:32.790 --> 16:35.970
of the development of the quantum industry as a whole.

384
16:35.970 --> 16:37.830
So we started down this path,

385
16:37.830 --> 16:40.290
and, you know, my community

386
16:40.290 --> 16:43.830
is the Quantum Valley in Waterloo, Canada as I said,

387
16:43.830 --> 16:44.663
and our community

388
16:44.663 --> 16:46.740
is probably one of the more established communities

389
16:46.740 --> 16:48.450
in terms of quantum.

390
16:48.450 --> 16:50.940
We were founded almost 25 years ago,

391
16:50.940 --> 16:54.023
and our community is kind of a grouping of organizations

392
16:54.023 --> 16:56.640
centered around the University of Waterloo.

393
16:56.640 --> 17:00.030
But we have the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics,

394
17:00.030 --> 17:03.360
the Institute for Quantum Computing at the university,

395
17:03.360 --> 17:05.910
Transformative Quantum Program, and my organization,

396
17:05.910 --> 17:07.410
Quantum Valley Ideas Lab,

397
17:07.410 --> 17:10.230
which is an industrial research lab focused on, you know,

398
17:10.230 --> 17:12.000
early stage quantum development

399
17:12.000 --> 17:15.663
and then commercializing the technologies that we develop.

400
17:16.620 --> 17:20.767
The community also includes a pool of 25 to 30 startups

401
17:20.767 --> 17:25.060
and companies that have been created out of that base of,

402
17:25.060 --> 17:28.170
you know, dozens and dozens of research groups,

403
17:28.170 --> 17:31.170
a couple hundred graduate students in quantum

404
17:31.170 --> 17:33.150
at the university and so on.

405
17:33.150 --> 17:35.580
Basically an extensive community of activity.

406
17:35.580 --> 17:37.380
Which makes sense, right, when you look at

407
17:37.380 --> 17:39.790
trying to bring together the commercial,

408
17:39.790 --> 17:43.031
the linkage of research to the commercial opportunities,

409
17:43.031 --> 17:44.730
this kind of program,

410
17:44.730 --> 17:47.190
like the industry challenge really becomes critical

411
17:47.190 --> 17:50.070
for those people to get exposed to the problems

412
17:50.070 --> 17:52.380
but also then try and help solve the problems.

413
17:52.380 --> 17:54.840
So that's kind of my regional organization.

414
17:54.840 --> 17:56.903
I'm gonna ask Philippe now, he can talk a bit about

415
17:56.903 --> 17:59.103
kind of the European perspective.

416
18:00.360 --> 18:01.193
<v ->Thanks, Nick.</v>

417
18:01.193 --> 18:02.050
I'm Philippe Bouyer.

418
18:03.110 --> 18:04.810
I'm the chair of Quantum Delta NL,

419
18:06.345 --> 18:07.650
Quantum Delta NL, it's a non-profit organization

420
18:07.650 --> 18:10.200
with one mission and a few goals.

421
18:10.200 --> 18:14.910
The mission is to coordinate the quantum initiatives,

422
18:14.910 --> 18:16.974
the national Quantum initiatives,

423
18:16.974 --> 18:21.540
the support of the Dutch government to quantum development.

424
18:21.540 --> 18:26.070
One of the major goal we have is to use this support

425
18:26.070 --> 18:27.780
to build a quantum economy

426
18:27.780 --> 18:31.590
and to build our ecosystem, our Dutch ecosystem

427
18:31.590 --> 18:34.140
to play a significant role in this quantum economy.

428
18:35.250 --> 18:38.910
That requires to support innovation,

429
18:38.910 --> 18:41.280
innovation that will last for decades, of course.

430
18:41.280 --> 18:43.080
That doesn't mean that there is no application today,

431
18:43.080 --> 18:47.250
but we need to sustain the development of new ideas.

432
18:47.250 --> 18:50.070
We need to sustain the transfer of these new ideas

433
18:50.070 --> 18:55.070
from universities where the knowledge is to the companies.

434
18:56.370 --> 18:58.950
For that we are actually also pushing programs

435
18:58.950 --> 19:03.000
to help startups to be created, to help startups to grow,

436
19:03.000 --> 19:05.700
to help startup to get investment.

437
19:05.700 --> 19:08.070
Of course, the Netherlands, it's a small country.

438
19:08.070 --> 19:10.080
We cannot do everything.

439
19:10.080 --> 19:11.790
We cannot do everything alone,

440
19:11.790 --> 19:15.000
and we also thrive a big development

441
19:15.000 --> 19:16.650
for international cooperation.

442
19:16.650 --> 19:19.473
We've been, we are one of the,

443
19:22.320 --> 19:25.740
sorry, collaborator of UNESCO

444
19:25.740 --> 19:29.550
for the International Year of Quantum.

445
19:29.550 --> 19:33.000
We have been also pushing very hard for an initiative

446
19:33.000 --> 19:34.380
which is called 30 Nation

447
19:34.380 --> 19:36.266
and Canada is also part of it

448
19:36.266 --> 19:39.030
where we speak about what is needed

449
19:39.030 --> 19:42.480
for all our like minding country to work together

450
19:42.480 --> 19:44.160
and to get quantum technology

451
19:44.160 --> 19:46.950
to a point where we can actually have real products

452
19:46.950 --> 19:47.783
on the market.

453
19:47.783 --> 19:49.950
But these products are here today.

454
19:49.950 --> 19:52.650
That means that we not only need to push

455
19:52.650 --> 19:53.970
the development of the technology,

456
19:53.970 --> 19:56.910
but we also need to push actually the application of it.

457
19:56.910 --> 20:00.043
And this is where the Global Industry Challenge

458
20:00.043 --> 20:01.860
plays a significant role.

459
20:01.860 --> 20:05.580
I mean we need to engage ASAP with the end users.

460
20:05.580 --> 20:08.220
We need to engage ASAP with the consumers

461
20:08.220 --> 20:10.110
to look at what they need

462
20:10.110 --> 20:11.460
and to look at how quantum

463
20:11.460 --> 20:12.810
can actually respond to these needs.

464
20:12.810 --> 20:15.090
And this is why we are very supportive

465
20:15.090 --> 20:17.580
of this Quantum Industry Challenge.

466
20:17.580 --> 20:20.010
First, because we think it is today that we,

467
20:20.010 --> 20:22.200
and you heard it in the panel before,

468
20:22.200 --> 20:24.570
it is today that we need to work on quantum software,

469
20:24.570 --> 20:27.420
but not only on quantum software, on the quantum internet,

470
20:27.420 --> 20:30.420
quantum communication, quantum sensing as well.

471
20:30.420 --> 20:32.580
But we need to do it in a global way.

472
20:32.580 --> 20:34.890
I mean, we need to look at the, like the market,

473
20:34.890 --> 20:36.630
which is a worldwide market.

474
20:36.630 --> 20:37.470
Well, I have a question.

475
20:37.470 --> 20:40.080
So how many people are not from the US in this audience?

476
20:40.080 --> 20:41.310
Maybe you can raise your hands.

477
20:41.310 --> 20:43.860
I hope I can see that because I have the light in the face,

478
20:43.860 --> 20:47.850
but well, that means something.

479
20:47.850 --> 20:51.330
I mean it's not only a market for Europe,

480
20:51.330 --> 20:52.800
it's not only a market for the US.

481
20:52.800 --> 20:53.700
It's a global market,

482
20:53.700 --> 20:55.410
and it's also a global development market.

483
20:55.410 --> 20:58.830
So we are very supportive of the Quantum Industry Challenge.

484
20:58.830 --> 21:03.330
And please we think the success of such an initiative

485
21:03.330 --> 21:06.450
welcome if you all actually apply to it,

486
21:06.450 --> 21:07.710
if you'll use this opportunity.

487
21:07.710 --> 21:09.750
So please, yes, use this opportunity

488
21:09.750 --> 21:12.570
to register to the Quantum Industry Challenge,

489
21:12.570 --> 21:15.360
and I hope that we can actually together

490
21:15.360 --> 21:17.550
get great applications and great concepts

491
21:17.550 --> 21:18.723
out of this initiative.

492
21:21.716 --> 21:24.966
(audience applauding)

493
21:33.720 --> 21:34.553
<v ->Thank you, Philippe and Nick.</v>

494
21:34.553 --> 21:37.590
As you can see from the map, we have kind of five confirmed

495
21:37.590 --> 21:39.570
besides the four Accord members,

496
21:39.570 --> 21:41.310
Cleveland, Ohio in the United States

497
21:41.310 --> 21:43.830
is also a confirmed impact node,

498
21:43.830 --> 21:45.795
and there's lots of interest

499
21:45.795 --> 21:47.730
from some of the light green flags, pins

500
21:47.730 --> 21:48.810
that you see on the map.

501
21:48.810 --> 21:50.820
If there's interest in other countries,

502
21:50.820 --> 21:52.410
thank you, Philippe for asking that question,

503
21:52.410 --> 21:54.270
who are in the room or otherwise who are interested

504
21:54.270 --> 21:56.310
to participate, please let us know.

505
21:56.310 --> 21:57.320
So with that, let me move on

506
21:57.320 --> 21:59.490
to the last major segment of this,

507
21:59.490 --> 22:02.820
which is I would like to invite Kanav Setia up,

508
22:02.820 --> 22:04.740
who is the CEO and Co-founder of qBraid

509
22:04.740 --> 22:07.020
who is the platform that's gonna allow us

510
22:07.020 --> 22:08.120
to kind of execute for this.

511
22:08.120 --> 22:10.620
So Kanav's gonna spend five to seven minutes

512
22:10.620 --> 22:12.820
just kind of going through what qBraid does.

513
22:14.550 --> 22:15.960
<v ->Good morning, CES.</v>

514
22:15.960 --> 22:17.790
How's everybody doing?

515
22:17.790 --> 22:18.960
Nice, nice, nice.

516
22:18.960 --> 22:20.670
So I'm gonna start with a question.

517
22:20.670 --> 22:24.990
How many people here heard the Google Willow announcement

518
22:24.990 --> 22:25.823
two weeks ago.

519
22:27.420 --> 22:29.850
All right, lots of light.

520
22:29.850 --> 22:31.320
Good amount, good amount.

521
22:31.320 --> 22:35.220
So couple that with the excitement you heard today

522
22:35.220 --> 22:37.950
that it's like just so much that has happened

523
22:37.950 --> 22:39.960
first over the past hundred years

524
22:39.960 --> 22:42.660
and also like over the past five years itself,

525
22:42.660 --> 22:44.010
tremendous progress.

526
22:44.010 --> 22:47.100
You heard about so many different business applications.

527
22:47.100 --> 22:50.100
Hearing all of that, how many people here

528
22:50.100 --> 22:52.470
want to do something in Quantum?

529
22:52.470 --> 22:54.843
Wanna share the excitement by show of hands.

530
22:56.250 --> 22:58.980
All right, good, good number.

531
22:58.980 --> 23:01.470
Okay, just one last question, I promise.

532
23:01.470 --> 23:06.470
How many people here already have something going on

533
23:06.480 --> 23:10.713
in their company or organization with respect to Quantum?

534
23:13.260 --> 23:15.060
Oh wow, good percentage,

535
23:15.060 --> 23:19.620
but that percentage is still just looking around sizing it,

536
23:19.620 --> 23:21.840
it's less than 10%.

537
23:21.840 --> 23:24.600
And that's the part that we wanted to change

538
23:24.600 --> 23:27.394
with Global Industry Challenge.

539
23:27.394 --> 23:32.100
The idea is how do we engage with more people?

540
23:32.100 --> 23:35.820
So many people hear big announcements,

541
23:35.820 --> 23:38.250
big industry problems getting addressed

542
23:38.250 --> 23:39.510
using quantum computing,

543
23:39.510 --> 23:42.960
and everybody's thinking, okay, like, okay,

544
23:42.960 --> 23:45.660
I mean, you can have calculations

545
23:45.660 --> 23:48.510
that would take 10 raised to the power of 25 years

546
23:48.510 --> 23:49.560
done in five minutes.

547
23:49.560 --> 23:51.930
But what does that mean for me, right?

548
23:51.930 --> 23:53.460
And that's the part

549
23:53.460 --> 23:56.550
where we came up with this Global Industry Challenge.

550
23:56.550 --> 23:58.050
What we wanted to do was

551
23:58.050 --> 24:01.830
without selling anything to anybody, bring you in,

552
24:01.830 --> 24:04.500
understand the problems you care about.

553
24:04.500 --> 24:07.830
You bring us the problem that you care about

554
24:07.830 --> 24:09.660
in your industry, the problem,

555
24:09.660 --> 24:12.090
the most complex and challenging problems

556
24:12.090 --> 24:16.020
that you face in your workflow, bring it to us,

557
24:16.020 --> 24:20.070
and then we'll work with you to design a challenge

558
24:20.070 --> 24:24.540
for the students and hackers around the world

559
24:24.540 --> 24:28.980
from the most amazing places like MIT, UC Berkeley.

560
24:28.980 --> 24:32.850
And you heard lot of places all over the world

561
24:32.850 --> 24:37.800
like Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, U Maryland,

562
24:37.800 --> 24:39.510
and all those amazing places,

563
24:39.510 --> 24:42.090
people from all of these amazing places

564
24:42.090 --> 24:45.060
come together to build a solution

565
24:45.060 --> 24:47.910
and address the challenges that you brought in.

566
24:47.910 --> 24:49.590
So where does qBrain come in?

567
24:49.590 --> 24:52.710
So qBrain is a one-stop platform

568
24:52.710 --> 24:56.460
where we provide the easiest and most streamlined access

569
24:56.460 --> 24:59.250
to quantum software and quantum hardware,

570
24:59.250 --> 25:01.140
so that we will work with you

571
25:01.140 --> 25:02.940
to design those challenge problems

572
25:02.940 --> 25:05.190
and release it on our platform.

573
25:05.190 --> 25:07.860
I like to say what we do is we take you

574
25:07.860 --> 25:10.020
from not knowing much about Quantum

575
25:10.020 --> 25:12.510
to running your first quantum program

576
25:12.510 --> 25:15.510
on a real quantum computer in under five minutes.

577
25:15.510 --> 25:18.090
So you probably saw all the logos listed.

578
25:18.090 --> 25:20.070
So we work with all the major companies

579
25:20.070 --> 25:23.073
including IBM, AWS, Microsoft, Qora, IREQ,

580
25:24.330 --> 25:28.350
and we have all of their quantum computers available

581
25:28.350 --> 25:30.120
at a click of a button.

582
25:30.120 --> 25:33.480
So these challenges will be released on our platform.

583
25:33.480 --> 25:36.270
All the hackers have easiest access to quantum software,

584
25:36.270 --> 25:37.230
quantum hardware.

585
25:37.230 --> 25:40.350
They build a solution for 10 weeks,

586
25:40.350 --> 25:42.180
and once they get done,

587
25:42.180 --> 25:45.840
we assess them in partnership with you.

588
25:45.840 --> 25:50.580
We give out prizes at the Quantum World Congress,

589
25:50.580 --> 25:53.760
and ultimately the goal is to make that solution

590
25:53.760 --> 25:56.922
easily accessible to all of you.

591
25:56.922 --> 25:58.560
So you should just be able to,

592
25:58.560 --> 26:00.750
or your developers at your organization,

593
26:00.750 --> 26:03.510
you should just be able to log into our platform

594
26:03.510 --> 26:06.900
and play with the solution and build on it, right?

595
26:06.900 --> 26:10.560
And that's the goal, and that's the theme.

596
26:10.560 --> 26:12.990
And unless anybody has any questions,

597
26:12.990 --> 26:14.253
I think that's my part.

598
26:15.998 --> 26:18.682
(audience applauding)

599
26:18.682 --> 26:19.515
<v Audience Member>I have a question.</v>

600
26:19.515 --> 26:20.350
<v Kanav>Okay, go for it.</v>

601
26:22.042 --> 26:23.970
<v Audience Member>Do you do actual coding on the platform?</v>

602
26:23.970 --> 26:24.840
<v Kanav>Yeah, absolutely.</v>

603
26:24.840 --> 26:27.990
So we give you a Jupyter lab-based platform

604
26:27.990 --> 26:32.760
with a bunch of extensions that we built that shows devices

605
26:32.760 --> 26:35.160
and that allow you to manage your quantum jobs

606
26:35.160 --> 26:37.770
and also give you access to GPUs.

607
26:37.770 --> 26:39.840
So I think like somebody mentioned earlier,

608
26:39.840 --> 26:41.790
it's gonna be a orchestration

609
26:41.790 --> 26:43.920
of all of these compute modalities

610
26:43.920 --> 26:45.570
that are gonna work in unison

611
26:45.570 --> 26:47.400
to address all of your problems.

612
26:47.400 --> 26:48.630
So on a single platform,

613
26:48.630 --> 26:51.150
not only you get access to quantum computers,

614
26:51.150 --> 26:53.580
but people will also have access to GPUs

615
26:53.580 --> 26:55.203
and scalable CPUs.

616
26:58.350 --> 26:59.937
<v ->Thank you, Kanav.</v>

617
26:59.937 --> 27:00.981
Another round of applause please.

618
27:00.981 --> 27:04.910
(audience applauding)

619
27:04.910 --> 27:07.350
So I'm gonna go back to this for a quick sec.

620
27:07.350 --> 27:08.880
So as you've kind of heard

621
27:08.880 --> 27:11.520
from some of the component pieces of this,

622
27:11.520 --> 27:13.590
this is something we are really, really excited about

623
27:13.590 --> 27:16.230
to help move the needle from an industry perspective.

624
27:16.230 --> 27:18.000
I think the biggest kind of advantage

625
27:18.000 --> 27:19.800
to running a program like this

626
27:19.800 --> 27:24.720
is to get the end user buyers really engaged with a program

627
27:24.720 --> 27:26.939
that many of them, many of you

628
27:26.939 --> 27:30.090
may not be completely too sure how to get engaged with

629
27:30.090 --> 27:31.080
to get started.

630
27:31.080 --> 27:32.850
So we are looking at this as a mechanism

631
27:32.850 --> 27:35.880
to lower that barrier to getting into the game

632
27:35.880 --> 27:38.400
if you are a user or a buyer and have a problem

633
27:38.400 --> 27:40.620
that you think you might wanna test against it.

634
27:40.620 --> 27:42.570
And it also allows at the other end

635
27:42.570 --> 27:45.000
a significant portion of the builder community

636
27:45.000 --> 27:46.740
to engage much easier with you

637
27:46.740 --> 27:48.600
without having to create a lot of work

638
27:48.600 --> 27:50.700
for you to kind of engage one-on-one with them.

639
27:50.700 --> 27:52.470
So that's really kinda like the hope, you know,

640
27:52.470 --> 27:54.450
that we wanna kind of do with it.

641
27:54.450 --> 27:57.210
So ways to get engaged,

642
27:57.210 --> 27:58.860
if you go to the QR code,

643
27:58.860 --> 28:00.960
there is a website that has a lot more information

644
28:00.960 --> 28:02.940
about what we kind of discussed here today.

645
28:02.940 --> 28:04.740
There's multiple kind of levels

646
28:04.740 --> 28:06.090
of where you can get engaged.

647
28:06.090 --> 28:09.510
Please just go register and kind of, you know, let us know

648
28:09.510 --> 28:11.220
and get in touch with us with what it is.

649
28:11.220 --> 28:15.090
And those levels include participant groups within yours

650
28:15.090 --> 28:16.890
at your higher ed universities around the world

651
28:16.890 --> 28:19.290
if you want to create cohorts within them.

652
28:19.290 --> 28:21.840
Individual participants of smaller companies and startups

653
28:21.840 --> 28:24.150
within your countries, regions

654
28:24.150 --> 28:25.770
who might wanna participate.

655
28:25.770 --> 28:27.180
If you are an industry player,

656
28:27.180 --> 28:29.460
if you want to put a challenge in, don't know where to start

657
28:29.460 --> 28:30.720
or if you are already working on it

658
28:30.720 --> 28:32.190
but wanna participate in it,

659
28:32.190 --> 28:34.140
there's a mechanism to kind of do that as well.

660
28:34.140 --> 28:35.801
And then of course regional hosts,

661
28:35.801 --> 28:39.300
we think we'll have about seven to 10 regional hosts

662
28:39.300 --> 28:40.140
on April 14th.

663
28:40.140 --> 28:43.110
That will happen all in parallel starting with, you know,

664
28:43.110 --> 28:46.290
in Australia all the way to the west coast.

665
28:46.290 --> 28:48.450
We want you to be, and that's part of the celebration

666
28:48.450 --> 28:50.284
that we want to do, you know,

667
28:50.284 --> 28:53.070
with Paul and Marsha, with IYQ to kind of raise awareness.

668
28:53.070 --> 28:56.310
So the mission is industry use cases,

669
28:56.310 --> 28:58.200
getting the builders involved,

670
28:58.200 --> 29:00.060
create excitement around talent

671
29:00.060 --> 29:02.520
for people to kick tires around what quantum is

672
29:02.520 --> 29:04.920
and to have universities in academia start to collaborate

673
29:04.920 --> 29:06.450
on what this process is.

674
29:06.450 --> 29:09.541
So that's really at a very high level what the plan is

675
29:09.541 --> 29:11.010
for the Global Industry Challenge.

676
29:11.010 --> 29:13.680
So I think we have a little bit of time, so, you know,

677
29:13.680 --> 29:16.080
we can open it up for some questions.

678
29:16.080 --> 29:18.880
If there are any questions we can take a couple I think.

679
29:20.100 --> 29:21.990
And again as Philippe said, we can't,

680
29:21.990 --> 29:24.543
I can't see anything, it's just blinding light, so.

681
29:33.630 --> 29:35.553
I think I see your hand there, yeah.

682
29:37.593 --> 29:38.700
<v ->[Audience Members] What are some of the applications</v>

683
29:38.700 --> 29:41.910
you've seen already and inspire us with, you know,

684
29:41.910 --> 29:44.880
some of these applications as innovators?

685
29:44.880 --> 29:46.298
<v ->Yeah, sure.</v>

686
29:46.298 --> 29:47.700
I'll pick on one for no particular reason.

687
29:47.700 --> 29:52.400
So our partner on the life sciences innovation,

688
29:53.310 --> 29:55.710
sorry, the industry challenge is Cleveland Clinic

689
29:55.710 --> 29:59.100
and Cleveland Clinic for the last I know 10-ish years

690
29:59.100 --> 30:01.680
has been very deeply engaged in quantum.

691
30:01.680 --> 30:04.320
They, you know, outside of quantum in their research

692
30:04.320 --> 30:07.590
they have about 1600 researchers looking for the next thing.

693
30:07.590 --> 30:08.670
From a mission perspective,

694
30:08.670 --> 30:10.620
they're trying to solve disease problems,

695
30:10.620 --> 30:12.990
and you know, pharma problems

696
30:12.990 --> 30:15.810
and delivery of devices problems for healthcare.

697
30:15.810 --> 30:18.150
Quantum is just one tool in their kit bag,

698
30:18.150 --> 30:21.120
but they're one of the, I think the first life sciences firm

699
30:21.120 --> 30:23.790
to actually acquire a physical quantum computer

700
30:23.790 --> 30:24.870
and put it on site.

701
30:24.870 --> 30:26.340
They acquired a IBM System One,

702
30:26.340 --> 30:28.440
I think they're gonna create an IBM System Two.

703
30:28.440 --> 30:31.470
So that organization has been working quite a bit

704
30:31.470 --> 30:33.210
at use cases within it.

705
30:33.210 --> 30:35.340
So within that, one of the areas

706
30:35.340 --> 30:38.310
they are thinking of putting in is around neurotech

707
30:38.310 --> 30:40.050
and brain functions

708
30:40.050 --> 30:43.860
that can be possibly solved using quantum functions, please.

709
30:43.860 --> 30:47.160
<v ->I'm thinking more of the hacker type community,</v>

710
30:47.160 --> 30:49.230
the people that can do that kinda stuff.

711
30:49.230 --> 30:52.740
For that, we're not just gonna think of that in our basement

712
30:52.740 --> 30:55.458
and come up with that solution.

713
30:55.458 --> 30:58.050
I'm thinking more of a blender community

714
30:58.050 --> 31:01.110
that's gonna do computational fluid dynamics

715
31:01.110 --> 31:04.440
and have water flow and more applications

716
31:04.440 --> 31:07.500
that are more practical than solving cancer right now

717
31:07.500 --> 31:09.930
'cause we're not gonna wake up and say, oh my goodness,

718
31:09.930 --> 31:12.930
let's solve that cancer problem.

719
31:12.930 --> 31:14.670
<v ->No, you're absolutely right, and there's a big difference</v>

720
31:14.670 --> 31:17.730
between solving something that can, you know,

721
31:17.730 --> 31:18.990
move data from A to B

722
31:18.990 --> 31:21.240
or some part of crypto to solving cancer.

723
31:21.240 --> 31:23.340
Like that's a pretty large gradient.

724
31:23.340 --> 31:26.130
And these organizations have been working quite a bit

725
31:26.130 --> 31:28.612
at figuring out these parts of that

726
31:28.612 --> 31:29.610
that could help you solve cancer.

727
31:29.610 --> 31:31.140
So it's not going all the way at the end

728
31:31.140 --> 31:32.250
with a challenge like this.

729
31:32.250 --> 31:33.390
You're absolutely right.

730
31:33.390 --> 31:35.610
There's not enough time to kind of go do that,

731
31:35.610 --> 31:38.340
but what we want to do is use this mechanism

732
31:38.340 --> 31:40.380
to involve a much larger community

733
31:40.380 --> 31:41.343
to look at these parts of this

734
31:41.343 --> 31:43.293
that they might wanna go and solve for.

735
31:44.160 --> 31:45.733
<v ->Yes, go ahead, here.</v>

736
31:48.930 --> 31:52.320
<v ->I just wanna quickly add to what George already mentioned.</v>

737
31:52.320 --> 31:54.450
So there's a lot of really cool applications

738
31:54.450 --> 31:56.100
around quantum machine learning as well.

739
31:56.100 --> 31:57.840
So it's nowhere close to

740
31:57.840 --> 32:00.090
where traditional machine learning is,

741
32:00.090 --> 32:02.310
but there are really cool examples

742
32:02.310 --> 32:03.900
where you see the potential.

743
32:03.900 --> 32:07.680
There have been a few papers where what you can show

744
32:07.680 --> 32:12.240
is that quantum neural nets train much faster

745
32:12.240 --> 32:14.310
with much lower parameters.

746
32:14.310 --> 32:17.940
And overall, if you look at the energy burned by

747
32:17.940 --> 32:20.070
or the energy required by quantum computers

748
32:20.070 --> 32:23.430
with respect to classical computers, it's much lower.

749
32:23.430 --> 32:27.870
So it's a very small model where AlexNet was,

750
32:27.870 --> 32:30.990
I believe in 2012 or maybe even preliminary to that,

751
32:30.990 --> 32:34.320
but it's like one really cool example that shows that,

752
32:34.320 --> 32:37.320
hey, there might be something incredibly cool here.

753
32:37.320 --> 32:40.230
So those are problems which are easily accessible

754
32:40.230 --> 32:41.700
by all the hackers

755
32:41.700 --> 32:44.190
because it's the data that you're gonna understand

756
32:44.190 --> 32:45.840
and neural networks, it's again

757
32:45.840 --> 32:47.580
like different way of encoding,

758
32:47.580 --> 32:50.400
but this is something you can just sit down for two days

759
32:50.400 --> 32:51.543
and make sense of it.

760
32:52.770 --> 32:55.500
And even on the solving cancer part,

761
32:55.500 --> 32:57.870
again, if you just say solving cancer,

762
32:57.870 --> 32:59.310
that's incredibly hard.

763
32:59.310 --> 33:02.880
But then if you zone in on a particular piece,

764
33:02.880 --> 33:04.410
then that becomes tractable,

765
33:04.410 --> 33:07.230
and that's where you will have support from all of us

766
33:07.230 --> 33:08.730
where we will come in and understand,

767
33:08.730 --> 33:11.130
okay, no, no, narrow this down.

768
33:11.130 --> 33:12.895
We're gonna zone in onto something

769
33:12.895 --> 33:15.300
and make it into a mathematical problem.

770
33:15.300 --> 33:18.000
And as soon as you do that, it becomes easily tractable

771
33:18.000 --> 33:19.443
by hackers around the world.

772
33:21.678 --> 33:22.890
<v ->[Audience Members] I have a question.</v>

773
33:22.890 --> 33:25.170
Nowadays the blockchain technology

774
33:25.170 --> 33:26.460
has become really hot,

775
33:26.460 --> 33:29.732
and many people host like blockchain exchange,

776
33:29.732 --> 33:34.732
I mean BTC, Bitcoin as wealth, and so quantum economy,

777
33:35.430 --> 33:39.720
quantum technology, how in what level it will impact

778
33:39.720 --> 33:44.130
or interrupt the blockchain technology in future?

779
33:44.130 --> 33:45.657
Could you share a little bit about that?

780
33:45.657 --> 33:48.624
<v ->Oh, I'm not qualified to answer that question.</v>

781
33:48.624 --> 33:51.453
Yeah, I mean if you look at blockchain

782
33:51.453 --> 33:53.430
just from the compute perspective side of it,

783
33:53.430 --> 33:55.230
that it takes a lot of energy, this thing,

784
33:55.230 --> 33:57.030
and it's just a shared ledger,

785
33:57.030 --> 33:59.490
you can think of a lot of ways just classic that would,

786
33:59.490 --> 34:01.560
I would just put it in the bucket of classical computing.

787
34:01.560 --> 34:03.240
So that question, if you just convert that

788
34:03.240 --> 34:04.980
to a classical computer question,

789
34:04.980 --> 34:07.200
there are lots of ways to kind of think about it

790
34:07.200 --> 34:08.250
from a blockchain perspective.

791
34:08.250 --> 34:10.110
The other side we haven't quite mentioned

792
34:10.110 --> 34:11.910
is energy usage, right?

793
34:11.910 --> 34:14.010
Energy usage for classical computing

794
34:14.010 --> 34:17.070
and high performance computing has a certain kind of demand

795
34:17.070 --> 34:20.070
that we have all seen with AI data centers now, you know,

796
34:20.070 --> 34:22.590
companies looking at building their own nuclear facilities

797
34:22.590 --> 34:23.970
to power their own data.

798
34:23.970 --> 34:26.220
There's a whole kind of conversation going on

799
34:26.220 --> 34:28.950
within the quantum and adjacent committee

800
34:28.950 --> 34:32.101
about what would it mean to run a quantum commuter.

801
34:32.101 --> 34:34.272
Is it less energy intensive, more energy intensive?

802
34:34.272 --> 34:37.350
Is it usable now to use quantum

803
34:37.350 --> 34:39.603
to help solve for energy needs?

804
34:39.603 --> 34:40.436
So maybe not in the next 15 years,

805
34:40.436 --> 34:42.300
but after 15 years we'd have something

806
34:42.300 --> 34:46.020
that quantum can help optimize energy usage in data centers,

807
34:46.020 --> 34:48.286
which again, use technologies like blockchain.

808
34:48.286 --> 34:49.470
that are more intensive.

809
34:49.470 --> 34:50.940
I would put AI in the same bucket,

810
34:50.940 --> 34:53.340
but I'm generalizing both of those

811
34:53.340 --> 34:55.410
under just classical computing needs

812
34:55.410 --> 34:57.120
versus blockchain specifically,

813
34:57.120 --> 35:00.153
which I'm not qualified to talk to, if that helps.

814
35:01.620 --> 35:04.479
Okay, I think we can take one more question please.

815
35:04.479 --> 35:05.940
<v Audience Member>Would you say that the main reason</v>

816
35:05.940 --> 35:08.880
that quantum computers maybe aren't scaling

817
35:08.880 --> 35:11.520
as fast in mainstream would be

818
35:11.520 --> 35:14.319
because people aren't aware of

819
35:14.319 --> 35:17.373
that they can use quantum computing?

820
35:19.290 --> 35:20.807
<v ->That's a tricky question.</v>

821
35:20.807 --> 35:23.280
I would kind of push back on the premise

822
35:23.280 --> 35:24.660
that they're not scaling as fast.

823
35:24.660 --> 35:28.080
I think if you think about where quantum was, right?

824
35:28.080 --> 35:32.850
Like Schrödinger and Bohr and Einstein

825
35:32.850 --> 35:35.402
in about the 1900s came up with a theory.

826
35:35.402 --> 35:37.515
<v Audience Member>I mean from a public perspective,</v>

827
35:37.515 --> 35:38.777
awareness? (audio blurs)

828
35:38.777 --> 35:41.700
<v ->So, but even if the public is aware,</v>

829
35:41.700 --> 35:45.180
let's say all 100,000 people at CES were aware of quantum,

830
35:45.180 --> 35:48.750
what would they do about it, right?

831
35:48.750 --> 35:50.940
It's the engagement models that are more difficult

832
35:50.940 --> 35:52.920
than just the awareness part of it, right?

833
35:52.920 --> 35:55.802
So you need to have enough PhDs generated

834
35:55.802 --> 35:58.770
around many, many topics that's not just quantum,

835
35:58.770 --> 36:01.380
it's IT, it's, you know, there's a whole bunch of sleuth.

836
36:01.380 --> 36:04.470
You need to have business translation capability.

837
36:04.470 --> 36:06.900
Just because I can go to Cleveland Clinic

838
36:06.900 --> 36:08.610
does not mean they know how to translate that

839
36:08.610 --> 36:10.410
to a quantum question.

840
36:10.410 --> 36:13.530
So we have lots of challenges in talent development

841
36:13.530 --> 36:16.020
and pipeline, how that gets applied.

842
36:16.020 --> 36:18.780
We have engineering issues that people are trying to solve

843
36:18.780 --> 36:21.780
around deploying full scale quantum computers.

844
36:21.780 --> 36:24.210
The science is there, the engineering always takes time.

845
36:24.210 --> 36:25.050
We have dependencies

846
36:25.050 --> 36:27.000
that are completely outside the quantum world

847
36:27.000 --> 36:28.110
from a standards perspective,

848
36:28.110 --> 36:29.850
from a policy perspective that have come into play.

849
36:29.850 --> 36:31.260
And those things take time.

850
36:31.260 --> 36:32.340
And I said in the morning session,

851
36:32.340 --> 36:33.270
they're not linear, right?

852
36:33.270 --> 36:34.560
They're cyclical,

853
36:34.560 --> 36:36.030
and you know, not saying

854
36:36.030 --> 36:38.130
that somebody somewhere won't have a killer app

855
36:38.130 --> 36:39.630
that kind of drives everything.

856
36:39.630 --> 36:43.500
But without that, like AI is a great example, right?

857
36:43.500 --> 36:47.070
Chat GPT apparently happened, what, overnight?

858
36:47.070 --> 36:49.470
But AI has been in play, the same technologies

859
36:49.470 --> 36:52.320
for 60, 70 years now before Chat GPT came around,

860
36:52.320 --> 36:55.080
and there's a significant amount of generations of work

861
36:55.080 --> 36:57.930
that built all the building blocks that made that happen.

862
37:03.080 --> 37:05.160
<v ->Yeah, I can add one point to your question.</v>

863
37:05.160 --> 37:09.090
It's yes, the penetration of quantum technology

864
37:09.090 --> 37:13.650
into the society is not quite significant there.

865
37:13.650 --> 37:15.510
That doesn't mean that it's hindering the development

866
37:15.510 --> 37:16.440
of quantum computer.

867
37:16.440 --> 37:18.300
And actually if you look at what happened

868
37:18.300 --> 37:22.470
over the past two years, that's actually pretty amazing.

869
37:22.470 --> 37:25.440
I think if we would have a meeting here two years ago,

870
37:25.440 --> 37:28.320
we would say quantum computer may be error correction,

871
37:28.320 --> 37:30.007
we're not quite sure.

872
37:30.007 --> 37:34.260
And all of a sudden there were like tremendous announcement

873
37:34.260 --> 37:38.923
made by Google, made by University of Harvard

874
37:38.923 --> 37:40.230
about like actual corrections.

875
37:40.230 --> 37:42.161
And it's now implemented

876
37:42.161 --> 37:44.580
in most of quantum computing platform.

877
37:44.580 --> 37:46.830
Same thing with connecting two quantum computer,

878
37:46.830 --> 37:48.690
two quantum computer cores

879
37:48.690 --> 37:50.760
or two quantum computer chips together,

880
37:50.760 --> 37:53.190
one of the challenge of quantum internet.

881
37:53.190 --> 37:55.710
If we would have like spoken about it last year,

882
37:55.710 --> 37:57.900
I say, well, we are really working hard on it,

883
37:57.900 --> 37:59.400
but this is a very hard problem

884
37:59.400 --> 38:02.130
and look at the announcements that were done with Google

885
38:02.130 --> 38:02.963
and others.

886
38:02.963 --> 38:05.040
I mean this is something which is happening today.

887
38:05.040 --> 38:07.200
So this is not the same scaling we're speaking about.

888
38:07.200 --> 38:09.120
This is not about having from 10

889
38:09.120 --> 38:12.060
to like 100 cubits to 1,000 cubits to a million cubits.

890
38:12.060 --> 38:13.860
This is really about getting the solutions

891
38:13.860 --> 38:15.720
to the real problem that we have.

892
38:15.720 --> 38:18.420
But we still need to reach out with the society.

893
38:18.420 --> 38:20.400
We still need to reach out with the consumers.

894
38:20.400 --> 38:22.001
This event is one of them.

895
38:22.001 --> 38:25.260
This is also our role as organizations.

896
38:25.260 --> 38:27.060
I mean we, for example, at Quantum Delta

897
38:27.060 --> 38:28.410
have launched and created

898
38:28.410 --> 38:29.760
the Center for Quantum and Society,

899
38:29.760 --> 38:33.090
which is really outreaching to the rest of the society

900
38:33.090 --> 38:34.350
to say Quantum is here.

901
38:34.350 --> 38:37.020
You don't need to understand quantum in order to use it.

902
38:37.020 --> 38:39.000
The same way you don't need to understand electronics

903
38:39.000 --> 38:39.960
to use your iPhone,

904
38:39.960 --> 38:41.700
you just need to press on the button.

905
38:41.700 --> 38:43.377
And this is what we have to do.

906
38:43.377 --> 38:45.780
And I think this is what the Quantum Industry Challenge

907
38:45.780 --> 38:48.000
and an initiative like this will do,

908
38:48.000 --> 38:50.013
and this is why we need to do it ASAP.

909
38:51.304 --> 38:53.683
<v Audience Member>Thank you so much.</v>

910
38:53.683 --> 38:55.170
<v ->Just one follow up from my perspective.</v>

911
38:55.170 --> 38:58.140
So the worst, the word quantum

912
38:58.140 --> 39:01.020
is getting used in this context to mean particularly

913
39:01.020 --> 39:03.030
what I call quantum information technologies,

914
39:03.030 --> 39:04.800
which are these new things like quantum computation,

915
39:04.800 --> 39:05.820
quantum sensing, right?

916
39:05.820 --> 39:09.210
And that is one part of the quantum landscape, right?

917
39:09.210 --> 39:11.550
So we started exploring this quantum landscape

918
39:11.550 --> 39:15.510
100 years ago, and that the particular things

919
39:15.510 --> 39:17.430
that are coming to fruition now,

920
39:17.430 --> 39:19.290
people didn't realize until like 50 years ago.

921
39:19.290 --> 39:21.509
So we're doing things on decadal timescales,

922
39:21.509 --> 39:24.870
but I see these things saying,

923
39:24.870 --> 39:27.120
oh, like is quantum technology coming?

924
39:27.120 --> 39:28.860
Quantum technology has always been here

925
39:28.860 --> 39:31.200
for the past decades and decades, right?

926
39:31.200 --> 39:34.650
So every single LED light that you see, right,

927
39:34.650 --> 39:37.593
we couldn't have created without quantum understanding.

928
39:38.640 --> 39:40.500
It's a kind of a silly technology at this point,

929
39:40.500 --> 39:42.630
but everybody's got a light on their phone, right?

930
39:42.630 --> 39:44.280
A bright light on their phone.

931
39:44.280 --> 39:46.770
And if you touch that light, it's not hot.

932
39:46.770 --> 39:48.060
If you talk to people 100 years ago,

933
39:48.060 --> 39:50.610
how do you make a light that bright that's not hot?

934
39:50.610 --> 39:52.500
They'll just say it's impossible, right?

935
39:52.500 --> 39:54.090
It's only because we have quantum understanding

936
39:54.090 --> 39:55.650
that we can do that technology.

937
39:55.650 --> 39:57.570
So what we need to do in this year

938
39:57.570 --> 40:00.570
is talk about the present and future,

939
40:00.570 --> 40:02.640
but also talk about all the things that surround them

940
40:02.640 --> 40:06.360
in their electronics that are quantum related.

941
40:06.360 --> 40:10.230
Everybody understands DNA, right?

942
40:10.230 --> 40:12.720
Doesn't mean everybody's a microbiologist, right?

943
40:12.720 --> 40:15.270
But if you go out in the strip and ask people like

944
40:15.270 --> 40:16.473
what is quantum?

945
40:17.340 --> 40:19.140
They'll give you blank looks, right?

946
40:19.140 --> 40:21.690
Something from a Marvel movie, something like that.

947
40:21.690 --> 40:24.690
We need people to understand that Quantum has been here,

948
40:24.690 --> 40:26.820
is here, has been generating all this technologies,

949
40:26.820 --> 40:29.100
is underlying everything at CES

950
40:29.100 --> 40:32.040
and will continue to generate all sorts of new technologies.

951
40:32.040 --> 40:34.200
That's the goal of the year.

952
40:34.200 --> 40:36.450
<v ->Thank you, and we'll leave that as the last word.</v>

953
40:36.450 --> 40:38.070
Please join the global community

954
40:38.070 --> 40:39.720
in participating in the Global Industrial Challenge.

955
40:39.720 --> 40:40.959
Thank you.

956
40:40.959 --> 40:42.073
(audience applauding)

957
40:42.073 --> 40:44.740
(upbeat music)
