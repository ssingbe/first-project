1
00:02.460 --> 00:06.720
<v ->We are here at CES 2025 where business gets done.</v>

2
00:06.720 --> 00:07.860
I'm Brian Comiskey,

3
00:07.860 --> 00:10.740
Senior Director of Innovation and Trends at CTA.

4
00:10.740 --> 00:13.650
I'm also the futurist here, which means I'm here today

5
00:13.650 --> 00:15.300
to talk about tomorrow

6
00:15.300 --> 00:17.430
and we're in North Hall really looking at what

7
00:17.430 --> 00:19.530
tomorrow's enterprise looks like.

8
00:19.530 --> 00:24.180
At CES, 30 to 40% of our exhibitors offer and showcase

9
00:24.180 --> 00:25.410
enterprise technology.

10
00:25.410 --> 00:30.330
So software as a service, FinTech, cybersecurity, cloud, AI,

11
00:30.330 --> 00:34.020
and more are all showcasing what enterprise will be using

12
00:34.020 --> 00:36.720
to really define work, improve operations,

13
00:36.720 --> 00:39.120
and really create more productivity in the future.

14
00:39.120 --> 00:41.910
So why don't you join me as we walk across North Hall

15
00:41.910 --> 00:43.080
and take a look at some of the greatest

16
00:43.080 --> 00:45.303
enterprise innovations on the show floor.

17
00:52.560 --> 00:56.730
Textile industry, water scarcity, and even jet design.

18
00:56.730 --> 00:59.160
What do these three industries have in common?

19
00:59.160 --> 01:01.140
Well, a new tech sector is starting to merge

20
01:01.140 --> 01:04.380
all thanks to industrial AI from Siemens.

21
01:04.380 --> 01:06.840
So what we're looking at here are textiles

22
01:06.840 --> 01:10.380
created in a partnership between Spinnova and Siemens.

23
01:10.380 --> 01:12.240
My grandfather used to work in the textile industry.

24
01:12.240 --> 01:14.910
It's very labor intensive, it's material intensive.

25
01:14.910 --> 01:16.980
How do we start to make that more sustainable

26
01:16.980 --> 01:20.190
as generations think about how to get more sustainability

27
01:20.190 --> 01:22.140
and green impact outta their clothing?

28
01:22.140 --> 01:24.450
Well, using a virtualization

29
01:24.450 --> 01:26.820
of the textile industry floor from Siemens

30
01:26.820 --> 01:28.470
Industrial AI technology,

31
01:28.470 --> 01:29.850
they're starting to get those solutions

32
01:29.850 --> 01:32.760
in this wonderful partnership with Spinnova.

33
01:32.760 --> 01:35.730
Water scarcity is one of the biggest challenges

34
01:35.730 --> 01:36.960
facing the globe right now.

35
01:36.960 --> 01:39.960
And so how do you start to make smarter filtration systems

36
01:39.960 --> 01:42.270
that can turn things like even sea water with salt

37
01:42.270 --> 01:44.100
into drinking water resources?

38
01:44.100 --> 01:46.980
Again, a partnership here through Siemens Industrial AI,

39
01:46.980 --> 01:48.960
working with Wayout to secure

40
01:48.960 --> 01:50.790
and filter more drinking water

41
01:50.790 --> 01:54.420
so that people have greater access to this vital resource.

42
01:54.420 --> 01:55.970
This is incredible, by the way.

43
02:00.120 --> 02:02.340
Air travel connects us from A to B

44
02:02.340 --> 02:04.830
and helps make the world feel a little bit smaller,

45
02:04.830 --> 02:06.360
and we want to see what does the future

46
02:06.360 --> 02:07.500
of air travel look like?

47
02:07.500 --> 02:09.120
How is it more sustainable?

48
02:09.120 --> 02:11.520
So Siemens Industrial AI has made a partnership

49
02:11.520 --> 02:14.400
with JetZero to create this blended wing design

50
02:14.400 --> 02:15.420
that you see here.

51
02:15.420 --> 02:17.490
This allows for more efficient air travel,

52
02:17.490 --> 02:18.750
greener air travel,

53
02:18.750 --> 02:20.580
and you're starting to see those partnerships take off

54
02:20.580 --> 02:23.700
not just in the commercial air travel space for tourism,

55
02:23.700 --> 02:25.290
but also even the military space

56
02:25.290 --> 02:26.460
with the United States Air Force

57
02:26.460 --> 02:28.560
getting involved in this partnership as well.

58
02:28.560 --> 02:29.670
Really transforming

59
02:29.670 --> 02:32.363
and helping the world just feel a little bit more global.

60
02:34.380 --> 02:38.070
And we're continuing our enterprise of B2B story here at CES

61
02:38.070 --> 02:39.390
at Richtech Robotics,

62
02:39.390 --> 02:41.790
which is one of my favorite places to go.

63
02:41.790 --> 02:44.220
Looking at the ADAM and the Scorpio robots behind me,

64
02:44.220 --> 02:45.450
this is an incredible company

65
02:45.450 --> 02:47.760
that has grown from being in the hospitality sector

66
02:47.760 --> 02:50.790
to a wide range of B2B solutions across services,

67
02:50.790 --> 02:53.700
whether that's pharmaceutical, the food industry,

68
02:53.700 --> 02:56.190
or even the commercial and hotel industry

69
02:56.190 --> 02:58.260
through a variety of robots like ADAM,

70
02:58.260 --> 03:01.140
who's a barista that has humanoid capabilities.

71
03:01.140 --> 03:03.510
It will make and cater a drink based on your mood

72
03:03.510 --> 03:05.640
and preference with human-like motion,

73
03:05.640 --> 03:07.830
it is seen it deployed at the Texas Rangers

74
03:07.830 --> 03:10.440
and other businesses and environments and venues

75
03:10.440 --> 03:11.700
across the country.

76
03:11.700 --> 03:13.800
Similarly, we see robots like Dusty

77
03:13.800 --> 03:15.330
that are helping clean floors.

78
03:15.330 --> 03:17.040
You have Titan and Med Bot

79
03:17.040 --> 03:19.470
that are helping really bring pharmaceutical drugs

80
03:19.470 --> 03:20.850
across the hospital floor.

81
03:20.850 --> 03:23.040
So when we look at the space

82
03:23.040 --> 03:25.230
and how robotics are really transforming

83
03:25.230 --> 03:27.930
and being a physical representation of AI,

84
03:27.930 --> 03:31.143
the rich text robotic story is really driving it home.

85
03:36.120 --> 03:37.260
We're at Lotte,

86
03:37.260 --> 03:40.320
one of Korea's biggest brands in the metaverse

87
03:40.320 --> 03:42.570
as well as shopping and retail story.

88
03:42.570 --> 03:45.030
So what we're seeing here is their Caliverse product

89
03:45.030 --> 03:47.370
that helps for 3D visualization

90
03:47.370 --> 03:49.920
and metaverse capabilities to bring the stores

91
03:49.920 --> 03:53.250
of tomorrow directly into your homes today.

92
03:53.250 --> 03:54.510
Oh my gosh, wow.

93
03:54.510 --> 03:55.343
Perfect.

94
03:55.343 --> 03:56.176
This is excellent.

95
03:56.176 --> 03:57.270
This is so cool.

96
03:57.270 --> 03:59.220
This is exactly what we're talking about

97
03:59.220 --> 04:00.053
when we're talking about

98
04:00.053 --> 04:02.940
how do we bring the human into the digital world

99
04:02.940 --> 04:05.220
and really coexist with one another,

100
04:05.220 --> 04:07.980
and this is gonna bring and bridge out those gaps

101
04:07.980 --> 04:10.230
in shopping and let people try out brands

102
04:10.230 --> 04:11.580
that they might not be familiar with.

103
04:11.580 --> 04:13.110
So this is incredible.

104
04:13.110 --> 04:15.003
Such a wonderful experience.

105
04:17.190 --> 04:20.940
The average CES attendee has 29 meetings per week,

106
04:20.940 --> 04:24.030
and you saw some of this action on the enterprise story

107
04:24.030 --> 04:27.090
in play from Siemens, Richtech Robotics,

108
04:27.090 --> 04:30.660
and Lotte showcasing how it's a global business show.

109
04:30.660 --> 04:32.820
You can see the enterprise B2B story

110
04:32.820 --> 04:35.550
really shine here at CES 2025.

111
04:35.550 --> 04:36.630
I really want to thank you

112
04:36.630 --> 04:38.530
for taking this journey with me today.
