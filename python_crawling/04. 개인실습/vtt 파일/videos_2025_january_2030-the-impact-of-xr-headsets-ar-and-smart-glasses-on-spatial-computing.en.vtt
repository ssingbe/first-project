00:00.003 --> 00:02.570
(upbeat music)

00:09.703 --> 00:10.536
- Hello, good morning.

00:10.536 --> 00:12.670
Thank you for joining us this morning

00:12.670 --> 00:15.236
and for making your way,

00:15.236 --> 00:19.870
way over into the West Hall.

00:19.870 --> 00:21.636
It's quite a hike

00:21.636 --> 00:25.270
and I'm really pleased that
you're here to join us.

00:25.270 --> 00:26.803
I'm really pleased also

00:26.803 --> 00:29.336
to have a really good panel this morning.

00:29.336 --> 00:32.203
On this particular
topic, this is a subject

00:32.203 --> 00:36.636
that I've been studying for over 20 years

00:36.636 --> 00:40.736
and have worked on various
projects, both in VR, AR,

00:40.736 --> 00:42.036
smart glasses, et cetera,

00:42.036 --> 00:44.870
over the last seven or eight years.

00:44.870 --> 00:49.436
And it's really captured my
imagination and my attention.

00:49.436 --> 00:51.403
I've spent a lot of time working on it.

00:53.170 --> 00:55.070
And this particular CES we did,

00:55.070 --> 00:58.170
we did actually our first
panel on, I think we,

00:58.170 --> 01:01.403
I think last year we did it
on the metaverse and glasses.

01:01.403 --> 01:04.436
But it was very clear
that in the last year,

01:04.436 --> 01:07.736
especially the term
spatial computing has come

01:07.736 --> 01:10.870
to the forefront, not only
because Apple pushed it

01:10.870 --> 01:12.470
with the Vision Pro,

01:12.470 --> 01:15.536
but a lot of the vendors
did begin to realize

01:15.536 --> 01:20.536
that spatial probably was
the good, a good term to use

01:20.670 --> 01:24.503
to identify the whole area

01:24.503 --> 01:28.336
of AR, XR, VR, MR, et cetera.

01:30.236 --> 01:31.303
My name is Tim Bajarin.

01:31.303 --> 01:33.936
I'm chairman of Creative Strategies.

01:33.936 --> 01:36.070
I've been in the industry for many years.

01:36.070 --> 01:39.470
This is actually my 50th CES.

01:39.470 --> 01:41.936
(audience applauding)

01:41.936 --> 01:46.203
Yeah, I actually probably need more

01:46.203 --> 01:50.370
of my head examined than applause,

01:50.370 --> 01:54.536
but I've been involved
with CES for a long time

01:54.536 --> 01:56.403
as an advisor in working with them

01:56.403 --> 01:57.570
and especially working

01:57.570 --> 02:02.570
on the conferences over the
last 20 or 30 years or so.

02:02.603 --> 02:04.270
This is a very important show.

02:04.270 --> 02:07.603
It's one that centers on
not only the technology

02:07.603 --> 02:11.836
that's here, but what
the industry's working on

02:11.836 --> 02:14.703
and where we are gonna go with it.

02:14.703 --> 02:19.136
So today, our particular
panel, and I brought together

02:19.136 --> 02:22.536
some really important
experts on the subject,

02:25.070 --> 02:30.070
but what we're gonna explore
today is what's going on now.

02:31.336 --> 02:33.670
And then it is kind of interesting.

02:33.670 --> 02:37.403
In fact, if I can go
backwards, the actual title

02:38.303 --> 02:41.403
was 2030, the Impact of XR Headsets, AR,

02:41.403 --> 02:43.703
and Smart Glasses on Special Computing.

02:43.703 --> 02:46.470
I did not put 2030 in my title,

02:47.636 --> 02:50.036
that how somehow got on there.

02:50.036 --> 02:54.536
I have learned as an
analyst who does predictions

02:54.536 --> 02:56.003
that predicting 10 years

02:56.003 --> 02:59.670
or even five years out is a foolish idea

02:59.670 --> 03:01.970
because it's amazing

03:01.970 --> 03:05.536
how much changes even in a year.

03:05.536 --> 03:08.570
And I'm just looking back
from our panel last year

03:08.570 --> 03:11.103
and how much different this panel is

03:11.103 --> 03:14.936
and what we're gonna talk about
today compared to last year.

03:14.936 --> 03:19.103
The bottom line is, I have
wonderful speakers today.

03:19.103 --> 03:23.103
Kelly Ingham, VP of wearable
Research Partnerships

03:23.103 --> 03:25.403
Reality Labs at Meta,

03:25.403 --> 03:28.170
Jason McGuigan, is it McGuigan?

03:28.170 --> 03:30.070
- [Jason] McGuigan.
- McGuigan.

03:30.070 --> 03:31.670
Okay, I never get that right. Sorry.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.903
Head of Virtual Reality at Lenovo.

03:33.903 --> 03:37.103
And Scott Myers, VP of Hardware at Snap.

03:37.103 --> 03:39.570
Now, all of these folks have been involved

03:39.570 --> 03:42.736
in this particular area
for quite some time.

03:44.070 --> 03:47.470
As a researcher, I'm also a user.

03:47.470 --> 03:51.636
I use my meta Wayfarer glasses
consistently, especially

03:51.636 --> 03:55.636
for taking pictures, recording
notes for the AI capabilities

03:55.636 --> 03:58.470
that have just been introduced
in the last year or so.

03:58.470 --> 04:00.903
And Kelly's gonna give us a
little bit of an update on some

04:00.903 --> 04:03.403
of the new software that's,
that's going on there.

04:07.503 --> 04:09.870
I was early in one of the first actually

04:09.870 --> 04:11.636
to see the Vision Pro

04:11.636 --> 04:13.770
and got to understand a little bit about

04:13.770 --> 04:17.036
what Apple was doing
from its earliest stages.

04:19.236 --> 04:20.070
If I have time,

04:20.070 --> 04:22.436
I'll comment on the Vision
Pro a little bit later.

04:23.270 --> 04:25.136
But where we are today

04:25.136 --> 04:29.603
is VR is going to be a
very interesting area

04:30.469 --> 04:33.836
still from the standpoint of the headsets

04:33.836 --> 04:38.603
and its impact, especially
in things like business

04:38.603 --> 04:41.936
and enterprises, et cetera.

04:41.936 --> 04:46.536
In that one context, I want to recommend

04:46.536 --> 04:49.036
that the session after mine

04:50.303 --> 04:54.436
is with my friend and
partner, Barton Goldenberg,

04:54.436 --> 04:58.936
who is gonna have three
speakers very specifically

04:58.936 --> 05:02.536
on the role of VR and XR

05:02.536 --> 05:04.236
and even headsets, excuse me,

05:04.236 --> 05:07.136
smart glasses in the
business enterprise world.

05:07.136 --> 05:08.669
And he's got amazing panels.

05:08.669 --> 05:10.569
He's got one of the leaders

05:10.569 --> 05:14.169
of Siemens who's done the
big projects for them.

05:14.169 --> 05:18.603
He's got a woman from Honda who is kind

05:18.603 --> 05:20.936
of gonna blow your mind
because they're doing all

05:20.936 --> 05:25.603
of their work and design
on the Apple Vision Pro.

05:27.669 --> 05:29.436
And Dr. Harvey Castro,

05:31.136 --> 05:35.636
sorry, who is a medical doctor

05:35.636 --> 05:39.703
who's been on the forefront
of using AR and VR

05:39.703 --> 05:41.603
in everything from surgery.

05:41.603 --> 05:45.103
And he was 20 years as
an emergency doctor.

05:45.103 --> 05:47.169
So I encourage you to stay for that.

05:47.169 --> 05:49.736
Now Kelly, I'm gonna start with you

05:51.103 --> 05:54.903
because number one, right now,

05:54.903 --> 05:59.869
when you look at VR headset,
Quest is the King of the Hill.

05:59.869 --> 06:04.336
Numbers-wise, you are
the number one headset.

06:04.336 --> 06:08.136
So let's start just
with the Quest as it is

06:08.136 --> 06:09.736
and its success.

06:09.736 --> 06:11.703
And then I'm gonna go to Jason

06:11.703 --> 06:14.936
and have you talk a
little bit about your VR.

06:14.936 --> 06:17.703
So I'm gonna start out
with the VR side, okay?

06:17.703 --> 06:18.869
- Sure, great.

06:18.869 --> 06:21.103
Thanks Tim. I'm really excited to be here.

06:21.103 --> 06:23.336
I hope everybody's awake this morning.

06:23.336 --> 06:25.769
You know, we're opening the show here.

06:25.769 --> 06:28.803
Talk a little bit about Quest.
It's been an amazing device.

06:28.803 --> 06:31.136
We've launched our Quest 3
with digital pass through.

06:31.136 --> 06:35.036
I hope everyone has had a
chance to play with that device

06:35.036 --> 06:36.403
and experience the pass through.

06:36.403 --> 06:39.069
We had the Quest 3S that
we also launched this year.

06:39.069 --> 06:41.403
Some of the things that we're
working on is continuing

06:41.403 --> 06:43.236
to drive into our pass through

06:43.236 --> 06:45.169
and improving that technology.

06:45.169 --> 06:47.336
We're also looking to make things lighter

06:47.336 --> 06:49.436
and with a better form factor.

06:49.436 --> 06:52.536
We want people to spend more
time in their Quest devices.

06:52.536 --> 06:56.103
I recently met a woman who is
a population one power user

06:56.103 --> 06:58.869
and she has a battery pack
that she straps to her head so

06:58.869 --> 07:01.469
that she can play for five
hours at a time, right?

07:01.469 --> 07:03.769
So we need to get to a point where people

07:03.769 --> 07:05.103
that wanna play and be in device

07:05.103 --> 07:06.603
for five hours at a time don't have

07:06.603 --> 07:08.136
to add an extra battery pack.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.436
And so we are working on those areas.

07:10.436 --> 07:12.303
And so form factor is gonna be a big space

07:12.303 --> 07:14.603
that you're gonna see
more advancements from us

07:14.603 --> 07:16.403
in the VR headsets.

07:16.403 --> 07:18.369
We're also looking at
bringing more users to play

07:18.369 --> 07:20.069
with the Quest 3S and the price point.

07:20.069 --> 07:21.736
We brought a lot of younger audience

07:21.736 --> 07:24.436
and younger gamers, they're
really interested in that device

07:24.436 --> 07:27.769
and they're consuming a lot
of our freemium content.

07:27.769 --> 07:31.169
Another area is we're focusing
in the content space on 3D.

07:31.169 --> 07:32.503
I think many of you saw

07:32.503 --> 07:34.503
that we have a partnership
with James Cameron.

07:34.503 --> 07:37.403
He's one of the most
innovative storytellers in 3D.

07:37.403 --> 07:40.303
And we're gonna be bringing a
lot more 3D content to Quest,

07:40.303 --> 07:41.869
which I'm really excited about.

07:41.869 --> 07:43.669
We're also seeing new use cases.

07:43.669 --> 07:46.969
People love to multitask
with their Quest devices.

07:46.969 --> 07:48.403
There is a YouTube series now

07:48.403 --> 07:50.569
where people are putting on
their Quest and then going

07:50.569 --> 07:53.436
and vacuuming, doing the dishes, right,

07:53.436 --> 07:55.736
and doing other types of
interactions around the house.

07:55.736 --> 07:57.036
And so what this is showing is

07:57.036 --> 08:00.969
that people really enjoy having
a virtual screen with them

08:00.969 --> 08:02.136
to do different activities

08:02.136 --> 08:04.603
and they're leveraging the
digital pass through to do that.

08:04.603 --> 08:07.469
And so you're gonna see
us leaning into more areas

08:07.469 --> 08:09.036
where people can multitask

08:09.036 --> 08:12.269
and enjoy the great content
they're used to live,

08:12.269 --> 08:16.369
you know, NBA games and
gaming content as well

08:16.369 --> 08:18.069
as the additional 3D content.

08:18.069 --> 08:18.936
So those are some of the big

08:18.936 --> 08:22.136
things that we're gonna be
working on, on the Quest line.

08:22.136 --> 08:25.869
- Jason, I've known Lenovo's work,

08:25.869 --> 08:29.469
especially in the enterprise,
which has been kind

08:29.469 --> 08:32.669
of your lead category that you focused on,

08:32.669 --> 08:35.269
especially over the
last four or five years.

08:35.269 --> 08:37.236
Update us on where Lenovo is on this,

08:37.236 --> 08:38.369
'cause I know you're making a little bit

08:38.369 --> 08:39.436
of a transition also too,

08:39.436 --> 08:42.903
including something we'll
talk about in a few minutes,

08:42.903 --> 08:46.903
smart glasses, but what's your experience

08:46.903 --> 08:51.303
so far in using XR headsets
or VR headsets in enterprise

08:51.303 --> 08:53.803
and where do you see that going?

08:53.803 --> 08:56.036
- Yeah, that's a great
question. Thanks, Tim.

08:56.036 --> 08:59.536
So at Lenovo we do focus very
heavily on the enterprise

08:59.536 --> 09:02.203
space within XR, you know,

09:02.203 --> 09:03.569
but you know, I think as you mentioned,

09:03.569 --> 09:06.003
there's a great deal of interest

09:06.003 --> 09:07.736
of how we're actually transitioning

09:07.736 --> 09:09.669
from what the consumer market's doing

09:09.669 --> 09:13.103
to what the enterprise space
is actually doing at Lenovo.

09:13.103 --> 09:14.869
When we're, you know, figuring out

09:15.869 --> 09:20.303
our next agenda, our next
path, it's very much led by

09:20.303 --> 09:21.769
how people actually utilize the device

09:21.769 --> 09:23.369
sometimes in the consumer space.

09:23.369 --> 09:27.369
Now Kelly mentioned people
multitasking in the device.

09:27.369 --> 09:29.536
When you look at it from
a enterprise perspective,

09:29.536 --> 09:32.569
we don't necessarily want a
worker going into the office

09:32.569 --> 09:36.236
and then doing their work
and then jumping on Netflix

09:36.236 --> 09:38.036
or going into a gaming platform, right?

09:38.036 --> 09:41.036
So there is a bit of a
difference in the market,

09:41.036 --> 09:42.236
but it does come down to

09:42.236 --> 09:44.036
how we keep people in devices longer.

09:44.036 --> 09:46.669
And that for us goes
down to device utility.

09:46.669 --> 09:49.636
So how often people will be
able to stay in the device

09:49.636 --> 09:51.336
and do work related tasks

09:51.336 --> 09:53.403
and jump to other pieces
of spatial content

09:53.403 --> 09:56.169
that also have work
related tasks associated.

09:56.169 --> 09:58.669
But when we really look
at that overall spectrum,

09:58.669 --> 10:00.969
where we focus our energy both previously

10:00.969 --> 10:03.636
and now is around the solution approach.

10:03.636 --> 10:05.769
It's not necessarily
just about the hardware.

10:05.769 --> 10:08.669
And for us, we've focused on
hardware, we have great pieces

10:08.669 --> 10:10.636
of hardware we've
developed, we have partners

10:10.636 --> 10:12.236
that work in the hardware space,

10:12.236 --> 10:13.436
but at the end of the day,

10:13.436 --> 10:15.569
it's what people actually can do with it.

10:15.569 --> 10:18.269
And when a business makes a
decision to bring devices,

10:18.269 --> 10:21.369
XR devices into their
space, they are doing it

10:21.369 --> 10:23.569
with a business use case.

10:23.569 --> 10:25.636
They're doing it for a purpose of ROI,

10:25.636 --> 10:27.702
not to give somebody
something entertaining to use,

10:27.702 --> 10:30.136
but to actually make a
difference for their platform,

10:30.136 --> 10:31.536
for their organization.

10:31.536 --> 10:33.336
So when they start looking
at it from that perspective,

10:33.336 --> 10:34.602
they say, all right, well,

10:34.602 --> 10:36.002
I'm gonna bring this into my office

10:36.002 --> 10:39.402
and I'm gonna bring this into
my whole entire organization.

10:39.402 --> 10:42.236
How do I make this worthwhile
for us to spend the money

10:42.236 --> 10:44.402
to do the development
and to bring this up?

10:44.402 --> 10:46.302
So when we look at it
from that perspective,

10:46.302 --> 10:47.802
the last thing they're
usually talking about is

10:47.802 --> 10:50.169
what are the specs on the device?

10:50.169 --> 10:51.936
They're talking about how
they're actually gonna make a

10:51.936 --> 10:53.102
difference in their organization.

10:53.102 --> 10:55.336
And that's, I think our area

10:55.336 --> 10:57.136
that we really focus on is when we talk

10:57.136 --> 10:59.069
to a customer about it, when
we talk to an organization,

10:59.069 --> 11:00.369
we talk to the world about it,

11:00.369 --> 11:02.836
we're focusing on the actual solution

11:02.836 --> 11:05.202
and not just the product.

11:05.202 --> 11:08.736
- Kelly, while we're on the whole role

11:08.736 --> 11:12.936
of XR headsets in general, you obviously

11:12.936 --> 11:15.636
and the Quest have had
great success in gaming

11:15.636 --> 11:17.769
and the consumer, but I do know

11:17.769 --> 11:19.602
that it's being used in some enterprise

11:19.602 --> 11:20.936
applications as well.

11:20.936 --> 11:24.369
Can you share about some
of the enterprise functions

11:24.369 --> 11:28.736
or areas that it's gotten
some success as well?

11:28.736 --> 11:30.036
- Sure, Tim.

11:30.036 --> 11:32.969
I think some of the early
successes were in training.

11:32.969 --> 11:35.302
You know, one of the big use cases,

11:35.302 --> 11:36.669
Walmart actually brought this on

11:36.669 --> 11:38.702
and actually put all of their shelves

11:38.702 --> 11:42.836
and actually mocked up like
basically a Black Friday sale

11:42.836 --> 11:45.169
in the Quest headset so
that their store associates

11:45.169 --> 11:46.536
could know how to deal with the influx

11:46.536 --> 11:48.569
of all the customers, all of the demands,

11:48.569 --> 11:50.636
yelling, screaming, and
trying to grab devices.

11:50.636 --> 11:51.836
And actually they were one

11:51.836 --> 11:54.402
of the first early use cases
in using these headsets

11:54.402 --> 11:56.336
to really train people
and do it much faster

11:56.336 --> 11:58.536
and much more efficiently
using the headsets.

11:58.536 --> 12:02.036
And so we see a lot of different
applications for training

12:02.036 --> 12:04.636
and kind of simulation exercises.

12:04.636 --> 12:06.836
Another area that's
been really interesting

12:06.836 --> 12:09.369
is on the medical field, surgical VR

12:09.369 --> 12:10.836
has been a great advancement

12:10.836 --> 12:12.236
where they're actually
using these headsets

12:12.236 --> 12:15.702
to actually show surgery
in different practices

12:15.702 --> 12:17.236
and be able to get the surgeons

12:17.236 --> 12:19.536
and the associates to actually learn how

12:19.536 --> 12:23.236
to actually advance very complex
techniques without having

12:23.236 --> 12:26.002
to use cadavers, which are
actually quite expensive.

12:26.002 --> 12:27.236
And so that's been another, you know,

12:27.236 --> 12:29.302
I think enterprise application.

12:29.302 --> 12:30.736
Education is obviously an area

12:30.736 --> 12:32.436
that they've been leaning into quite a bit

12:32.436 --> 12:33.936
with the VR headsets.

12:33.936 --> 12:35.669
And then we're partnering with companies

12:35.669 --> 12:38.136
to actually enable us to go
even broader into enterprise

12:38.136 --> 12:40.069
that can actually bring
those enterprise solutions

12:40.069 --> 12:43.136
and tool sets like Lenovo to go

12:43.136 --> 12:44.636
and really customize those

12:44.636 --> 12:46.336
for those enterprise applications.

12:46.336 --> 12:49.002
We're very much focused on
the consumer business, right?

12:49.002 --> 12:50.736
And driving these headsets into consumer.

12:50.736 --> 12:52.669
And so we've been really excited about

12:52.669 --> 12:55.336
what our developers have been
able to do with the headsets

12:55.336 --> 12:57.369
and actually using it for applications

12:57.369 --> 12:58.636
and content that I think we couldn't even

12:58.636 --> 13:00.502
think about on our own.

13:01.669 --> 13:03.769
- Alright, we may come back

13:03.769 --> 13:06.669
to the XR headsets in a minute,

13:06.669 --> 13:10.869
but I wanna shift a little
bit over to the smart glasses.

13:10.869 --> 13:15.002
This is an area that I've been looking at

13:15.002 --> 13:16.169
for quite a while

13:17.469 --> 13:22.369
besides this particular, the
Wayfarers I was in early-

13:25.069 --> 13:26.336
- His Wayfarers are talking to him, now.

13:26.336 --> 13:27.502
I can hear his music.

13:28.469 --> 13:29.902
Just say, "Hey Meta, stop."

13:35.036 --> 13:37.869
This shows connectivity
on the glasses right now.

13:37.869 --> 13:40.136
- I am a Jimmy Buffet fan

13:40.136 --> 13:43.269
and how, I can't tell
you how that happened.

13:43.269 --> 13:44.402
Anyway, anyway,

13:47.669 --> 13:51.136
anyway, bottom line is smart glasses.

13:52.202 --> 13:55.569
Besides this, I used one called the X Reel

13:55.569 --> 13:58.602
and it was one of the
first ones that came out

13:58.602 --> 14:01.336
and I literally used it on
airplanes watching, you know,

14:01.336 --> 14:03.502
my movies on that.

14:05.769 --> 14:09.936
But Smart Glasses actually
debuted pretty early with Snap

14:09.936 --> 14:13.102
and Scott, if remind me, I believe it was,

14:13.102 --> 14:15.636
was it 2015 or 2019?

14:15.636 --> 14:16.869
- We launched in 2016.

14:16.869 --> 14:18.202
- 2016!
- Camera only. Smart Glasses.

14:18.202 --> 14:21.602
- So you've been in this
smart glasses for a while.

14:21.602 --> 14:24.936
Tell us a little bit about
the thinking about, you know,

14:24.936 --> 14:27.802
getting into that market,
but more importantly

14:27.802 --> 14:29.402
where you are today.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.136
- Oh yeah, we've been
building smart glasses

14:31.136 --> 14:33.236
for a really long time
and while they're fun

14:33.236 --> 14:34.902
and we think there's
like a near term market.

14:34.902 --> 14:36.769
We're actually focused on the long term.

14:36.769 --> 14:37.869
- Scott put you-

14:37.869 --> 14:39.836
- If you ask people what they really want,

14:39.836 --> 14:41.436
what they'll describe
to you in the long term

14:41.436 --> 14:43.702
is see-through immersive AR glasses

14:43.702 --> 14:46.402
and we've actually built them
with our spectacles product,

14:46.402 --> 14:47.669
which is available today.

14:49.202 --> 14:53.869
So, you know, we think that they're...

14:55.102 --> 14:58.469
Big, a lot of potential here
as we're building use cases

14:58.469 --> 15:01.769
and SNAP is already a scaled
augmented reality player.

15:01.769 --> 15:03.869
I think that's really
important for people to know.

15:03.869 --> 15:05.702
We have 300 million people using

15:05.702 --> 15:07.402
augmented reality every day.

15:07.402 --> 15:11.036
375,000 developers have
built 4 million lenses

15:11.036 --> 15:12.836
and the use case is really simple,

15:12.836 --> 15:14.402
it's just about having fun

15:14.402 --> 15:16.402
and that's what we
designed spectacles to do,

15:16.402 --> 15:18.102
both inside and outdoors.

15:19.102 --> 15:23.402
We've made spectacles work
indoors, it's like really hard

15:23.402 --> 15:26.436
to make them work that way when we have

15:26.436 --> 15:31.436
like see-through immersive
AR and indoor capability.

15:31.802 --> 15:34.002
But making them work
outdoors is far harder

15:34.002 --> 15:35.802
and we've done that and
you can do it today.

15:35.802 --> 15:39.369
It transitions from clear to
tinted in the blink of an eye

15:39.369 --> 15:42.535
and it's super fun and we
think that's the future

15:42.535 --> 15:43.602
for the long term.

15:43.602 --> 15:44.502
- Okay.

15:44.502 --> 15:48.069
Now Kelly, you most
recently made quite a bit

15:48.069 --> 15:50.435
of splash at your developer's conference

15:50.435 --> 15:52.202
with the introduction of the Orion.

15:53.635 --> 15:54.835
Tell, first of all,

15:54.835 --> 15:57.802
some people may not have
seen that announcement,

15:57.802 --> 15:59.869
but tell us a little
bit about what Orion is

15:59.869 --> 16:04.469
and kind of the timing,
as I understand it.

16:04.469 --> 16:07.369
- Sure, Tim. So Orion is our AR glasses.

16:07.369 --> 16:09.035
These are fully immersive glasses

16:09.035 --> 16:12.035
that we showed at our
Connect developer conference.

16:12.035 --> 16:14.035
This is really showing
a vision of the future.

16:14.035 --> 16:16.902
They're not commercial glasses today.

16:16.902 --> 16:18.835
And these glasses really
bring together all

16:18.835 --> 16:20.935
of the technology and research
that we've been working on

16:20.935 --> 16:24.469
for the past 10 years in research labs.

16:24.469 --> 16:27.102
I've been a part of that for
about seven and a half years.

16:27.102 --> 16:29.635
And the glasses are really
focused on a form factor,

16:29.635 --> 16:31.502
highly immersive experience.

16:31.502 --> 16:33.702
We've been very open that
we're looking at displays,

16:33.702 --> 16:36.535
we're using silicon carbide in
these glasses for wide field

16:36.535 --> 16:39.002
of view and high resolution.

16:39.002 --> 16:41.302
We're also brought in eye tracking

16:41.302 --> 16:42.935
and some of our new eye
tracking technologies.

16:42.935 --> 16:47.135
We have custom silicon to
do both compute as well

16:47.135 --> 16:48.702
as enable battery life.

16:48.702 --> 16:51.502
We have our Meta AI assistant
on the glasses as well.

16:51.502 --> 16:54.235
It does come with a separate compute puck.

16:54.235 --> 16:56.802
We're also integrated our band technology.

16:56.802 --> 17:01.169
So for many of you we have our EMG band,

17:01.169 --> 17:03.269
which allows us to
really understand inputs

17:03.269 --> 17:05.702
and interaction devices in a seamless way.

17:05.702 --> 17:08.835
And so the combination of
those experiences of being able

17:08.835 --> 17:11.902
to have input via your
voice, via your eyes

17:11.902 --> 17:13.135
and via the band.

17:13.135 --> 17:15.269
And then this highly immersive experience

17:15.269 --> 17:17.969
where you can actually
put up three screens

17:17.969 --> 17:19.402
where you can actually scroll your feed,

17:19.402 --> 17:22.302
your Instagram feed, you can
actually do a voice conference

17:22.302 --> 17:26.369
at the same time or you can
actually see photos or pictures

17:26.369 --> 17:29.035
or maybe you're working, you
know, something with your,

17:29.035 --> 17:30.569
something with Lenovo at the same time.

17:30.569 --> 17:33.269
But you can do all of
those on this wide screen

17:33.269 --> 17:35.535
and then be able to navigate the room

17:35.535 --> 17:36.435
that we have in the demo.

17:36.435 --> 17:38.969
And this is really showing
what we see the promise

17:38.969 --> 17:41.535
of spatial computing and
the promise of glasses

17:41.535 --> 17:44.169
because this is in a glasses form factor.

17:44.169 --> 17:46.435
Where we're going with
this is we do have plans

17:46.435 --> 17:48.169
to commercialize this device.

17:48.169 --> 17:51.235
So gonna be working over that
on the next couple of years

17:51.235 --> 17:53.135
for fully immersive AR displays.

17:53.135 --> 17:55.702
We have a lot of work going on
in research right now looking

17:55.702 --> 17:57.535
at displays from small field of view up

17:57.535 --> 17:58.702
to large field of view.

17:58.702 --> 17:59.969
And I think you're gonna see some of

17:59.969 --> 18:02.069
that technology come
forward in our smart glasses

18:02.069 --> 18:04.035
and our overall glasses roadmap.

18:04.935 --> 18:06.369
- And timing-wise,

18:06.369 --> 18:08.869
last I heard it was about
a three year timing, like,

18:08.869 --> 18:11.269
but is that still kind of where we are?

18:12.135 --> 18:13.669
- That is still where we are.

18:13.669 --> 18:15.202
I'm sure we are trying

18:15.202 --> 18:17.035
to accelerate as much as possible.

18:17.035 --> 18:18.235
- Okay, good.

18:18.235 --> 18:23.235
Now Jason, when we talk
about XR headsets in general,

18:24.202 --> 18:28.002
and even smart glasses,
Google made an announcement

18:28.002 --> 18:32.435
around what's called Android,
is it Android X, I believe.

18:32.435 --> 18:34.202
- Android XR.
- XR, XR.

18:35.602 --> 18:37.669
I know you guys have partnered
with Google on various.

18:37.669 --> 18:40.169
And can you tell our audience
a little bit about what XR is

18:40.169 --> 18:42.602
and what do you think the value

18:42.602 --> 18:46.935
of adding another operating
system to the XR scheme?

18:46.935 --> 18:48.835
- Sure, yeah, no, it's a, it's a great

18:48.835 --> 18:51.935
and important question
for the entire ecosystem.

18:51.935 --> 18:53.635
XR is kind of the umbrella term

18:53.635 --> 18:55.069
for everything we're working on.

18:55.069 --> 18:57.435
So everything from a wearable device,

18:57.435 --> 19:00.035
and you could even start to
include the wearable devices

19:00.035 --> 19:01.202
like the Meta RayBan glasses

19:01.202 --> 19:03.602
to fall starting into that realm.

19:03.602 --> 19:05.702
I mean, you're not
quite extending reality,

19:05.702 --> 19:08.702
you're not putting an
overview on anything just yet,

19:08.702 --> 19:10.135
but we see where that's going.

19:10.135 --> 19:12.835
Obviously these devices
here that, you know,

19:12.835 --> 19:15.402
they're both wearing,
are that training wheels

19:15.402 --> 19:16.369
to where we want to get to,

19:16.369 --> 19:19.269
where we actually have that
pass through on at all times

19:19.269 --> 19:21.869
or that visual overlay at all times.

19:21.869 --> 19:23.602
But that umbrella term XR

19:23.602 --> 19:24.535
or spatial compute,

19:24.535 --> 19:26.769
I think we're all in
this room familiar with.

19:28.169 --> 19:29.969
What Google announced, I
think was very important

19:29.969 --> 19:32.169
for the overall ecosystem
because they're a major player

19:32.169 --> 19:33.835
and they have a platform.

19:33.835 --> 19:36.735
Now, platforms are extremely
important to who, you know,

19:36.735 --> 19:38.535
to the development community primarily

19:38.535 --> 19:40.569
as well as the customers.

19:40.569 --> 19:42.735
And when a developer looks
at where they're going

19:42.735 --> 19:44.935
to actually create their
product for, they want to go

19:44.935 --> 19:47.169
to a platform that has
customers already on it,

19:47.169 --> 19:48.335
they're small companies,

19:48.335 --> 19:50.402
they're investing a lot
of their energy into it.

19:50.402 --> 19:51.435
Of course they wanna make sure

19:51.435 --> 19:53.935
that when they invest into it,
that it goes onto a platform

19:53.935 --> 19:55.769
that they have an ease of distribution.

19:55.769 --> 19:59.302
So Google as a player in the
space that has the play store

19:59.302 --> 20:03.402
and has the ability to
massively distribute content to

20:03.402 --> 20:06.835
third parties and to vendors
that will allow them to

20:06.835 --> 20:08.869
essentially accelerate
that portion of the market

20:08.869 --> 20:09.902
and step into a role

20:09.902 --> 20:13.302
that only meta previously
has had purview into.

20:13.302 --> 20:14.902
So I think it does create a little bit of

20:14.902 --> 20:16.169
that competition aspect.

20:16.169 --> 20:18.235
It does allow for more devices,

20:18.235 --> 20:19.835
more players to come to market.

20:19.835 --> 20:22.869
And the expectation is, is
that that will allow other OEMs

20:22.869 --> 20:25.569
to develop devices on their platform.

20:25.569 --> 20:28.269
Or as meta announced with Lenovo

20:28.269 --> 20:30.902
and some other third
parties, the Horizon platform

20:30.902 --> 20:33.635
to be able to develop a open ecosystem

20:33.635 --> 20:37.202
to allow multiple OEMs to
create devices for those,

20:37.202 --> 20:38.969
you know, more umbrella platforms.

20:38.969 --> 20:41.435
So that way when a
developer comes in they say,

20:41.435 --> 20:43.602
do I wanna develop for
the Meta Horizons platform

20:43.602 --> 20:45.235
and go towards these devices

20:45.235 --> 20:47.635
or do I want to develop for
the Android XR platform,

20:47.635 --> 20:49.435
develop for these devices?

20:49.435 --> 20:50.702
Now hopefully what we get to,

20:50.702 --> 20:52.902
and we've spoken about this,
the three of us earlier

20:52.902 --> 20:55.835
spoke about this, is we want
to get to a world where,

20:55.835 --> 20:58.535
of course it doesn't matter
where you're developing for

20:58.535 --> 21:00.535
that your content can work within it.

21:00.535 --> 21:02.402
Similar to how the web is today.

21:02.402 --> 21:03.869
You know, we developed
something that ends up

21:03.869 --> 21:05.002
being on a web browser.

21:05.002 --> 21:07.835
It doesn't matter if you look
at it on your phone on a Mac,

21:07.835 --> 21:10.035
on a pc, wherever you are,

21:10.035 --> 21:12.935
you still get a reflection
of that content.

21:12.935 --> 21:17.235
It's, you know, it's of course
not in the immersive space,

21:17.235 --> 21:19.002
A little bit more easy to tailor,

21:19.002 --> 21:21.068
but thanks to the powers of generative AI,

21:21.068 --> 21:23.568
we're gonna see a lot of
that uptick where we're going

21:23.568 --> 21:26.068
to create once and it's going
to be able to be folded over

21:26.068 --> 21:27.402
to any platform.

21:27.402 --> 21:29.802
And we're gonna see that in
the very, very near future

21:29.802 --> 21:33.735
where the vision of OpenXR
will start to come to fruition.

21:33.735 --> 21:36.435
We're not gonna be stuck in
this world where we develop once

21:36.435 --> 21:39.302
and then we have to
spend eons developing for

21:39.302 --> 21:43.235
another headset that just came
out and now changes the game.

21:43.235 --> 21:45.535
We're getting to that near-term point

21:45.535 --> 21:48.535
where we are going to see XR become

21:48.535 --> 21:50.568
a little bit more unified.

21:50.568 --> 21:52.502
And I think that announcement really

21:52.502 --> 21:54.802
does show that that's where we're going.

21:54.802 --> 21:58.068
- So what you're announcing is Nirvana XR.

21:59.035 --> 22:02.635
- I mean the hope is of course that again,

22:02.635 --> 22:05.035
a developer with, you know,

22:05.035 --> 22:06.935
a small team can create something

22:06.935 --> 22:10.435
and it can go on to wherever
the customer lands, right?

22:10.435 --> 22:12.668
And if the customer says,
I've got these devices,

22:12.668 --> 22:15.235
I want this piece of software
to work on that, great.

22:15.235 --> 22:16.802
That's where it goes.

22:16.802 --> 22:19.168
When Adobe, for example, sells a piece

22:19.168 --> 22:22.135
of software, they don't tell
you what computer to buy to run

22:22.135 --> 22:23.235
that piece of software.

22:23.235 --> 22:24.502
That is up to the end customer.

22:24.502 --> 22:27.835
So I think that's where the
world wants, you know, XR to be,

22:27.835 --> 22:29.268
is into a platform space

22:29.268 --> 22:30.802
where a developer can create something

22:30.802 --> 22:33.535
and it can be consumed
on whichever XR device

22:33.535 --> 22:35.035
that person ends up having.

22:35.035 --> 22:39.168
And the XR device will work
within its own constraints

22:39.168 --> 22:42.835
to create the experience related
to that piece of content.

22:42.835 --> 22:45.535
So if it's just, you
know, an AI-powered glass,

22:45.535 --> 22:47.568
maybe it's a truncated experience.

22:47.568 --> 22:49.502
If it has a visual overlay

22:49.502 --> 22:52.435
and it's more of an AR
glass, it has one experience

22:52.435 --> 22:54.168
or a more advanced experience

22:54.168 --> 22:55.935
and then if you want
something fully immersive,

22:55.935 --> 22:57.235
it could be more of a mixed reality

22:57.235 --> 22:59.035
or virtual reality device.

22:59.035 --> 23:01.202
- Scott, I want you to weigh
in on this a little bit

23:01.202 --> 23:03.335
because you guys have
spent quite a bit of time

23:03.335 --> 23:06.835
and a lot of energy developing
your own operating system,

23:06.835 --> 23:08.402
which has been very successful.

23:12.835 --> 23:14.868
What Jason just mentioned
is a really important thing

23:14.868 --> 23:17.068
in the context of getting
software developers

23:17.068 --> 23:21.035
and you gave us a number
on developers that you have

23:21.035 --> 23:25.735
for your operating system now.

23:25.735 --> 23:28.502
Tell us, give us a little more of a sense

23:28.502 --> 23:32.735
of your thinking about that
growing your operating system

23:32.735 --> 23:34.202
and the developer network

23:34.202 --> 23:38.035
and how is that going to be able to

23:39.068 --> 23:41.335
continue to grow in that context?

23:41.335 --> 23:43.835
- Sure, so we built SNAP OS

23:43.835 --> 23:45.602
because we had to, there's really nothing

23:45.602 --> 23:46.702
else in the world like it.

23:46.702 --> 23:48.235
And there's a couple reasons why.

23:48.235 --> 23:50.502
We have Snap's spatial engine,

23:50.502 --> 23:53.235
which not only uses six degree VIO

23:53.235 --> 23:55.402
to put content in the
world and keep it there

23:55.402 --> 23:56.635
as you move around,

23:56.635 --> 23:57.968
it's actually powerful enough

23:57.968 --> 23:59.935
to augment dynamic moving objects

23:59.935 --> 24:01.802
like a basketball in the scene.

24:01.802 --> 24:04.835
This required intense
focus on both the camera

24:04.835 --> 24:07.402
and the rendering pipeline
to drive down the latency

24:07.402 --> 24:08.835
to the point where that's possible.

24:08.835 --> 24:09.702
And it's amazing.

24:10.735 --> 24:13.735
We also have an operating
system built on hands and voice.

24:13.735 --> 24:17.002
You have everything you need
to interact with spectacles,

24:17.002 --> 24:18.735
you don't need any controllers.

24:18.735 --> 24:22.235
And making hand tracking
work on large glasses

24:22.235 --> 24:24.568
or large goggles is pretty hard,

24:25.435 --> 24:27.502
but making it work on
glasses is far harder.

24:27.502 --> 24:29.835
Not only does it need to
be as accurate, it needs

24:29.835 --> 24:32.002
to be way more power efficient.

24:32.002 --> 24:34.735
One of the amazing things
about spectacles is

24:34.735 --> 24:36.002
that it's connected.

24:36.002 --> 24:37.735
So if we're all in the same room

24:37.735 --> 24:41.235
and we have AR content out in
front of us, we can interact

24:41.235 --> 24:43.135
with it together as if it was real.

24:43.135 --> 24:46.335
And that's built deep
into the operating system

24:46.335 --> 24:47.768
that connected nature.

24:47.768 --> 24:50.535
And finally, spectacles
is completely standalone.

24:50.535 --> 24:53.368
You don't need a puck, it's
not tethered to a phone,

24:53.368 --> 24:55.535
it's all just crammed into the device

24:55.535 --> 24:57.568
and that creates some
intense thermal challenges.

24:57.568 --> 25:00.002
And so we have a unique dual system

25:00.002 --> 25:04.068
on chip architecture using
Qualcomm Snapdragon processors

25:04.068 --> 25:05.635
where just like your brain has two halves,

25:05.635 --> 25:07.968
we separate out the processing

25:07.968 --> 25:10.835
and it allows us to spread
the heat around much better.

25:10.835 --> 25:12.435
And we think it's really unique

25:12.435 --> 25:15.235
and it actually enables the
kind of experiences we want

25:15.235 --> 25:17.602
to build because that's
where we think the value is,

25:17.602 --> 25:19.402
is having fun with people.

25:20.235 --> 25:23.335
- Now I've been studying
this area for quite a while

25:23.335 --> 25:26.668
and one of the things that has been a,

25:26.668 --> 25:28.435
what I would call a roadblock

25:28.435 --> 25:31.768
and I want you guys to
discuss, to weigh in on this,

25:32.968 --> 25:36.235
is really the lenses and the
ability to take the content

25:36.235 --> 25:37.502
and display it.

25:38.835 --> 25:43.335
I've seen a couple, I actually,
I saw three yesterday where,

25:43.335 --> 25:48.335
you know, the information
is in front of you

25:48.402 --> 25:50.668
is in the glass lenses, I should say.

25:53.168 --> 25:54.635
In the Lenovo, you know,

25:54.635 --> 25:57.502
I've been involved with
Lenovo for decades.

25:57.502 --> 26:01.168
We, early on, there were
these really key discussions

26:01.168 --> 26:04.668
of the role of next generation lenses

26:04.668 --> 26:07.635
that were gonna be
necessary to deliver the AR.

26:07.635 --> 26:10.435
Can you tell us about not only what kind

26:10.435 --> 26:12.535
of lenses you think are
gonna have to be there,

26:12.535 --> 26:15.102
including in the Orion for example,

26:15.102 --> 26:17.535
and what are the roadblocks to get there?

26:17.535 --> 26:21.268
Are are we seeing breakthroughs, you know,

26:21.268 --> 26:24.068
with wave guides and you know,
getting to that point now

26:24.068 --> 26:26.702
or where are we at this point?

26:26.702 --> 26:28.468
Because what I'm trying to figure out,

26:28.468 --> 26:31.768
and I gotta tell you, I've tested now,

26:31.768 --> 26:33.768
I don't know how many smart glasses

26:33.768 --> 26:37.035
and headsets, pretty much
every one you can imagine

26:37.035 --> 26:38.935
that are commercial.

26:38.935 --> 26:42.735
And I agree with you

26:42.735 --> 26:45.968
that I eventually want
the Nirvana experience.

26:45.968 --> 26:48.135
I'd like to be able to take
whatever that content is

26:48.135 --> 26:50.968
and use that on any device.

26:50.968 --> 26:53.368
Getting there is not that easy.

26:53.368 --> 26:55.868
I think that this, we as an industry

26:55.868 --> 26:59.335
are gonna have a technical
challenge to get to that point.

26:59.335 --> 27:00.468
And I don't know when we,

27:00.468 --> 27:03.701
when and if we ever
get to that Nirvana XR,

27:03.701 --> 27:06.668
but that should be our goal, right?

27:07.635 --> 27:09.935
- Yeah, so I think we'll get there,

27:09.935 --> 27:12.301
but I think the challenge
obviously is, you know,

27:12.301 --> 27:13.735
as you mentioned the
technological barriers,

27:13.735 --> 27:16.135
but it comes down to
what Scott was mentioning

27:16.135 --> 27:19.468
around like things like heat
or then of course the cost.

27:19.468 --> 27:21.368
And you can make these devices today,

27:21.368 --> 27:25.468
but they're ridiculously
expensive to create.

27:25.468 --> 27:28.435
If you're gonna make a
one-off as a prototype, great,

27:28.435 --> 27:30.835
you can get a lot of
this experience in there,

27:30.835 --> 27:32.768
but how do we get down
to a commercializable,

27:32.768 --> 27:33.835
scalable fashion?

27:33.835 --> 27:37.101
And then how do we make it
wearable for all day with,

27:37.101 --> 27:40.435
you know, battery life
with, like heat dispersion,

27:40.435 --> 27:42.335
all of the challenges associated with it.

27:42.335 --> 27:44.935
Now the lenses are a part of the equation

27:44.935 --> 27:47.235
and the optics are absolutely part of it.

27:47.235 --> 27:49.735
I mean, but you can get
amazingly crisp visuals

27:49.735 --> 27:53.168
in a small area or you
can get it more spread out

27:53.168 --> 27:54.435
and less crisp.

27:54.435 --> 27:57.835
Getting the two together, wide FOV,

27:57.835 --> 27:59.101
lower power consumption,

27:59.101 --> 28:02.835
all those aspects really takes
a lot of engineering feats.

28:02.835 --> 28:05.001
But I think where the, you know, nirvana

28:05.001 --> 28:07.968
of all this is going is that
if you do have that need

28:07.968 --> 28:11.468
to get into that more
fully immersive experience,

28:11.468 --> 28:12.835
you go to a different device

28:12.835 --> 28:14.601
and I think we'll see an
ecosystem of device is not

28:14.601 --> 28:16.301
that one catchall device

28:16.301 --> 28:17.635
that kind of solves for everything.

28:17.635 --> 28:18.468
- Scott?

28:18.468 --> 28:21.701
- Yeah, so Snap, we have our
own custom optical engine.

28:21.701 --> 28:24.701
So it not only has an
incredibly tiny liquid crystal

28:24.701 --> 28:26.035
on silicon projector,

28:26.035 --> 28:29.201
which has these super sharp, super vivid,

28:29.201 --> 28:31.001
very bright images.

28:31.001 --> 28:32.435
We have our own custom waveguides

28:32.435 --> 28:35.501
and the rate of waveguide
development has blown me away.

28:35.501 --> 28:37.768
We bought a waveguide
company a couple years ago

28:37.768 --> 28:39.835
and I had a projection on
how I thought it would go

28:39.835 --> 28:41.435
and we've far exceeded it

28:41.435 --> 28:42.668
and this is all built on glass,

28:42.668 --> 28:44.335
which is ready to scale today.

28:44.335 --> 28:46.435
And so I think what we're
gonna see over the coming years

28:46.435 --> 28:51.035
is wider and wider, more
vivid, more detailed waveguides

28:51.035 --> 28:52.201
that allow us

28:52.201 --> 28:54.801
to really combine the light
from the real world with

28:56.068 --> 28:58.468
the digital light, but
also in a way that's clear.

28:58.468 --> 29:00.701
So like you can see my eyes.

29:00.701 --> 29:01.835
I think that's so important

29:01.835 --> 29:04.401
because as people communicate,
you not only communicate

29:04.401 --> 29:06.768
with your voice, your body language,

29:06.768 --> 29:07.868
but also with your eyes.

29:07.868 --> 29:09.001
I think that's gonna be another really

29:09.001 --> 29:10.001
important aspect of it.

29:10.001 --> 29:12.435
- Now Kelly, in the Orion design

29:12.435 --> 29:16.168
and my son was at the event, I watched it,

29:17.035 --> 29:19.468
but it's the same
scenario where I know that

29:19.468 --> 29:23.401
the visuals are in the
glasses themselves, right?

29:25.735 --> 29:27.501
Tell us a little bit about where,

29:28.601 --> 29:32.101
because, you said
potentially three years out,

29:32.101 --> 29:35.635
what are the things that are
keeping you from doing it now?

29:36.568 --> 29:39.668
- Yeah, I think just to feed on both Scott

29:39.668 --> 29:42.468
and Jason, like the optic
systems in these glasses

29:42.468 --> 29:44.035
are extremely difficult.

29:44.035 --> 29:45.835
Like this is one of the big challenges

29:45.835 --> 29:46.735
that we have to solve.

29:46.735 --> 29:48.968
And I see a lot of people
nodding their heads here

29:48.968 --> 29:51.368
because it's not just a
materials question, right?

29:51.368 --> 29:53.068
It's also a grading

29:53.068 --> 29:54.235
and how do you actually put,

29:54.235 --> 29:56.768
how do you actually get the
optical engine to align,

29:56.768 --> 29:58.735
you know, with that wave guide?

30:00.001 --> 30:01.635
And then you also need to look at,

30:01.635 --> 30:02.635
make sure that you manage

30:02.635 --> 30:04.168
that is socially acceptable.

30:04.168 --> 30:05.001
You know, Scott said like,

30:05.001 --> 30:06.268
you have to be able to see your eyes.

30:06.268 --> 30:08.701
Well not only that, your
eyes can't glow, right?

30:08.701 --> 30:11.001
So you have to manage that
light leakage on the front side

30:11.001 --> 30:12.801
because you don't wanna
look like a robot talking

30:12.801 --> 30:14.735
to people when you have your screens on.

30:14.735 --> 30:17.868
And managing light leakage
is not an easy thing to do

30:17.868 --> 30:19.468
for anybody that's kind of nodding

30:19.468 --> 30:21.535
because there's other
trade offs in the system.

30:21.535 --> 30:24.368
Second is, glasses are lightweight.

30:24.368 --> 30:27.535
The RayBan Metas I'm wearing
today are 48 grams, right?

30:27.535 --> 30:30.235
Even Orion right now is
less than a hundred grams

30:30.235 --> 30:33.568
that still feels heavy over
a longer period of time.

30:33.568 --> 30:35.935
And when lenses right now are
about two millimeters thick,

30:35.935 --> 30:38.101
if you add a wave guide,
they're four millimeters thick.

30:38.101 --> 30:40.468
So are you gonna have one
fat lens or two fat lenses?

30:40.468 --> 30:43.235
And so when you start really
thinking about form factor

30:43.235 --> 30:45.735
and really getting to
glasses and acceptability,

30:45.735 --> 30:49.135
it even constrains the space
you're working with even more.

30:49.135 --> 30:50.235
And so when we think about

30:50.235 --> 30:52.735
what constrains us on Orion
is we're trying to do all

30:52.735 --> 30:55.935
of this, right, with highly
immersive wide field of view

30:55.935 --> 30:58.301
with high resolution with no light leakage

30:58.301 --> 31:00.101
and a lightweight form factor.

31:00.101 --> 31:01.368
And so a lot of the technologies

31:01.368 --> 31:03.568
that we're using right now
aren't commercially viable

31:03.568 --> 31:06.301
in the sense of they're high cost, right?

31:06.301 --> 31:08.801
And they're expensive because
there's also this trade off as

31:08.801 --> 31:10.501
how much is the user gonna pay

31:10.501 --> 31:12.501
for this AR experience, right?

31:12.501 --> 31:14.535
Are they gonna pay $10,000
per pair of glasses?

31:14.535 --> 31:15.701
Probably not, right?

31:15.701 --> 31:17.668
I mean if they say Tiffany on 'em maybe,

31:17.668 --> 31:20.935
but, you know, so I think what
we're looking at is we need

31:20.935 --> 31:23.535
to get to a price point
where we think the value

31:23.535 --> 31:25.768
of these glasses are enough
that people are willing to pay

31:25.768 --> 31:29.268
for them and that the
technologies that we put

31:29.268 --> 31:32.135
inside can deliver the experience
that we think are fitting

31:32.135 --> 31:34.635
for truly AR-immersive display.

31:34.635 --> 31:37.735
And so we've learned a lot
from smart glasses, right?

31:37.735 --> 31:40.935
Both on the consumers, how
to bring these to consumers.

31:40.935 --> 31:42.535
You know what the things
we don't talk about

31:42.535 --> 31:44.068
is everyone in this room

31:44.068 --> 31:46.235
is really familiar with
consumer electronics, right?

31:46.235 --> 31:48.101
Jo-Bob is not, right?

31:48.101 --> 31:50.335
And so training people to
actually think about glasses

31:50.335 --> 31:52.601
with technology inside
has been a challenge.

31:52.601 --> 31:55.635
We spent a lot of time
doing demonstrations, right?

31:55.635 --> 31:57.801
To teach people how do you use the

31:57.801 --> 31:59.201
camera, how do you use the audio?

31:59.201 --> 32:00.535
People are still blown away today

32:00.535 --> 32:02.335
that there's audio in their glasses.

32:02.335 --> 32:03.535
And so what we're trying

32:03.535 --> 32:06.368
to also look at is we're
actually going towards that,

32:06.368 --> 32:08.901
you know, user out there that
knows a lot about glasses,

32:08.901 --> 32:10.035
that's the early adopter,

32:10.035 --> 32:12.535
but they still have a price
point that we have to manage

32:12.535 --> 32:14.834
and wait and experience and
have all those pieces together.

32:14.834 --> 32:17.668
And so I think that's part of the delay.

32:17.668 --> 32:19.734
Obviously there's silicon that you know,

32:19.734 --> 32:21.168
is that we're working on right now.

32:21.168 --> 32:23.534
There's battery, there's eye tracking,

32:23.534 --> 32:25.168
there's the graphics pipeline, like all

32:25.168 --> 32:26.601
of this has to come together.

32:26.601 --> 32:27.701
And so being able to show it

32:27.701 --> 32:29.401
and demo it in the Orion form factor

32:29.401 --> 32:31.168
I think was a big breakthrough.

32:31.168 --> 32:33.534
Now the next thing is coming
back to supply chain ops

32:33.534 --> 32:34.968
and the rest of our teams of like make

32:34.968 --> 32:36.568
this happen within a budget.

32:36.568 --> 32:38.868
And I think that's what's really gonna,

32:38.868 --> 32:41.268
the focus is gonna be in
how we bring this to life.

32:41.268 --> 32:45.101
- You know, I mentioned that in the key,

32:45.101 --> 32:48.268
in the title, it uses the word 2030.

32:49.301 --> 32:53.834
As we talk, maybe the guys
from CES knew something,

32:54.901 --> 32:57.134
oh, is 2030 kinda like

33:02.701 --> 33:05.734
the timeframe that we're gonna
solve some of these things?

33:05.734 --> 33:08.068
- Tim, everything in XR
is always five years away.

33:08.068 --> 33:11.434
That's the simple-
(group laughing)

33:11.434 --> 33:12.901
It's the easiest role, right?

33:14.001 --> 33:17.168
- I think we see a clear path
to broad consumer adoption

33:17.168 --> 33:19.301
of AR glasses within this decade.

33:19.301 --> 33:20.868
And lemme tell you how we're gonna do it.

33:20.868 --> 33:23.768
We've already shipped real
AR glasses to real people

33:23.768 --> 33:26.068
that are available today.

33:26.068 --> 33:27.968
And we already have a scaled use case.

33:27.968 --> 33:30.234
We know what people want to do with AR

33:30.234 --> 33:33.234
and we see that AR glasses
is the next logical step,

33:33.234 --> 33:35.201
but like I mentioned,
building them inside is hard,

33:35.201 --> 33:37.201
building them outside is even harder.

33:37.201 --> 33:39.534
So we're not asking people to do anything

33:39.534 --> 33:40.868
they're not already doing.

33:40.868 --> 33:43.134
Three of us on this panel
already wear glasses.

33:43.134 --> 33:44.634
We're gonna just make those glasses more

33:44.634 --> 33:47.634
and more powerful in a way
that lets the technology fade

33:47.634 --> 33:50.268
to the background so people
can focus on living their lives

33:50.268 --> 33:53.368
and having fun in a way that's
more natural, more human

33:53.368 --> 33:54.901
and just more interactive.

33:54.901 --> 33:56.334
- Yeah, I think that's the key, Scott,

33:56.334 --> 33:59.634
is as we're seeing this
technology continue to develop,

33:59.634 --> 34:01.101
I mentioned this training wheels idea

34:01.101 --> 34:03.268
before, you know,
putting on a pair of the,

34:03.268 --> 34:05.834
the meta Wayfarers, I've got a pair,

34:05.834 --> 34:07.301
I use 'em all the time now.

34:09.334 --> 34:11.034
When I put on my regular sunglasses,

34:11.034 --> 34:12.601
I feel like I'm missing something.

34:12.601 --> 34:13.901
Like there's a disconnect.

34:13.901 --> 34:17.834
I get used to having that
extra bit of ability around it.

34:17.834 --> 34:20.001
You throw on a visual display,

34:20.001 --> 34:22.001
and this is actually a funny anecdote.

34:22.001 --> 34:24.168
I have a friend of mine
that has tried out a bunch

34:24.168 --> 34:28.434
of VR devices because I've
forced 'em to over the years

34:28.434 --> 34:31.734
and he bought a pair of the meta glasses

34:31.734 --> 34:32.934
and he's like, you know
what would be great?

34:32.934 --> 34:34.801
It's like if they could have
like a little display on it.

34:34.801 --> 34:36.601
I'm like, well you mean like XR devices?

34:36.601 --> 34:38.468
He's like, oh, is that what
you guys have been working on?

34:38.468 --> 34:39.801
I'm like, yeah, that's what
everybody's been working on

34:39.801 --> 34:41.601
this is the whole idea, right?

34:41.601 --> 34:44.468
So this is the graduation
of the tech, right?

34:44.468 --> 34:47.601
And as we see more development go into it

34:47.601 --> 34:50.534
and we see the ability for
these, the wave guides to be able

34:50.534 --> 34:53.668
to get smaller, lighter,
faster, better, that graduation

34:53.668 --> 34:56.301
of the technology, it'll start
to get slowly implemented.

34:56.301 --> 34:58.234
But I think we are still gonna
have some of the challenges

34:58.234 --> 35:01.601
and some of the reasons why
some folks are offloading power

35:01.601 --> 35:03.268
processing and things like that

35:03.268 --> 35:07.068
to a separate battery device,
puck, whatever it may be.

35:08.068 --> 35:09.568
You know, I think that
we're going to, we see this,

35:09.568 --> 35:11.901
this crossover where some
people say, you know what?

35:11.901 --> 35:13.068
I need to have it all in one

35:13.068 --> 35:14.368
or other folks are gonna
say, you know what?

35:14.368 --> 35:16.434
I wanna have a companion
device that's gonna run

35:16.434 --> 35:18.634
and I can wear this
device maybe a little bit

35:18.634 --> 35:20.334
longer 'cause it's a little bit lighter.

35:20.334 --> 35:23.201
Whatever factor rolls into
it absolutely has to go down

35:23.201 --> 35:25.634
to the wearability and the
individual user saying,

35:25.634 --> 35:28.368
I'm comfortable using
this in my daily life.

35:28.368 --> 35:30.768
- And let's just add even
more to the equation.

35:30.768 --> 35:35.634
Most people wear glasses today
because they need rx, right?

35:35.634 --> 35:38.034
And so like if you look
at sun form factor,

35:38.034 --> 35:39.834
those are easy users to go after.

35:39.834 --> 35:41.568
I have clear these are
transition lenses on

35:41.568 --> 35:42.968
right now, they're great.

35:42.968 --> 35:44.534
We actually see with our RayBan metas

35:44.534 --> 35:47.168
that we have the higher percentage
of transition lens users

35:47.168 --> 35:48.301
because people wanna go indoors

35:48.301 --> 35:50.801
and outdoors with the
same set of smart glasses.

35:50.801 --> 35:53.134
But the big population here

35:53.134 --> 35:54.668
that wears glasses is rx.

35:54.668 --> 35:57.568
So you need to add RX
into this display equation

35:57.568 --> 35:59.234
that we just talked about, right?

35:59.234 --> 36:00.401
Which is already heavy,

36:00.401 --> 36:02.601
which already you have the
social form factor issues

36:02.601 --> 36:03.434
and then you're gonna have

36:03.434 --> 36:04.834
to revolutionize the supply chain.

36:04.834 --> 36:07.034
And this is one of the reasons
that we partnered with Esil

36:07.034 --> 36:10.034
or Luxottica is that we feel that is one

36:10.034 --> 36:12.134
of the big challenges that
we're going to have to solve.

36:12.134 --> 36:13.501
And they're one of the best partners

36:13.501 --> 36:15.534
that we can actually
solve that with as well

36:15.534 --> 36:17.601
as they have the distribution
that gets us into the consumer

36:17.601 --> 36:19.968
that teaches that consumer
both on the optical

36:19.968 --> 36:21.601
and the retail side as well

36:21.601 --> 36:23.201
as it helps us leverage their brands,

36:23.201 --> 36:25.834
which people then have trust
that hey, this is gonna look

36:25.834 --> 36:28.368
and feel like a RayBan product.

36:28.368 --> 36:30.301
- But I do think it's worth it to get

36:30.301 --> 36:32.701
the displays into the glasses themselves

36:32.701 --> 36:35.668
because it just makes it
so much easier for people

36:35.668 --> 36:36.801
to understand what to do.

36:36.801 --> 36:39.434
One of my favorite parts of working

36:39.434 --> 36:41.401
on at this job is getting to do demos

36:41.401 --> 36:44.201
to skeptical very serious people.

36:44.201 --> 36:45.834
And we get them laughing and smiling

36:45.834 --> 36:47.934
as they're pinching AR bubbles moving

36:47.934 --> 36:50.768
around augmented reality
jellyfish with our tutorial

36:50.768 --> 36:52.268
and then they're just off to the races,

36:52.268 --> 36:54.234
playing golf, building Legos,

36:54.234 --> 36:56.668
usually with very little
instruction from me.

36:56.668 --> 36:59.401
And then with the younger
generation, they love

36:59.401 --> 37:00.534
to like imagine things.

37:00.534 --> 37:02.801
So we have a lens called Imagine Together

37:03.901 --> 37:06.901
where you literally say what
you are thinking, it pops up

37:06.901 --> 37:08.134
as a 2D image.

37:08.134 --> 37:11.234
We use gen AI to build it
into 3D and it's interactable.

37:11.234 --> 37:13.201
You can move it around, you can play it.

37:13.201 --> 37:15.901
And then with connected lenses
we can play with it together.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.568
So I was playing with
my daughter, she wanted

37:18.568 --> 37:22.934
to have a tea party, we,
she imagined a teacup

37:22.934 --> 37:25.201
and all the stuff that goes
along with a tea party,

37:25.201 --> 37:27.734
we put it on the table and
we just started playing

37:27.734 --> 37:28.768
and it was so much fun.

37:28.768 --> 37:30.801
And like that's what we're going for.

37:30.801 --> 37:34.768
That's just that fun aspect
and it's amazing to see.

37:34.768 --> 37:35.834
- Yeah, and I think we, you know,

37:35.834 --> 37:37.868
we see the crossover with, you know, fun

37:37.868 --> 37:39.168
and then we look at it, you know,

37:39.168 --> 37:40.201
it's sometimes a little bit more of

37:40.201 --> 37:42.601
the stodgier portion of the
enterprise space, right?

37:42.601 --> 37:43.434
So how do we actually make this

37:43.434 --> 37:46.601
into a business-usable tool, right?

37:46.601 --> 37:50.034
And you know, when we start
looking at it from who's going

37:50.034 --> 37:51.567
to invest in some of
these early technologies,

37:51.567 --> 37:54.734
sometimes it does go to the
enterprise first and you know,

37:54.734 --> 37:58.434
but you know, I think
we've talked about this

37:58.434 --> 37:59.734
ad nauseum at this point, you know,

37:59.734 --> 38:01.867
a lot of people will become to expect

38:01.867 --> 38:04.434
that these devices will
be part of their ability

38:04.434 --> 38:06.501
to bring into their jobs.

38:06.501 --> 38:08.967
You know, the privacy aspects of it.

38:08.967 --> 38:11.567
All the challenges associated
with these devices,

38:11.567 --> 38:14.601
but there's going to be
so much of a consumer use

38:14.601 --> 38:17.167
of this technology that there's
going to be an expectation

38:17.167 --> 38:18.534
that you're gonna be able to use it

38:18.534 --> 38:20.401
on the job as well.

38:20.401 --> 38:22.034
I think, you know, many of us started off

38:22.034 --> 38:23.967
with our own personal phones, you know,

38:23.967 --> 38:25.334
cell phones being able to use them

38:25.334 --> 38:26.801
and then you start bringing 'em into work

38:26.801 --> 38:31.434
and it had to be this graduation
of allowing organizations

38:31.434 --> 38:33.234
to allow for your
personal phone to be used

38:33.234 --> 38:34.401
for work related needs.

38:34.401 --> 38:36.467
And we're gonna see the same level of kind

38:36.467 --> 38:39.834
of graduation over from fun into work.

38:39.834 --> 38:43.501
But all of those things are
absolutely gonna work together.

38:43.501 --> 38:44.334
There is one thing I think

38:44.334 --> 38:46.901
that you both talked about is
just the interaction points.

38:46.901 --> 38:50.434
And you know, the ability to have

38:51.634 --> 38:53.067
a device where you just put it on,

38:53.067 --> 38:55.001
and can interact with a virtual world

38:55.001 --> 38:58.067
or interact with virtual
objects is really key.

38:58.067 --> 38:59.401
And, you know, I want to call out

38:59.401 --> 39:01.567
what meta is doing on, on Orion

39:01.567 --> 39:03.967
as something I think is
going to be a a new industry

39:03.967 --> 39:06.834
altogether is that band.

39:06.834 --> 39:09.734
Now that band seems simplistic,

39:09.734 --> 39:12.434
but for anybody that's worked in XR

39:12.434 --> 39:13.701
and has used hand tracking before,

39:13.701 --> 39:16.534
one of the biggest drawbacks of that is

39:16.534 --> 39:18.834
a lack of haptic response.

39:18.834 --> 39:21.501
And getting even just a
little bit of vibration,

39:21.501 --> 39:24.434
a little bit of tactile response
when you're manipulating

39:24.434 --> 39:28.234
something is so much more of
a connection to that object.

39:28.234 --> 39:29.501
And I think we'll see that with,

39:29.501 --> 39:30.601
you know, across the ecosystem.

39:30.601 --> 39:33.401
I'm sure you guys are working
in that direction as well,

39:34.267 --> 39:37.001
that there's a need for people to say,

39:37.001 --> 39:39.201
oh I actually have
physically engaged with that

39:39.201 --> 39:41.867
and it's gonna cement that
interaction even further.

39:41.867 --> 39:44.134
It's gonna make it feel
more tangible to them.

39:44.134 --> 39:45.601
It's gonna make it feel more real.

39:45.601 --> 39:47.667
And I think you guys did
a great job with that

39:47.667 --> 39:50.034
and I think I'd love
to see that become more

39:50.034 --> 39:52.667
of the norm throughout XR

39:52.667 --> 39:55.734
and interaction is that we
need something that triggers

39:55.734 --> 39:59.734
that mind link that I did
actually touch that thing.

39:59.734 --> 40:01.301
'Cause otherwise you're just,
you know, interacting with

40:01.301 --> 40:02.701
that little ghost out there, right?

40:02.701 --> 40:03.967
So when you reach out

40:03.967 --> 40:06.234
and you pinch, if you could just feel that

40:06.234 --> 40:07.734
makes all the world difference.

40:07.734 --> 40:09.434
- Well, and I think one of the things

40:09.434 --> 40:11.134
that we've been really focused on is

40:11.134 --> 40:14.501
that people need multimodal,
they need different ways

40:14.501 --> 40:15.834
to be able to interact their glasses.

40:15.834 --> 40:18.034
So we have voice, which
I won't say "Hey Meta,"

40:18.034 --> 40:20.301
'cause my glasses will go off,
but you have voice, right?

40:20.301 --> 40:21.634
We also, we have the touch, right?

40:21.634 --> 40:22.801
So you can take a photo,

40:22.801 --> 40:25.934
having the band gives you
discreet input, right?

40:25.934 --> 40:27.101
You could actually be engaging

40:27.101 --> 40:29.367
with your meta AI
assistant very discreetly

40:29.367 --> 40:30.834
by just doing clicks.

40:30.834 --> 40:32.001
And to your point, like having

40:32.001 --> 40:33.701
that haptic response gives you confidence

40:33.701 --> 40:34.734
that it's actually hearing

40:34.734 --> 40:37.701
and responding to you
in discrete function.

40:37.701 --> 40:39.401
And so I find right
now, today I spend a lot

40:39.401 --> 40:40.734
of time clicking my glasses,

40:40.734 --> 40:42.534
especially if I'm taking action videos

40:42.534 --> 40:44.234
of me skiing down the slopes

40:44.234 --> 40:46.634
because you know, the voice,
the wind noise, right?

40:46.634 --> 40:48.467
It won't pick up my voice
with that wind noise.

40:48.467 --> 40:51.134
And so I think the band is
gonna open up a whole new set

40:51.134 --> 40:53.567
of interactions, both
just on smart glasses

40:53.567 --> 40:56.367
and AI assistant, but
also as you go to displays

40:56.367 --> 40:58.434
and being able to navigate those displays.

40:58.434 --> 40:59.334
- Just to add to that,

40:59.334 --> 41:01.434
like the way we actually designed Snap OS

41:01.434 --> 41:03.734
is the interface is literally
in the palm of your hand.

41:03.734 --> 41:06.834
So you get that physical
touch as you touch your finger

41:06.834 --> 41:08.101
and it feels like you're
touching the button.

41:08.101 --> 41:11.201
- Yeah, just it is a really
cool feature on the Snap.

41:11.201 --> 41:13.534
I'd be remiss to not ask this question

41:13.534 --> 41:16.934
and unfortunately I'm doing
it with like a minute left,

41:16.934 --> 41:18.801
which is bad.

41:18.801 --> 41:21.834
(group chuckling)

41:21.834 --> 41:26.767
AI on the meta,

41:26.767 --> 41:28.501
Wayfarers was really kind

41:28.501 --> 41:30.334
of a breakthrough for me.

41:30.334 --> 41:33.601
The fact that you could use
your headset or use that

41:33.601 --> 41:36.367
and you're seeing more and
more earbuds, et cetera,

41:36.367 --> 41:38.467
adding the AI feature.

41:38.467 --> 41:40.634
The other thing that you

41:40.634 --> 41:42.934
and I were talking about is translation.

41:43.801 --> 41:45.967
I've tried two or three glasses

41:45.967 --> 41:50.967
and or earbuds that do translation.

41:51.334 --> 41:53.867
I think those two are

41:54.734 --> 41:59.467
kinda underappreciated as a
part of this next generation

41:59.467 --> 42:01.201
of applications.

42:01.201 --> 42:04.001
The idea of being able
to have those headsets

42:04.001 --> 42:09.001
and I saw one from Evan Labs last night

42:10.467 --> 42:15.467
where the president was
speaking to me in Chinese

42:15.467 --> 42:19.234
and what he said was
showing up in the glasses.

42:19.234 --> 42:21.167
And that was a game changer in the sense.

42:21.167 --> 42:23.201
And then of course being able to just say,

42:23.201 --> 42:25.734
"Hey, meta," you know, "what time is it?"

42:25.734 --> 42:26.934
Or where am I going?

42:26.934 --> 42:28.667
Actually, I don't ask it that

42:28.667 --> 42:31.201
'cause you'll never know,
but you know what I mean?

42:32.301 --> 42:37.034
The role of AI in spatial, I think,

42:37.034 --> 42:39.201
is gonna be very important.

42:39.201 --> 42:44.201
And I want to, if I can
get this screen up on this

42:46.067 --> 42:50.201
and by just telling you
a little bit about a site

42:50.201 --> 42:52.301
that my partner and I
have created called AI

42:52.301 --> 42:55.501
and Spatial Computing Resource Center.

42:55.501 --> 42:59.601
That's the connection to
it. This is a labor of love.

42:59.601 --> 43:01.134
There's no cost.

43:01.134 --> 43:04.401
We have, Barton and I have
written hundreds of articles

43:04.401 --> 43:07.767
and pieces of material
on this particular area,

43:07.767 --> 43:11.667
and we brought in a lot of
material and case studies

43:11.667 --> 43:13.434
and this is a good resource center

43:13.434 --> 43:16.834
because the AI connection is still new.

43:16.834 --> 43:19.267
I mean, you know, all, you know, you can't

43:19.267 --> 43:21.367
by the way go anywhere here

43:21.367 --> 43:25.100
and any booth without AI being brought up.

43:25.100 --> 43:28.900
So we kind of determined
that it's a trend.

43:28.900 --> 43:32.934
The bottom line is we felt
that this started out as,

43:32.934 --> 43:37.234
as was called the
Metaverse Resource Center,

43:37.234 --> 43:40.467
but most recently we
started bringing in more

43:40.467 --> 43:44.600
and more of the AI and spatial
computing content to this.

43:44.600 --> 43:47.100
So if you can get a picture of that

43:50.700 --> 43:54.234
symbol there, it'll take
you right to the guide.

43:57.034 --> 43:58.534
We're unfortunately right out of time.

43:58.534 --> 44:01.434
But I do want to each ask
each of you, you know,

44:01.434 --> 44:03.200
to weigh in on just one last thing.

44:06.834 --> 44:11.634
XR and AR have kind of solidified

44:11.634 --> 44:13.000
where they are today.

44:13.000 --> 44:17.700
Gaming, education, training, enterprise,

44:19.200 --> 44:20.767
and there may be some.

44:20.767 --> 44:22.800
And if you're in the next session,

44:22.800 --> 44:27.000
Dr. Castro will bring up some
amazing examples in the area

44:27.000 --> 44:29.067
of it use using in surgery.

44:34.134 --> 44:35.034
But if you actually look

44:35.034 --> 44:37.367
at the one big theme from this show,

44:37.367 --> 44:41.567
you're gonna walk away from
it saying that Smart glasses

44:41.567 --> 44:46.367
was a really important new
thing that was brought up.

44:46.367 --> 44:50.300
Where are we going to be
next year with smart glasses?

44:50.300 --> 44:53.234
Are we gonna see breakthroughs?

44:53.234 --> 44:57.300
Is this gonna be more
of a developing year?

44:57.300 --> 44:59.967
2026? Is that the next year?

44:59.967 --> 45:02.934
Yeah, 20, I've totally lost years.

45:02.934 --> 45:04.467
I'm getting so old that I don't even

45:04.467 --> 45:05.634
know what they are anymore.

45:05.634 --> 45:09.900
Anyway, 2026, what do you
think is gonna happen?

45:09.900 --> 45:12.700
- Well, from a meta point of view,

45:12.700 --> 45:15.934
our RayBan metas are
selling very well, right?

45:15.934 --> 45:17.534
We are leaning in to continue

45:17.534 --> 45:19.867
to drive growth on these glasses.

45:19.867 --> 45:22.134
I think the biggest
learnings we have is really

45:22.134 --> 45:23.367
understanding, you know,

45:23.367 --> 45:25.600
and demoing the glasses to the consumer.

45:25.600 --> 45:27.034
You know, we have to remember that to get

45:27.034 --> 45:29.934
to broad consumer adoption,
this is a new technology,

45:29.934 --> 45:32.934
this is a new use case in how
they're using the glasses.

45:32.934 --> 45:35.434
We see that we are on the hockey stick.

45:35.434 --> 45:37.567
I think the evidence of all
the new AI glasses you're gonna

45:37.567 --> 45:39.467
see at the show today kind of shows that

45:39.467 --> 45:41.900
we're gonna continue to
lean in that form factor

45:41.900 --> 45:43.234
and style is important.

45:44.200 --> 45:47.534
Two is we're continuing to lean
into our AI on the glasses.

45:47.534 --> 45:48.867
We've launched many new kind

45:48.867 --> 45:51.200
of AI commands, we had "Be My Eyes,"

45:51.200 --> 45:52.867
which is one of the partnerships that were

45:52.867 --> 45:54.467
for the low and vision impaired,

45:54.467 --> 45:56.600
where they can actually turn on the camera

45:56.600 --> 45:58.634
and say, look at this, right?

45:58.634 --> 46:00.634
And then the user on the other side,

46:00.634 --> 46:02.334
on the Be My Eyes
database can actually see

46:02.334 --> 46:05.167
what they're seeing, and then
in their ear can actually give

46:05.167 --> 46:07.567
them instructions on how to navigate.

46:07.567 --> 46:09.100
This was actually a
really big breakthrough

46:09.100 --> 46:10.434
for that community.

46:10.434 --> 46:13.400
We're leaning in more
to, you know, reminders.

46:13.400 --> 46:14.434
Like, hey, look at this.

46:14.434 --> 46:17.000
Remind me later, where's
where did I park my car?

46:17.000 --> 46:18.934
That's a big one that I use a lot.

46:18.934 --> 46:22.467
And in our early access program
right now, we have live AI.

46:22.467 --> 46:25.867
So you can actually live from
your glasses, actually show

46:25.867 --> 46:28.900
what you're seeing and doing at that time,

46:28.900 --> 46:31.734
and then put it on your
Facebook family of apps

46:31.734 --> 46:33.300
and then live translation,

46:33.300 --> 46:35.634
which is really a game
changer today in these glasses

46:35.634 --> 46:37.634
so that you can speak with
someone in a different language

46:37.634 --> 46:39.534
and then have it translated in your ear.

46:39.534 --> 46:41.800
You're gonna see a cadence of more

46:41.800 --> 46:45.434
and more launches of really
specific AI use cases

46:45.434 --> 46:48.767
that help your assistant be
even more useful to you so

46:48.767 --> 46:52.034
that you don't want to take
your glasses off, right?

46:52.034 --> 46:54.067
At the same time, the
glasses have to look good.

46:54.067 --> 46:55.734
They have to feel good, right?

46:55.734 --> 46:57.000
And we need more and more consumers

46:57.000 --> 46:58.100
to find out about the glasses

46:58.100 --> 46:59.867
and to continue to kind of lean into them.

46:59.867 --> 47:02.734
And so we're really excited
in terms of this growth year.

47:02.734 --> 47:03.800
Some of the other things you're seeing,

47:03.800 --> 47:05.767
we've been leaning into more styles.

47:05.767 --> 47:08.767
You know, we recently
launched our headliner

47:08.767 --> 47:12.334
and our Skylar style for
more of the female audience.

47:12.334 --> 47:14.034
We're also leaning into more colors

47:14.034 --> 47:16.167
and you're also gonna see
more limited edition launches,

47:16.167 --> 47:17.334
like the one that I'm wearing so

47:17.334 --> 47:19.234
that we target very specific audiences.

47:19.234 --> 47:23.334
And so look out for this
space, I wish I could say more,

47:23.334 --> 47:25.800
but we have a really exciting fall lineup

47:25.800 --> 47:27.834
on the glasses form factor

47:27.834 --> 47:29.667
that we're gonna continue
to be leaning into.

47:29.667 --> 47:32.500
- Scott, a year from now. Snap.

47:32.500 --> 47:35.734
- So I don't wanna comment on
specific roadmap necessarily,

47:35.734 --> 47:38.600
but like we know now that
the hardware, software

47:38.600 --> 47:40.367
and the authoring tools are ready to go.

47:40.367 --> 47:43.534
So we expect to see this
explosion of use cases

47:43.534 --> 47:45.934
focused on just helping
people live their lives better

47:45.934 --> 47:47.667
and looking up not down.

47:47.667 --> 47:49.200
And if anybody wants to see spectacles

47:49.200 --> 47:51.000
after you let me know,
I'm happy to stick around.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.534
- Okay, Jason?

47:52.534 --> 47:54.534
You're gonna do some
partnerships this year, right?

47:54.534 --> 47:56.900
- Yeah, so obviously we
did a big announcement

47:56.900 --> 47:58.700
with Meta probably about
six months ago or so.

47:58.700 --> 48:01.767
We'll be working with them
on the Horizon ecosystem.

48:01.767 --> 48:02.867
So we will be leaning into

48:02.867 --> 48:05.200
that relationship in this coming year.

48:05.200 --> 48:07.734
So we're very excited to
continue to develop that.

48:07.734 --> 48:09.667
But I think 2025 is going to be the year

48:09.667 --> 48:12.600
where these devices become
socially acceptable,

48:12.600 --> 48:15.267
where people will begin
to fully understand

48:15.267 --> 48:16.900
that this is a thing that they're going

48:16.900 --> 48:18.500
to see on a regular basis.

48:18.500 --> 48:21.100
You know, whether it's a Snap like device,

48:21.100 --> 48:23.334
a Wayfarer device, you know

48:23.334 --> 48:24.967
the RayBan glasses style

48:24.967 --> 48:28.334
or eventually an Orion type glass.

48:28.334 --> 48:30.367
We're gradually building the community

48:30.367 --> 48:33.067
and gradually building
the audience to expect

48:33.067 --> 48:36.334
that a glasses form factor
with cameras on them,

48:36.334 --> 48:38.934
with potentially displays could be part

48:38.934 --> 48:41.400
of the interaction you're
having with another human being.

48:41.400 --> 48:43.734
So when you see somebody
wearing glasses, they,

48:43.734 --> 48:45.534
it's not going to be just
the normal expectation

48:45.534 --> 48:47.100
that they're just a pair of eyeglasses.

48:47.100 --> 48:49.367
You may be, you know, asked to,

48:49.367 --> 48:50.767
you know, asked a question, all right,

48:50.767 --> 48:52.734
well what's actually going
on behind the scenes there?

48:52.734 --> 48:54.800
Are they seeing something?
Are they hearing something?

48:54.800 --> 48:55.633
You know?

48:55.633 --> 48:56.667
So that interaction point

48:56.667 --> 48:58.733
becomes a lot more socially acceptable.

48:58.733 --> 49:01.833
I think by 2026, the big
thing will be is that

49:02.700 --> 49:04.033
we're gonna have an expectation

49:04.033 --> 49:06.467
that these will be part
of our daily lives.

49:06.467 --> 49:08.233
I think this will be the last year

49:08.233 --> 49:10.967
where people will walk away
and say, you know what?

49:10.967 --> 49:13.233
I don't have that need to be able

49:13.233 --> 49:14.833
to speak to an AI assistant.

49:14.833 --> 49:18.933
I don't have that, again,
the Chat GPT interaction

49:18.933 --> 49:20.367
or the LM interaction

49:20.367 --> 49:22.867
or whatever you're
actually using for your LM,

49:22.867 --> 49:23.933
any of those tools

49:23.933 --> 49:26.033
become such a part of our daily lives

49:26.033 --> 49:30.200
that as we're moving into
this next generation of tech,

49:30.200 --> 49:31.933
there's going to be this
absolute expectation

49:31.933 --> 49:34.167
that it's built into
that future technology.

49:34.167 --> 49:36.767
So I think we're at the
end of the generation

49:36.767 --> 49:39.000
where there were dumb glasses

49:39.000 --> 49:40.433
and we're moving into that generation

49:40.433 --> 49:41.667
where there's an expectation,

49:41.667 --> 49:42.667
almost like the TVs we have today.

49:42.667 --> 49:46.133
When you buy a TV, every
TV now is a smart TV.

49:46.133 --> 49:48.833
There's no TV that is not
internet connected anymore.

49:48.833 --> 49:50.533
And I think in the very
near future we're gonna have

49:50.533 --> 49:53.833
that same thing with our
(indistinct) wearables.

49:53.833 --> 49:55.767
- Well panel, thank you
so much for joining me.

49:55.767 --> 49:58.200
It's really been a pleasure
to have you with us.

49:58.200 --> 50:00.733
Your information and your knowledge

50:00.733 --> 50:03.467
and your roles at your
companies are important

50:03.467 --> 50:05.233
to us in the industry.

50:05.233 --> 50:07.133
Thank you for joining us today.

50:07.133 --> 50:08.433
- [Panelists] Thank you.

50:08.433 --> 50:09.267
- [Tim] And I encourage you to stay

50:09.267 --> 50:12.033
for the next session,
which you'll enjoy too.

50:12.033 --> 50:15.667
Thank you very much!

50:15.667 --> 50:18.233
