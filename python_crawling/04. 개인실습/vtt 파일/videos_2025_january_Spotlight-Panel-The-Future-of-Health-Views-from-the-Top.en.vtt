00:00.040 --> 00:02.957
(electronic music)

00:10.710 --> 00:11.543
All right.

00:11.543 --> 00:12.600
Welcome, everybody.

00:12.600 --> 00:13.830
My name is Logan Plaster.

00:13.830 --> 00:17.310
I'm the Chief Content Officer at Startup Health,

00:17.310 --> 00:20.670
excited to be moderating this panel today.

00:20.670 --> 00:22.560
Panel's called Views from the Top.

00:22.560 --> 00:26.970
And we've got a really nice diverse set of perspectives

00:26.970 --> 00:31.620
in healthcare leadership across health systems,

00:31.620 --> 00:33.720
big tech, big pharma.

00:33.720 --> 00:37.290
And we're gonna talk about big challenges

00:37.290 --> 00:38.640
and big opportunities.

00:38.640 --> 00:42.090
We've got David Holmberg, CEO of Highmark Health.

00:42.090 --> 00:46.380
We've got Dr. Janice Nevin, the CEO of ChristianaCare.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.910
We've got Dr. Michael Howell,

00:47.910 --> 00:50.130
the chief clinical officer at Google.

00:50.130 --> 00:51.360
And we've got Diogo Rau,

00:51.360 --> 00:54.843
the chief information officer at Eli Lilly.

00:55.920 --> 01:00.120
So two big objectives for today's conversation.

01:00.120 --> 01:02.047
Obviously, these folks are, or you all,

01:02.047 --> 01:04.980
I'm gonna try to talk to you and keep this conversational.

01:04.980 --> 01:09.690
You are helping to helm health transformation today

01:09.690 --> 01:10.620
in many ways.

01:10.620 --> 01:13.410
And so part of the goal here is to pull back the curtain

01:13.410 --> 01:18.000
on how you're thinking, where you're steering,

01:18.000 --> 01:20.430
maybe some of the icebergs that you're seeing

01:20.430 --> 01:22.620
and how to avoid them.

01:22.620 --> 01:25.740
But we also want this to be a conversation,

01:25.740 --> 01:27.810
a convergence of your own ideas,

01:27.810 --> 01:30.180
'cause my guess is you don't have many opportunities

01:30.180 --> 01:32.580
to be on a Zoom call with the four of you

01:32.580 --> 01:36.000
and to bounce ideas between health system thinking,

01:36.000 --> 01:38.070
pharmaceutical innovation thinking,

01:38.070 --> 01:39.420
what Google is working on.

01:39.420 --> 01:41.220
And so as we go through some of these sort

01:41.220 --> 01:46.132
of high level issues, I also want to hear some crosstalk

01:46.132 --> 01:48.090
and some conversations.

01:48.090 --> 01:50.940
So let's start with some basic introductions.

01:50.940 --> 01:52.950
We're gonna go down the line starting with David.

01:52.950 --> 01:54.540
Tell us about your role

01:54.540 --> 01:58.380
and tell us one of your biggest objectives

01:58.380 --> 02:01.170
in the business for 2025.

02:01.170 --> 02:02.100
<v ->Well, I'm David Holmberg.</v>

02:02.100 --> 02:03.930
I'm CEO of Highmark Health.

02:03.930 --> 02:07.500
Highmark Health is a integrated health system

02:07.500 --> 02:09.930
and health plan based in Pittsburgh.

02:09.930 --> 02:13.470
So, you know, we're the blue plan for four states.

02:13.470 --> 02:15.240
We also have a hospital system

02:15.240 --> 02:17.910
with 14 hospitals in Western Pennsylvania.

02:17.910 --> 02:19.650
And we have a technology company

02:19.650 --> 02:23.550
that, you know, is pretty advanced in terms of capabilities

02:23.550 --> 02:25.860
and the work that we're trying to do.

02:25.860 --> 02:28.950
You know, from our perspective, the biggest challenge,

02:28.950 --> 02:30.390
I mean, obviously, the environment we're in

02:30.390 --> 02:32.340
is very difficult right now.

02:32.340 --> 02:36.960
And, you know, we believe very strongly that in 2025,

02:36.960 --> 02:38.970
we've gotta start to move some things forward

02:38.970 --> 02:43.470
and be different and innovate and maybe show progress

02:43.470 --> 02:45.960
on, you know, some of the consumer things.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.700
And just to give you a perspective,

02:47.700 --> 02:50.370
I'm a very unconventional healthcare CEO.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.440
I started my career in the jewelry business.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.660
Ultimately got into the optical business,

02:54.660 --> 02:56.340
and that's how I ended up in healthcare.

02:56.340 --> 02:57.390
<v Logan>What's one thing you've carried</v>

02:57.390 --> 03:00.510
from being a jeweler to being a head of a health system?

03:00.510 --> 03:01.560
<v ->Well, when you're selling jewel.</v>

03:01.560 --> 03:03.570
Well, first of all, I am very popular at Christmas time

03:03.570 --> 03:04.830
'cause I can get you out of trouble.

03:04.830 --> 03:08.250
Whatever trouble you've gotten yourself into, you know.

03:08.250 --> 03:11.640
For me, you know, when you're selling jewelry,

03:11.640 --> 03:15.870
you're selling something that people want but don't need.

03:15.870 --> 03:20.070
And in healthcare, they need us but sometimes don't want us.

03:20.070 --> 03:24.240
And so we have to figure out a way to meet people

03:24.240 --> 03:26.520
where they're at, treat 'em like consumers,

03:26.520 --> 03:30.540
maybe break the paradigm of a health, you know, insurer

03:30.540 --> 03:33.900
or health system or pharma company, whatever it might be,

03:33.900 --> 03:35.760
and take a different approach that's been done.

03:35.760 --> 03:36.593
<v Logan>Nice.</v>

03:36.593 --> 03:37.426
Dr. Nevin.

03:37.426 --> 03:38.259
<v ->Thanks.</v>

03:38.259 --> 03:39.390
Good afternoon.

03:39.390 --> 03:40.410
Dr. Janice Nevin.

03:40.410 --> 03:43.050
I'm the president and CEO of ChristianaCare.

03:43.050 --> 03:46.230
I am a primary care physician by training,

03:46.230 --> 03:48.990
grew up with the biopsychosocial model of care

03:48.990 --> 03:53.990
and so firmly believe in how care needs to be integrated

03:54.345 --> 03:56.550
in order to achieve health.

03:56.550 --> 03:59.010
And I think, again, when we think about technology,

03:59.010 --> 04:01.770
there's a great opportunity with technology

04:01.770 --> 04:03.480
to help us do that.

04:03.480 --> 04:05.070
We are large regional,

04:05.070 --> 04:07.620
community-based academic health system.

04:07.620 --> 04:10.620
We take care of people throughout the state of Delaware

04:10.620 --> 04:13.620
as well as in the contiguous counties in Maryland,

04:13.620 --> 04:16.920
Southeastern Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.

04:16.920 --> 04:20.940
We are very committed to population health,

04:20.940 --> 04:23.490
to value-based care.

04:23.490 --> 04:26.430
You know, we believe that there is a better way

04:26.430 --> 04:29.370
to care for people to really drive health

04:29.370 --> 04:33.180
that the hospital should be the place of last resort.

04:33.180 --> 04:36.330
And again, as I think about the future,

04:36.330 --> 04:38.640
I think about 2025.

04:38.640 --> 04:42.090
Again, I just think there's an incredible opportunity

04:42.090 --> 04:44.460
given the time in which we find ourselves,

04:44.460 --> 04:47.400
the technology that's available to us

04:47.400 --> 04:52.350
to really help solve for some of the very troubling issues

04:52.350 --> 04:54.000
that we have in healthcare.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.220
Whether it be our ability to care

04:56.220 --> 05:00.630
for a significantly growing elderly population

05:00.630 --> 05:04.680
where an ability to support our workforce,

05:04.680 --> 05:08.910
which is dwindling and has significant issues with burnout.

05:08.910 --> 05:12.120
And also to solve for the financial issues

05:12.120 --> 05:14.160
so that we can make care more affordable.

05:14.160 --> 05:16.470
And that's really where we're focused.

05:16.470 --> 05:17.303
<v ->Thanks.</v>

05:17.303 --> 05:18.420
Dr. Howell.

05:18.420 --> 05:19.253
<v ->I'm Michael Howell.</v>

05:19.253 --> 05:20.790
I work at Google.

05:20.790 --> 05:23.370
I'm the company's chief clinical officer,

05:23.370 --> 05:25.200
which if it sounds like a made up job title

05:25.200 --> 05:28.083
for the best job in the world possible that that's true.

05:29.070 --> 05:32.970
And my teams work across the things that Google does

05:32.970 --> 05:35.400
that have an important impact in health.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.780
And so those are things

05:36.780 --> 05:40.140
like, you know, a few hundred million people a day come

05:40.140 --> 05:42.990
to search, ask questions about their health.

05:42.990 --> 05:46.590
They're around 200 billion health related YouTube videos

05:46.590 --> 05:48.300
that are viewed a year.

05:48.300 --> 05:51.090
There are 8 billion people on the planet.

05:51.090 --> 05:54.180
But also our work with enterprises through Google Cloud

05:54.180 --> 05:56.580
through inventing new kinds of math.

05:56.580 --> 05:59.400
You know, two of my coworkers last month received

05:59.400 --> 06:03.150
their Nobel Prize for protein folding.

06:03.150 --> 06:05.610
And then I come from a background of I took care

06:05.610 --> 06:07.500
of sick people for a long time.

06:07.500 --> 06:11.520
I'm a pulmonary critical care doc in between 1995-1995.

06:13.860 --> 06:17.880
And 2017, I was either training or practicing as an ICU doc

06:17.880 --> 06:19.890
and then ran parts of health systems.

06:19.890 --> 06:21.990
And so I would say that, you know, the things

06:21.990 --> 06:24.840
to know about us are we have six products

06:24.840 --> 06:28.020
that more than 2 billion people use every month.

06:28.020 --> 06:30.210
By definition, that tells you that we have to think

06:30.210 --> 06:31.860
on a global scale.

06:31.860 --> 06:35.760
And that the other is that is we invent new kinds of math

06:35.760 --> 06:37.530
and new kinds of AI.

06:37.530 --> 06:40.890
We work really hard to make those available for other folks

06:40.890 --> 06:42.093
to build on top of.

06:43.050 --> 06:46.200
<v ->Quick follow up, where do you see Google Health</v>

06:46.200 --> 06:48.340
on YouTube sort of shifting

06:49.440 --> 06:52.980
vis-a-vis the Google TV sort of announcement

06:52.980 --> 06:54.390
and kinda where that's heading?

06:54.390 --> 06:55.620
<v ->Yeah, there are a few things.</v>

06:55.620 --> 06:58.410
So one is in the health information quality space there,

06:58.410 --> 07:01.110
we worked with the National Academy of Medicine

07:01.110 --> 07:04.620
and the World Health Organization who defined principles

07:04.620 --> 07:07.350
for what high quality health information is.

07:07.350 --> 07:10.680
And so, you know, if you search for the most common queries,

07:10.680 --> 07:11.910
you'll see this thing at the top

07:11.910 --> 07:14.040
that says from health sources.

07:14.040 --> 07:16.110
And then we'll tell you like that this video

07:16.110 --> 07:18.510
is from, you know, ChristianaCare,

07:18.510 --> 07:20.940
which has licensed hospitals in the United States,

07:20.940 --> 07:23.370
or for doctors, nurses,

07:23.370 --> 07:25.020
and licensed mental health professionals.

07:25.020 --> 07:26.550
It will tell you it's a licensed physician

07:26.550 --> 07:27.870
or a licensed nurse.

07:27.870 --> 07:31.500
We do actually give verified licenses and things like that.

07:31.500 --> 07:32.550
And then I think the other thing

07:32.550 --> 07:35.010
that we've worked on really hard for accessibility

07:35.010 --> 07:37.590
is related to language.

07:37.590 --> 07:40.530
And so we have AI tools that help people move

07:40.530 --> 07:41.460
from their native language

07:41.460 --> 07:43.410
to more than a hundred other languages.

07:43.410 --> 07:45.750
You know, we have really expanding availability

07:45.750 --> 07:47.400
of high quality information.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.233
<v Logan>Okay.</v>

07:48.233 --> 07:49.470
Diogo Rau, What are you working on?

07:49.470 --> 07:50.303
<v ->Great.</v>

07:50.303 --> 07:52.050
Hey everyone, my name is Diogo Rau

07:52.050 --> 07:54.120
and I am at Eli Lilly and Company.

07:54.120 --> 07:55.650
We are a company that makes medicines

07:55.650 --> 07:58.290
and my job is to run technology,

07:58.290 --> 08:01.170
run everything from the technology that we use in discovery

08:01.170 --> 08:04.440
to the technology we use in the consumer experience.

08:04.440 --> 08:05.610
Speaking of the consumer experience,

08:05.610 --> 08:07.650
it's awesome to be here at CES.

08:07.650 --> 08:09.510
I've had a grin on my face all day

08:09.510 --> 08:12.630
as I've seen all kinds of really cool technology.

08:12.630 --> 08:15.570
Actually, I see a few people out there smiling right now.

08:15.570 --> 08:19.260
Now, let me ask you about the last time you got medicine.

08:19.260 --> 08:20.943
Did that make you smile,

08:21.900 --> 08:23.940
especially when you had to pay the copay?

08:23.940 --> 08:25.140
I bet not.

08:25.140 --> 08:27.210
That is something we need to change.

08:27.210 --> 08:30.240
Like this industry is stuck in the wrong century.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.760
Like we need to modernize this consumer experience,

08:32.760 --> 08:35.700
at least bring it into the late 20th century.

08:35.700 --> 08:37.740
Actually, I'd really like to bring it into the 21st century,

08:37.740 --> 08:40.050
but it's time to change that consumer experience.

08:40.050 --> 08:43.140
That's really the problem that I wanna go after this year.

08:43.140 --> 08:43.973
<v ->Awesome.</v>

08:43.973 --> 08:45.090
Okay, I wanna start our conversation,

08:45.090 --> 08:47.640
although it's already begun.

08:47.640 --> 08:50.550
Talking about the greatest challenges you're seeing

08:50.550 --> 08:54.270
in health and in health innovation within your sphere.

08:54.270 --> 08:57.390
At Startup Health, we coach hundreds of founders

08:57.390 --> 09:01.230
and often come back to the traditional SWAT chart,

09:01.230 --> 09:03.480
the understanding that if you understand your weaknesses

09:03.480 --> 09:07.920
and threats, it opens up opportunities for innovation

09:07.920 --> 09:08.790
and expansion.

09:08.790 --> 09:11.370
And so I really want to go down the line

09:11.370 --> 09:13.260
and talk about the greatest challenge

09:13.260 --> 09:16.560
that you're seeing in 2025, and then we'll come back around

09:16.560 --> 09:19.365
towards kinda how that opens up opportunities

09:19.365 --> 09:20.198
for innovation.

09:20.198 --> 09:21.150
So David.

09:21.150 --> 09:25.080
<v ->Well, the greatest challenge we're seeing in 2025</v>

09:25.080 --> 09:28.590
is, you know, we have a big portion of the country

09:28.590 --> 09:31.650
that's not satisfied with the healthcare system,

09:31.650 --> 09:33.390
and that includes all of us.

09:33.390 --> 09:38.280
And, you know, and I think you have this in this panel,

09:38.280 --> 09:40.020
we all represent different components

09:40.020 --> 09:41.252
of the healthcare system.

09:41.252 --> 09:42.660
You know, we have the financing of care,

09:42.660 --> 09:45.780
we have the delivery of care, we have technology,

09:45.780 --> 09:47.400
we've got pharmaceuticals.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.200
Pharmaceuticals are running 30%

09:49.200 --> 09:51.777
of claims, you know, expense today.

09:51.777 --> 09:54.090
And that reflects the success and the work

09:54.090 --> 09:56.190
that they're doing to create super drugs

09:56.190 --> 09:58.230
and things that are gonna make a difference.

09:58.230 --> 10:00.510
And the biggest challenge we see

10:00.510 --> 10:02.820
is we're all working in silos.

10:02.820 --> 10:07.590
You know, if we wanna change healthcare in 2025 and beyond,

10:07.590 --> 10:09.420
we've gotta get at the table together

10:09.420 --> 10:13.500
and work on some of these things in a collaborative front.

10:13.500 --> 10:14.910
And that's what we were talking about

10:14.910 --> 10:17.190
before we started today is, you know, we're working

10:17.190 --> 10:20.527
with Christiana and Delaware on some unique things.

10:20.527 --> 10:24.060
You know, we're working with Lily on some unique things,

10:24.060 --> 10:25.950
but I do believe that's the biggest challenge

10:25.950 --> 10:28.560
is we're all in silos, we all have more data

10:28.560 --> 10:30.840
than we know what to do with, and we're lacking insights

10:30.840 --> 10:34.770
because we're not on the same team on any given issue.

10:34.770 --> 10:35.603
<v ->Okay.</v>

10:35.603 --> 10:36.810
And a reminder that if anyone wants to jump in

10:36.810 --> 10:38.430
on a response, you're welcome to.

10:38.430 --> 10:39.263
So, Dr. Nevin?

10:39.263 --> 10:41.010
<v ->Yeah, I would just really underscore</v>

10:41.010 --> 10:42.900
that I was gonna say it at some point.

10:42.900 --> 10:45.450
I think not only do we function in silos,

10:45.450 --> 10:48.090
we tend to point fingers at each other.

10:48.090 --> 10:51.780
And I think, you know, if we've learned nothing

10:51.780 --> 10:54.060
over the last couple of months,

10:54.060 --> 10:56.370
we really need to come together

10:56.370 --> 11:01.320
and start bringing our collective capabilities

11:01.320 --> 11:06.320
to the table to solve for what our very real challenges.

11:06.480 --> 11:09.240
You know, I spend an awful lot of time thinking

11:09.240 --> 11:12.330
about people being a health system provider.

11:12.330 --> 11:16.680
We are either taking care of people, families, communities,

11:16.680 --> 11:20.310
or we have people that we have to take care of

11:20.310 --> 11:22.920
who are fulfilling that role.

11:22.920 --> 11:27.630
And, you know, as I mentioned in the opening,

11:27.630 --> 11:29.880
it's becoming increasingly challenging

11:29.880 --> 11:33.450
for people who need care to be able to access care.

11:33.450 --> 11:38.450
And so we really have to think creatively, innovatively,

11:39.000 --> 11:43.650
think about how we use technology to support our people

11:43.650 --> 11:47.040
so that they can do what they came to healthcare to do,

11:47.040 --> 11:49.770
which is provide that human touch.

11:49.770 --> 11:53.520
Technology is an absolutely essential critical tool.

11:53.520 --> 11:55.470
We need to figure out how to use it

11:55.470 --> 11:58.080
in ways that are gonna have impact.

11:58.080 --> 12:02.310
But when someone is suffering, they want that human touch

12:02.310 --> 12:05.370
and we need to ensure that we will be able to do that.

12:05.370 --> 12:08.037
We've done a couple of things at ChristianaCare

12:08.037 --> 12:11.490
and an effort to meet that challenge.

12:11.490 --> 12:15.810
I think, you know, the, the promise of ambient voice

12:15.810 --> 12:19.800
in helping solve for some of the administrative issues

12:19.800 --> 12:21.120
that result in burnout.

12:21.120 --> 12:23.220
I'm very excited about that.

12:23.220 --> 12:25.320
We also have deployed Moxie.

12:25.320 --> 12:28.440
Moxie is a collaborative robot.

12:28.440 --> 12:33.440
Moxie essentially takes non-value added tasks off the hands

12:33.990 --> 12:35.910
of bedside nurses.

12:35.910 --> 12:39.720
And to date, I think Moxie has saved something

12:39.720 --> 12:42.810
like 8 million hours of work

12:42.810 --> 12:46.680
for nurses and patient care technicians.

12:46.680 --> 12:49.950
So, again, we've gotta think ultimately in healthcare,

12:49.950 --> 12:53.250
we take care of people and we need people,

12:53.250 --> 12:54.630
we'll never have enough.

12:54.630 --> 12:56.520
So I spent a lot of time, you know,

12:56.520 --> 12:59.850
thinking about worrying about how the people that we serve

12:59.850 --> 13:01.950
are gonna be able to get the care that they need

13:01.950 --> 13:05.070
and how I and we can do a better job

13:05.070 --> 13:07.650
of supporting those that provide that care.

13:07.650 --> 13:08.700
<v ->Michael, maybe you can lean in</v>

13:08.700 --> 13:11.730
on some of the AI challenges that you're seeing

13:11.730 --> 13:13.830
and how that even feeds into.

13:13.830 --> 13:16.380
I think, what we heard were people challenges

13:16.380 --> 13:19.200
and silo challenges, community challenges.

13:19.200 --> 13:20.610
But then on the tech side,

13:20.610 --> 13:25.610
I think you and Diogo can feed into that.

13:25.830 --> 13:28.500
<v ->You mean technology is a tool, right,</v>

13:28.500 --> 13:29.580
to solve a problem.

13:29.580 --> 13:31.440
And so what is the problem?

13:31.440 --> 13:33.390
I think I would probably say the same thing

13:33.390 --> 13:36.810
that patient-centered care, by definition,

13:36.810 --> 13:38.643
doesn't care where the patient is.

13:40.227 --> 13:42.690
We should take care of them whenever they need it

13:42.690 --> 13:46.290
with as little effort and as little expense as possible

13:46.290 --> 13:48.420
to create the most health on the planet.

13:48.420 --> 13:51.840
The WHO says that 4.5 billion people don't have access

13:51.840 --> 13:54.600
to essential health services.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.273
That's not only outside the United States.

13:58.590 --> 14:03.203
You know, if you talk to medical schools

14:04.050 --> 14:05.940
who are recruiting faculty,

14:05.940 --> 14:09.060
they can't find primary care with a reasonable wait time

14:09.060 --> 14:11.070
for the faculty that they're recruiting.

14:11.070 --> 14:13.410
And it's not because the doctors aren't working hard

14:13.410 --> 14:14.820
or the nurses aren't working hard

14:14.820 --> 14:16.380
or the physical therapists aren't working hard

14:16.380 --> 14:18.330
or the pharmacists aren't working hard.

14:18.330 --> 14:22.050
It's because of the system that we, to quote Don Berwick,

14:22.050 --> 14:25.860
the system that we have is perfectly designed

14:25.860 --> 14:27.540
to achieve the outcomes that it achieves.

14:27.540 --> 14:28.830
And so we need to think about that.

14:28.830 --> 14:32.400
And technology is an important tool for that.

14:32.400 --> 14:35.490
AI is a foundational general purpose technology

14:35.490 --> 14:37.770
like electricity or connectivity.

14:37.770 --> 14:40.170
And so it may have impacts across all of those.

14:40.170 --> 14:45.120
And certainly, we see the early targets being eliminated.

14:45.120 --> 14:48.300
I can tell a fellow lean practitioner over here,

14:48.300 --> 14:51.840
eliminating the non-value added work that is huge part

14:51.840 --> 14:54.210
of being successful in healthcare.

14:54.210 --> 14:55.230
<v ->So just to follow up quickly,</v>

14:55.230 --> 14:56.670
that's sort of like the macro challenge.

14:56.670 --> 15:00.300
I'm curious, as you look at 2025 in your specific work,

15:00.300 --> 15:03.570
what's a specific challenge that might keep you up at night?

15:03.570 --> 15:08.100
<v ->Yeah, 2023 was the year of people experimenting</v>

15:08.100 --> 15:09.420
with large language models.

15:09.420 --> 15:14.040
2024 was the year of many leading healthcare organizations

15:14.040 --> 15:16.770
getting real value out of generative AI.

15:16.770 --> 15:21.750
2025 is the year of agents, by which I mean the models begin

15:21.750 --> 15:24.130
to do things in the real world around them

15:25.080 --> 15:27.570
to use of tools and other systems.

15:27.570 --> 15:30.300
That's a whole new set of challenges that will require a lot

15:30.300 --> 15:33.027
of change management for use in healthcare

15:33.027 --> 15:35.100
and in every industry.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.180
<v Logan>Diogo.</v>

15:36.180 --> 15:38.640
<v ->Well, a lot going on in 2025,</v>

15:38.640 --> 15:41.940
but if I had to put one thing out there on the radar,

15:41.940 --> 15:44.070
it's around the safety of our medicines.

15:44.070 --> 15:45.960
Now, that's not a hot, sexy topic,

15:45.960 --> 15:48.180
but it actually is really important right now

15:48.180 --> 15:50.820
because something big is happening in our world

15:50.820 --> 15:55.380
that is the rise of the medicines to treat obesity.

15:55.380 --> 15:57.240
There are a couple on the market,

15:57.240 --> 15:58.740
there are many more coming.

15:58.740 --> 16:00.420
These are expensive medicines

16:00.420 --> 16:03.150
that many plans choose not to cover,

16:03.150 --> 16:05.760
so that means the cash price is really expensive.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.500
What happens when you have a hot product

16:07.500 --> 16:09.000
that's really expensive?

16:09.000 --> 16:11.190
You start getting a lot of fakes out there.

16:11.190 --> 16:14.130
Now, it's one thing if you get a fake movie

16:14.130 --> 16:16.620
or get a copy of something or a fake handbag.

16:16.620 --> 16:19.050
How much harm is that really going to do?

16:19.050 --> 16:20.760
When you're talking about a fake medicine,

16:20.760 --> 16:22.530
something that you inject in your body.

16:22.530 --> 16:25.590
At best, a fake medicine is going to do no harm.

16:25.590 --> 16:30.590
At worst, the consequences could be absolutely catastrophic.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.697
This is something we are just at the beginning of.

16:32.697 --> 16:36.900
And I think we need to start turning our focus to it in 2025

16:36.900 --> 16:39.480
because this industry really needs to change.

16:39.480 --> 16:41.340
This industry, the medicines industry

16:41.340 --> 16:43.770
and the healthcare industry has a terrible history.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.800
If you go all the way back 150 years, like around the time

16:46.800 --> 16:48.030
that Lilly was started.

16:48.030 --> 16:51.060
Lilly in fact was started to counteract snake oil

16:51.060 --> 16:53.460
and all the fake medicines that were out there.

16:53.460 --> 16:55.710
We are about to hit that again,

16:55.710 --> 16:59.550
thanks to the rise in medicines to treat obesity,

16:59.550 --> 17:02.040
the economic potential for counterfeiters out there.

17:02.040 --> 17:04.380
So we're working on that really hard.

17:04.380 --> 17:06.750
We've got some really cool consumer kinds of technology

17:06.750 --> 17:08.190
we'd be happy to talk about,

17:08.190 --> 17:10.920
bringing in NFC and other things like that.

17:10.920 --> 17:13.200
But this is something that we're going to have to address

17:13.200 --> 17:15.123
before people get hurt in a big way.

17:17.460 --> 17:19.740
<v ->I wanna talk about tech convergence.</v>

17:19.740 --> 17:22.590
We're here at CES and one of the really exciting things

17:22.590 --> 17:25.860
about being on the floor is that the health tech zone

17:25.860 --> 17:29.790
is next to the vacuums, the home tech,

17:29.790 --> 17:34.790
and you can go see the auto tech personal wellness tech

17:35.370 --> 17:36.780
and the world's collide.

17:36.780 --> 17:37.613
The world's collide.

17:37.613 --> 17:38.880
And so when you're in health,

17:38.880 --> 17:40.770
you start to connect these dots,

17:40.770 --> 17:43.860
you start to see how this should play with that,

17:43.860 --> 17:45.510
should play with this,

17:45.510 --> 17:48.720
or how it should and it never does,

17:48.720 --> 17:50.310
so you start to see the gaps as well.

17:50.310 --> 17:51.720
So I'd like to go down the line

17:51.720 --> 17:56.720
and hear what convergence you would like to see happen.

17:56.970 --> 17:59.070
Maybe it's something that you'd like to have somebody pitch

17:59.070 --> 18:02.670
to you and maybe you're seeing elements of it,

18:02.670 --> 18:03.750
maybe it hasn't happened yet,

18:03.750 --> 18:06.870
but how would you like to see the dots connected

18:06.870 --> 18:08.700
based off of some of the tech you're seeing here.

18:08.700 --> 18:09.810
David?

18:09.810 --> 18:12.360
<v ->Well, I mean, it's been a fascinating few days.</v>

18:12.360 --> 18:14.410
I mean, I had a chance to walk the floor.

18:15.390 --> 18:19.440
I mean, there was a lot of tech that's looking for a market.

18:19.440 --> 18:22.740
I was looking at the tech and saying, okay,

18:22.740 --> 18:25.000
how do we solve an existing problem

18:26.095 --> 18:27.360
that's in the healthcare system

18:27.360 --> 18:29.040
that, you know, we're trying to deal with?

18:29.040 --> 18:32.490
And being both a payer and a provider of care,

18:32.490 --> 18:34.410
we get to see both sides of the equation.

18:34.410 --> 18:37.440
And when it's out of balance, I mean, it can be devastating.

18:37.440 --> 18:42.440
So what I'm excited about was, you know, I truly believe

18:42.750 --> 18:44.520
that if we're going to get this right as a country,

18:44.520 --> 18:46.620
we're gonna have to innovate our way out.

18:46.620 --> 18:48.180
And the way that'll happen

18:48.180 --> 18:51.000
is by, you know, getting the smart people in the room

18:51.000 --> 18:53.910
and saying, these are the five problems

18:53.910 --> 18:56.700
that are most relevant that could make a difference,

18:56.700 --> 18:59.280
that could deal with, you know, the fakes

18:59.280 --> 19:02.400
and all the other stuff that we agree upon.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.490
And then what do you have in your tool chest that'll work?

19:05.490 --> 19:09.150
So I jokingly, for those of you who are a little bit older,

19:09.150 --> 19:12.510
if you remember "The Gong Show", you know,

19:12.510 --> 19:14.640
it was on television a few years ago.

19:14.640 --> 19:17.040
You know, we have run that several times

19:17.040 --> 19:19.920
where we invite anyone in who's got an innovative idea

19:19.920 --> 19:23.730
that improves care, improves outcomes,

19:23.730 --> 19:25.560
and that addresses affordability.

19:25.560 --> 19:28.713
And we'll listen to 'em and we'll try to find a way,

19:29.880 --> 19:31.890
you know, to pilot it.

19:31.890 --> 19:35.400
We're doing that with ambient listening for our clinicians.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.480
That's been a big space.

19:36.480 --> 19:39.360
So we had a bunch of things

19:39.360 --> 19:41.790
that we saw the last couple of days.

19:41.790 --> 19:44.730
Everything from sensors that they were using

19:44.730 --> 19:48.900
with the military to determine if a uniform was wet,

19:48.900 --> 19:50.733
was it blood or was it water?

19:51.810 --> 19:53.640
<v ->Remind me how many patients generally</v>

19:53.640 --> 19:55.770
your health system deals with.

19:55.770 --> 19:59.160
<v ->So we'll see about two and a half million patients a year.</v>

19:59.160 --> 19:59.993
<v ->Yeah.</v>

19:59.993 --> 20:01.590
I ask that because, you know, all the startups

20:01.590 --> 20:04.770
that I work with would love nothing better than to get in

20:04.770 --> 20:06.450
with a health system that would plug them

20:06.450 --> 20:09.055
into a big patient population.

20:09.055 --> 20:13.020
It's the, you know, million dollars sort of ticket.

20:13.020 --> 20:16.480
What are you looking for in an innovative startup

20:17.430 --> 20:19.380
that would show you that they're ready

20:19.380 --> 20:21.960
to take on a health system?

20:21.960 --> 20:25.440
<v ->Yeah, so typically, what we look for obviously</v>

20:25.440 --> 20:28.230
is we wanna make sure that, you know, the service,

20:28.230 --> 20:33.230
the product, the solution, you know, is sound and solid

20:33.390 --> 20:35.220
and stands up.

20:35.220 --> 20:38.477
We wanna be able to pilot it, you know,

20:38.477 --> 20:41.130
'cause we have 7 million lives that we insure,

20:41.130 --> 20:43.440
two and a half million patients that we see.

20:43.440 --> 20:47.010
And if we can take a device or whatever it might be,

20:47.010 --> 20:49.470
and, you know, one of our strengths is our ability

20:49.470 --> 20:52.380
to put it into the marketplace fairly quickly.

20:52.380 --> 20:56.280
But our objective is they all have to be scalable.

20:56.280 --> 20:58.800
So we don't wanna do it for 10 people.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.110
You know, we need to know that if this works,

21:01.110 --> 21:05.010
that we will approve it for payment and we will roll it out

21:05.010 --> 21:07.470
and make sure it's part of the formulary.

21:07.470 --> 21:08.700
<v ->Dr. Nevin, same question for you.</v>

21:08.700 --> 21:11.940
I'm particularly interested in your view on the home

21:11.940 --> 21:14.040
and care being extended into the home as well.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.870
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

21:15.870 --> 21:19.290
And I would just, again, I think David and I,

21:19.290 --> 21:20.490
we do have a partnership

21:20.490 --> 21:22.710
and we tend to agree on a lot of things.

21:22.710 --> 21:25.230
I agree with everything that you said.

21:25.230 --> 21:29.070
Yeah, I mean, I think my worry about all of this

21:29.070 --> 21:31.980
is you may know that traditional healthcare

21:31.980 --> 21:34.680
is not generally very adventurous.

21:34.680 --> 21:36.480
We tend to be very traditional.

21:36.480 --> 21:40.380
And I worry that we are going to sort of lose this moment

21:40.380 --> 21:44.160
in time because the technology opportunity,

21:44.160 --> 21:47.910
particularly I think with AI and generative AI

21:47.910 --> 21:50.760
to really solve for some of these big issues

21:50.760 --> 21:54.330
that we've struggled with for decades, the time is now.

21:54.330 --> 21:57.480
And so I think it is absolutely imperative

21:57.480 --> 22:01.530
that we work together and we work with these new companies,

22:01.530 --> 22:04.200
so that as they're creating their product,

22:04.200 --> 22:06.870
they can deeply understand the problems

22:06.870 --> 22:08.490
that we're trying to solve.

22:08.490 --> 22:13.110
I am a firm believer that the home

22:13.110 --> 22:17.190
can be a really important place for care.

22:17.190 --> 22:20.910
We have long had a primary care at home program

22:20.910 --> 22:23.340
for the frail list of the frail elderly.

22:23.340 --> 22:25.320
It gets excellent outcomes

22:25.320 --> 22:28.200
and it is significantly less expensive.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.270
It costs Medicare much less

22:30.270 --> 22:32.790
when we take care of patients that way.

22:32.790 --> 22:37.080
We more recently launched a hospital at home program

22:37.080 --> 22:39.000
using the CMS waiver.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.790
So patients who qualify for admission,

22:41.790 --> 22:44.250
an inpatient admission to the hospital

22:44.250 --> 22:46.410
can now be taken care of at home.

22:46.410 --> 22:49.950
And the technology that supports that, again,

22:49.950 --> 22:52.080
it's just has been tremendous.

22:52.080 --> 22:54.240
Patients absolutely love it.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.770
Families love it.

22:55.770 --> 22:59.400
It solves for some of the issues around equity, frankly,

22:59.400 --> 23:02.280
because it helps solve for culture and language

23:02.280 --> 23:04.590
and food and so forth.

23:04.590 --> 23:07.290
The quality outcomes exceed those

23:07.290 --> 23:09.750
in bricks and mortar setting.

23:09.750 --> 23:14.580
And again, we're still trying to better understand cost,

23:14.580 --> 23:17.490
but there is extremely promising.

23:17.490 --> 23:22.490
Again, it is a way that helps us get to more affordability.

23:23.190 --> 23:27.060
We recently launched essentially skilled nursing care

23:27.060 --> 23:27.893
in the home.

23:27.893 --> 23:30.990
And our vision is to be able to provide the continuum

23:30.990 --> 23:32.160
of care in the home.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.950
And again, to me, you know,

23:34.950 --> 23:38.340
pilots and dabbling are really important.

23:38.340 --> 23:41.550
I would love to see this happen at scale

23:41.550 --> 23:44.250
and not just at, you know, ChristianaCare

23:44.250 --> 23:47.700
and the I think 130 health systems that are doing this,

23:47.700 --> 23:50.670
but this becomes a different way of providing care.

23:50.670 --> 23:54.660
It's better, it's safer and it costs less.

23:54.660 --> 23:57.873
<v ->Michael, what tech convergence are you most excited about?</v>

23:59.310 --> 24:00.979
<v ->I'm excited about the timing.</v>

24:00.979 --> 24:03.630
So there's a tendency to think

24:03.630 --> 24:06.570
that everything we see is the first time in history.

24:06.570 --> 24:09.960
And there's this thing called the productivity paradox.

24:09.960 --> 24:11.370
That if you look at introductions

24:11.370 --> 24:13.650
of general purpose technologies, like if you go back

24:13.650 --> 24:17.940
to electricity, when factories got electricity,

24:17.940 --> 24:20.880
they didn't redesign the work, they replaced the water wheel

24:20.880 --> 24:22.230
with a big central motor.

24:22.230 --> 24:25.590
And it took 10, 15, 20 years to figure out

24:25.590 --> 24:28.950
that you could redesign the work around the new technology.

24:28.950 --> 24:30.540
Same thing happened in banking

24:30.540 --> 24:32.640
with the introduction of computers.

24:32.640 --> 24:37.500
It wasn't that ATMs appeared when computers first came in.

24:37.500 --> 24:41.400
Well, when did we first digitize US healthcare?

24:41.400 --> 24:42.720
10 to 15 years ago.

24:42.720 --> 24:47.010
And so from a historical standpoint, we're at the right time

24:47.010 --> 24:51.690
where you might expect to see care actually get redesigned.

24:51.690 --> 24:53.670
We certainly see that with partners like Highmark

24:53.670 --> 24:56.730
of doing these really leading edge things for it.

24:56.730 --> 25:01.290
And so I'm especially excited about the fact

25:01.290 --> 25:05.880
that the things that two years ago no lab in the world

25:05.880 --> 25:07.110
could do them.

25:07.110 --> 25:10.350
You know, nine months ago, we got it working, you know,

25:10.350 --> 25:12.300
nearly melting the research computers

25:12.300 --> 25:15.180
and now our partners can actually build on top of it

25:15.180 --> 25:18.570
in a way that changes who can design the final mile

25:18.570 --> 25:19.830
of technology.

25:19.830 --> 25:20.980
I'm excited about that.

25:22.020 --> 25:24.090
<v Logan>Diogo, over to you.</v>

25:24.090 --> 25:26.550
<v ->I'm excited just about bringing it all together</v>

25:26.550 --> 25:27.390
and what you can do.

25:27.390 --> 25:29.580
One of the reasons why I'm excited about that

25:29.580 --> 25:32.700
is because I'd like to get rid to the extent possible

25:32.700 --> 25:34.890
of patient reported outcomes.

25:34.890 --> 25:38.070
That's the endpoint of many clinical trials.

25:38.070 --> 25:42.510
It's how the patient feels versus some objective measure.

25:42.510 --> 25:44.520
And many of you that are healthcare providers

25:44.520 --> 25:46.260
will know some of these standards,

25:46.260 --> 25:48.450
like the six minute walk test,

25:48.450 --> 25:51.240
which measures how far can you walk in six minutes

25:51.240 --> 25:52.350
when you're in a doctor's office.

25:52.350 --> 25:53.250
Maybe you're having a good day,

25:53.250 --> 25:54.570
maybe you're having a bad day,

25:54.570 --> 25:56.610
but you're getting one point in time.

25:56.610 --> 25:57.990
Or if you wanna measure

25:57.990 --> 26:01.290
whether your medicine affects sleepiness

26:01.290 --> 26:03.060
or prevents daytime sleepiness,

26:03.060 --> 26:05.160
there's a thing called the Epworth Sleepiness score.

26:05.160 --> 26:08.160
You ask the patient once every few months,

26:08.160 --> 26:10.260
how often do you feel sleepy,

26:10.260 --> 26:12.780
or doing the following eight activities.

26:12.780 --> 26:14.640
And you get a single point in time.

26:14.640 --> 26:18.600
Why do we need to be doing that when we are in 2025 now?

26:18.600 --> 26:20.550
We're all wearing these on our wrists.

26:20.550 --> 26:23.280
Why do you need to have somebody do a six minute walk

26:23.280 --> 26:26.220
in the doctor's office instead of taking in all of that data

26:26.220 --> 26:27.810
over the past six months?

26:27.810 --> 26:30.090
We've actually done that in some of our studies.

26:30.090 --> 26:33.930
We've added on actigraphy in the middle of a study

26:33.930 --> 26:35.610
that still had a patient reported outcome

26:35.610 --> 26:37.920
'cause that's what the regulators like to see.

26:37.920 --> 26:41.820
And we've seen that, wow, you can get so much richer data,

26:41.820 --> 26:44.864
you can find out that not only is the person walking

26:44.864 --> 26:48.660
and awake during the day, but they're actually active

26:48.660 --> 26:50.370
and they're doing better on the medicine.

26:50.370 --> 26:54.060
You can get much, much, much richer data

26:54.060 --> 26:55.530
if you bring it all together

26:55.530 --> 26:57.150
and you look at it holistically.

26:57.150 --> 26:59.670
So I would just like to bring all of this data together,

26:59.670 --> 27:01.620
converge everything, take a look at it,

27:01.620 --> 27:02.820
let the machines do the work,

27:02.820 --> 27:04.710
let the machines do the interpretation

27:04.710 --> 27:06.240
and get ourselves out of the business

27:06.240 --> 27:09.030
of looking at single data points spaced weeks

27:09.030 --> 27:10.143
or months apart.

27:11.220 --> 27:14.090
<v ->I've got a follow up that I wanna ask</v>

27:14.090 --> 27:16.350
to the whole group and whoever wants to jump in,

27:16.350 --> 27:18.360
it's really about taking action.

27:18.360 --> 27:21.630
Dr. Nevin, you'd said you don't wanna miss this opportunity

27:21.630 --> 27:23.580
and that we're at a specific moment in time.

27:23.580 --> 27:25.050
I couldn't agree with you more.

27:25.050 --> 27:27.090
And we've got a room full of people

27:27.090 --> 27:29.580
who can be change makers

27:29.580 --> 27:32.910
who can really take action in their sphere of influence.

27:32.910 --> 27:34.860
And so I want someone from this group

27:34.860 --> 27:38.310
or multiple people to make a recommendation

27:38.310 --> 27:40.983
about how we can make sure we don't miss this moment.

27:43.560 --> 27:45.720
<v ->I mean, I think it goes to what we've discussed</v>

27:45.720 --> 27:48.480
is we really have to work together.

27:48.480 --> 27:52.380
You know, healthcare is extremely complex

27:52.380 --> 27:56.580
and I know we've probably all had the experience

27:56.580 --> 28:01.260
of, you know, a great piece of technology has been created,

28:01.260 --> 28:04.200
but no one has really thought about how it's going

28:04.200 --> 28:07.560
to function inside the health system.

28:07.560 --> 28:11.670
And we have got to work together.

28:11.670 --> 28:14.010
You know, I think one of David mentioned

28:14.010 --> 28:15.180
that we have a partnership,

28:15.180 --> 28:17.880
we have a very unique joint venture

28:17.880 --> 28:19.590
between our two organizations.

28:19.590 --> 28:21.633
We do not have an insurance arm.

28:22.560 --> 28:26.220
And we both organizations believe we need

28:26.220 --> 28:27.990
to change care delivery.

28:27.990 --> 28:30.480
We need at the same time the opportunities

28:30.480 --> 28:32.820
to change how it gets paid for.

28:32.820 --> 28:35.220
And because we are having those conversations,

28:35.220 --> 28:39.600
we're also talking about how can we then use technology

28:39.600 --> 28:44.220
to solve for some of those vexing issues

28:44.220 --> 28:47.520
that get in the way of being able to do that.

28:47.520 --> 28:51.090
Having technology partners in that conversation

28:51.090 --> 28:53.220
and early in that conversation

28:53.220 --> 28:56.070
is ultimately gonna be the most helpful.

28:56.070 --> 28:59.700
<v ->David, your thoughts on encouraging collaboration</v>

28:59.700 --> 29:03.540
in this environment that is naturally build silos?

29:03.540 --> 29:05.940
<v ->Well, I think at least my experience</v>

29:05.940 --> 29:10.940
has been that when you have your incentives aligned,

29:12.240 --> 29:13.650
you have your metrics aligned.

29:13.650 --> 29:15.060
I mean it really is a three-legged stool.

29:15.060 --> 29:17.190
What you measure, you know, what you evaluate,

29:17.190 --> 29:21.000
and what you compensate for ultimately changes.

29:21.000 --> 29:26.000
And I mean, you know, Lily and Highmark and a HN

29:26.580 --> 29:28.680
in Western Pennsylvania, you know, prove

29:28.680 --> 29:31.460
that during the pandemic where we were able, you know,

29:31.460 --> 29:35.190
to put shots in arms for 650,000 people

29:35.190 --> 29:37.563
and stem the tide during the pandemic.

29:39.068 --> 29:40.110
And what that took

29:40.110 --> 29:44.130
was everybody taking themselves back one step, you know,

29:44.130 --> 29:46.710
all the A personalities and instead say,

29:46.710 --> 29:47.760
what are we solving for?

29:47.760 --> 29:49.740
How do we get this done and let's go?

29:49.740 --> 29:52.350
And, you know, I think Janice, just the work

29:52.350 --> 29:55.233
that we're doing in Delaware together,

29:56.070 --> 29:59.190
the thing that we've eliminated, it's full risk,

29:59.190 --> 30:00.720
up and downside risk.

30:00.720 --> 30:04.740
And so when her docs are saying, no, this isn't what works,

30:04.740 --> 30:07.320
you know, we're changing medical policy

30:07.320 --> 30:08.790
and we're trying to address that

30:08.790 --> 30:11.310
or we're showing things that are working in other markets

30:11.310 --> 30:12.480
that they might wanna consider.

30:12.480 --> 30:13.313
<v Logan>Yeah.</v>

30:13.313 --> 30:15.570
<v ->Can I take a dissenting view to part of it?</v>

30:15.570 --> 30:17.070
Or maybe a caution.

30:17.070 --> 30:19.470
I think there are a lot of great examples of collaboration

30:19.470 --> 30:22.080
like between Highmark and Lily that you mentioned,

30:22.080 --> 30:25.380
but there are also some really bad examples of collaboration

30:25.380 --> 30:27.783
where it's had tragic consequences.

30:29.310 --> 30:32.340
Anybody here want to see greater collaboration

30:32.340 --> 30:35.433
between insurers and pharmacy benefit managers?

30:36.660 --> 30:41.340
I hope not because guess who gets screwed if that happens?

30:41.340 --> 30:43.230
We all do, right?

30:43.230 --> 30:46.380
There has been a lot of collaboration in this industry

30:46.380 --> 30:49.950
that has worked against consumers, not for consumers.

30:49.950 --> 30:52.800
In fact, one of the things I only recently discovered

30:52.800 --> 30:55.980
is that 80% of the cost of your medicine

30:55.980 --> 30:57.480
when you buy medicines,

30:57.480 --> 31:02.100
the total cost is actually not going to the manufacturers.

31:02.100 --> 31:03.960
You know, maybe if it were 8%,

31:03.960 --> 31:05.070
you could kind of understand it,

31:05.070 --> 31:07.200
an 8% commission on any other product you buy.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.420
But 80, 80 is crazy.

31:09.420 --> 31:12.360
So there has been all of this collusion,

31:12.360 --> 31:14.910
this excessive collaboration I would say

31:14.910 --> 31:18.330
that happens downstream at the expense of the consumer.

31:18.330 --> 31:22.620
So I think we need excellent collaboration in certain parts.

31:22.620 --> 31:25.200
We want great collaboration on the discovery side

31:25.200 --> 31:27.240
and clinical trials and things like that.

31:27.240 --> 31:28.740
But on the consumer side,

31:28.740 --> 31:31.080
I'm not so sure I wanna see more collaboration.

31:31.080 --> 31:32.970
I wanna see more competition there

31:32.970 --> 31:34.950
to help bring down the cost of medicines

31:34.950 --> 31:36.363
and the cost of healthcare.

31:37.303 --> 31:40.303
(audience clapping)

31:42.300 --> 31:44.850
<v ->I think an interesting topic for this panel as well</v>

31:44.850 --> 31:48.240
is just as we look at the incredible increase

31:48.240 --> 31:50.700
in the amount of data that we have available,

31:50.700 --> 31:54.390
these streams of data coming in, we have both opportunity

31:54.390 --> 31:59.160
and risk when we think about drug discovery on one end

31:59.160 --> 32:01.560
and on the other, provider burnout

32:01.560 --> 32:05.910
and click fatigue, alarm fatigue.

32:05.910 --> 32:08.940
And so I'd love to hear kind of where you feel like we're at

32:08.940 --> 32:11.250
in terms of the opportunities and threats

32:11.250 --> 32:12.870
of managing the amount of data

32:12.870 --> 32:14.130
that's coming into the system.

32:14.130 --> 32:16.930
Maybe, Michael, you could start and we'll go from there.

32:19.740 --> 32:23.310
<v ->I have mixed feelings about this.</v>

32:23.310 --> 32:26.787
So number one is it's...

32:26.787 --> 32:29.580
And you asked sort of for people in the room

32:29.580 --> 32:32.610
and I don't know everyone in the room, that's for sure.

32:32.610 --> 32:35.100
You know, what are the things to think about?

32:35.100 --> 32:39.360
One is to respect the complexity of care delivery.

32:39.360 --> 32:41.010
And so I'll give an example

32:41.010 --> 32:44.880
of if you have a 500 bed hospital,

32:44.880 --> 32:48.510
you might have 2,000 nurses to staff of 500 bed hospital,

32:48.510 --> 32:50.040
maybe 1,500.

32:50.040 --> 32:51.480
Before you start applying rules,

32:51.480 --> 32:52.740
how many options are there

32:52.740 --> 32:54.513
for your staffing choices tomorrow?

32:55.710 --> 32:57.690
Well, the number is larger than the number of atoms

32:57.690 --> 32:59.910
in the observed universe.

32:59.910 --> 33:00.743
Okay.

33:00.743 --> 33:03.420
Like that's a problem we've had since the inception

33:03.420 --> 33:08.420
of hospitals and that we've had those data for a long time.

33:09.240 --> 33:11.880
We now have techniques that may be able to help with them.

33:11.880 --> 33:13.860
And so one of the things that we think about

33:13.860 --> 33:15.900
is what can we learn from other industries

33:15.900 --> 33:17.730
that may be useful for healthcare.

33:17.730 --> 33:21.180
So supply chain optimization is something

33:21.180 --> 33:24.690
that many organizations outside of healthcare

33:24.690 --> 33:26.160
are really good at

33:26.160 --> 33:28.830
and we have lots of technology to support.

33:28.830 --> 33:31.830
So we're things like scheduling and optimization

33:31.830 --> 33:34.380
of the most important resources that you have,

33:34.380 --> 33:36.630
which is your burned out clinicians, right?

33:36.630 --> 33:39.063
So one are things like that.

33:39.900 --> 33:43.290
The second thing that I would say is that, again,

33:43.290 --> 33:45.810
you know, patient-centered care doesn't care

33:45.810 --> 33:48.900
where the patient is, would be...

33:48.900 --> 33:51.930
You know, your question before

33:51.930 --> 33:54.750
posited that there has been no convergence,

33:54.750 --> 33:59.250
but if I asked this room, you know, who's been to the doctor

33:59.250 --> 34:02.790
and then who when you went home googled up

34:02.790 --> 34:04.990
what the doctor told you to double check it,

34:06.690 --> 34:09.300
like a lot of people would raise their hand for that, right?

34:09.300 --> 34:11.820
Or like, you know, haven't helped you

34:11.820 --> 34:13.770
if you had to switch primary care doctors

34:13.770 --> 34:16.170
and you try to find a new primary care doctor

34:16.170 --> 34:19.680
who's used the internet to try to help you do that.

34:19.680 --> 34:21.180
Everybody would raise their hand, right?

34:21.180 --> 34:23.730
The data would say 70% of people.

34:23.730 --> 34:24.870
And if I asked the same question

34:24.870 --> 34:28.380
of who's used, you know, Gemini or Claude or ChatGPT,

34:28.380 --> 34:29.700
a lot of people would raise their hints now

34:29.700 --> 34:31.890
who a year ago would not have.

34:31.890 --> 34:36.390
So I think we are seeing that convergence

34:36.390 --> 34:39.030
without the traditional healthcare system.

34:39.030 --> 34:40.950
And what we're hopeful for

34:40.950 --> 34:43.890
is that by making the tooling available

34:43.890 --> 34:48.890
for healthcare delivery groups, healthcare payers,

34:51.210 --> 34:53.790
medicine and device manufacturers

34:53.790 --> 34:58.790
that will be able to accelerate by us doing 85% of the work

34:58.920 --> 35:00.870
that you have to do and the 15% being done

35:00.870 --> 35:02.880
by the people who are expert in it.

35:02.880 --> 35:05.590
<v ->David, to you, how are you balancing</v>

35:06.600 --> 35:08.910
just all of this data coming in, the power of it,

35:08.910 --> 35:10.080
making the most of it,

35:10.080 --> 35:12.750
while still thinking about just the mental health

35:12.750 --> 35:14.580
and wellbeing of your providers

35:14.580 --> 35:16.410
as they manage that at the bedside?

35:16.410 --> 35:18.240
<v ->Yeah, I mean, I would say a couple of things.</v>

35:18.240 --> 35:19.620
First of all, there's a gentleman named Richard Clark

35:19.620 --> 35:22.350
in the audience, who heads up our data analytics,

35:22.350 --> 35:24.120
came out of Carnegie Mellon.

35:24.120 --> 35:25.650
You know, we went out and we found a bunch

35:25.650 --> 35:26.940
of smart people at Carnegie Mellon

35:26.940 --> 35:28.860
who knew nothing about healthcare.

35:28.860 --> 35:33.570
And then we said, how can you help us take this information,

35:33.570 --> 35:37.590
all this knowledge, both on terms of clinical data,

35:37.590 --> 35:41.520
claims data and unstructured data, you know, the devices,

35:41.520 --> 35:43.650
et cetera, and do something with it.

35:43.650 --> 35:45.000
So we partnered with Google

35:45.000 --> 35:47.880
and said, you know, we need your help

35:47.880 --> 35:50.910
on how do we, you know, build the big engine.

35:50.910 --> 35:53.490
And, you know, we're challenging our people

35:53.490 --> 35:58.410
to then take all that complex information and simplify it.

35:58.410 --> 36:01.740
So going back to my, you know, retail roots.

36:01.740 --> 36:03.570
In retail, when you talk to somebody,

36:03.570 --> 36:05.490
a salesperson in a store, you know,

36:05.490 --> 36:06.930
if you ask them to do something,

36:06.930 --> 36:08.550
you need to understand that you have to write

36:08.550 --> 36:11.280
in a language that allows them to start working

36:11.280 --> 36:14.340
on the project or read it, put it down, go help a customer,

36:14.340 --> 36:17.190
then come back to it in five minutes and pick it back up.

36:17.190 --> 36:21.450
So if you write in paragraphs, people don't pay attention.

36:21.450 --> 36:25.080
If you write, you know, in bullet points,

36:25.080 --> 36:26.700
you can get things done.

36:26.700 --> 36:29.190
We're doing the same thing with everything that we're doing.

36:29.190 --> 36:31.980
You know, we're using the data

36:31.980 --> 36:35.400
and then we're using journey maps, consumer journey maps

36:35.400 --> 36:37.830
for different disease states, cancer, you know,

36:37.830 --> 36:39.600
heart disease, whatever it might be.

36:39.600 --> 36:43.470
And we're trying to make it so that the average person

36:43.470 --> 36:45.510
can understand it, and we're making it so

36:45.510 --> 36:50.100
that it's in a format that the average clinician, you know,

36:50.100 --> 36:54.207
who's, you know, got alert fatigue can deal with it.

36:54.207 --> 36:56.040
And we're also using ambient listening

36:56.040 --> 36:58.170
and, you know, all those kinds of things, you know,

36:58.170 --> 37:01.533
so that we end the days of our docs doing pajama notes.

37:02.520 --> 37:04.260
<v ->A little different spin on this question for you,</v>

37:04.260 --> 37:05.250
Dr. Nevin.

37:05.250 --> 37:06.870
I felt like when I walked the floor,

37:06.870 --> 37:10.890
there was a lack of innovation in provider care,

37:10.890 --> 37:13.050
just thinking about the provider workflow

37:13.050 --> 37:15.100
and there's a number of reasons for that.

37:16.080 --> 37:19.110
How do you think about the kind of programs

37:19.110 --> 37:20.700
that you want to roll out

37:20.700 --> 37:25.320
that help providers manage technology and data

37:25.320 --> 37:26.153
as it comes in?

37:26.153 --> 37:29.580
<v ->Yes, I think there was a strong focus on the consumer,</v>

37:29.580 --> 37:31.680
which is great, you know.

37:31.680 --> 37:33.720
Yeah, so I'll maybe just talk a little bit

37:33.720 --> 37:35.703
about how we're thinking about AI.

37:36.630 --> 37:39.990
You know, I think, again, sort of how...

37:39.990 --> 37:41.850
We've been using AI for a long time.

37:41.850 --> 37:46.020
We have, I think since 2012, have had a platform

37:46.020 --> 37:49.680
that's now called CareVio that ingests data,

37:49.680 --> 37:53.850
applies machine learning, generates risk scores,

37:53.850 --> 37:58.020
and allows a care team essentially to manage a population

37:58.020 --> 38:01.620
of patients in an asynchronous fashion

38:01.620 --> 38:06.620
and also reach out to them if they see rising risk.

38:06.930 --> 38:10.830
So we've been in this space for a while,

38:10.830 --> 38:13.230
but obviously the new tools bring with them

38:13.230 --> 38:14.730
some additional risks.

38:14.730 --> 38:15.780
So it was very important

38:15.780 --> 38:17.520
that we created a governance structure

38:17.520 --> 38:20.610
inside the health system so it didn't become the wild west,

38:20.610 --> 38:23.313
because, again, we're dealing with people's lives.

38:24.364 --> 38:27.000
And the data question is a great question.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.480
You know, we generate tons and tons of data.

38:30.480 --> 38:33.720
The challenge is how do we use it effectively

38:33.720 --> 38:37.530
for the purposes of AI and using data for AI,

38:37.530 --> 38:40.320
we are keeping our data, our data,

38:40.320 --> 38:42.190
we have not sort of pulled in data

38:43.351 --> 38:45.240
from the internet again,

38:45.240 --> 38:48.060
because we have to be certain that the data

38:48.060 --> 38:51.240
that we are using is evidence-based data.

38:51.240 --> 38:54.150
So when we're applying analytics and using it,

38:54.150 --> 38:55.440
we have confidence

38:55.440 --> 38:58.530
that we're gonna get the right outcomes.

38:58.530 --> 39:00.630
And, of course, we always have to be concerned

39:00.630 --> 39:02.010
about privacy.

39:02.010 --> 39:03.090
<v ->Awesome.</v>

39:03.090 --> 39:04.140
One closing question.

39:04.140 --> 39:06.810
I wanna give each of you a chance to respond

39:06.810 --> 39:09.153
as a sort of just a last thought.

39:10.080 --> 39:11.580
If we were to come back 10 years from now

39:11.580 --> 39:13.080
and have a reunion panel

39:13.080 --> 39:16.290
and talk about all the things that we have worked on,

39:16.290 --> 39:18.330
what's one advancement that you hope

39:18.330 --> 39:20.580
that we would be celebrating on that panel?

39:20.580 --> 39:21.990
We'll start with Diogo.

39:21.990 --> 39:24.180
And as a little bit of a wild card question there.

39:24.180 --> 39:26.190
So what do you think.

39:26.190 --> 39:27.023
<v ->It is.</v>

39:27.023 --> 39:30.000
I would like to see some breakthrough medicines out there.

39:30.000 --> 39:34.080
I think we need to focus a lot more on prevention

39:34.080 --> 39:35.430
rather than treatment.

39:35.430 --> 39:38.220
If I walk into an emergency room right now,

39:38.220 --> 39:40.410
I'm gonna pay about 3% out of pocket.

39:40.410 --> 39:42.780
If I go to buy a medicine right now,

39:42.780 --> 39:44.670
I'm gonna pay 20% out of pocket.

39:44.670 --> 39:46.890
These perverted economics drive people

39:46.890 --> 39:49.830
to avoid preventing treatment

39:49.830 --> 39:53.220
and going and getting it when they need it later.

39:53.220 --> 39:54.177
And we need to stop that.

39:54.177 --> 39:58.890
And I would like to see more medicines that are cheaper,

39:58.890 --> 40:00.840
more available for everyone

40:00.840 --> 40:02.760
so that people don't have to go to the hospital

40:02.760 --> 40:04.510
unless they really, really need to.

40:05.472 --> 40:07.200
<v Logan>Dr. Howell.</v>

40:07.200 --> 40:08.500
<v ->10 years is a long time.</v>

40:09.583 --> 40:12.390
I think we'll see medicines that have been discovered

40:12.390 --> 40:16.140
that cure things that we think are incurable today

40:16.140 --> 40:19.113
or require mechanical support today.

40:20.130 --> 40:23.310
I am hopeful that we'll see the democratization

40:23.310 --> 40:27.270
of expertise in a way that makes that number

40:27.270 --> 40:29.760
of 4.5 billion people who don't have access

40:29.760 --> 40:33.240
to essential health services much smaller.

40:33.240 --> 40:34.950
And I think technology is the only way to get there.

40:34.950 --> 40:38.640
And so I'm hopeful for the first time in my career

40:38.640 --> 40:42.180
that technology may play out in a way that leads to billions

40:42.180 --> 40:44.230
of healthier people on a planetary scale.

40:45.720 --> 40:48.810
<v ->10 years from now, I will have closed hospital beds.</v>

40:48.810 --> 40:53.280
The hospital will be purely for intensive care,

40:53.280 --> 40:55.320
high tech procedures,

40:55.320 --> 40:57.870
a place where women will deliver babies.

40:57.870 --> 40:59.610
And I'm able to do that

40:59.610 --> 41:02.880
because so much of the care is moved into the community,

41:02.880 --> 41:05.640
the home into ambulatory settings.

41:05.640 --> 41:08.730
You know, a lot of primary care can be done with AI.

41:08.730 --> 41:11.493
And so 10 years from now,

41:13.020 --> 41:16.380
we've got healthier communities, healthier people,

41:16.380 --> 41:21.210
we're managing chronic disease so much more effectively

41:21.210 --> 41:24.150
that I can shrink those acute care services.

41:24.150 --> 41:25.320
<v Logan>Last word, David.</v>

41:25.320 --> 41:26.820
<v ->You know, 10 years from now,</v>

41:26.820 --> 41:30.030
I think we will have, you know, made a big impact

41:30.030 --> 41:31.350
on chronic disease.

41:31.350 --> 41:32.520
I truly believe that.

41:32.520 --> 41:35.190
I think the innovation that's available to us,

41:35.190 --> 41:38.610
but more importantly, using artificial intelligence

41:38.610 --> 41:41.490
and the computing power that is in front of us

41:41.490 --> 41:43.230
over the next decade,

41:43.230 --> 41:46.677
I think can really knock down some serious issues.

41:46.677 --> 41:48.660
And I think we gotta get away from sick care

41:48.660 --> 41:52.020
and start focusing on, you know, being upstream

41:52.020 --> 41:54.720
and really helping people stay healthy

41:54.720 --> 41:56.280
and give them the information

41:56.280 --> 41:58.740
that will allow them to do that.

41:58.740 --> 42:02.340
<v ->Well, 2035, it's both a long time and a short time,</v>

42:02.340 --> 42:04.950
so maybe we'll be back here to talk about it.

42:04.950 --> 42:06.180
So thank you, everybody.

42:06.180 --> 42:07.830
Thank you, panelists, for taking the time

42:07.830 --> 42:10.858
and thank you everybody for taking part in panel.

42:10.858 --> 42:13.146
(audience clapping)

42:13.146 --> 42:16.063
(electronic music)
