00:00.339 --> 00:03.506
(light upbeat music)

2
00:10.830 --> 00:12.270
<v ->Please welcome the President</v>

3
00:12.270 --> 00:16.231
of the Consumer Technology Association, Kinsey Fabrizio.

4
00:16.231 --> 00:21.231
(light upbeat music)
(audience cheering)

5
00:25.710 --> 00:29.760
<v ->Welcome to CES 2025.</v>

6
00:29.760 --> 00:34.560
Transportation plays an important role in all of our lives,

7
00:34.560 --> 00:38.940
but it's not just about getting from point A to point B.

8
00:38.940 --> 00:41.730
Transportation is what connects us.

9
00:41.730 --> 00:46.710
It's how we reach new destinations and build new skylines.

10
00:46.710 --> 00:48.360
And as the world accelerates

11
00:48.360 --> 00:50.940
towards a smarter, greener future,

12
00:50.940 --> 00:53.970
transportation can help us get there.

13
00:53.970 --> 00:56.880
That's thanks to the leadership of companies

14
00:56.880 --> 00:58.260
like Volvo Group,

15
00:58.260 --> 01:01.650
which has been pushing boundaries in transportation

16
01:01.650 --> 01:06.480
and infrastructure for nearly 100 years.

17
01:06.480 --> 01:09.870
Volvo is setting the benchmark in electrification,

18
01:09.870 --> 01:14.310
automation and connectivity, and transforming how people

19
01:14.310 --> 01:17.910
and goods move across the world.

20
01:17.910 --> 01:22.410
Volvo's investments aren't just moving technology forward,

21
01:22.410 --> 01:26.250
they're also making mobility more secure with innovations

22
01:26.250 --> 01:29.850
from the world's first three point safety belt

23
01:29.850 --> 01:32.880
to cutting edge autonomous safety features

24
01:32.880 --> 01:34.863
like adaptive cruises control.

25
01:35.730 --> 01:39.030
Under Volvo President and CEO Martin Lundstedt,

26
01:39.030 --> 01:43.620
Volvo also succeeds thanks to its dynamic partnerships

27
01:43.620 --> 01:46.920
and collaboration across industries.

28
01:46.920 --> 01:48.697
And as Martin likes to say,

29
01:48.697 --> 01:51.270
"Partnership is the new leadership."

30
01:51.270 --> 01:52.380
I love that.

31
01:52.380 --> 01:55.290
And Volvo's partnerships have made the company

32
01:55.290 --> 01:58.473
bold, innovative, and inclusive.

33
01:59.370 --> 02:02.070
Over nearly a decade leading Volvo,

34
02:02.070 --> 02:06.510
Martin has advanced ambitious innovation roadmaps

35
02:06.510 --> 02:09.840
alongside a commitment to sustainability

36
02:09.840 --> 02:14.190
and decarbonization that meets society's need for cleaner,

37
02:14.190 --> 02:18.660
smarter, and more efficient transportation systems.

38
02:18.660 --> 02:22.920
Today, Martin will share his vision for innovation

39
02:22.920 --> 02:27.240
that's redefining the future of sustainable mobility

40
02:27.240 --> 02:30.630
and technology and improving lives of people

41
02:30.630 --> 02:32.700
across the globe.

42
02:32.700 --> 02:35.220
I am so excited for this keynote,

43
02:35.220 --> 02:37.830
so please join me in welcoming

44
02:37.830 --> 02:41.853
Volvo Group's CEO, Martin Lundstedt.

45
02:41.853 --> 02:44.810
(audience cheering)

46
02:44.810 --> 02:48.707
(upbeat techno music)

47
02:48.707 --> 02:50.507
<v ->Thank you, Kinsey,</v>

48
02:50.507 --> 02:54.359
Thank you very much. Thank you for having us.

49
02:54.359 --> 02:57.141
Good morning, CES.
<v Audience>Morning.</v>

50
02:57.141 --> 03:00.477
<v ->Good morning CES lovers.</v>
<v Audience>Good morning.</v>

51
03:00.477 --> 03:04.080
<v ->And welcome also to everyone watching online,</v>

52
03:04.080 --> 03:05.970
customers and business partners

53
03:05.970 --> 03:09.723
and family and friends around the globe.

54
03:10.740 --> 03:15.150
It's just fantastic to see so many of you here today,

55
03:15.150 --> 03:18.000
so many that are inspired by technology and innovation

56
03:18.000 --> 03:22.710
and how that can be leveraged to build a better tomorrow.

57
03:22.710 --> 03:25.740
And it's great for us also to be here in the United States

58
03:25.740 --> 03:30.120
where we have such a long and strong history.

59
03:30.120 --> 03:32.880
Volvo trucks has been present here

60
03:32.880 --> 03:35.010
for more than four decades,

61
03:35.010 --> 03:39.510
and another of our iconic brands, Mack trucks,

62
03:39.510 --> 03:43.710
who literally built the United States,

63
03:43.710 --> 03:47.400
is turning 125 years this year.

64
03:47.400 --> 03:50.910
Isn't that fantastic, right?
(audience clapping)

65
03:50.910 --> 03:52.000
And I can tell you

66
03:54.240 --> 03:56.520
that there will be great news coming along this year

67
03:56.520 --> 03:57.900
for Mack trucks.

68
03:57.900 --> 04:00.660
And we are investing more than ever in the United States.

69
04:00.660 --> 04:04.380
Over the last years, we have invested billions of dollars

70
04:04.380 --> 04:05.820
in our industrial footprint,

71
04:05.820 --> 04:09.810
but also in cutting edge new technology

72
04:09.810 --> 04:13.020
by and for our customers and colleagues

73
04:13.020 --> 04:15.573
and North American ecosystem.

74
04:16.410 --> 04:19.480
We are one of the largest producers of trucks

75
04:20.411 --> 04:24.240
or buses of construction equipment, of drive trains,

76
04:24.240 --> 04:26.763
propulsion systems in the world.

77
04:27.600 --> 04:29.943
And why are we here at the CES?

78
04:31.080 --> 04:34.230
Because you might not think about it all that much,

79
04:34.230 --> 04:36.540
but transport and logistics

80
04:36.540 --> 04:39.720
is what makes modern life possible.

81
04:39.720 --> 04:42.870
And at the Volvo Group, we are using technology to innovate

82
04:42.870 --> 04:45.450
and transform the very foundation

83
04:45.450 --> 04:47.013
of the transportation industry.

84
04:47.910 --> 04:49.590
And with our scale,

85
04:49.590 --> 04:53.640
what we do has a major impact across the globe.

86
04:53.640 --> 04:56.700
And the current transport and logistics transformation

87
04:56.700 --> 05:00.420
is about shaping the world we want to live in

88
05:00.420 --> 05:03.180
and also for future generations.

89
05:03.180 --> 05:07.590
So friends, let's have a look at who we really are.

90
05:07.590 --> 05:09.058
Get started.

91
05:09.058 --> 05:11.641

99
05:56.204 --> 05:57.371
<v ->But what if?</v>

100
05:59.599 --> 06:02.373
But what if we were not here?

101
06:08.700 --> 06:11.583
Then society would rapidly shut down.

102
06:12.570 --> 06:15.180
Hospitals would lack medical equipment

103
06:15.180 --> 06:17.433
and grocery stores would be street bare,

104
06:18.450 --> 06:22.413
garbage would be piled outside your and my home.

105
06:23.370 --> 06:27.510
That is how important transport

106
06:27.510 --> 06:31.890
and logistics is for society, for business and for people.

107
06:31.890 --> 06:36.270
It is literally the lifeblood that drives prosperity

108
06:36.270 --> 06:41.073
and that's why we work tirelessly to keep the lights on.

109
06:44.520 --> 06:47.130
Thriving societies are built on transport

110
06:47.130 --> 06:49.110
and infrastructure solutions.

111
06:49.110 --> 06:51.150
Take United States as an example,

112
06:51.150 --> 06:55.320
more than 70% of all goods used in our daily lives

113
06:55.320 --> 06:59.610
from food to manufactured goods are transported

114
06:59.610 --> 07:03.543
to our stores, to plants and to our homes by trucks.

115
07:04.380 --> 07:07.050
Transport is not just about moving people

116
07:07.050 --> 07:09.630
or goods from one place to another,

117
07:09.630 --> 07:12.450
it binds us together, fuels our economy

118
07:12.450 --> 07:16.893
and enriches our life and in society in countless ways.

119
07:17.850 --> 07:20.550
And the demand for transport is growing,

120
07:20.550 --> 07:25.550
driven by trends like growing middle class, e-commerce,

121
07:26.400 --> 07:30.090
mass customization, urbanization.

122
07:30.090 --> 07:33.120
As a matter of fact, freight volumes are expected

123
07:33.120 --> 07:35.790
to grow by five times

124
07:35.790 --> 07:39.753
between 2010 and 2050.

125
07:41.250 --> 07:45.360
The wealth creation is the key driver to why logistics,

126
07:45.360 --> 07:47.640
transport and infrastructure development

127
07:47.640 --> 07:50.010
exists in the first place.

128
07:50.010 --> 07:54.630
The rule is as simple as it is important,

129
07:54.630 --> 07:58.710
the more advanced logistics a country

130
07:58.710 --> 08:03.093
or a region has, the higher GDP per capita.

131
08:04.080 --> 08:05.343
It is a straight line.

132
08:06.270 --> 08:09.540
But with transport comes also negative side effects

133
08:09.540 --> 08:12.300
such as climate impact,

134
08:12.300 --> 08:15.213
pollution, congestion, noise.

135
08:16.110 --> 08:20.730
We have improved those a lot over the last many years,

136
08:20.730 --> 08:23.973
but there is still a lot to continue to address.

137
08:24.930 --> 08:26.760
The transformation to a fossil-free

138
08:26.760 --> 08:30.280
and a safe transport system is happening to turn

139
08:31.440 --> 08:35.460
the red side effects into green opportunities

140
08:35.460 --> 08:38.220
and it will be a bumpy road.

141
08:38.220 --> 08:40.863
It'll take some time, but it'll happen.

142
08:42.240 --> 08:46.830
It'll happen because everyone that is involved,

143
08:46.830 --> 08:47.940
it makes sense for them.

144
08:47.940 --> 08:50.730
And because so many companies and societies

145
08:50.730 --> 08:54.030
across the globe really want to see those changes.

146
08:54.030 --> 08:56.520
The transformation will lead

147
08:56.520 --> 09:00.663
to new level of prosperity and sustainability for real.

148
09:02.104 --> 09:03.600
And the companies and people

149
09:03.600 --> 09:06.690
that can make it happen will get rewarded.

150
09:06.690 --> 09:09.693
They will get rewarded with high levels of growth.

151
09:11.160 --> 09:12.600
To us in the Volvo group,

152
09:12.600 --> 09:16.740
driving prosperity is about providing solutions

153
09:16.740 --> 09:20.850
that make modern life work here and now,

154
09:20.850 --> 09:23.220
while at the same time tirelessly

155
09:23.220 --> 09:24.930
to improve solutions

156
09:24.930 --> 09:28.020
and deliver new ones to shape also the world

157
09:28.020 --> 09:30.213
that we want to live in tomorrow.

158
09:31.260 --> 09:34.320
Emissions from supply and distribution chains

159
09:34.320 --> 09:39.320
account for almost 87% of big companies emissions.

160
09:40.590 --> 09:42.870
Because of this, companies must work

161
09:42.870 --> 09:47.703
with partners they trust to address their carbon footprint.

162
09:48.540 --> 09:52.890
And that is where companies like us, where we come in,

163
09:52.890 --> 09:56.160
by being first movers leading the tech shift

164
09:56.160 --> 09:58.620
and creating advanced value chains,

165
09:58.620 --> 10:00.930
we can help our customers address this

166
10:00.930 --> 10:03.303
transformation step by step.

167
10:05.100 --> 10:08.010
However, creating the complete ecosystem

168
10:08.010 --> 10:10.800
for fossil-free transport is not something

169
10:10.800 --> 10:13.380
that any one company can do alone.

170
10:13.380 --> 10:15.390
We need to partner up.

171
10:15.390 --> 10:18.000
Big companies and startups,

172
10:18.000 --> 10:20.580
government and private sector,

173
10:20.580 --> 10:23.790
truck producers and transport companies,

174
10:23.790 --> 10:27.180
transport buyers and consumers of goods.

175
10:27.180 --> 10:29.640
Including all of you in this room,

176
10:29.640 --> 10:31.263
all of you watching online,

177
10:32.250 --> 10:35.370
partnership is truly the new leadership.

178
10:35.370 --> 10:37.680
And it sounds great, right?

179
10:37.680 --> 10:40.353
But how do we get there in reality?

180
10:41.220 --> 10:43.200
Well, we have an equation

181
10:43.200 --> 10:46.440
of the adoption of fossil-free solutions,

182
10:46.440 --> 10:50.880
an equation where all the variables play a vital role

183
10:50.880 --> 10:53.670
to make this transformation happen.

184
10:53.670 --> 10:57.900
And if you remember your multiplication in school math,

185
10:57.900 --> 11:01.350
you will know that if any one of these parameters

186
11:01.350 --> 11:04.800
or variables is zero,

187
11:04.800 --> 11:07.653
the outcome will be zero.

188
11:09.000 --> 11:11.310
But unlike your school math,

189
11:11.310 --> 11:15.753
that zero result will have major repercussions globally.

190
11:16.680 --> 11:20.040
So let's start with our first parameter,

191
11:20.040 --> 11:21.573
availability of products.

192
11:22.500 --> 11:25.170
And we have already accumulated hundreds of millions

193
11:25.170 --> 11:28.980
of miles of experience with zero emission technology.

194
11:28.980 --> 11:31.470
Our CTO, Lars Stenqvist,

195
11:31.470 --> 11:34.560
will soon provide a detailed overview.

196
11:34.560 --> 11:36.990
And Volvo Group is fully committed

197
11:36.990 --> 11:40.203
to achieving net zero emissions by 2040.

198
11:41.220 --> 11:44.970
We have successfully launched battery powered trucks,

199
11:44.970 --> 11:49.890
dumps, haulers, excavators, buses, boats

200
11:49.890 --> 11:53.580
across Europe, across North America, United States,

201
11:53.580 --> 11:55.560
and many other regions.

202
11:55.560 --> 11:58.650
And I'm proud to say that we lead in this field,

203
11:58.650 --> 12:03.390
holding half of the e-truck market in North America

204
12:03.390 --> 12:07.713
and an impressive 70% in Europe.

205
12:08.640 --> 12:12.510
And I can tell you when you talk to both truck drivers,

206
12:12.510 --> 12:14.460
fleet owners, and anyone in

207
12:14.460 --> 12:18.630
and around the trucking industry,

208
12:18.630 --> 12:22.323
once you've made the shift, you don't want to go back.

209
12:23.400 --> 12:27.453
The red side effects are turning into green opportunities.

210
12:28.410 --> 12:29.940
We also aim to grow in services

211
12:29.940 --> 12:32.280
to support this transition, obviously.

212
12:32.280 --> 12:36.030
Pioneering artificial intelligence connectivity

213
12:36.030 --> 12:38.220
as part of the twin transformation.

214
12:38.220 --> 12:42.180
We have almost 2 million connected assets

215
12:42.180 --> 12:45.270
that we can leverage together with our customers

216
12:45.270 --> 12:47.580
and other partners in the value chain.

217
12:47.580 --> 12:49.330
So we are on the cutting edge here.

218
12:50.340 --> 12:52.410
Cost is another crucial factor.

219
12:52.410 --> 12:53.970
And when we talk about cost,

220
12:53.970 --> 12:56.880
it is important to remind ourself that a truck

221
12:56.880 --> 13:01.350
or a articulated hauler is not a big car,

222
13:01.350 --> 13:03.450
it is a piece of production equipment.

223
13:03.450 --> 13:06.930
And for our customers to switch to fossil-free alternatives,

224
13:06.930 --> 13:09.120
clean transportation tech

225
13:09.120 --> 13:12.033
must be profitable and cost competitive.

226
13:13.110 --> 13:16.140
Robust policies are needed to bridge the gap,

227
13:16.140 --> 13:18.960
not at least in the startup

228
13:18.960 --> 13:21.240
between a diesel and an electric truck.

229
13:21.240 --> 13:22.830
We need a combination of incentives

230
13:22.830 --> 13:27.330
and initiatives to encourage and accelerate green adoption

231
13:27.330 --> 13:28.473
and clean adoption.

232
13:30.240 --> 13:34.080
So what's next? Infrastructure of course.

233
13:34.080 --> 13:36.270
To go electric, we need charging infrastructure

234
13:36.270 --> 13:39.903
for heavy vehicles, but building it takes time.

235
13:40.740 --> 13:45.740
In Europe, we need 40,000 fast charging stations by 2030,

236
13:46.110 --> 13:49.053
but currently we only have 500.

237
13:50.130 --> 13:52.440
We need continue to invest.

238
13:52.440 --> 13:55.050
Infrastructure investment and smart policy

239
13:55.050 --> 13:55.950
are lagging behind.

240
13:55.950 --> 13:57.150
We need to work together.

241
13:57.150 --> 14:00.900
We need grid modernization and institutional reform.

242
14:00.900 --> 14:03.630
In the United States, it can take one to two years

243
14:03.630 --> 14:06.480
to secure permits for charging stations.

244
14:06.480 --> 14:10.320
Three to five years to upgrade distribution

245
14:10.320 --> 14:13.050
and 10 to 20 years to build substations.

246
14:13.050 --> 14:16.050
The time to act was yesterday as we know,

247
14:16.050 --> 14:18.573
but now we must move faster than ever.

248
14:19.560 --> 14:21.180
And when we have energy in place,

249
14:21.180 --> 14:24.063
let's make it green together and clean.

250
14:25.260 --> 14:27.510
Green energy production needs to increase

251
14:27.510 --> 14:30.450
and clean energy production needs to increase

252
14:30.450 --> 14:31.800
and it must be predictable.

253
14:32.730 --> 14:35.550
Currently, clean energy, when available,

254
14:35.550 --> 14:38.010
is the lowest cost energy source of all.

255
14:38.010 --> 14:39.480
That's good news.

256
14:39.480 --> 14:40.770
And that is why we have secured

257
14:40.770 --> 14:44.610
long-term renewable contracts for all our operations.

258
14:44.610 --> 14:48.060
And for example, in Sweden with the Swedish utility company,

259
14:48.060 --> 14:50.673
Vattenfall, for all Swedish operations.

260
14:51.510 --> 14:55.920
So this transition is about much more than transportation.

261
14:55.920 --> 14:59.310
The world simply must have more clean energy sources

262
14:59.310 --> 15:00.243
across the board.

263
15:01.230 --> 15:04.170
The loss of our variable is a massive network

264
15:04.170 --> 15:09.170
of coordinated players along and across the value chains.

265
15:09.630 --> 15:13.530
Andrea Fuder, our Chief Purchasing Officer,

266
15:13.530 --> 15:15.390
will be on a bit later

267
15:15.390 --> 15:19.020
and I'm sure you will be impressed with the sheer scale

268
15:19.020 --> 15:20.313
of this supply chain.

269
15:21.690 --> 15:24.270
That supply chain and many are represented here today,

270
15:24.270 --> 15:28.080
delivers magic, but it must evolve

271
15:28.080 --> 15:30.033
to take up net zero emissions.

272
15:31.020 --> 15:34.080
Everything from processing and refining raw materials

273
15:34.080 --> 15:37.560
to production of batteries and electric drive trains.

274
15:37.560 --> 15:41.010
And what is more, going green and clean should be profitable

275
15:41.010 --> 15:44.283
for everyone in the value chain and it must happen quickly.

276
15:45.180 --> 15:47.973
So my math lesson is almost done.

277
15:49.110 --> 15:51.260
And if you be keeping track, I've shown you

278
15:52.816 --> 15:57.093
five variables that will determine the speed of adoption.

279
15:58.530 --> 16:01.410
This transformation will likely follow the rhythm

280
16:01.410 --> 16:02.553
of the hype cycle.

281
16:03.570 --> 16:05.670
We have had the technology triggers,

282
16:05.670 --> 16:09.240
we know that many of them and most of them are working.

283
16:09.240 --> 16:14.240
And we have passed the peak of inflated expectations.

284
16:14.310 --> 16:18.573
Now we are somewhere in the trough of dissolution math.

285
16:20.010 --> 16:23.160
But yet, friends,

286
16:23.160 --> 16:26.580
this is not the end, it's the turning point.

287
16:26.580 --> 16:28.830
Because history shows that this stage

288
16:28.830 --> 16:31.380
is where strategies are refined,

289
16:31.380 --> 16:34.530
resilience is tested

290
16:34.530 --> 16:37.830
and the foundation for success are built.

291
16:37.830 --> 16:42.603
Because the right tech solutions will eventually win.

292
16:43.890 --> 16:45.990
And soon momentum will accelerate again

293
16:45.990 --> 16:49.260
and those prepared will lead the way forward.

294
16:49.260 --> 16:51.903
And when it turns, the winners will be the companies

295
16:51.903 --> 16:54.570
that have the right products and solutions

296
16:54.570 --> 16:57.363
and the ability and speed to adapt.

297
16:58.710 --> 17:01.170
But ultimately, and most importantly,

298
17:01.170 --> 17:05.943
the winners will be those with the right people, and why?

299
17:07.290 --> 17:10.413
Because in the end it's all about people,

300
17:11.250 --> 17:14.670
their expertise, the commitment,

301
17:14.670 --> 17:18.813
and the trust we put into colleagues and partners.

302
17:19.710 --> 17:22.830
In times of change,

303
17:22.830 --> 17:26.343
trust becomes the ultimate human currency.

304
17:27.660 --> 17:29.640
At Volvo, trust isn't just the value,

305
17:29.640 --> 17:32.550
it's the foundation of how we operate.

306
17:32.550 --> 17:36.180
And that's why we have always placed our people

307
17:36.180 --> 17:38.403
at the heart of everything we do.

308
17:39.420 --> 17:42.720
And as many of you know, when thinking about Volvo

309
17:42.720 --> 17:44.073
and closing your eyes,

310
17:45.240 --> 17:47.850
that's the reason why safety has always been

311
17:47.850 --> 17:51.183
one of our core values since inception.

312
17:52.260 --> 17:55.050
I'm proud that Volvo Group has led this transformation

313
17:55.050 --> 17:56.103
from the start.

314
17:57.300 --> 18:01.650
Confidence innovation is in our people's DNA,

315
18:01.650 --> 18:06.303
and it's also part of our heritage as a Swedish company.

316
18:07.140 --> 18:09.720
And part of the reason our country

317
18:09.720 --> 18:14.610
has such a strong position in innovation is due to the focus

318
18:14.610 --> 18:18.213
and investment we put on technology and climate.

319
18:19.110 --> 18:21.720
And with this in mind, I would like to introduce you

320
18:21.720 --> 18:26.040
to a someone who is a unique example

321
18:26.040 --> 18:30.600
of the Swedish passion of innovation and collaboration.

322
18:30.600 --> 18:32.430
That type of collaboration

323
18:32.430 --> 18:35.400
between private and public sectors

324
18:35.400 --> 18:39.243
that as a country we have championed.

325
18:40.410 --> 18:43.530
So up next, we are honored to be joined

326
18:43.530 --> 18:47.613
by our Minister for Energy, Business and Industry,

327
18:48.540 --> 18:52.170
our deputy prime Minister for Sweden, Ebba Busch.

328
18:52.170 --> 18:56.190
But first to introduce our minister,

329
18:56.190 --> 18:59.360
a snapshot of Swedish innovation.

330
19:01.562 --> 19:02.847
(audience clapping)

331
19:02.847 --> 19:06.680
(singing in foreign language)

332
19:21.644 --> 19:25.477
(singing in foreign language)

333
19:40.720 --> 19:44.553
(singing in foreign language)

334
19:57.682 --> 20:00.765
(upbeat techo music)

335
20:04.215 --> 20:07.298
(audience clapping)

336
20:09.707 --> 20:12.960
<v ->Ladies and gentlemen, visitors of Vegas,</v>

337
20:12.960 --> 20:15.453
nerds and lovers of tech,

338
20:16.410 --> 20:20.100
I'm here to talk about three things,

339
20:20.100 --> 20:25.100
innovation, values and hope for the next generation.

340
20:26.790 --> 20:29.580
And how these three things

341
20:29.580 --> 20:32.433
drives wealth and welfare.

342
20:33.300 --> 20:36.240
Sweden is a land of science and engineering.

343
20:36.240 --> 20:38.850
We are home to the Nobel Prize.

344
20:38.850 --> 20:42.780
We have a unique love for innovation and collaboration.

345
20:42.780 --> 20:47.010
And I would say that with hard work and curiosity,

346
20:47.010 --> 20:49.920
we keep on reinventing ourselves.

347
20:49.920 --> 20:54.180
But how did we get here and where are we headed?

348
20:54.180 --> 20:57.900
Well, in the mid 1800s, Sweden was actually,

349
20:57.900 --> 20:59.850
we were the poorest country in Europe,

350
20:59.850 --> 21:04.500
defined by cold, by starvation and hopelessness.

351
21:04.500 --> 21:09.150
A situation that led 1 million Swedes

352
21:09.150 --> 21:11.700
to leave for the US,

353
21:11.700 --> 21:15.210
but hope arose through groundbreaking innovations,

354
21:15.210 --> 21:18.120
brilliant engineers and tireless efforts

355
21:18.120 --> 21:19.800
by hardworking people.

356
21:19.800 --> 21:22.560
And they drove economic growth

357
21:22.560 --> 21:25.860
and laid the foundation for an engineering tradition

358
21:25.860 --> 21:28.800
that defines Sweden's identity today.

359
21:28.800 --> 21:32.100
From the dynamite to today's fossil-free industries,

360
21:32.100 --> 21:35.733
technological development drives our prosperity.

361
21:36.660 --> 21:40.260
But today we face

362
21:40.260 --> 21:43.290
a somewhat similar challenge.

363
21:43.290 --> 21:46.533
Many young people lack hope.

364
21:47.400 --> 21:50.975
And as a mother of two children of my own,

365
21:50.975 --> 21:53.250
I can see that so many parents now worry

366
21:53.250 --> 21:55.980
that their children may not experience

367
21:55.980 --> 21:59.283
better living conditions than they had themselves.

368
22:00.180 --> 22:04.353
Can you imagine what that does to a whole generation?

369
22:05.250 --> 22:09.150
The two key ingredients to Sweden's success,

370
22:09.150 --> 22:12.900
hard work and curiosity are now in danger.

371
22:12.900 --> 22:16.260
and of course, I mean, fear can drive action,

372
22:16.260 --> 22:19.020
but too much fear leads to hopelessness,

373
22:19.020 --> 22:20.730
it leads to paralysis

374
22:20.730 --> 22:23.640
and political decisions lately rooted in

375
22:23.640 --> 22:27.840
quite a lot of fear for climate change, war or pandemics

376
22:27.840 --> 22:31.260
that hinders next generation to believe

377
22:31.260 --> 22:33.990
and pursue these values.

378
22:33.990 --> 22:38.700
Yet there is so much hope.

379
22:38.700 --> 22:42.600
New technologies offer incredible possibilities.

380
22:42.600 --> 22:46.800
And here I would actually like to make a direct appeal

381
22:46.800 --> 22:48.570
to you all sitting here in this room

382
22:48.570 --> 22:50.370
or listening online now.

383
22:50.370 --> 22:53.400
As business leaders, as mothers, as fathers,

384
22:53.400 --> 22:57.630
as policymakers, well as fellow citizens,

385
22:57.630 --> 23:02.370
you, I, we all have a great responsibility

386
23:02.370 --> 23:05.070
to instill the values of hard work

387
23:05.070 --> 23:08.100
and curiosity in the next generation.

388
23:08.100 --> 23:12.570
Do not underestimate the power of what we model

389
23:12.570 --> 23:15.360
as admirable and worth striving for.

390
23:15.360 --> 23:20.190
Like our ancestors, we can transform fear into hope

391
23:20.190 --> 23:23.901
and build a more prosperous tomorrow.

392
23:23.901 --> 23:26.984
(audience clapping)

393
23:30.390 --> 23:33.360
Sweden, I would say is quite uniquely positioned

394
23:33.360 --> 23:34.680
for what is to come.

395
23:34.680 --> 23:37.800
We are truly creating the Swedish dream.

396
23:37.800 --> 23:40.080
Our companies have a global outlook

397
23:40.080 --> 23:41.430
and they are indispensable

398
23:41.430 --> 23:45.330
in the new technological value chains that are emerging.

399
23:45.330 --> 23:48.930
And mobility obviously is a key strength for us,

400
23:48.930 --> 23:51.720
a field where we integrate different technologies

401
23:51.720 --> 23:54.000
into quite complex system.

402
23:54.000 --> 23:57.810
But this does not only include trucks and buses,

403
23:57.810 --> 24:01.290
we make our own fire jets and submarines too.

404
24:01.290 --> 24:03.150
And we believe in communication,

405
24:03.150 --> 24:06.510
companies like Ericsson truly connect the world.

406
24:06.510 --> 24:08.250
We excel in clean technologies,

407
24:08.250 --> 24:10.140
leading the fossil-free transition,

408
24:10.140 --> 24:12.450
including green steel production

409
24:12.450 --> 24:15.630
and all this powered by an electricity system

410
24:15.630 --> 24:19.230
that is 98% fossil-free.

411
24:19.230 --> 24:22.770
Our companies are climate heroes.

412
24:22.770 --> 24:25.980
We have amazing natural resources including metals

413
24:25.980 --> 24:27.480
and rare earth metals

414
24:27.480 --> 24:30.090
that are essential parts of new technology.

415
24:30.090 --> 24:32.490
And we're a space nation too.

416
24:32.490 --> 24:35.130
So if you want to launch rockets in the EU,

417
24:35.130 --> 24:38.100
anybody in here got any plans on that?

418
24:38.100 --> 24:40.740
Well, if you have those plans,

419
24:40.740 --> 24:44.340
you have to go to the northern part of Sweden to Esrange.

420
24:44.340 --> 24:46.743
And I gladly welcome you myself.

421
24:47.670 --> 24:52.080
For 16 years, Sweden has consistently ranked

422
24:52.080 --> 24:57.080
among the top three most innovative countries in the world.

423
24:57.090 --> 24:59.850
We are number two in patent applications per capita,

424
24:59.850 --> 25:02.010
ranked as third best country in the world

425
25:02.010 --> 25:03.540
according to US news,

426
25:03.540 --> 25:07.170
and second in WIPO's world's most innovative economy

427
25:07.170 --> 25:09.510
and first in quality of life index.

428
25:09.510 --> 25:13.440
Stockholm producing the most unicorns per capita

429
25:13.440 --> 25:15.210
after Silicon Valley.

430
25:15.210 --> 25:16.410
You might think this is bragging,

431
25:16.410 --> 25:18.150
but I learned from an American yesterday

432
25:18.150 --> 25:20.133
that if it's facts, it's not bragging.

433
25:21.600 --> 25:26.490
On December 10th, Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson

434
25:26.490 --> 25:28.470
and James A. Robinson,

435
25:28.470 --> 25:32.160
received the Nobel Prize in Stockholm.

436
25:32.160 --> 25:33.780
And their research shows

437
25:33.780 --> 25:38.780
just how strong institutions promote long-term growth.

438
25:39.120 --> 25:43.380
And Sweden, well, this principle is very evident.

439
25:43.380 --> 25:46.170
We're a democracy with robust institutions,

440
25:46.170 --> 25:50.070
political stability and high levels of trust among people,

441
25:50.070 --> 25:51.270
businesses, and government.

442
25:51.270 --> 25:55.050
And I would say that this fosters a safe investment climate

443
25:55.050 --> 25:58.380
and strong returns, if anyone is interested in that.

444
25:58.380 --> 26:02.070
Swedes embrace new technologies early

445
26:02.070 --> 26:06.360
and we make the world both sting and dance and play

446
26:06.360 --> 26:09.304
and look good from "ABBA" to "Avicii",

447
26:09.304 --> 26:13.383
from Minecraft to Candy Crush and from H&amp;M to Fjallraven.

448
26:14.970 --> 26:18.240
Swedish companies are experts at turning technology

449
26:18.240 --> 26:22.110
into complex systems and solutions.

450
26:22.110 --> 26:26.280
International collaboration with like-minded nations

451
26:26.280 --> 26:29.850
is essential, particularly in a world

452
26:29.850 --> 26:33.960
where geopolitics increasingly shapes technology.

453
26:33.960 --> 26:37.440
So finally, ladies and gentlemen,

454
26:37.440 --> 26:41.070
I welcome you to be part of team Sweden

455
26:41.070 --> 26:46.070
where hard work and curiosity turns poverty to prosperity

456
26:46.200 --> 26:50.730
and hopelessness to hope for the next generation.

457
26:50.730 --> 26:55.434
So join Sweden, we're open for business. Thank you.

458
26:55.434 --> 27:00.434
(audience clapping)
(upbeat techno music)

459
27:05.559 --> 27:08.892
<v ->Wow, thank you very much indeed, Ebba.</v>

460
27:10.350 --> 27:14.010
And we need shared goals, solid roadmaps,

461
27:14.010 --> 27:16.740
and we need to take action.

462
27:16.740 --> 27:17.760
And for us as a company,

463
27:17.760 --> 27:20.460
that means taking action even at the time

464
27:20.460 --> 27:23.970
when we do not know exactly how the shift

465
27:23.970 --> 27:28.200
from the fossil-based to a fossil-free platform

466
27:28.200 --> 27:32.010
will play out in time and across regions.

467
27:32.010 --> 27:34.140
And that is why we are developing

468
27:34.140 --> 27:36.030
three parallel tracks of technology

469
27:36.030 --> 27:40.173
for fossil-free transport, battery electric,

470
27:41.610 --> 27:45.210
it's about hydrogen powered fuel cell electric

471
27:45.210 --> 27:49.470
and combustion technology with renewable fuels.

472
27:49.470 --> 27:52.560
It is a massive undertaking

473
27:52.560 --> 27:55.353
and a once in a lifetime challenge.

474
27:56.220 --> 27:59.010
But I'm so proud that we have some of the best

475
27:59.010 --> 28:01.440
and most passionate engineers in the world

476
28:01.440 --> 28:03.150
working on it.

477
28:03.150 --> 28:05.100
And talking about engineers,

478
28:05.100 --> 28:08.010
the one heading up our technology, innovations,

479
28:08.010 --> 28:10.350
and groundbreaking concept

480
28:10.350 --> 28:12.600
that are shaping the future of transport

481
28:12.600 --> 28:16.830
is our own master of take, so please welcome

482
28:16.830 --> 28:19.983
Lars Stenqvist, the CTO of the Volvo Group.

483
28:20.866 --> 28:24.086
(audience cheering)

484
28:24.086 --> 28:26.753
(upbeat music)

485
28:30.720 --> 28:31.830
<v ->Thank you, Martin.</v>

486
28:31.830 --> 28:33.210
And hello, everyone.

487
28:33.210 --> 28:36.453
It's great to be here with you today at CES.

488
28:37.350 --> 28:41.190
You ever heard Morton talk about driving prosperity,

489
28:41.190 --> 28:45.090
enabling our customers to create value to society

490
28:45.090 --> 28:48.120
here and now while at the same time

491
28:48.120 --> 28:51.240
developing the solutions of tomorrow?

492
28:51.240 --> 28:54.570
And that's all about innovation.

493
28:54.570 --> 28:59.570
I'm here to show you how we turn ideas into reality,

494
28:59.940 --> 29:03.813
how we use innovation to shape the world we want to live in.

495
29:05.580 --> 29:08.610
We are on a transformation journey

496
29:08.610 --> 29:12.780
and where we are going, our trucks, buses,

497
29:12.780 --> 29:14.340
and construction equipment,

498
29:14.340 --> 29:17.040
they will be 100% fossil-free

499
29:17.040 --> 29:21.930
but also 100% safe and 100% more productive.

500
29:21.930 --> 29:25.350
And the good news is we are already delivering

501
29:25.350 --> 29:26.703
in this direction.

502
29:28.200 --> 29:32.670
We have delivered heavy duty Volvo V and R Electric

503
29:32.670 --> 29:36.453
across 19 US states and Canadian provinces.

504
29:37.440 --> 29:40.650
Worldwide, our electric Volvo trucks

505
29:40.650 --> 29:43.530
are rolling in 49 countries

506
29:43.530 --> 29:47.160
covering more than 130 million kilometers

507
29:47.160 --> 29:49.440
or 82 million miles.

508
29:49.440 --> 29:50.770
That's equal to

509
29:51.840 --> 29:54.723
more than 3000 laps around the globe.

510
29:57.060 --> 30:00.120
Our 15,000 engineers,

511
30:00.120 --> 30:03.240
my 15,000 idols,

512
30:03.240 --> 30:06.550
they are key players on this journey

513
30:07.890 --> 30:11.790
because to decarbonize our industry,

514
30:11.790 --> 30:16.790
there's no single magic solution, no silver bullet.

515
30:17.070 --> 30:18.930
It's about having the right tools

516
30:18.930 --> 30:20.673
for the right job to be done.

517
30:21.510 --> 30:24.630
Different sectors in the transportation industry

518
30:24.630 --> 30:26.550
need different solutions,

519
30:26.550 --> 30:29.730
whether it's construction sites in cities,

520
30:29.730 --> 30:32.460
transporting goods across the country,

521
30:32.460 --> 30:35.493
or moving people in buses.

522
30:36.690 --> 30:38.820
We will also see different solutions

523
30:38.820 --> 30:41.403
for different regions of the world.

524
30:42.300 --> 30:45.870
And that's where our three path propulsion strategy

525
30:45.870 --> 30:47.850
come into play.

526
30:47.850 --> 30:52.443
By 2040, we believe most vehicles will be electric,

527
30:53.310 --> 30:56.970
but not just one kind of electric solution,

528
30:56.970 --> 31:00.990
we are investing heavily in both battery electric

529
31:00.990 --> 31:03.540
and fuel cell electric.

530
31:03.540 --> 31:05.970
And besides electrification,

531
31:05.970 --> 31:09.150
we're investing heavily in combustion engines,

532
31:09.150 --> 31:13.743
running on fossil-free renewable fuels like green hydrogen.

533
31:15.930 --> 31:17.550
But instead of me just telling you

534
31:17.550 --> 31:19.650
how we are going to achieve all of this,

535
31:19.650 --> 31:21.753
I think it's better that I show you.

536
31:23.010 --> 31:25.113
So now imagine this,

537
31:26.267 --> 31:28.830
a world where our cutting edge vehicles

538
31:28.830 --> 31:33.042
and technologies are already transforming transportation.

539
31:33.042 --> 31:34.530
(truck humming)

540
31:34.530 --> 31:36.810
That world isn't just a concept,

541
31:36.810 --> 31:39.210
it's happening right here, right now.

542
31:39.210 --> 31:42.360
And Anders, my VR assistant,

543
31:42.360 --> 31:44.670
will help me with some live animations.

544
31:44.670 --> 31:47.013
Anders, are you ready to go?
<v Anders>Yes.</v>

545
31:48.390 --> 31:49.980
<v ->Behind me you will see</v>

546
31:49.980 --> 31:53.160
our virtual representation of the world

547
31:53.160 --> 31:55.893
where our innovations are already in motion.

548
31:56.880 --> 31:59.310
As we go on this journey together here

549
31:59.310 --> 32:01.590
you will experience how our technology

550
32:01.590 --> 32:05.520
is shaping the future of transportation and construction.

551
32:05.520 --> 32:07.263
So let's dive in.

552
32:08.250 --> 32:12.750
Picture the cities of tomorrow, clean air, quiet streets

553
32:12.750 --> 32:17.220
and emission-free vehicles delivering everything we need.

554
32:17.220 --> 32:20.460
So how do we get there?

555
32:20.460 --> 32:22.930
Well, let's start by following a package

556
32:23.940 --> 32:25.980
to be delivered on this journey.

557
32:25.980 --> 32:27.210
And behind me, you will see

558
32:27.210 --> 32:30.720
our recently launched highway truck,

559
32:30.720 --> 32:32.587
the all new Volvo VNL.

560
32:33.990 --> 32:37.980
VNL is our name of our flagship truck here in North America.

561
32:37.980 --> 32:41.190
Designed to set new industry standards

562
32:41.190 --> 32:42.870
in heavy duty trucking

563
32:42.870 --> 32:47.133
and it's the platform for all future technologies.

564
32:48.300 --> 32:51.810
We know that aerodynamic has a major impact

565
32:51.810 --> 32:53.790
on energy efficiency of a truck.

566
32:53.790 --> 32:58.200
So we decided to change, optimize the cab design,

567
32:58.200 --> 33:01.143
making it much more streamlined.

568
33:02.040 --> 33:06.660
And this, together with major powertrain enhancements,

569
33:06.660 --> 33:08.700
is a key factor in achieving

570
33:08.700 --> 33:13.113
up to 10% in fuel and energy efficiency.

571
33:14.340 --> 33:18.450
And the designed windshield brings other benefits.

572
33:18.450 --> 33:22.140
It provides much better visibility for the driver,

573
33:22.140 --> 33:25.143
which is important for safety on the road.

574
33:26.370 --> 33:29.790
Much more into it's safety is in the Volvo DNA

575
33:29.790 --> 33:32.190
and our engineers have focused

576
33:32.190 --> 33:35.160
on several new active safety systems

577
33:35.160 --> 33:38.430
to continue our journey towards zero accidents

578
33:38.430 --> 33:42.153
or 100% safe as we say in Volvo.

579
33:43.290 --> 33:46.860
One example is Volvo active driver assist

580
33:46.860 --> 33:50.310
and a new pedestrian detection system,

581
33:50.310 --> 33:52.140
alerting the driver

582
33:52.140 --> 33:56.553
and activating frontal emergency braking if needed.

583
33:58.050 --> 34:01.740
Our goal is clear, to create solutions,

584
34:01.740 --> 34:05.220
meeting the demands of tomorrow cleaner, safer,

585
34:05.220 --> 34:08.673
more efficient, smarter transport and construction.

586
34:10.230 --> 34:13.530
Smarter is very much connected

587
34:13.530 --> 34:16.143
to seamless connectivity and data.

588
34:17.070 --> 34:19.830
All of it today we have 1.7 million

589
34:19.830 --> 34:22.830
connected vehicles worldwide.

590
34:22.830 --> 34:26.070
We are monitoring the performance of these vehicles.

591
34:26.070 --> 34:30.960
We are being able to coach our customers on fuel efficiency

592
34:30.960 --> 34:35.010
and to predict breakdowns of components

593
34:35.010 --> 34:39.450
to avoid downtime in critical operations.

594
34:39.450 --> 34:43.890
There is so much potential around connectivity and data.

595
34:43.890 --> 34:46.740
But remember, we are on a mission to deliver.

596
34:46.740 --> 34:48.900
Anders is helping me deliver a package.

597
34:48.900 --> 34:53.900
And as we approach the city, our electric van from Flexis,

598
34:54.180 --> 34:56.400
our joint venture together with Reno Group,

599
34:56.400 --> 34:59.100
takes over the lost mile delivery of the package

600
34:59.100 --> 35:00.930
to our homes.

601
35:00.930 --> 35:03.300
With increasing urbanization,

602
35:03.300 --> 35:07.470
booming e-commerce, electric transport is essential

603
35:07.470 --> 35:12.450
to cut emissions and reduce air pollutions in city centers.

604
35:12.450 --> 35:15.270
And then once delivery is made, we end up

605
35:15.270 --> 35:20.190
with the packaging material at home, a form of waste.

606
35:20.190 --> 35:23.550
Our Mack electric garbage truck arrives to ensure

607
35:23.550 --> 35:27.153
that waste is managed in a clean and quiet way.

608
35:28.680 --> 35:31.950
What we are showcasing here is a glimpse

609
35:31.950 --> 35:35.820
of today's solutions as well as the future.

610
35:35.820 --> 35:37.290
Emission-free vehicles,

611
35:37.290 --> 35:39.960
designed to reduce environmental impact

612
35:39.960 --> 35:43.713
and improve efficiency at every stage of the journey.

613
35:46.170 --> 35:50.370
Now imagine you are walking besides a construction site

614
35:50.370 --> 35:51.810
in the city on your way to work,

615
35:51.810 --> 35:53.820
to school or to meet friends.

616
35:53.820 --> 35:56.250
I mean heavy construction site

617
35:56.250 --> 35:58.950
with many machines working in parallel.

618
35:58.950 --> 36:03.950
A heavy construction site where the air is clean,

619
36:04.170 --> 36:07.713
noise is minimal and everything is just running smoothly.

620
36:08.880 --> 36:11.250
That's not the future, that's today

621
36:11.250 --> 36:13.470
because right here behind me,

622
36:13.470 --> 36:16.800
you see our electric excavator hard at work,

623
36:16.800 --> 36:19.143
alongside a Volvo electric truck.

624
36:20.310 --> 36:23.820
And to run a fully electric site like this

625
36:23.820 --> 36:28.020
is definitely sometimes a challenge for the electric grid.

626
36:28.020 --> 36:30.300
And to support and balance the grid,

627
36:30.300 --> 36:33.750
we have our battery energy storage solution,

628
36:33.750 --> 36:38.700
or BESS as we like to call it, no diesel generators,

629
36:38.700 --> 36:43.413
no fumes, no noise, just clean energy getting the job done.

630
36:44.250 --> 36:47.850
This is a complete ecosystem.

631
36:47.850 --> 36:50.580
The excavator is digging, the truck is hauling

632
36:50.580 --> 36:53.970
and the BESS is making sure we have a smooth operation.

633
36:53.970 --> 36:57.540
These aren't just concepts they are real.

634
36:57.540 --> 36:58.950
Real working solutions

635
36:58.950 --> 37:01.620
that are building the cities of tomorrow

636
37:01.620 --> 37:04.050
in a way that's better for the environment

637
37:04.050 --> 37:05.673
and safer for everyone.

638
37:06.690 --> 37:10.230
And now think what this really means.

639
37:10.230 --> 37:12.783
We are not just electrifying construction,

640
37:13.836 --> 37:16.963
we are transforming the entire process.

641
37:16.963 --> 37:20.073
The entire ecosystem of city construction.

642
37:21.660 --> 37:24.603
Question is of course what makes all of this possible?

643
37:25.500 --> 37:29.010
A lot of important hardware, but not just hardware.

644
37:29.010 --> 37:33.930
Our vehicles are getting more and more software defined.

645
37:33.930 --> 37:37.083
We are truly at the beginning of a paradigm shift here.

646
37:37.980 --> 37:41.820
And to cater for future demands, Volvo Group,

647
37:41.820 --> 37:44.220
together with one of our main competitors,

648
37:44.220 --> 37:49.140
Daimler Truck, intend to start tech joint venture

649
37:49.140 --> 37:51.390
that will develop and deliver

650
37:51.390 --> 37:56.100
a software-defined vehicle platform for commercial vehicles,

651
37:56.100 --> 38:01.100
hardware, and software up to the operative system level.

652
38:02.520 --> 38:06.600
The intended name of this joint venture is Coretura.

653
38:06.600 --> 38:08.760
And by teaming up with Daimler Truck,

654
38:08.760 --> 38:11.700
we will accelerate the development of this platform

655
38:11.700 --> 38:14.820
and share the burden of heavy investments.

656
38:14.820 --> 38:18.780
And by that, we are freeing up resources

657
38:18.780 --> 38:20.730
that we are going to use to develop

658
38:20.730 --> 38:23.070
all the Volvo Group vehicle functions

659
38:23.070 --> 38:24.783
that will run on this platform.

660
38:26.483 --> 38:29.130
It's important here to understand collaborating

661
38:29.130 --> 38:32.763
with a competitor in order to be competitive.

662
38:34.380 --> 38:37.590
We expect other commercial vehicle OEMs

663
38:37.590 --> 38:39.360
to show interest in this platform.

664
38:39.360 --> 38:43.587
And maybe this can turn into a standard operating system

665
38:43.587 --> 38:44.913
for our industry.

666
38:46.380 --> 38:49.020
This intended joint venture will pave the way

667
38:49.020 --> 38:51.390
for the next generation of vehicles,

668
38:51.390 --> 38:55.020
and it's much more than just a technological upgrade.

669
38:55.020 --> 38:59.760
It's redefining transport intelligence.

670
38:59.760 --> 39:03.210
Highly integrated vehicles that can be constantly improved

671
39:03.210 --> 39:07.470
with software updates, providing greater safety,

672
39:07.470 --> 39:09.360
greater productivity, and greater value

673
39:09.360 --> 39:10.983
for all our customers.

674
39:12.210 --> 39:14.520
And the transformation doesn't end here.

675
39:14.520 --> 39:18.930
Let's move and move to hydrogen, green hydrogen,

676
39:18.930 --> 39:21.450
an exciting piece of the puzzle

677
39:21.450 --> 39:24.690
on our journey to decarbonize transportation.

678
39:24.690 --> 39:25.650
Behind me, you will see

679
39:25.650 --> 39:29.910
an articulated hauler in action, a beast.

680
39:29.910 --> 39:33.090
Volvo is the world market leader in articulated haulers.

681
39:33.090 --> 39:36.450
And this one is the world's first

682
39:36.450 --> 39:38.820
hydrogen-powered articulated hauler.

683
39:38.820 --> 39:43.110
In this case it's a fuel cell electric hauler prototype.

684
39:43.110 --> 39:46.620
So instead of electric entity stored in batteries,

685
39:46.620 --> 39:49.950
we are converting hydrogen into electricity

686
39:49.950 --> 39:51.453
onboard the vehicle.

687
39:52.380 --> 39:53.880
And this is a proof point

688
39:53.880 --> 39:57.090
that fuel cell electric vehicles can manage

689
39:57.090 --> 40:00.753
the toughest jobs in construction and long-haul trucking.

690
40:01.650 --> 40:05.310
You definitely need a hydrogen infrastructure,

691
40:05.310 --> 40:08.760
but the benefits of fuel cells are many.

692
40:08.760 --> 40:12.510
You are not dependent on the electrical grid capacity.

693
40:12.510 --> 40:15.540
You have a high hydrogen conversion efficiency,

694
40:15.540 --> 40:17.850
long range, quick refueling,

695
40:17.850 --> 40:20.943
and the only emission here, it's water vapor.

696
40:21.810 --> 40:24.750
That's the kind of game changing solutions

697
40:24.750 --> 40:26.520
we are talking about.

698
40:26.520 --> 40:29.340
And besides hydrogen in fuel cells,

699
40:29.340 --> 40:33.750
we also believe in hydrogen for combustion engines

700
40:33.750 --> 40:37.623
as one of the fossil-free renewable fuels for the future.

701
40:39.780 --> 40:42.570
I'm sure we are sure that we will see variations

702
40:42.570 --> 40:46.590
of infrastructure, supply and price of green electricity

703
40:46.590 --> 40:50.040
and green hydrogen in different parts of the world.

704
40:50.040 --> 40:53.640
And again, that's why we have a three part strategy

705
40:53.640 --> 40:56.823
to support customer needs just everywhere.

706
40:57.990 --> 40:59.310
But there's more.

707
40:59.310 --> 41:01.530
We are in a green and digital transformation

708
41:01.530 --> 41:02.460
at the same time.

709
41:02.460 --> 41:03.570
So let me introduce you

710
41:03.570 --> 41:07.230
to a zero-emission autonomous wheel loader.

711
41:07.230 --> 41:11.100
It's a truly innovative research and development concept,

712
41:11.100 --> 41:15.540
uses AI to create self-learning capabilities,

713
41:15.540 --> 41:18.390
meaning that it can adapt to different scenarios,

714
41:18.390 --> 41:20.100
make real time decisions,

715
41:20.100 --> 41:23.133
and even safely interact with humans on site.

716
41:24.960 --> 41:28.500
It's a site, but our innovation doesn't stop on land.

717
41:28.500 --> 41:32.700
So now let's continue with autonomous applications

718
41:32.700 --> 41:36.303
and to Volvo Penta and our hybrid electric vessels.

719
41:37.290 --> 41:39.360
I think some of you can agree

720
41:39.360 --> 41:42.540
that docking a boat in tough conditions

721
41:42.540 --> 41:46.260
can be a challenge, eh?

722
41:46.260 --> 41:49.500
I see some of you're nodding. So do I.

723
41:49.500 --> 41:52.440
Volvo Penta is offering an industry-first innovation

724
41:52.440 --> 41:55.320
with assisted docking technology,

725
41:55.320 --> 41:57.693
the next step in marine automation.

726
41:58.620 --> 42:00.840
It simplifies the demanding task

727
42:00.840 --> 42:02.820
of docking a boat in a harbor

728
42:02.820 --> 42:06.570
by counteracting the effects of wind and current,

729
42:06.570 --> 42:11.570
making it easier and safer to maneuver in tight spaces.

730
42:11.790 --> 42:15.840
You simply point with a joystick where you want to go

731
42:15.840 --> 42:17.643
and the system docks the boat.

732
42:18.570 --> 42:19.710
On your left here,

733
42:19.710 --> 42:23.670
you see how the system is docking the boat smoothly.

734
42:23.670 --> 42:26.940
On your right, you see how Anders is struggling

735
42:26.940 --> 42:28.770
to compensate for the winds.

736
42:28.770 --> 42:29.603
It's not easy.

737
42:29.603 --> 42:32.820
So Anders, do you want the second run or?

738
42:32.820 --> 42:35.153
<v Anders>Yes, please.</v>
<v ->I would guess so, yeah.</v>

739
42:36.570 --> 42:40.650
This innovation isn't only about convenience.

740
42:40.650 --> 42:43.320
Like so much that I have shown you so far

741
42:43.320 --> 42:46.953
it's about increasing safety and efficiency.

742
42:48.180 --> 42:50.760
So far we have explored the transformation

743
42:50.760 --> 42:53.190
of urban environments and construction sites,

744
42:53.190 --> 42:55.713
but what about highways?

745
42:57.060 --> 42:58.890
Volvo group's vision for the future

746
42:58.890 --> 43:01.590
of freight transport is here.

747
43:01.590 --> 43:05.790
The high-tech production ready Volvo VNL Autonomous,

748
43:05.790 --> 43:10.473
the key piece of our autonomous transport exo system.

749
43:11.850 --> 43:14.910
As Martin mentioned earlier, freight volumes are projected

750
43:14.910 --> 43:18.540
to fivefold between 2010 and 2050.

751
43:18.540 --> 43:21.270
Making autonomous transport not just an innovation

752
43:21.270 --> 43:23.223
but a necessity.

753
43:24.390 --> 43:28.830
Yet it's much more than just adding capacity.

754
43:28.830 --> 43:31.860
Autonomous transport is about transforming

755
43:31.860 --> 43:35.190
how goods move across vast distances

756
43:35.190 --> 43:37.983
with greater efficiency and safety.

757
43:39.180 --> 43:43.140
This transformation, however, is no small task

758
43:43.140 --> 43:45.750
and it requires significant collaboration.

759
43:45.750 --> 43:48.240
Why we have partnered up

760
43:48.240 --> 43:51.810
with Aurora innovation whose Aurora Driver

761
43:51.810 --> 43:56.193
is seamlessly integrated into the Volvo VNL Autonomous.

762
43:57.360 --> 44:00.990
So now it's my pleasure to welcome Sterling Anderson,

763
44:00.990 --> 44:05.163
co-founder and chief product officer at Aurora, Sterling.

764
44:06.152 --> 44:11.152
(audience clapping)
(upbeat music)

765
44:15.510 --> 44:17.160
<v ->Welcome.</v>
<v ->Thanks, thanks.</v>

766
44:17.160 --> 44:18.390
And good morning CES.

767
44:18.390 --> 44:19.440
It's great to be here

768
44:19.440 --> 44:20.910
and showcase some of the extraordinary work

769
44:20.910 --> 44:23.220
that's been done by our collective teams.

770
44:23.220 --> 44:24.447
<v ->Great to have you here, Sterling.</v>

771
44:24.447 --> 44:26.670
And we have worked together now for a couple of years,

772
44:26.670 --> 44:28.740
and one thing is super clear,

773
44:28.740 --> 44:31.410
we both share a deep commitment to safety.

774
44:31.410 --> 44:35.790
At Volvo, safety is in our DNA, built into everything we do,

775
44:35.790 --> 44:38.070
including the Volvo VNL Autonomous.

776
44:38.070 --> 44:39.690
And at Aurora,

777
44:39.690 --> 44:43.470
the Aurora Driver reflects exactly the same focus.

778
44:43.470 --> 44:46.170
And I feel that the partnership between our teams

779
44:46.170 --> 44:49.110
has taken safety to a new level.

780
44:49.110 --> 44:50.790
What's your view, Sterling?

781
44:50.790 --> 44:52.650
<v ->Yeah, that's certainly been our collective goal.</v>

782
44:52.650 --> 44:56.340
Look, safety is the primary value proposition of autonomy.

783
44:56.340 --> 45:00.030
Like Volvo, we built Aurora around a commitment to it.

784
45:00.030 --> 45:03.210
Our driver is designed to be super human, to see further,

785
45:03.210 --> 45:05.160
to think faster, and to react better

786
45:05.160 --> 45:06.540
than a human driver could.

787
45:06.540 --> 45:08.460
And I wanna show you a quick example of that.

788
45:08.460 --> 45:10.710
What you'll see here in the video that we're about to play

789
45:10.710 --> 45:12.480
is an Aurora-powered heavy truck,

790
45:12.480 --> 45:15.570
hauling a commercial load in the middle of the Texas desert

791
45:15.570 --> 45:17.010
in the dead of night.

792
45:17.010 --> 45:18.690
A human driver wouldn't expect

793
45:18.690 --> 45:20.250
to see a pedestrian on the side of the highway

794
45:20.250 --> 45:21.570
in these circumstances.

795
45:21.570 --> 45:23.130
Yet that's exactly what the Aurora Driver

796
45:23.130 --> 45:24.510
is about to detect.

797
45:24.510 --> 45:27.510
And what you'll notice is it detects that a full 11 seconds

798
45:27.510 --> 45:29.880
before a human would've.

799
45:29.880 --> 45:31.500
As this video plays, I want you to keep your eye

800
45:31.500 --> 45:33.870
on the small red box that the Aurora Driver places

801
45:33.870 --> 45:35.160
around the pedestrian when it sees it

802
45:35.160 --> 45:36.570
and begins to track it.

803
45:36.570 --> 45:38.520
And then I want you to watch the high resolution camera

804
45:38.520 --> 45:41.280
and tell me, if you had been driving this truck,

805
45:41.280 --> 45:44.010
at what moment would this pedestrian have been visible

806
45:44.010 --> 45:45.750
to you and your human eye?

807
45:45.750 --> 45:46.950
So we can roll the tape.

808
45:48.180 --> 45:50.040
So you notice here right at the outset

809
45:50.040 --> 45:51.660
that the Aurora Driver has already picked up

810
45:51.660 --> 45:54.270
this pedestrian as is shown there in that box.

811
45:54.270 --> 45:56.490
Now I want you to watch the camera feed

812
45:56.490 --> 45:59.253
and imagine you're a human driving this truck at night.

813
46:04.110 --> 46:05.460
It's about 11 seconds later.

814
46:05.460 --> 46:06.293
Do you see that pedestrian?

815
46:06.293 --> 46:08.160
That's enough time for the Aurora Driver

816
46:08.160 --> 46:10.140
to have noticed, tracked,

817
46:10.140 --> 46:11.910
decided it was safer to get over,

818
46:11.910 --> 46:14.040
looked for other traffic in the adjacent lane,

819
46:14.040 --> 46:16.200
gotten over and given sufficient birth

820
46:16.200 --> 46:18.063
to this pedestrian in passing it.

821
46:19.050 --> 46:22.050
<v ->11 seconds, that can definitely save a life.</v>

822
46:22.050 --> 46:25.410
And that means to me that you and the team,

823
46:25.410 --> 46:27.750
you have solved really the biggest challenges

824
46:27.750 --> 46:31.140
in autonomous driving, this with accurately seeing

825
46:31.140 --> 46:34.713
and then safely reacting to the world around you.

826
46:35.753 --> 46:36.586
Could that be true?

827
46:36.586 --> 46:37.500
<v ->Yeah, it's one of them. Certainly one of them.</v>

828
46:37.500 --> 46:40.170
This and other examples like it give us confidence

829
46:40.170 --> 46:41.280
that the system's capable

830
46:41.280 --> 46:43.890
of superhuman performance on the road.

831
46:43.890 --> 46:45.450
Now, Aurora's perception system

832
46:45.450 --> 46:48.630
uses high resolution cameras, imaging radar,

833
46:48.630 --> 46:50.580
short range lasers, microphones

834
46:50.580 --> 46:52.350
in our proprietary first light lidar

835
46:52.350 --> 46:53.820
to see the world around it

836
46:53.820 --> 46:57.780
and see through darkness, rain, fog, and even snow.

837
46:57.780 --> 46:58.890
And we've integrated this deeply

838
46:58.890 --> 47:00.630
with the Volvo VNL Autonomous.

839
47:00.630 --> 47:03.240
Giving the trucks that it operates, the ability to detect

840
47:03.240 --> 47:06.900
and track even small objects like debris or small people,

841
47:06.900 --> 47:09.420
it ranges of up to 500 meters.

842
47:09.420 --> 47:11.430
Now the Aurora Driver that's operating these trucks

843
47:11.430 --> 47:13.980
is constantly monitoring its entire surroundings

844
47:13.980 --> 47:15.240
and it can make quicker,

845
47:15.240 --> 47:17.340
more informed decisions than a human can.

846
47:17.340 --> 47:21.540
As you saw in that video, 11 seconds really can save a life.

847
47:21.540 --> 47:24.210
Now we tested the verifiable AI at the core

848
47:24.210 --> 47:25.980
of the Aurora Driver in millions of miles

849
47:25.980 --> 47:27.900
of real world driving and in billions

850
47:27.900 --> 47:30.540
of effective miles in simulation.

851
47:30.540 --> 47:33.330
For instance, before the Aurora Driver ever performed

852
47:33.330 --> 47:35.580
an unprotected left-hand turn on the roadway,

853
47:35.580 --> 47:38.430
it had practiced 2 million unprotected

854
47:38.430 --> 47:40.650
left-hand turns in simulation.

855
47:40.650 --> 47:44.520
<v ->It's impressive. 200 million simulations.</v>

856
47:44.520 --> 47:46.950
I think we will know that making a left turn

857
47:46.950 --> 47:49.860
with oncoming traffic is one of the trickiest move

858
47:49.860 --> 47:51.090
on the road.

859
47:51.090 --> 47:53.580
<v ->Yeah, yeah, the Aurora Driver's sophisticated system</v>

860
47:53.580 --> 47:54.810
to do stuff like this,

861
47:54.810 --> 47:57.180
but we can't deliver it alone.

862
47:57.180 --> 47:59.430
To deliver the highest levels of safety,

863
47:59.430 --> 48:01.980
quality, reliability, and scale,

864
48:01.980 --> 48:03.750
we recognize that it has to be developed

865
48:03.750 --> 48:06.120
and integrated deeply and hand in hand

866
48:06.120 --> 48:07.770
with the self-driving truck platform.

867
48:07.770 --> 48:09.810
And that's really where our partnership comes in.

868
48:09.810 --> 48:12.990
<v ->Indeed, and we have built redundancy</v>

869
48:12.990 --> 48:15.390
into the core of our truck.

870
48:15.390 --> 48:17.670
When we look at the Volvo VNL Autonomous,

871
48:17.670 --> 48:20.430
and you can experience it here at CES,

872
48:20.430 --> 48:22.260
at the Continental both.

873
48:22.260 --> 48:24.330
We are seeing a truck designed

874
48:24.330 --> 48:26.430
from the beginning for autonomy.

875
48:26.430 --> 48:29.220
It's built here at our North American plant

876
48:29.220 --> 48:33.330
with six key redundancy systems, dual braking,

877
48:33.330 --> 48:37.260
steering communication, computing power, energy storage,

878
48:37.260 --> 48:38.670
and motion control.

879
48:38.670 --> 48:43.670
We have even daplicated critical lights and hazard signals.

880
48:43.860 --> 48:46.380
<v ->Yeah, and by tightly integrating the Aurora Driver</v>

881
48:46.380 --> 48:48.510
with each of these systems, we've created a truck

882
48:48.510 --> 48:50.700
that's not only safe, but it's reliable

883
48:50.700 --> 48:54.000
and it's manufacturable at extremely large scales.

884
48:54.000 --> 48:57.840
<v ->Exactly, and with this, we have now created the blueprint</v>

885
48:57.840 --> 49:00.780
for autonomous technology for future models,

886
49:00.780 --> 49:03.150
brands, and use cases.

887
49:03.150 --> 49:06.210
So Sterling, this with partnership collaboration,

888
49:06.210 --> 49:10.080
why is it imperative in order to take self-driving

889
49:10.080 --> 49:11.340
to full production?

890
49:11.340 --> 49:12.173
<v ->Yeah, that's a good question.</v>

891
49:12.173 --> 49:14.040
Look early in the founding of Aurora,

892
49:14.040 --> 49:16.800
we recognized the only way we could bring safe,

893
49:16.800 --> 49:18.750
reliable, autonomous vehicles to market

894
49:18.750 --> 49:21.810
was through an ecosystem of industry leaders.

895
49:21.810 --> 49:23.100
A redundant platform, as I said,

896
49:23.100 --> 49:25.110
is critical to the safe deployment

897
49:25.110 --> 49:27.870
and large scale adoption of this technology.

898
49:27.870 --> 49:29.160
Now, doing this work together,

899
49:29.160 --> 49:31.590
it was a very large investment for both of us,

900
49:31.590 --> 49:33.630
but it's one that I am confident

901
49:33.630 --> 49:35.820
we'll provide enormous dividends for customers

902
49:35.820 --> 49:37.620
of this product in the future.

903
49:37.620 --> 49:41.073
<v ->And we are showing how partnership is the leadership.</v>

904
49:41.940 --> 49:42.990
So ladies and gentlemen,

905
49:42.990 --> 49:47.430
what we have shared today is not a concept or a prototype

906
49:47.430 --> 49:49.020
or a vision of what's to come.

907
49:49.020 --> 49:50.430
It's happening now.

908
49:50.430 --> 49:54.480
Our autonomous trucks are already in commercial operation,

909
49:54.480 --> 49:59.480
transporting goods for customers like DHL across Texas.

910
49:59.910 --> 50:02.100
We have now been operating in autonomous mode

911
50:02.100 --> 50:05.130
with the safety driver on public roads.

912
50:05.130 --> 50:07.083
A key step in this journey.

913
50:07.920 --> 50:10.950
Together, Aurora and Volvo have achieved many milestones

914
50:10.950 --> 50:14.250
on the path to fully autonomous commercial trucking

915
50:14.250 --> 50:16.440
with only one final step ahead,

916
50:16.440 --> 50:19.650
tough one, removing the safety driver.

917
50:19.650 --> 50:23.220
And we are well on our way to achieving that.

918
50:23.220 --> 50:27.270
So ladies and gentlemen, together Aurora and Volvo,

919
50:27.270 --> 50:29.430
we are not just gearing up for success,

920
50:29.430 --> 50:31.440
we are delivering success.

921
50:31.440 --> 50:33.630
Thank you Sterling for being with us here today.

922
50:33.630 --> 50:35.100
Thank you for being a great partner.

923
50:35.100 --> 50:36.697
<v Sterling>You bet. Happy to, thanks</v>

924
50:36.697 --> 50:39.780
(audience clapping)

925
50:42.420 --> 50:44.970
<v ->We have covered a lot of ground today together</v>

926
50:44.970 --> 50:48.840
from electric vehicles and hydrogen-powered solutions

927
50:48.840 --> 50:50.670
to software-defined vehicles

928
50:50.670 --> 50:52.950
and autonomous technology.

929
50:52.950 --> 50:56.070
At Volvo Group, we are proudly integrating

930
50:56.070 --> 50:57.750
these exciting technologies

931
50:57.750 --> 51:02.730
across transportation segments from sea to land,

932
51:02.730 --> 51:06.690
from mining to highways, to city environments.

933
51:06.690 --> 51:10.563
We are in the midst of transforming our industry.

934
51:11.580 --> 51:14.400
I hope we have demonstrated to you

935
51:14.400 --> 51:17.320
the powerful real-world potential

936
51:18.210 --> 51:20.310
of a reimagined transportation

937
51:20.310 --> 51:22.410
and infrastructure landscape

938
51:22.410 --> 51:25.923
built with climate tech at its very core.

939
51:26.850 --> 51:29.670
And speaking of transforming industry,

940
51:29.670 --> 51:33.000
this is a journey that requires close collaboration

941
51:33.000 --> 51:34.980
with our partners.

942
51:34.980 --> 51:38.250
Here to share the details of how we tap into the power

943
51:38.250 --> 51:40.650
of collective demand to drive innovation

944
51:40.650 --> 51:42.870
across our supply network,

945
51:42.870 --> 51:46.170
please welcome on stage my close colleague, friend,

946
51:46.170 --> 51:49.533
our Chief Purchasing Officer, Andrea Fuder.

947
51:50.450 --> 51:55.450
(audience clapping)
(upbeat music)

948
52:02.760 --> 52:07.140
<v ->Hi, everyone, I am very excited to be here</v>

949
52:07.140 --> 52:11.070
and share on how we can scale up climate tech

950
52:11.070 --> 52:13.503
for a more prosperous future.

951
52:14.370 --> 52:16.950
Let me start with some stats.

952
52:16.950 --> 52:21.950
By 2050, 50% of the emission reductions

953
52:22.080 --> 52:24.840
needed to achieve net zero are expected

954
52:24.840 --> 52:29.613
to come from technologies not yet available at scale.

955
52:30.720 --> 52:33.930
And in many ways, we will also need

956
52:33.930 --> 52:36.480
to rely on new technologies,

957
52:36.480 --> 52:40.080
innovations that still must be unlocked

958
52:40.080 --> 52:42.243
for the green transition.

959
52:43.260 --> 52:46.890
So if technologies are yet

960
52:46.890 --> 52:48.810
to be imagined

961
52:48.810 --> 52:52.860
or are in fact in the need to scale,

962
52:52.860 --> 52:56.550
how can we build an innovations mindset

963
52:56.550 --> 52:59.523
and create the prerequisites to scale?

964
53:01.140 --> 53:04.950
Well big companies like us must utilize

965
53:04.950 --> 53:09.950
their purchasing power and that of their entire ecosystem

966
53:10.230 --> 53:13.143
to catalyze their commercial adoption.

967
53:14.220 --> 53:17.850
Martin talked about driving prosperity

968
53:17.850 --> 53:22.710
in how the most important part of the equation

969
53:22.710 --> 53:27.423
is in fact, to take the whole ecosystem with us.

970
53:28.860 --> 53:33.480
I am here to talk about how we can leverage purchasing power

971
53:33.480 --> 53:37.773
and drive collective demand to enable the transformation.

972
53:39.090 --> 53:42.090
Let me start by giving you a flavor

973
53:42.090 --> 53:45.900
of our extensive supply network.

974
53:45.900 --> 53:49.200
If we get at just one representative

975
53:49.200 --> 53:52.710
from each of our first tier supply partners,

976
53:52.710 --> 53:57.710
we would need 25 rooms like this.

977
53:57.990 --> 54:01.533
Some 50,000 partners.

978
54:02.670 --> 54:06.360
Each has its own supply network,

979
54:06.360 --> 54:10.530
which creates an even vaster ecosystem.

980
54:10.530 --> 54:12.960
So to achieve a sustainable future,

981
54:12.960 --> 54:16.890
we must leverage this entire network.

982
54:16.890 --> 54:21.870
Purchasing is in fact a strategic powerhouse

983
54:21.870 --> 54:25.470
at the heart of every company.

984
54:25.470 --> 54:28.260
It sets a direction of a business,

985
54:28.260 --> 54:32.793
turning ambitions into reality, words into actions.

986
54:33.810 --> 54:38.643
This is purpose and impact for real.

987
54:40.590 --> 54:44.820
Our Volvo Group 2040 commitment

988
54:44.820 --> 54:49.820
to a net zero value chain depends on our success together

989
54:50.190 --> 54:54.000
in partnership, we are one team,

990
54:54.000 --> 54:57.390
learning, innovating, accelerating,

991
54:57.390 --> 55:02.253
and scaling technology innovations together.

992
55:03.960 --> 55:06.840
And we have clear demands in place to drive innovation

993
55:06.840 --> 55:10.710
for sustainable solutions like decarbonization targets

994
55:10.710 --> 55:12.243
for our supply network.

995
55:13.380 --> 55:16.320
And our influence doesn't stop

996
55:16.320 --> 55:20.940
at our 50,000 direct supply partners.

997
55:20.940 --> 55:23.070
These demands must be pushed

998
55:23.070 --> 55:26.220
through the entire supply network,

999
55:26.220 --> 55:28.920
forming a massive ecosystem

1000
55:28.920 --> 55:32.463
where every player shapes the future.

1001
55:33.600 --> 55:36.720
In many ways, it works a bit like

1002
55:36.720 --> 55:39.480
the good old game of domino

1003
55:39.480 --> 55:42.870
with every action creating a chain effect,

1004
55:42.870 --> 55:45.033
amplifying the impact.

1005
55:46.650 --> 55:47.880
At Volvo Group, we have moved

1006
55:47.880 --> 55:50.250
from transactional relationships

1007
55:50.250 --> 55:54.120
into real partnerships, driving prosperity

1008
55:54.120 --> 55:57.183
and impact for the entire value chain.

1009
55:58.680 --> 56:02.460
We are making it happen with a wide range of corporations,

1010
56:02.460 --> 56:05.400
utility companies, academia,

1011
56:05.400 --> 56:08.163
transport companies and startups.

1012
56:09.030 --> 56:12.390
Partnerships are being forged in ways

1013
56:12.390 --> 56:17.250
that no one would have imagined years ago,

1014
56:17.250 --> 56:20.040
even with our competitors.

1015
56:20.040 --> 56:25.040
And all this to help speed up the transportation

1016
56:25.170 --> 56:27.183
and logistics transition.

1017
56:28.050 --> 56:32.883
So in being a true partner, what do we do differently?

1018
56:34.140 --> 56:38.430
We extend our hand to help.

1019
56:38.430 --> 56:40.830
For example, we share our knowledge

1020
56:40.830 --> 56:45.830
and data openly to ensure a good pace of progress.

1021
56:46.440 --> 56:49.380
We offer upskilling through our purchasing

1022
56:49.380 --> 56:53.550
by Volvo Group platform in areas like carbon accounting,

1023
56:53.550 --> 56:56.730
energy savings, and circularity.

1024
56:56.730 --> 57:00.181
And in addition, we are unique in having

1025
57:00.181 --> 57:04.860
a dedicated team pursuing low carbon materials,

1026
57:04.860 --> 57:08.400
fossil-free and circular models who are at hand

1027
57:08.400 --> 57:12.393
and support to validate carbon reduction roadmaps.

1028
57:13.560 --> 57:17.583
Now, you may ask, is this approach successful?

1029
57:18.840 --> 57:23.550
Well, we were the first in the world

1030
57:23.550 --> 57:27.900
to launch fossil-free steel vehicles,

1031
57:27.900 --> 57:30.450
which created a totally new market.

1032
57:30.450 --> 57:34.020
And now we have moved further into low-carbon materials

1033
57:34.020 --> 57:37.677
with aluminum, copper, and polymers.

1034
57:37.677 --> 57:41.760
And of course, I can promise, we will continue to innovate,

1035
57:41.760 --> 57:45.090
but we do not innovate alone.

1036
57:45.090 --> 57:48.900
The collective impact is what will drive speed.

1037
57:48.900 --> 57:53.400
It is only by leveraging this collective purchasing power

1038
57:53.400 --> 57:56.220
that we can fast track green technology

1039
57:56.220 --> 57:57.843
and climate innovation.

1040
57:59.100 --> 58:02.013
But let's be transparent,

1041
58:03.150 --> 58:06.663
this is in no means an easy journey.

1042
58:08.520 --> 58:12.660
Fossil-based solutions, while currently lower in price,

1043
58:12.660 --> 58:16.020
do not include the full cost to society,

1044
58:16.020 --> 58:20.490
like costs for poor air quality, wildfires, flooding,

1045
58:20.490 --> 58:22.410
hurricanes, and so on.

1046
58:22.410 --> 58:25.890
All direct impacts of global warming.

1047
58:25.890 --> 58:30.783
We must find ways to achieve fair cost comparison.

1048
58:32.070 --> 58:35.220
And the world is complex.

1049
58:35.220 --> 58:38.940
Right now, we face geopolitical instability,

1050
58:38.940 --> 58:42.480
political fragmentation, regulatory pressure,

1051
58:42.480 --> 58:45.003
and the lack of synchronized agendas.

1052
58:45.840 --> 58:47.550
All this has of course,

1053
58:47.550 --> 58:52.230
an impact on our ability to deliver.

1054
58:52.230 --> 58:56.010
But our approach at Volvo Groups stays,

1055
58:56.010 --> 58:59.460
it is to navigate collectively

1056
58:59.460 --> 59:01.830
and find innovative ways

1057
59:01.830 --> 59:04.413
to accelerate our journey to net zero.

1058
59:05.730 --> 59:08.140
Because we cannot

1059
59:10.110 --> 59:13.140
lose our guiding north star

1060
59:13.140 --> 59:16.590
to come to a fossil-free society.

1061
59:16.590 --> 59:20.430
We simply need to foster the technologies

1062
59:20.430 --> 59:23.670
required for that transition.

1063
59:23.670 --> 59:28.530
The power of a supplied network with a shared purpose

1064
59:28.530 --> 59:31.983
to drive positive change is exponential.

1065
59:33.420 --> 59:37.020
This collective demand is in fact

1066
59:37.020 --> 59:40.323
a make or break for the green transition.

1067
59:42.330 --> 59:44.800
So how do we move forward?

1068
59:46.500 --> 59:47.793
The answer is obvious.

1069
59:49.050 --> 59:52.830
Together with transparency

1070
59:52.830 --> 59:54.453
and with trust.

1071
59:56.520 --> 01:00:00.330
And someone we certainly can trust to lead us

1072
01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:02.880
through this transition is Martin.

1073
01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:07.530
Let me welcome him back to stage for some closing words.

1074
01:00:07.530 --> 01:00:09.783
Martin, please join us again.

1075
01:00:10.707 --> 01:00:13.556
(audience clapping)

1076
01:00:13.556 --> 01:00:15.083
<v ->Thank you, Andrea.</v>

1077
01:00:15.083 --> 01:00:16.110
Thank you, Andrea.

1078
01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:17.190
It's so impressive to see

1079
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:21.210
this impressive ecosystem

1080
01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:22.350
that Andrea is talking about

1081
01:00:22.350 --> 01:00:24.240
and many of you are here today

1082
01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:27.540
and the sphere of influence that we can represent,

1083
01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:29.140
but also that you can represent.

1084
01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:31.800
I'm under standing here now

1085
01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.860
representing the Volvo Group, very proud.

1086
01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:37.950
We have a fantastic heritage and history.

1087
01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:41.430
In many ways, Mack Trucks built America

1088
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:43.560
from the Statue of Liberty

1089
01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:47.520
to supporting troops during World War I and II,

1090
01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.350
and up to today.

1091
01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:52.500
And in peril across the pond,

1092
01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:57.500
Volvo was instrumental in the Swedish success story,

1093
01:00:57.690 --> 01:01:01.530
going from a rural economy to an industrial

1094
01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:02.583
and high tech one.

1095
01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:06.030
And transport and infrastructure

1096
01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:09.783
continue to be a prerequisite for driving prosperity.

1097
01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:12.960
But we must deliver transportation

1098
01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:16.740
and infrastructure that is considerably more safe,

1099
01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:21.630
more sustainable, and more productive than it is today.

1100
01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:26.010
And we are in the middle of a historic transformation

1101
01:01:26.010 --> 01:01:29.040
with fantastic opportunities.

1102
01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:33.453
Succeeding is about aligning with long-term vision.

1103
01:01:34.410 --> 01:01:37.920
It is about utilizing innovation and technology,

1104
01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.420
creating business models.

1105
01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:43.320
It is about working together across sectors.

1106
01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:46.680
But more than anything, it is about dedicate

1107
01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:49.840
and passionate people coming together

1108
01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:55.473
to completely reinvent and transform our world.

1109
01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:03.827
As one of my predecessors said, long serving CEO of Volvo,

1110
01:02:03.827 --> 01:02:08.827
Soren Gyll, he said, "I take my hat off for everything

1111
01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:12.450
that has been achieved and I take my jacket off

1112
01:02:12.450 --> 01:02:15.810
and roll up the sleeves for the future."

1113
01:02:15.810 --> 01:02:19.530
On that note, please welcome back my fellow speakers

1114
01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:20.460
on stage again

1115
01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:23.398
and give them a big hands on applause, thank you.

1116
01:02:23.398 --> 01:02:26.653
(audience clapping)

1117
01:02:26.653 --> 01:02:29.243
Lars, Andrea, Ebba, Sterling.

1118
01:02:29.243 --> 01:02:32.326
(audience cheering)

1119
01:02:37.606 --> 01:02:41.550
So just to finalize, let's shape the world

1120
01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:45.060
we want to live in and let's do it together.

1121
01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.748
Thank you.
<v ->Yes.</v>

1122
01:02:46.748 --> 01:02:51.748
(audience cheering)
(light upbeat music)

1123
01:03:03.187 --> 01:03:06.437
(upbeat techno music)
