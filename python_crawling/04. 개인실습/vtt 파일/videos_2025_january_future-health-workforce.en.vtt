1
00:00.221 --> 00:02.804
(upbeat music)

2
00:11.850 --> 00:12.683
<v ->All right.</v>

3
00:12.683 --> 00:14.100
Thank you everyone for joining us

4
00:14.100 --> 00:16.260
for our panel here Future of Health Workforce.

5
00:16.260 --> 00:18.510
We're very excited to get started.

6
00:18.510 --> 00:20.670
I'll introduce myself first as a moderator.

7
00:20.670 --> 00:21.870
My name is Dr. Adam Goodcoff,

8
00:21.870 --> 00:23.970
I'm a board certified emergency medicine physician

9
00:23.970 --> 00:27.060
and also the co-founder and CEO of MedFluencers,

10
00:27.060 --> 00:30.630
which is an HCP influencer marketing communications firm.

11
00:30.630 --> 00:34.950
So I'm very excited to introduce our panelists here today.

12
00:34.950 --> 00:37.050
They're all incredibly accomplished in their own right.

13
00:37.050 --> 00:39.735
And in fact, I will actually let them speak for themselves.

14
00:39.735 --> 00:41.010
Not only introducing,

15
00:41.010 --> 00:42.360
but a little bit about themselves.

16
00:42.360 --> 00:43.470
Mary, I'll have you kick it off.

17
00:43.470 --> 00:44.910
<v ->Wonderful, thank you.</v>

18
00:44.910 --> 00:45.743
Good afternoon.

19
00:45.743 --> 00:47.340
My name is Mary Del Guidice.

20
00:47.340 --> 00:50.550
I am the vice president and chief nursing officer

21
00:50.550 --> 00:52.350
at Tipton Health Communications,

22
00:52.350 --> 00:56.400
which is the country's largest nurse consultancy.

23
00:56.400 --> 01:00.450
We support nurses across really globally,

24
01:00.450 --> 01:04.350
US, Europe, over 300 hospitals

25
01:04.350 --> 01:09.090
to truly optimize nursing practice,

26
01:09.090 --> 01:10.980
elevate work environments,

27
01:10.980 --> 01:14.070
and improve outcomes in every measurable way.

28
01:14.070 --> 01:16.890
I've been with Tipton Health for five years,

29
01:16.890 --> 01:21.240
but previous to that, I've been a nurse for 42 years.

30
01:21.240 --> 01:22.470
Don't do the math on that.

31
01:22.470 --> 01:27.030
And spent really the last 30 years as a nurse leader,

32
01:27.030 --> 01:30.993
chief nursing officer of many wonderful organizations.

33
01:32.910 --> 01:34.890
<v ->Hello everyone, my name is Colby Takeda,</v>

34
01:34.890 --> 01:38.250
co-founder and CEO of Pear Suites.

35
01:38.250 --> 01:39.960
We are a early stage startup.

36
01:39.960 --> 01:43.050
We launched in 2021 and focused completely on

37
01:43.050 --> 01:44.700
empowering community health workers

38
01:44.700 --> 01:45.990
and other community-based providers

39
01:45.990 --> 01:49.710
like doulas, promotores, and other frontline workers.

40
01:49.710 --> 01:50.580
My background is actually,

41
01:50.580 --> 01:52.860
I started in senior care and public health.

42
01:52.860 --> 01:55.710
I was an administrator of a senior living facility at 24

43
01:55.710 --> 01:57.150
and learned all about operations

44
01:57.150 --> 01:58.830
and taking care of older adults.

45
01:58.830 --> 02:01.800
And then I worked for Sharecare on the Blue Zones Project

46
02:01.800 --> 02:03.780
to focus on food, housing, transportation,

47
02:03.780 --> 02:07.920
and helping a team of about 15 policy and partnership leads

48
02:07.920 --> 02:09.660
helped to make communities healthier and happier.

49
02:09.660 --> 02:10.950
And so during the pandemic

50
02:10.950 --> 02:13.470
when community health workers really stepped up,

51
02:13.470 --> 02:15.360
that's when we decided to build

52
02:15.360 --> 02:17.370
to support community health workers.

53
02:17.370 --> 02:18.990
Many of them aren't on technology,

54
02:18.990 --> 02:20.370
they're on paper and spreadsheets,

55
02:20.370 --> 02:23.550
so helping them transition to the healthcare needs

56
02:23.550 --> 02:24.690
of payers and providers

57
02:24.690 --> 02:28.200
allowed them to now contract and support community health

58
02:28.200 --> 02:30.180
through these payers and provider contracts.

59
02:30.180 --> 02:32.530
So that's what we do and excited to share more.

60
02:34.320 --> 02:36.480
<v ->Good afternoon, my name is Joe Ganley,</v>

61
02:36.480 --> 02:39.390
I'm the vice president of Government and Regulatory Affairs

62
02:39.390 --> 02:40.920
at Athenahealth,

63
02:40.920 --> 02:43.860
which is a health IT provider

64
02:43.860 --> 02:45.720
primarily in the ambulatory market.

65
02:45.720 --> 02:48.930
So doctor's offices are really our sweet spot.

66
02:48.930 --> 02:50.880
We are a company that's passionate about

67
02:50.880 --> 02:53.760
how technology can disrupt and make improvements

68
02:53.760 --> 02:54.930
in the way care is delivered

69
02:54.930 --> 02:57.660
and reduce, most importantly, clinician burden,

70
02:57.660 --> 03:00.540
which we'll probably talk a lot about here today.

71
03:00.540 --> 03:02.520
I've been at Athena for five years.

72
03:02.520 --> 03:05.160
And prior to that, I was at McKesson for 10 years,

73
03:05.160 --> 03:08.220
working also on health IT public policy issues

74
03:08.220 --> 03:09.960
in Washington.

75
03:09.960 --> 03:11.040
And I was really pleased

76
03:11.040 --> 03:14.010
to be part of the effort in Washington

77
03:14.010 --> 03:15.927
that deregulated a lot of health IT,

78
03:15.927 --> 03:19.410
the 21st Century Cures Act which was passed back in 2015,

79
03:19.410 --> 03:23.340
which was a major deregulatory law that actually

80
03:23.340 --> 03:25.620
I think opened up a lot of innovation in technology.

81
03:25.620 --> 03:27.090
So we'll probably talk a little bit about that

82
03:27.090 --> 03:27.923
today as well.

83
03:27.923 --> 03:29.060
So thanks for being here.

84
03:30.510 --> 03:32.100
<v ->Hi, good afternoon, I'm Dennis Truong,</v>

85
03:32.100 --> 03:34.500
I'm emergency physician at Kaiser Permanente.

86
03:34.500 --> 03:36.330
I'm part of the Permanente Medical Group,

87
03:36.330 --> 03:40.380
so it's the physician side of the Kaiser Permanente name.

88
03:40.380 --> 03:43.470
We have 12.5 million members that we're accountable for

89
03:43.470 --> 03:46.200
across eight markets, about 400 hospitals,

90
03:46.200 --> 03:48.810
about 220,000 employees.

91
03:48.810 --> 03:52.740
Of those 220,000 is 25,000 of them are physicians.

92
03:52.740 --> 03:55.560
As the physician arm, as a physician leader,

93
03:55.560 --> 03:58.530
I run the digital mobility and virtual care

94
03:58.530 --> 03:59.760
for Mid-Atlantic.

95
03:59.760 --> 04:02.880
Also we combine and collaborate with all the other regions,

96
04:02.880 --> 04:04.850
and we have some of our other regional leaders here

97
04:04.850 --> 04:06.720
in the audience too.

98
04:06.720 --> 04:08.760
What's great about being a physician at Kaiser

99
04:08.760 --> 04:10.080
and a leader at Kaiser is that

100
04:10.080 --> 04:13.080
you get to not only be involved in the technical aspect,

101
04:13.080 --> 04:14.070
but you're involved in the clinical

102
04:14.070 --> 04:15.210
and the operational aspects.

103
04:15.210 --> 04:16.860
So you get to combine all three.

104
04:16.860 --> 04:19.920
So it's not as fragmented when making decisions

105
04:19.920 --> 04:21.570
and you still you're able to keep the patient

106
04:21.570 --> 04:22.410
at center all you do.

107
04:22.410 --> 04:24.270
So it makes it much easier to do those things.

108
04:24.270 --> 04:26.520
So I'm very excited about this conversation

109
04:26.520 --> 04:28.677
because it really combines a lot of the work that we do.

110
04:28.677 --> 04:31.127
And I look forward to learning from all you guys.

111
04:32.040 --> 04:33.510
<v ->Well, thank you very much to all of you.</v>

112
04:33.510 --> 04:37.279
You can see that there's a wide depth of experiences

113
04:37.279 --> 04:39.150
for our panel today.

114
04:39.150 --> 04:40.650
I think it's no secret that

115
04:40.650 --> 04:43.530
we have some significant challenges in healthcare as a whole

116
04:43.530 --> 04:45.903
and the healthcare workforce as a whole.

117
04:46.800 --> 04:49.080
Some might say big systemic challenges.

118
04:49.080 --> 04:50.220
What are some of the things

119
04:50.220 --> 04:52.350
that keep each of you up at night?

120
04:52.350 --> 04:53.940
And I'll keep it broad to start, Mary, we'll go to you.

121
04:53.940 --> 04:55.500
<v ->Wonderful.</v>

122
04:55.500 --> 04:59.220
Well, what comes to mind in our practicing consulting

123
04:59.220 --> 05:01.920
and organizations across the world

124
05:01.920 --> 05:04.770
is this worry and challenge

125
05:04.770 --> 05:09.510
to unleash the healthcare, entire healthcare team,

126
05:09.510 --> 05:13.980
from the enormous amount of administrative burdens,

127
05:13.980 --> 05:18.980
unmanageable workloads, and inefficient workflows

128
05:18.990 --> 05:23.970
that keep nurses and physicians away from the bedside.

129
05:23.970 --> 05:28.350
We know that nurses spend 54% of their time,

130
05:28.350 --> 05:30.630
not in direct care.

131
05:30.630 --> 05:34.860
50% of nurses are not practicing at the top of their license

132
05:34.860 --> 05:37.800
due to these burdens and barriers.

133
05:37.800 --> 05:40.020
And when I think of technology,

134
05:40.020 --> 05:45.020
up to 40% of their time is spent in documentation.

135
05:45.420 --> 05:49.950
And 15% of their time is spent in tasks that can be done

136
05:49.950 --> 05:52.440
by other healthcare team members.

137
05:52.440 --> 05:56.130
So that big picture of getting nurses and physicians

138
05:56.130 --> 06:00.030
to that place of joy and meaning with their patients

139
06:00.030 --> 06:04.023
is what's always on front of mind from a global perspective.

140
06:05.940 --> 06:06.930
<v ->Yeah, it's interesting.</v>

141
06:06.930 --> 06:08.970
Like one of the workers could be a community health worker,

142
06:08.970 --> 06:10.740
right, to support a nurse.

143
06:10.740 --> 06:11.670
So for me, you know,

144
06:11.670 --> 06:13.530
we're really passionate about community health workers.

145
06:13.530 --> 06:15.840
And unlike other clinicians

146
06:15.840 --> 06:18.450
and other credentialed licensed professionals,

147
06:18.450 --> 06:21.030
community health workers aren't credentialed in the way that

148
06:21.030 --> 06:24.450
nurses or doctors or physical therapists are.

149
06:24.450 --> 06:26.520
Every state right now has their own policies

150
06:26.520 --> 06:28.800
around what a credentialed community health worker is,

151
06:28.800 --> 06:30.330
which is really a part of the challenge.

152
06:30.330 --> 06:32.310
You can't start to work with the healthcare system

153
06:32.310 --> 06:34.770
unless there's some way to verify that this person

154
06:34.770 --> 06:37.320
has the right training and background experience.

155
06:37.320 --> 06:38.580
But that's also the benefit of

156
06:38.580 --> 06:40.050
what community health workers bring to the table.

157
06:40.050 --> 06:42.660
That lived experience is so valuable.

158
06:42.660 --> 06:45.510
You know, being someone who maybe had experienced

159
06:45.510 --> 06:47.730
homelessness or was on food stamps

160
06:47.730 --> 06:49.290
or was part of the justice system

161
06:49.290 --> 06:50.820
is what makes them so relevant

162
06:50.820 --> 06:51.750
when you're helping to address

163
06:51.750 --> 06:53.520
the social determinants of health needs.

164
06:53.520 --> 06:54.353
And of course,

165
06:54.353 --> 06:56.220
this also opens the opportunity to think about

166
06:56.220 --> 06:58.680
how do we address these social needs at scale?

167
06:58.680 --> 06:59.850
And so that keeps me up at night

168
06:59.850 --> 07:01.680
that social determinants of health are so important,

169
07:01.680 --> 07:04.200
and CHWs could be that solution,

170
07:04.200 --> 07:07.710
But yet helping them work with providers and payers

171
07:07.710 --> 07:10.650
and HIEs and government agencies

172
07:10.650 --> 07:13.650
and all these different stakeholders is pretty challenging.

173
07:13.650 --> 07:15.420
It took many, many years and decades

174
07:15.420 --> 07:16.860
for other provider types to get

175
07:16.860 --> 07:19.740
that credentialing and that respect and that compensation.

176
07:19.740 --> 07:22.020
So how do we achieve all of that all at once?

177
07:22.020 --> 07:23.820
That's what we're on the mission to try to do at Pear Suite

178
07:23.820 --> 07:26.620
and that's definitely a challenge that's worth tackling.

179
07:27.720 --> 07:28.770
<v ->Yeah, you know, I'll add,</v>

180
07:28.770 --> 07:31.920
I think that we've been talking about the economic pressure

181
07:31.920 --> 07:34.680
on primary care in this country,

182
07:34.680 --> 07:38.340
the administrative burden on primary care clinicians.

183
07:38.340 --> 07:39.420
And in my world,

184
07:39.420 --> 07:42.360
the regulatory burden on those folks for a long time.

185
07:42.360 --> 07:44.580
And now those chickens are coming home to roost, right?

186
07:44.580 --> 07:45.450
Because we're probably

187
07:45.450 --> 07:47.670
a hundred thousand primary care doctors short

188
07:47.670 --> 07:48.990
in this country right now.

189
07:48.990 --> 07:51.720
And that is a massive what keeps me up at night.

190
07:51.720 --> 07:53.130
I don't know that people are gonna be able to,

191
07:53.130 --> 07:54.540
my kids and my kids' kids

192
07:54.540 --> 07:56.070
are gonna be able to go to the doctor

193
07:56.070 --> 07:59.070
the way people have traditionally gone to the doctor.

194
07:59.070 --> 08:00.030
Because if there's not enough

195
08:00.030 --> 08:02.400
primary care doctors in the community

196
08:02.400 --> 08:04.503
and other clinicians in the community,

197
08:05.370 --> 08:08.640
our whole primary care model could fall apart.

198
08:08.640 --> 08:11.010
And I don't think that's an exaggeration

199
08:11.010 --> 08:13.210
to suggest that we're sort of on that trend.

200
08:14.100 --> 08:16.440
I was with a friend of mine who's a doctor the other day,

201
08:16.440 --> 08:18.060
he is actually retired,

202
08:18.060 --> 08:19.440
and he said, you know,

203
08:19.440 --> 08:20.940
the last thing I would tell somebody

204
08:20.940 --> 08:23.970
in medical school to do is to go be a primary care doc.

205
08:23.970 --> 08:25.050
He said, I get asked all the time.

206
08:25.050 --> 08:25.980
What should I specialize in?

207
08:25.980 --> 08:28.200
What should I think about in terms of the arc of my career?

208
08:28.200 --> 08:30.750
And he said, I tell them, do not be a primary care doc.

209
08:30.750 --> 08:32.340
It's brutal.

210
08:32.340 --> 08:33.450
Go be a proceduralist.

211
08:33.450 --> 08:35.760
Work at a big hospital where you collect your paycheck

212
08:35.760 --> 08:38.550
and you go home on Friday at five, right?

213
08:38.550 --> 08:40.860
Do not have your own independent practice,

214
08:40.860 --> 08:42.330
even if that's what you're passionate about,

215
08:42.330 --> 08:43.530
because it's just not sustainable.

216
08:43.530 --> 08:45.570
So that workforce challenge

217
08:45.570 --> 08:47.663
I think is what really keeps me up at night.

218
08:48.810 --> 08:50.760
<v ->I don't wanna say access keeps me up at night,</v>

219
08:50.760 --> 08:51.780
but after hearing you I'm kind of,

220
08:51.780 --> 08:53.640
as an emergency physician

221
08:53.640 --> 08:55.440
with not enough primary care physicians,

222
08:55.440 --> 08:58.260
we take the brunt of a lot of the access issues.

223
08:58.260 --> 08:59.180
<v Joe>That's in the hallway.</v>

224
08:59.180 --> 09:01.020
<v ->Right, exactly.</v>

225
09:01.020 --> 09:02.327
So I trained in Detroit and it's interesting

226
09:02.327 --> 09:03.540
'cause when you,

227
09:03.540 --> 09:05.670
I remember coming to work and seeing a patient laying there

228
09:05.670 --> 09:07.620
and he brought a sleeping bag.

229
09:07.620 --> 09:10.890
And he was there ready to sleep overnight

230
09:10.890 --> 09:12.630
until he was seen.

231
09:12.630 --> 09:15.480
So I went, started my shift, worked 12 hours and left.

232
09:15.480 --> 09:17.700
And he was still there in the sleeping bag.

233
09:17.700 --> 09:18.870
So I asked him like, what are you here for?

234
09:18.870 --> 09:20.553
I'm just here for a sore throat.

235
09:21.720 --> 09:24.150
You waited 12 hours for a sore throat.

236
09:24.150 --> 09:25.590
So even back then,

237
09:25.590 --> 09:27.780
as an emergency physician watching the physician shortage,

238
09:27.780 --> 09:29.580
not just primary care but in general,

239
09:29.580 --> 09:30.930
shortage across the board,

240
09:30.930 --> 09:33.270
that's always been the thing that kept me up at night

241
09:33.270 --> 09:34.290
is access.

242
09:34.290 --> 09:35.880
How do we get better access?

243
09:35.880 --> 09:37.440
Then now it's interesting because

244
09:37.440 --> 09:39.810
we have all these digital tools out here, right?

245
09:39.810 --> 09:42.420
We have some great speakers up here from great organizations

246
09:42.420 --> 09:44.190
and we go, well, access is still a problem

247
09:44.190 --> 09:46.470
because how do we right fit access now?

248
09:46.470 --> 09:49.560
Not just provide care, but make sure it's coordinated.

249
09:49.560 --> 09:51.420
Make sure it is responsible, right?

250
09:51.420 --> 09:53.340
So some of the things that we've talked about before,

251
09:53.340 --> 09:55.800
I remember being on a panel like this about four years ago,

252
09:55.800 --> 09:58.020
talk about digital divide.

253
09:58.020 --> 10:00.210
Now it become digital dependency.

254
10:00.210 --> 10:01.290
How do we,

255
10:01.290 --> 10:03.510
it's becoming no matter whether you like it or not,

256
10:03.510 --> 10:05.100
we are very dependent on digital.

257
10:05.100 --> 10:06.930
So how do we do it responsibly

258
10:06.930 --> 10:09.060
and still provide great access, great quality

259
10:09.060 --> 10:12.120
at the lowest possible cost so that we're not, you know,

260
10:12.120 --> 10:15.510
we're not gonna resolve our issues

261
10:15.510 --> 10:17.673
by just throwing cash at it in the future?

262
10:19.080 --> 10:20.460
<v ->Dennis, I think it's really interesting,</v>

263
10:20.460 --> 10:23.970
especially knowing the Kaiser system, it's very integrated.

264
10:23.970 --> 10:25.230
There are a lot of ways

265
10:25.230 --> 10:27.600
in which the patients are plugged in for multiple aspects

266
10:27.600 --> 10:29.040
even from an emergency department visit,

267
10:29.040 --> 10:29.873
where typically, you know,

268
10:29.873 --> 10:31.620
you're describing kind of an inner city experience,

269
10:31.620 --> 10:33.030
there's, you know, horrible wait times,

270
10:33.030 --> 10:36.090
but you all have the ability to,

271
10:36.090 --> 10:37.140
you know, book appointments,

272
10:37.140 --> 10:39.746
ensure that there's continuity of care.

273
10:39.746 --> 10:40.944
From your lens,

274
10:40.944 --> 10:42.930
what are some of the tech innovations or things

275
10:42.930 --> 10:44.190
that you are excited about

276
10:44.190 --> 10:47.853
that are making that continuity and access easier or better?

277
10:48.960 --> 10:50.417
<v ->Yeah, we're very lucky at Kaiser Permanente,</v>

278
10:50.417 --> 10:52.710
'cause even as an emergency physician,

279
10:52.710 --> 10:55.980
we've been able to always prepare for the future.

280
10:55.980 --> 10:58.050
So you're thinking about

281
10:58.050 --> 11:00.540
a decade ago we started doing telehealth

282
11:00.540 --> 11:02.370
and we started using the patient portal

283
11:02.370 --> 11:05.700
as a leverage tool to educate patients,

284
11:05.700 --> 11:07.410
make sure they can do self-scheduling.

285
11:07.410 --> 11:08.790
A lot of things that we do ourselves now

286
11:08.790 --> 11:12.480
when we book an Uber or we go buy pizza on your apps,

287
11:12.480 --> 11:14.760
think that patients are looking for self-service,

288
11:14.760 --> 11:16.680
no one wants to call and talk to someone

289
11:16.680 --> 11:17.790
unless they really need to.

290
11:17.790 --> 11:19.860
That's just kind of the trend that we were seeing.

291
11:19.860 --> 11:22.530
So we were able to actually cross train our physicians

292
11:22.530 --> 11:23.550
and shift them to go,

293
11:23.550 --> 11:25.200
well, we have a bunch of emergency physicians

294
11:25.200 --> 11:26.760
that also can do virtual care,

295
11:26.760 --> 11:28.740
and we get them licensed in 50 states.

296
11:28.740 --> 11:30.840
So we get 12.5 million Kaiser members

297
11:30.840 --> 11:33.750
that are traveling day and night or at their home,

298
11:33.750 --> 11:35.760
and they can get access to virtual care

299
11:35.760 --> 11:36.780
from an emergency physician,

300
11:36.780 --> 11:38.913
same one that would see them in the ER.

301
11:40.200 --> 11:42.300
And you can do it within the same hour, next hour

302
11:42.300 --> 11:44.310
before you even get in your car and try to go somewhere,

303
11:44.310 --> 11:47.220
go try to go to a waiting room and bring a sleeping bag.

304
11:47.220 --> 11:50.280
So knowing all those things that actually helped us

305
11:50.280 --> 11:54.090
flex our physician workforce by cross-training them.

306
11:54.090 --> 11:56.400
And also, it is great for retention also,

307
11:56.400 --> 11:57.810
because as an emergency physician,

308
11:57.810 --> 11:59.430
I know you're also one too,

309
11:59.430 --> 12:01.800
to have that option to try work virtually sometimes

310
12:01.800 --> 12:03.660
and still provide great care

311
12:03.660 --> 12:06.660
and seeing those patients in the clinic,

312
12:06.660 --> 12:09.450
that flexibility has helped us actually flex our workforce.

313
12:09.450 --> 12:12.210
So when COVID happened, that was a perfect example.

314
12:12.210 --> 12:16.080
We're 85% in office, 15% virtual,

315
12:16.080 --> 12:17.220
and within two weeks,

316
12:17.220 --> 12:18.750
all of Kaiser Permanente across the country,

317
12:18.750 --> 12:23.493
we able to flip that to 85% virtual, 15% in person.

318
12:25.050 --> 12:26.340
<v ->That's really impressive.</v>

319
12:26.340 --> 12:27.234
You got something to add?
<v ->Yeah, no,</v>

320
12:27.234 --> 12:28.067
I was just gonna add,

321
12:28.067 --> 12:29.460
I mean, listening to Dennis,

322
12:29.460 --> 12:32.670
I mean, it's this question of healthcare

323
12:32.670 --> 12:37.590
becoming something we do instead of a place we go, right?

324
12:37.590 --> 12:39.420
So healthcare is still,

325
12:39.420 --> 12:41.550
in a lot of circumstances a place we go.

326
12:41.550 --> 12:43.170
We go to the doctor's office

327
12:43.170 --> 12:45.120
or we go to the hospital, right?

328
12:45.120 --> 12:46.860
And I always draw the analogy with banking,

329
12:46.860 --> 12:48.420
because when I was a kid,

330
12:48.420 --> 12:50.190
my parents went to the bank.

331
12:50.190 --> 12:52.050
That was the only way you could bank

332
12:52.050 --> 12:53.700
was to go physically to the bank.

333
12:53.700 --> 12:56.250
Well, now there aren't even banks left, right?

334
12:56.250 --> 12:57.720
Because banking has become a verb

335
12:57.720 --> 13:00.840
and it's something that is done, you know, actively, right?

336
13:00.840 --> 13:02.940
And I think the opportunity in healthcare is there

337
13:02.940 --> 13:07.500
for the same kind of transformation from a venue-based,

338
13:07.500 --> 13:10.680
you know, rate limited access point

339
13:10.680 --> 13:15.680
to a more sort of 360 degree view of this is what we do.

340
13:16.050 --> 13:17.160
We're doing healthcare,

341
13:17.160 --> 13:18.810
we're not going to the hospital

342
13:18.810 --> 13:20.910
or going to the doctor's office.

343
13:20.910 --> 13:22.680
<v ->That really ties nicely with community health workers</v>

344
13:22.680 --> 13:23.550
because community health workers

345
13:23.550 --> 13:24.960
are going into the community, right?

346
13:24.960 --> 13:28.020
They're presenting healthcare and wellbeing services,

347
13:28.020 --> 13:30.510
not in clinics and not in hospitals,

348
13:30.510 --> 13:33.750
but in libraries or in HUD housing sites

349
13:33.750 --> 13:36.510
or in even grocery stores.

350
13:36.510 --> 13:38.490
Even, you know, walking around the show floor yesterday,

351
13:38.490 --> 13:40.260
there's a pod where you can get, you know,

352
13:40.260 --> 13:42.420
all of your services potentially in a grocery store.

353
13:42.420 --> 13:43.350
You can drop that pod in,

354
13:43.350 --> 13:45.053
you can do your scans, your screenings,

355
13:45.053 --> 13:46.380
you can check your weight,

356
13:46.380 --> 13:47.213
and all of a sudden

357
13:47.213 --> 13:49.560
bring access to people that need it anywhere.

358
13:49.560 --> 13:52.530
And think about rural communities, lower income settings,

359
13:52.530 --> 13:55.320
these are gonna be great technology solutions, right?

360
13:55.320 --> 13:56.820
Other solutions that community health workers

361
13:56.820 --> 13:58.980
are really great at is connecting the people

362
13:58.980 --> 14:00.150
to these devices, right?

363
14:00.150 --> 14:02.220
Community health workers are the ones

364
14:02.220 --> 14:04.290
that can help teach people how to use

365
14:04.290 --> 14:06.270
Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure cuffs,

366
14:06.270 --> 14:07.770
how to help people get screenings

367
14:07.770 --> 14:09.300
done from their home on their phone

368
14:09.300 --> 14:10.380
when they can scan their eye

369
14:10.380 --> 14:12.180
and check for a vision screening.

370
14:12.180 --> 14:13.110
Community health workers are the ones

371
14:13.110 --> 14:14.460
that can link the pieces.

372
14:14.460 --> 14:16.393
The panel before this was, you know, a combination of,

373
14:16.393 --> 14:19.020
I think Uber was there and Verizon, right?

374
14:19.020 --> 14:20.160
Broadband is huge.

375
14:20.160 --> 14:21.240
And so how do we make sure

376
14:21.240 --> 14:22.073
broadband is a part of this conversation,

377
14:22.073 --> 14:24.687
'cause all these devices rely on connectivity.

378
14:24.687 --> 14:26.730
And then of course, telehealth, right?

379
14:26.730 --> 14:29.340
Being able to do things through a device like a phone

380
14:29.340 --> 14:30.240
is gonna be really critical.

381
14:30.240 --> 14:31.073
And of course, Uber.

382
14:31.073 --> 14:32.640
Uber's great as a technology,

383
14:32.640 --> 14:34.650
but if they don't have the training and the skills

384
14:34.650 --> 14:36.060
to teach a Medicaid member

385
14:36.060 --> 14:37.950
who's on food stamps in a rural setting

386
14:37.950 --> 14:40.230
how to use Uber and get access to their doctor

387
14:40.230 --> 14:42.210
through this great technology,

388
14:42.210 --> 14:43.140
they won't be able to use it, right?

389
14:43.140 --> 14:45.000
So that's where the community can really step in

390
14:45.000 --> 14:47.160
and be that tech enable, that handhold,

391
14:47.160 --> 14:49.200
that friendly guide that can help you teach you

392
14:49.200 --> 14:51.150
how to use these devices.

393
14:51.150 --> 14:52.530
<v ->And I guess what I'm thinking about</v>

394
14:52.530 --> 14:55.620
the connection of everything you've beautifully mentioned

395
14:55.620 --> 14:57.660
is the workforce.

396
14:57.660 --> 15:00.090
And that is a real concern,

397
15:00.090 --> 15:03.000
burnout in the healthcare workforce.

398
15:03.000 --> 15:06.360
We know that nurses and physicians are experiencing burnout

399
15:06.360 --> 15:08.370
at similar rates.

400
15:08.370 --> 15:12.944
Our most recent study tells us that nurses and physicians

401
15:12.944 --> 15:16.770
identify and prioritize staffing the workload

402
15:16.770 --> 15:20.100
and the culture of safety in their organizations

403
15:20.100 --> 15:23.880
as the biggest barrier to their own wellbeing.

404
15:23.880 --> 15:26.850
So when we talk about access, you know,

405
15:26.850 --> 15:29.610
I can only imagine how that must have felt

406
15:29.610 --> 15:32.880
to see a patient wait so long.

407
15:32.880 --> 15:37.200
That does not add to your satisfaction in your work

408
15:37.200 --> 15:38.640
because you feel like

409
15:38.640 --> 15:41.700
I can't deliver the care I want to deliver,

410
15:41.700 --> 15:45.160
and you don't have the workforce to move patients

411
15:46.290 --> 15:49.500
through the system and get the care in a timely manner,

412
15:49.500 --> 15:51.990
so that focus on workforce,

413
15:51.990 --> 15:56.550
and how technology can enable clinicians

414
15:56.550 --> 15:58.230
to be with patients,

415
15:58.230 --> 16:01.473
I think connects everything we're talking about.

416
16:02.640 --> 16:04.290
<v ->I'd love to jump in to that.</v>

417
16:04.290 --> 16:05.910
And again, as a practicing physician

418
16:05.910 --> 16:09.300
and seeing some of these struggles of access to care

419
16:09.300 --> 16:12.480
and the lack of technology maybe supporting these

420
16:12.480 --> 16:15.990
or opportunity to do that, right, folks waiting 24,

421
16:15.990 --> 16:16.823
I always say, you know,

422
16:16.823 --> 16:18.780
the worst example for those that aren't aware,

423
16:18.780 --> 16:19.890
a work shift in the ER,

424
16:19.890 --> 16:21.300
thankfully not in my current role,

425
16:21.300 --> 16:24.270
but in the past inside of larger cities,

426
16:24.270 --> 16:27.300
you know, people will have three digit wait times

427
16:27.300 --> 16:28.710
like a hundred hours.

428
16:28.710 --> 16:29.760
Especially unfortunately,

429
16:29.760 --> 16:31.680
like psychiatric care we could go down a rabbit hole

430
16:31.680 --> 16:35.010
But there's some tremendous barriers there to quality care

431
16:35.010 --> 16:36.390
and to satisfaction around burnout.

432
16:36.390 --> 16:38.700
And I think this is a topic I'd love to dive into

433
16:38.700 --> 16:41.160
because burnout is such an important piece.

434
16:41.160 --> 16:41.993
To each of you,

435
16:41.993 --> 16:45.270
how is technology mitigating burnout

436
16:45.270 --> 16:48.510
or improving the situation for healthcare providers

437
16:48.510 --> 16:50.730
at all levels to give better care?

438
16:50.730 --> 16:51.563
If you don't mind, Mary,

439
16:51.563 --> 16:53.280
I'll come back to you and we'll go back down.

440
16:53.280 --> 16:56.310
<v ->So one of the ways we see technology supporting</v>

441
16:56.310 --> 17:01.080
is through AI use in staffing models,

442
17:01.080 --> 17:04.860
being able to predict the level of staffing required,

443
17:04.860 --> 17:06.660
the acuity of the patient,

444
17:06.660 --> 17:10.560
so that not only the right number of staff are present,

445
17:10.560 --> 17:14.460
but the right level of expertise and preparedness

446
17:14.460 --> 17:15.900
in that clinician

447
17:15.900 --> 17:18.630
is at the bedside with the right patient.

448
17:18.630 --> 17:21.150
Certainly it's in beginning stages,

449
17:21.150 --> 17:23.850
but that's a great opportunity as well

450
17:23.850 --> 17:28.850
to grow and evolve that predictive view of census acuity

451
17:29.220 --> 17:31.563
and the right clinician at the bedside.

452
17:33.540 --> 17:34.373
<v ->Yeah, for us,</v>

453
17:34.373 --> 17:35.460
I'm actually curious,

454
17:35.460 --> 17:38.700
does anybody know what a community health worker is?

455
17:38.700 --> 17:40.080
Okay, not bad.

456
17:40.080 --> 17:42.300
Anyone heard of a doula before?

457
17:42.300 --> 17:43.140
Okay, a little better.

458
17:43.140 --> 17:44.910
So maybe just a quick explanation.

459
17:44.910 --> 17:48.120
A community health worker are these frontline workers

460
17:48.120 --> 17:49.050
that have lived experience

461
17:49.050 --> 17:51.480
sometimes in paid and volunteer roles,

462
17:51.480 --> 17:52.680
lots of times at nonprofits.

463
17:52.680 --> 17:54.990
We'll see them at community-based organizations

464
17:54.990 --> 17:57.240
working in public housing sites

465
17:57.240 --> 17:59.250
or in the community working with loneliness

466
17:59.250 --> 18:02.040
and social isolation for older adults in their home.

467
18:02.040 --> 18:03.120
You'll have community health workers

468
18:03.120 --> 18:05.820
at YMCAs and senior centers.

469
18:05.820 --> 18:07.110
They're really just this frontline person

470
18:07.110 --> 18:09.930
that can guide you and navigate you and coordinate care.

471
18:09.930 --> 18:10.950
They go by many different names,

472
18:10.950 --> 18:12.540
which is why probably people that don't realize

473
18:12.540 --> 18:14.280
that community health worker are, you know,

474
18:14.280 --> 18:16.800
call themselves care coordinator or a navigator

475
18:16.800 --> 18:18.060
or a health advocate.

476
18:18.060 --> 18:20.700
But it's really this growing workforce.

477
18:20.700 --> 18:22.410
For them, you know, they're a little bit,

478
18:22.410 --> 18:24.107
you know, emerging as a workforce.

479
18:24.107 --> 18:27.360
And so for them, paper is huge,

480
18:27.360 --> 18:29.610
spreadsheets, they'll bring their notepad into the home.

481
18:29.610 --> 18:30.870
And so we think about technology

482
18:30.870 --> 18:33.360
like there's so much opportunities, right?

483
18:33.360 --> 18:34.740
Back in the days they didn't,

484
18:34.740 --> 18:37.035
you know, do jump on a telehealth call.

485
18:37.035 --> 18:38.250
They would actually drive to your home

486
18:38.250 --> 18:39.660
and visit you and see you.

487
18:39.660 --> 18:41.040
And of course that's part of the value, right?

488
18:41.040 --> 18:42.750
They had that in-person,

489
18:42.750 --> 18:45.090
person-centered, trusted relationship.

490
18:45.090 --> 18:47.790
But for them, documentation has been a big burden, right?

491
18:47.790 --> 18:49.740
Being able to document all the challenges you have,

492
18:49.740 --> 18:52.110
do assessments, come up with goals,

493
18:52.110 --> 18:55.290
create a care plan has been all manual.

494
18:55.290 --> 18:57.540
I visited one of our partners recently

495
18:57.540 --> 18:58.590
that's onboarding with us,

496
18:58.590 --> 19:00.750
and we built a software solution for them.

497
19:00.750 --> 19:01.680
But previously,

498
19:01.680 --> 19:03.660
they had photocopied of a photocopy

499
19:03.660 --> 19:05.220
of a photocopy of a photocopy,

500
19:05.220 --> 19:06.960
which after a while it gets all blurry and you can,

501
19:06.960 --> 19:08.760
I'm sure if anyone worked in community-based organizations,

502
19:08.760 --> 19:09.720
you know what that means.

503
19:09.720 --> 19:10.920
But that's what they're using in the field.

504
19:10.920 --> 19:12.270
And these are, you know,

505
19:12.270 --> 19:15.690
community health nurses actually doing street medicine.

506
19:15.690 --> 19:16.800
And for them, you know,

507
19:16.800 --> 19:18.900
being able to now document on their phone,

508
19:18.900 --> 19:20.100
document on our app,

509
19:20.100 --> 19:22.710
being able to take notes by recording themself

510
19:22.710 --> 19:24.900
and translating that and transcribing it to AI

511
19:24.900 --> 19:27.390
to develop a care plan has been huge.

512
19:27.390 --> 19:28.740
Of course, when someone needs help,

513
19:28.740 --> 19:30.780
they don't have to now get in their car and drive somewhere,

514
19:30.780 --> 19:32.970
they can jump on a telehealth visit

515
19:32.970 --> 19:34.680
and be able to provide them navigation

516
19:34.680 --> 19:36.690
and actually show them how to use things like

517
19:36.690 --> 19:38.850
the SNAP benefits registration site online

518
19:38.850 --> 19:40.980
or getting the Affordable Connectivity Program,

519
19:40.980 --> 19:43.680
which is a program for telehealth and broadband before.

520
19:43.680 --> 19:45.721
So really great ways that technology can be used.

521
19:45.721 --> 19:48.540
And I think the big question for us is

522
19:48.540 --> 19:52.260
how do we go from paper and spreadsheets to the future?

523
19:52.260 --> 19:54.420
And it's not a matter of jumping on day one,

524
19:54.420 --> 19:55.650
we have to slowly transition them

525
19:55.650 --> 19:57.180
because these are sometimes

526
19:57.180 --> 19:59.400
older individuals with less education

527
19:59.400 --> 20:01.560
that we have to kind of slowly walk with them

528
20:01.560 --> 20:02.880
and go at their speed

529
20:02.880 --> 20:04.260
and find ways to easily train them.

530
20:04.260 --> 20:06.810
Because if not, we can actually, you know,

531
20:06.810 --> 20:08.790
lose a big population if they can't keep up

532
20:08.790 --> 20:10.240
with the needs of technology.

533
20:11.430 --> 20:12.263
<v ->Yeah, so Adam,</v>

534
20:12.263 --> 20:15.810
I think about the transactions in healthcare.

535
20:15.810 --> 20:17.550
The transactions in healthcare,

536
20:17.550 --> 20:19.170
whether it's documentation,

537
20:19.170 --> 20:22.500
ordering, billing, insurance claims,

538
20:22.500 --> 20:25.410
they're all unnecessarily complex.

539
20:25.410 --> 20:27.180
And largely, you know,

540
20:27.180 --> 20:29.460
an awful lot of them are still really manual

541
20:29.460 --> 20:30.900
or there's a manual component

542
20:30.900 --> 20:32.910
of processing those transactions.

543
20:32.910 --> 20:34.620
And so I think about automation

544
20:34.620 --> 20:35.520
when I think about the role

545
20:35.520 --> 20:38.100
that technology can play in healthcare.

546
20:38.100 --> 20:39.840
You know, we're on this kind of arc here

547
20:39.840 --> 20:42.660
where we started 15 years ago where the government said,

548
20:42.660 --> 20:44.640
it's ridiculous that all of our medical records

549
20:44.640 --> 20:45.870
are in file cabinets.

550
20:45.870 --> 20:49.200
And so we're gonna have a policy tries to digitize those,

551
20:49.200 --> 20:50.670
you know, the recordkeeping in healthcare.

552
20:50.670 --> 20:51.870
And we've done that.

553
20:51.870 --> 20:53.180
But what we haven't seen in healthcare

554
20:53.180 --> 20:55.920
is the level of automation of transactions,

555
20:55.920 --> 20:57.660
the way we've seen it in other,

556
20:57.660 --> 20:59.637
you know, areas of our lives, right?

557
20:59.637 --> 21:02.280
And so because those processes are manual

558
21:02.280 --> 21:03.630
and because they're all linked

559
21:03.630 --> 21:06.780
to how the organization or the individual gets paid, right,

560
21:06.780 --> 21:08.630
so there's economic skin in the game,

561
21:09.780 --> 21:13.066
folks put up with that burden and they have to do it, right,

562
21:13.066 --> 21:14.910
and they have to engage in these manual processes.

563
21:14.910 --> 21:17.670
And I think there's an enormous opportunity for technology,

564
21:17.670 --> 21:21.240
AI being just one example of the types of technology

565
21:21.240 --> 21:22.080
that could be brought to bear.

566
21:22.080 --> 21:23.760
I'll give you a very quick example.

567
21:23.760 --> 21:25.590
Very basic transaction,

568
21:25.590 --> 21:28.170
verifying a patient's insurance information, right?

569
21:28.170 --> 21:29.700
We've all got our insurance card,

570
21:29.700 --> 21:31.110
you go into your doctor,

571
21:31.110 --> 21:33.360
you present the insurance card to the person

572
21:33.360 --> 21:35.790
at the doctor's office or at the hospital, right?

573
21:35.790 --> 21:38.640
The process of verifying that that's actually you

574
21:38.640 --> 21:40.620
and that that card's not expired

575
21:40.620 --> 21:41.580
and that you actually do have

576
21:41.580 --> 21:43.560
Blue Cross Blue Shield or whatever

577
21:43.560 --> 21:45.510
is done manually in most cases.

578
21:45.510 --> 21:48.000
And we now have built some technology that does that

579
21:48.000 --> 21:50.400
using AI automatically, right?

580
21:50.400 --> 21:52.440
And it's a really low risk, you know,

581
21:52.440 --> 21:53.820
in terms of patient safety issue,

582
21:53.820 --> 21:56.970
but it is taking a manual process in healthcare

583
21:56.970 --> 21:58.470
and automating it the same way

584
21:58.470 --> 22:00.660
when I walk out of here and go down a Starbucks

585
22:00.660 --> 22:03.180
and swipe my card for my coffee,

586
22:03.180 --> 22:04.350
Starbucks somehow knows

587
22:04.350 --> 22:05.490
that I have enough money in my account

588
22:05.490 --> 22:07.350
to buy a $8 coffee, right?

589
22:07.350 --> 22:10.020
Well, why is that not the same process that we have

590
22:10.020 --> 22:11.310
when you present your insurance card

591
22:11.310 --> 22:12.660
at your doctor's office or at a clinic

592
22:12.660 --> 22:14.100
or at an urgent care facility?

593
22:14.100 --> 22:16.530
So how do we automate these things that are,

594
22:16.530 --> 22:19.230
you know, needlessly and mindlessly manual

595
22:19.230 --> 22:21.180
right now in our system?

596
22:21.180 --> 22:22.770
<v ->One quick question on that that I think,</v>

597
22:22.770 --> 22:25.170
you know, folks probably have is why.

598
22:25.170 --> 22:27.390
What's the barrier from your expertise and perspective,

599
22:27.390 --> 22:28.650
why is that adoption so slow

600
22:28.650 --> 22:29.850
when we have it in other places?

601
22:29.850 --> 22:31.530
What do you think just some of the core factors

602
22:31.530 --> 22:33.453
of what slows that growth down?

603
22:35.490 --> 22:37.110
<v ->Yeah, I mean, I'll give one answer.</v>

604
22:37.110 --> 22:40.470
I think some of it is the economics of healthcare, right?

605
22:40.470 --> 22:42.990
So if I am in some other industry

606
22:42.990 --> 22:44.550
that has been disrupted by technology

607
22:44.550 --> 22:45.660
and I've embraced technology

608
22:45.660 --> 22:48.030
and I'm able to do whatever it is I do

609
22:48.030 --> 22:49.350
a heck of a lot cheaper,

610
22:49.350 --> 22:52.200
that's really good for my shareholders, right?

611
22:52.200 --> 22:55.110
In healthcare, there's not an obvious economic incentive

612
22:55.110 --> 22:56.670
to do things faster and better, right?

613
22:56.670 --> 22:57.720
There's no money that flows

614
22:57.720 --> 22:59.640
when you do it faster and better, right?

615
22:59.640 --> 23:02.400
And so, you have to sort of think about it that way.

616
23:02.400 --> 23:03.750
Now, there may be, if you're a hospital,

617
23:03.750 --> 23:05.850
there could be certain circumstances where that's the case,

618
23:05.850 --> 23:07.950
but I think the economic models and incentives

619
23:07.950 --> 23:09.333
are not always there.

620
23:10.410 --> 23:12.390
And so as a result,

621
23:12.390 --> 23:16.740
that pace of innovation has come about largely as a result

622
23:16.740 --> 23:19.620
in my world of government policy and regulations

623
23:19.620 --> 23:20.850
that have started to say,

624
23:20.850 --> 23:22.860
we're gonna require you to have digital recordkeeping,

625
23:22.860 --> 23:24.870
we're gonna require you to do

626
23:24.870 --> 23:26.790
prior authorizations automatically

627
23:26.790 --> 23:28.170
and electronically and so forth.

628
23:28.170 --> 23:29.640
And so, unfortunately,

629
23:29.640 --> 23:31.200
I wish it weren't the case that the government

630
23:31.200 --> 23:32.340
is the driver of innovation,

631
23:32.340 --> 23:34.680
'cause that usually doesn't go very well.

632
23:34.680 --> 23:35.513
But in this case,

633
23:35.513 --> 23:36.480
I think it is government policy

634
23:36.480 --> 23:37.830
that's been nudging the industry

635
23:37.830 --> 23:39.150
because of the lack of economic,

636
23:39.150 --> 23:41.130
obviously economic incentives.

637
23:41.130 --> 23:42.390
<v Adam>Yeah, thanks for sharing that.</v>

638
23:42.390 --> 23:44.220
<v ->Yeah obviously part of it's risk averse also.</v>

639
23:44.220 --> 23:47.610
I mean, we're in healthcare field, it's risk averse.

640
23:47.610 --> 23:50.360
I mean, how many, who's here at CES for the first time?

641
23:51.270 --> 23:52.470
Oh, I love it.

642
23:52.470 --> 23:54.420
So I've been going to CES for about eight years.

643
23:54.420 --> 23:57.330
And as a physician technical leader,

644
23:57.330 --> 23:59.100
I don't go straight to digital health when you get here.

645
23:59.100 --> 24:00.870
I don't go straight to the healthcare side.

646
24:00.870 --> 24:02.640
We actually go to the convention center

647
24:02.640 --> 24:03.900
and go check out the cars

648
24:03.900 --> 24:05.970
and check out all the other cool little gadgets.

649
24:05.970 --> 24:07.800
And not just because you're a technical geek,

650
24:07.800 --> 24:08.910
it's really because you're learning

651
24:08.910 --> 24:10.290
from all the other industries.

652
24:10.290 --> 24:13.290
I think CES presents on the silver platter

653
24:13.290 --> 24:14.310
what's gonna happen in healthcare

654
24:14.310 --> 24:15.300
in the next five to 10 years.

655
24:15.300 --> 24:16.620
It's gonna set the trend.

656
24:16.620 --> 24:18.390
So we rushed over there yesterday

657
24:18.390 --> 24:22.530
and we saw autonomous driving as the big thing now.

658
24:22.530 --> 24:24.000
And I think that actually plays into

659
24:24.000 --> 24:25.170
what we're talking about here too.

660
24:25.170 --> 24:28.260
It's care delivery is like a supply chain, right?

661
24:28.260 --> 24:30.840
There's first mile, there's middle mile, there's last mile.

662
24:30.840 --> 24:32.970
First mile is healthcare team physicians.

663
24:32.970 --> 24:35.460
Last mile is a patient and the support structures

664
24:35.460 --> 24:37.140
that you guys support.

665
24:37.140 --> 24:38.790
Middle mile is technology.

666
24:38.790 --> 24:41.610
And that technology can automate and assist

667
24:41.610 --> 24:43.650
all logistical clerical stuff.

668
24:43.650 --> 24:44.580
And we gotta get that right

669
24:44.580 --> 24:48.120
before we'll start going to the clinical part of automating.

670
24:48.120 --> 24:50.010
But you know, we do that a lot here at Kaiser.

671
24:50.010 --> 24:52.950
We do best practice alerts for sepsis.

672
24:52.950 --> 24:56.100
You know, we make sure that there's proactive care.

673
24:56.100 --> 24:58.470
Even though you're seeing a patient for stubbed toe,

674
24:58.470 --> 24:59.670
they're due for the mammogram,

675
24:59.670 --> 25:00.757
you make sure you order that also.

676
25:00.757 --> 25:02.880
These are all the things that bridge care

677
25:02.880 --> 25:06.360
and makes it more efficient and optimized

678
25:06.360 --> 25:07.620
for that patient visit.

679
25:07.620 --> 25:09.660
I think that also decreased the amount of touchpoints

680
25:09.660 --> 25:10.890
for that patient also,

681
25:10.890 --> 25:14.853
which adds more access to the rest of the workforce.

682
25:16.260 --> 25:18.930
<v ->Thinking about that as well,</v>

683
25:18.930 --> 25:23.850
what would that next level big picture coordination across

684
25:23.850 --> 25:26.520
let's say a hospital, the community,

685
25:26.520 --> 25:30.000
wherever health is needed.

686
25:30.000 --> 25:32.880
Just a snippet of what a hospital looks like

687
25:32.880 --> 25:36.000
when a team is changing shifts.

688
25:36.000 --> 25:41.000
Nurses, physicians, therapists, nutritionists, you name it,

689
25:41.310 --> 25:43.800
were handing off to each other.

690
25:43.800 --> 25:45.540
And then that next person

691
25:45.540 --> 25:49.890
based on their knowledge, experience, workload and demands

692
25:49.890 --> 25:53.580
is prioritizing on their own what they do next.

693
25:53.580 --> 25:57.330
So maybe a case manager's priority is one patient,

694
25:57.330 --> 25:59.910
that patient may be on my list,

695
25:59.910 --> 26:01.653
I may have a different priority.

696
26:02.790 --> 26:04.230
So I've been thinking about

697
26:04.230 --> 26:08.340
how can technology take into consideration

698
26:08.340 --> 26:12.120
the acuity, the complexity and the priorities

699
26:12.120 --> 26:17.120
of patients across an organization, across a population,

700
26:17.310 --> 26:20.430
and prioritize what that shift looks like

701
26:20.430 --> 26:22.410
for every clinician.

702
26:22.410 --> 26:25.530
So that everyone's focused on the same priorities

703
26:25.530 --> 26:27.180
at the same time,

704
26:27.180 --> 26:31.320
making sure everyone gets the right care at the right time

705
26:31.320 --> 26:33.630
with the team circled around them

706
26:33.630 --> 26:36.750
rather than this fragmented priority

707
26:36.750 --> 26:39.093
that everyone does with good intention,

708
26:39.930 --> 26:43.290
but there's not necessarily an alignment during the day.

709
26:43.290 --> 26:47.340
So the patient feels like the team is not coordinated

710
26:47.340 --> 26:49.680
and the team feels the same way,

711
26:49.680 --> 26:53.550
which adds to the stress and the burden and the workload

712
26:53.550 --> 26:56.730
of everyone trying to do the right thing, work together,

713
26:56.730 --> 26:59.640
but the systems aren't enabling us

714
26:59.640 --> 27:02.730
to circle around the bed in a way

715
27:02.730 --> 27:06.570
that feels safe to the patient as well.

716
27:06.570 --> 27:08.310
<v ->And that scenario is like just an example</v>

717
27:08.310 --> 27:10.020
of how complex healthcare is, right?

718
27:10.020 --> 27:11.250
This is not an easy industry

719
27:11.250 --> 27:12.330
and I think none of us here are here

720
27:12.330 --> 27:14.070
because it's simple, right?

721
27:14.070 --> 27:15.060
I think about education.

722
27:15.060 --> 27:16.950
You go to one school and everything is there, right?

723
27:16.950 --> 27:17.783
You have a teacher,

724
27:17.783 --> 27:19.200
you pay them if you're a private school,

725
27:19.200 --> 27:20.160
you get all your education there,

726
27:20.160 --> 27:21.930
and you go home and you learn, right?

727
27:21.930 --> 27:24.210
But in healthcare, you might work with multiple providers,

728
27:24.210 --> 27:25.860
you have plans and different coverages.

729
27:25.860 --> 27:27.240
Maybe you have different settings

730
27:27.240 --> 27:30.330
where you get your pharmacy medicines from and your therapy.

731
27:30.330 --> 27:31.950
I mean, this is a really complex industry

732
27:31.950 --> 27:33.270
and I think that's also the reason why

733
27:33.270 --> 27:34.170
there's so many opportunity

734
27:34.170 --> 27:37.500
for both innovations and new ideas,

735
27:37.500 --> 27:38.793
but also technology.

736
27:40.440 --> 27:42.390
<v ->I've heard everybody here at some point</v>

737
27:42.390 --> 27:43.650
bring up AI, right?

738
27:43.650 --> 27:45.960
AI is the hot button topic across the board,

739
27:45.960 --> 27:48.180
but I'd love to dig in on that for a second.

740
27:48.180 --> 27:49.320
You know, at the clinical level,

741
27:49.320 --> 27:50.910
I personally, you know, we were talking earlier,

742
27:50.910 --> 27:53.370
I use tools like Open Evidence for search and verification.

743
27:53.370 --> 27:54.420
I work overnights alone,

744
27:54.420 --> 27:56.250
so I have no colleague to to fact check with.

745
27:56.250 --> 27:57.090
So that's a great tool.

746
27:57.090 --> 27:59.580
We use AI scribes now from various, you know,

747
27:59.580 --> 28:01.470
everyone has an offering on that.

748
28:01.470 --> 28:03.260
What does AI currently mean for each of you

749
28:03.260 --> 28:06.270
in your respective areas of expertise?

750
28:06.270 --> 28:08.640
And where do you see that going

751
28:08.640 --> 28:09.680
under the umbrella of AI?

752
28:09.680 --> 28:12.150
What is 2.0 of adoption and efficacy

753
28:12.150 --> 28:14.250
in the various areas that you work within?

754
28:16.170 --> 28:20.970
<v ->Certainly within the nursing profession,</v>

755
28:20.970 --> 28:24.270
helping nurses understand the value

756
28:24.270 --> 28:28.620
and helping them to adopt the value of AI

757
28:28.620 --> 28:32.040
and engaging them on the input

758
28:32.040 --> 28:34.230
of how it will help them the most.

759
28:34.230 --> 28:38.760
Currently it is being used in the voice technology

760
28:38.760 --> 28:41.180
within electronic health record,

761
28:41.180 --> 28:44.370
certainly in some of our learning methodologies,

762
28:44.370 --> 28:46.650
but there is so much opportunity

763
28:46.650 --> 28:48.690
bringing nurses in to find out

764
28:48.690 --> 28:51.120
first what would be most helpful to them

765
28:51.120 --> 28:52.890
and then building from there.

766
28:52.890 --> 28:54.840
But the opportunities are limited

767
28:54.840 --> 28:59.840
when I think of virtual nursing documentation,

768
29:00.000 --> 29:05.000
predictive algorithms for preventing infection and falls,

769
29:05.100 --> 29:07.590
improving outcomes, improving the workforce.

770
29:07.590 --> 29:09.333
There's so many opportunities.

771
29:10.710 --> 29:12.510
<v ->Most of our users of our software,</v>

772
29:12.510 --> 29:13.740
and we built a platform

773
29:13.740 --> 29:16.290
that helps empower community health workers,

774
29:16.290 --> 29:18.087
they aren't asking for AI actually.

775
29:18.087 --> 29:19.650
And you know I've been on these sales calls

776
29:19.650 --> 29:20.483
for a year and a half now

777
29:20.483 --> 29:22.020
and not a single provider has asked,

778
29:22.020 --> 29:23.010
what are you doing around AI?

779
29:23.010 --> 29:25.200
You know, some of them are actually afraid of AI.

780
29:25.200 --> 29:26.580
They actually think that sort of replace them.

781
29:26.580 --> 29:28.800
And because these are frontline workers,

782
29:28.800 --> 29:29.700
they think about other industries

783
29:29.700 --> 29:31.980
where these frontline callers or these call centers

784
29:31.980 --> 29:34.110
are being replaced by AI.

785
29:34.110 --> 29:35.730
You know, I think we're a little far from that

786
29:35.730 --> 29:36.563
for healthcare

787
29:36.563 --> 29:37.830
because that's really the value

788
29:37.830 --> 29:38.700
of community health workers, right?

789
29:38.700 --> 29:39.840
Building that trust,

790
29:39.840 --> 29:41.700
being able to understand and interests,

791
29:41.700 --> 29:43.350
being able to ask the right questions,

792
29:43.350 --> 29:45.960
and then provide the navigation and resources.

793
29:45.960 --> 29:47.100
What's exciting is that, you know,

794
29:47.100 --> 29:49.920
there is opportunity for AI to support and enable

795
29:49.920 --> 29:51.570
and really supercharge

796
29:51.570 --> 29:53.280
these community health workers and these frontline workers

797
29:53.280 --> 29:55.170
and help them do their job better.

798
29:55.170 --> 29:57.210
We're exploring a lot of things AI right now

799
29:57.210 --> 29:59.310
and we're actually not telling our customers about that

800
29:59.310 --> 30:00.810
because we don't wanna, you know, scare them.

801
30:00.810 --> 30:02.550
But if it helps them do their job better,

802
30:02.550 --> 30:03.420
it helps them more effective,

803
30:03.420 --> 30:05.370
it helps them get more bills and claims in,

804
30:05.370 --> 30:08.130
so they get paid, then they'll be happy, right?

805
30:08.130 --> 30:09.090
We're doing things around, of course,

806
30:09.090 --> 30:11.850
voice and documentation, billing,

807
30:11.850 --> 30:13.950
but also training and workforce development.

808
30:13.950 --> 30:17.010
Because community health workers is a rather new workforce

809
30:17.010 --> 30:19.410
and a lot of them don't have standardized credentialing,

810
30:19.410 --> 30:21.930
how do we use AI to analyze their calls

811
30:21.930 --> 30:24.840
or to understand their documentation

812
30:24.840 --> 30:26.910
and give them feedback so they can become a better,

813
30:26.910 --> 30:30.360
more empowered and supported community health worker?

814
30:30.360 --> 30:31.770
<v ->Yeah, you know, I,</v>

815
30:31.770 --> 30:33.520
at Athena we talk about curing complexity, right?

816
30:33.520 --> 30:35.520
And so I think AI,

817
30:35.520 --> 30:37.770
and as I talked about transactions earlier,

818
30:37.770 --> 30:39.300
there's not a transaction in healthcare

819
30:39.300 --> 30:42.450
that couldn't benefit from greater automation

820
30:42.450 --> 30:45.210
and some of that automation being driven by AI.

821
30:45.210 --> 30:47.190
So whether it's insurance verification,

822
30:47.190 --> 30:48.120
whether it's understanding

823
30:48.120 --> 30:50.700
we have a epidemic in this country of insurance claims

824
30:50.700 --> 30:52.170
that don't get processed properly

825
30:52.170 --> 30:54.540
because of some tiny amount of information

826
30:54.540 --> 30:56.520
that's missing on the insurance claim, right?

827
30:56.520 --> 30:58.470
And so the doctor doesn't get paid,

828
30:58.470 --> 31:00.030
the clinicians don't get paid,

829
31:00.030 --> 31:01.590
because the insurance company is waiting on

830
31:01.590 --> 31:03.900
some tiny little, you know, dot,

831
31:03.900 --> 31:07.080
you know, box to be checked or T to be crossed, right?

832
31:07.080 --> 31:09.900
AI can actually scour those insurance claims

833
31:09.900 --> 31:11.730
and figure out what's missing and why it's missing

834
31:11.730 --> 31:15.000
and identify where that data lives within a healthcare,

835
31:15.000 --> 31:16.740
you know, electronic ecosystem,

836
31:16.740 --> 31:18.870
and automatically included in the claim, right?

837
31:18.870 --> 31:20.940
So there's a ton that can be done

838
31:20.940 --> 31:22.380
on healthcare transactions.

839
31:22.380 --> 31:23.370
There's also I think a lot

840
31:23.370 --> 31:24.750
that could be done clinically, right?

841
31:24.750 --> 31:26.100
I mean, you were talking about some of the tools,

842
31:26.100 --> 31:28.140
we were talking earlier about some of the tools

843
31:28.140 --> 31:32.760
that physicians are using that put evidence-based medicine

844
31:32.760 --> 31:35.040
at the tip of your finger, right?

845
31:35.040 --> 31:37.080
It would be as if you stopped

846
31:37.080 --> 31:39.240
and spent an hour looking something up and researching it.

847
31:39.240 --> 31:40.110
But you don't have to do that

848
31:40.110 --> 31:41.310
because there's a tool

849
31:41.310 --> 31:42.720
that will put that right at your fingertips.

850
31:42.720 --> 31:45.570
So I think there's enormous clinical applications

851
31:45.570 --> 31:48.780
and I think there's a ton of transactional ones.

852
31:48.780 --> 31:51.600
<v ->Yeah, a lot of the ways we've been proven to use AI</v>

853
31:51.600 --> 31:54.090
at Kaiser Permanente already is more of sensors,

854
31:54.090 --> 31:56.190
like sensors on a car, right?

855
31:56.190 --> 31:59.160
You can't be everything everywhere at once.

856
31:59.160 --> 32:01.620
So what you use is you use AI

857
32:01.620 --> 32:04.380
to detect patient that may deterior in the hospital,

858
32:04.380 --> 32:06.810
you know, based on our AI algorithms.

859
32:06.810 --> 32:09.060
You use AI for population health management,

860
32:09.060 --> 32:12.210
'cause it's just too much data to look through with,

861
32:12.210 --> 32:13.380
you know, human eyes.

862
32:13.380 --> 32:14.220
So we've been doing that

863
32:14.220 --> 32:16.050
and that's actually proven pretty helpful for us.

864
32:16.050 --> 32:17.290
The case for

865
32:18.540 --> 32:20.390
the one that we monitor patients in the hospital

866
32:20.390 --> 32:22.050
to see which ones would deteriorate first,

867
32:22.050 --> 32:24.810
that saved 500 lives since we started started.

868
32:24.810 --> 32:27.630
So it's been been pretty good to be proven that way.

869
32:27.630 --> 32:31.920
But also with 25,000 physicians, you want them to adopt.

870
32:31.920 --> 32:33.660
So by encouraging the adoption,

871
32:33.660 --> 32:35.430
by putting tools in our hand,

872
32:35.430 --> 32:37.950
We use ambient listening for physicians to start trying.

873
32:37.950 --> 32:38.783
Even though they make some really

874
32:38.783 --> 32:40.225
great smart phrases already,

875
32:40.225 --> 32:42.483
we still want them to try ambient listening.

876
32:43.350 --> 32:45.720
We encourage them to use Copilot.

877
32:45.720 --> 32:46.913
We encourage them to use ChatGPT.

878
32:46.913 --> 32:49.800
And now I learned from Adam, Open Evidence.

879
32:49.800 --> 32:52.620
So we try to encourage them to use all these new tools

880
32:52.620 --> 32:54.270
alongside what their standard is,

881
32:54.270 --> 32:55.470
whether it's up to date,

882
32:55.470 --> 32:56.970
whether it's whatever literature they use

883
32:56.970 --> 32:58.710
within their specialty.

884
32:58.710 --> 33:01.230
That allows them to also build their own trust

885
33:01.230 --> 33:03.630
within generative AI.

886
33:03.630 --> 33:04.800
So I think that's the first part,

887
33:04.800 --> 33:07.800
especially with physicians which we are very risk averse,

888
33:07.800 --> 33:09.300
just getting them to put their hands on it

889
33:09.300 --> 33:10.710
and try it and play with it,

890
33:10.710 --> 33:12.030
I think that's the first step.

891
33:12.030 --> 33:13.740
And as the AI gets better,

892
33:13.740 --> 33:15.990
that will also help us already be on board

893
33:15.990 --> 33:17.940
and not just try to get on the bus.

894
33:17.940 --> 33:19.800
<v ->Yeah and actually let me just make one other point,</v>

895
33:19.800 --> 33:21.720
which is you asked earlier

896
33:21.720 --> 33:23.940
why there wasn't the rapid adoption of technology

897
33:23.940 --> 33:25.020
in healthcare.

898
33:25.020 --> 33:27.120
The other point when you said this

899
33:27.120 --> 33:28.860
it made me think of it is,

900
33:28.860 --> 33:31.530
we've got to, I come back to like the Steve Jobs

901
33:31.530 --> 33:32.790
approach to technology, right?

902
33:32.790 --> 33:34.140
The technology has to be developed

903
33:34.140 --> 33:35.880
in order to solve a problem.

904
33:35.880 --> 33:38.820
When it solves the problem, people will flock to it, right?

905
33:38.820 --> 33:40.380
And they will use it and they will adopt it

906
33:40.380 --> 33:43.890
because it's addressing a pain point that they have, right?

907
33:43.890 --> 33:47.710
And so I think sometimes in healthcare we focus on

908
33:48.690 --> 33:50.460
developing technology in a space

909
33:50.460 --> 33:51.480
where there isn't necessarily,

910
33:51.480 --> 33:54.300
where it's not necessarily solving a significant problem.

911
33:54.300 --> 33:57.090
When you think about documentation of notes

912
33:57.090 --> 33:58.410
in a clinical encounter

913
33:58.410 --> 34:00.360
and how those notes ultimately wind up

914
34:00.360 --> 34:02.610
being orders that go into the system

915
34:02.610 --> 34:03.840
to order a prescription

916
34:03.840 --> 34:05.910
or to order additional tests or whatever, right?

917
34:05.910 --> 34:09.630
That process is really manual in most cases, right?

918
34:09.630 --> 34:10.740
And that's changing.

919
34:10.740 --> 34:12.510
Because physicians are starting to realize,

920
34:12.510 --> 34:14.789
hey, I can use Ambient Notes to,

921
34:14.789 --> 34:17.250
you know, use voice recognition software and AI

922
34:17.250 --> 34:18.810
to record the encounter.

923
34:18.810 --> 34:20.940
Right now, it's all about documentation,

924
34:20.940 --> 34:23.160
but it's not that far a leap to say

925
34:23.160 --> 34:25.380
at some point the AI can essentially

926
34:25.380 --> 34:27.990
be turning that conversation with that patient

927
34:27.990 --> 34:29.430
into a set of orders

928
34:29.430 --> 34:31.230
that could ultimately go into a system

929
34:31.230 --> 34:33.000
and automatically that's getting ordered

930
34:33.000 --> 34:36.090
without having to have the extra manual step of,

931
34:36.090 --> 34:37.650
okay, I've seen the patient,

932
34:37.650 --> 34:38.820
I know what tests I wanna order,

933
34:38.820 --> 34:40.860
now I have to go find my medical assistant,

934
34:40.860 --> 34:42.930
download all of this to my medical assistant

935
34:42.930 --> 34:45.390
and have my medical assistant go in some separate system

936
34:45.390 --> 34:46.350
and enter a bunch of orders

937
34:46.350 --> 34:47.760
for a bunch of additional tests, right?

938
34:47.760 --> 34:52.170
That whole manual process can be AI driven and automated.

939
34:52.170 --> 34:53.610
<v ->And the good about AI is that</v>

940
34:53.610 --> 34:54.500
it gets better as you use it.

941
34:54.500 --> 34:56.670
And so it's a plug to anyone out there

942
34:56.670 --> 34:59.670
who's a executive or a physician leader or someone

943
34:59.670 --> 35:01.320
like give some startups a chance.

944
35:01.320 --> 35:02.880
Like, we need help getting feedback,

945
35:02.880 --> 35:04.320
we need help testing things out,

946
35:04.320 --> 35:06.720
give us pilots, help us learn so we can grow.

947
35:06.720 --> 35:08.100
You know, when we first rolled out our platform,

948
35:08.100 --> 35:08.933
it was terrible.

949
35:08.933 --> 35:09.766
It is.

950
35:09.766 --> 35:10.770
I feel bad for anyone that used it,

951
35:10.770 --> 35:12.030
but it only got better over time

952
35:12.030 --> 35:14.430
because we had more people using it, we got more feedback.

953
35:14.430 --> 35:15.660
Now the feedback comes from our customers

954
35:15.660 --> 35:17.040
not from our staff using it.

955
35:17.040 --> 35:18.210
So I think give us a chance,

956
35:18.210 --> 35:20.280
give us a opportunity and the AI will get better,

957
35:20.280 --> 35:21.180
and our platforms will get better,

958
35:21.180 --> 35:22.980
the solutions would get better.

959
35:22.980 --> 35:26.280
<v ->And that will add to our ability to recruit and train</v>

960
35:26.280 --> 35:31.280
and retain a health force for the future.

961
35:31.590 --> 35:34.410
Because the up and coming nurses and physicians,

962
35:34.410 --> 35:36.750
they've been raised in technology,

963
35:36.750 --> 35:39.930
not like us who had to adopt it later on in our career.

964
35:39.930 --> 35:44.430
So they show up and expect to have technology in their hands

965
35:44.430 --> 35:47.040
and it is a great way to retain

966
35:47.040 --> 35:49.053
the staff as well at the bedside.

967
35:50.400 --> 35:52.516
<v ->This has been very insightful,</v>

968
35:52.516 --> 35:54.360
lots of different perspectives.

969
35:54.360 --> 35:55.590
I'd love to leave the audience,

970
35:55.590 --> 35:57.420
many of whom have various, you know,

971
35:57.420 --> 35:59.100
high level roles in their companies as well

972
35:59.100 --> 36:02.670
with something that they could chew on or think about.

973
36:02.670 --> 36:04.519
I'm wondering from each of you in closing,

974
36:04.519 --> 36:07.710
what is one problem that you feel you can't solve

975
36:07.710 --> 36:08.850
internal to your organization

976
36:08.850 --> 36:10.320
that requires external collaboration

977
36:10.320 --> 36:11.550
or external development of tech,

978
36:11.550 --> 36:12.720
something that you're excited

979
36:12.720 --> 36:14.520
to potentially see in the future,

980
36:14.520 --> 36:16.230
something that folks could take home

981
36:16.230 --> 36:18.060
and think on as to a way to innovate,

982
36:18.060 --> 36:20.910
a way to incorporate with others in this system?

983
36:20.910 --> 36:23.520
Mary, if it's good with you, we'll start here.

984
36:23.520 --> 36:25.220
<v ->Sure, I don't feel any pressure.</v>

985
36:27.570 --> 36:29.610
I think the thing we hear the most

986
36:29.610 --> 36:32.620
in our work across so many organizations

987
36:33.630 --> 36:35.970
is healthcare teams having what they need

988
36:35.970 --> 36:37.800
when they need it for their patients.

989
36:37.800 --> 36:41.850
So in any way technology can support

990
36:41.850 --> 36:44.370
them having the right person, the right supply,

991
36:44.370 --> 36:48.600
the right result, the right next step

992
36:48.600 --> 36:50.670
so that they're not hunting and pecking

993
36:50.670 --> 36:54.330
and spending so much time searching for things

994
36:54.330 --> 36:56.700
that the answer is in their hand,

995
36:56.700 --> 36:59.250
the person they need is close,

996
36:59.250 --> 37:03.000
it's easy to communicate across a healthcare team.

997
37:03.000 --> 37:08.000
Anything that eliminates all that time away from a patient

998
37:08.280 --> 37:09.113
would be helpful.

999
37:09.113 --> 37:12.750
Improving the transactions as Joe shared.

1000
37:12.750 --> 37:14.550
Bringing the experts to the patient.

1001
37:14.550 --> 37:16.260
Anything getting rid of,

1002
37:16.260 --> 37:18.750
anything that interferes with that

1003
37:18.750 --> 37:20.100
would be a tremendous help.

1004
37:21.150 --> 37:22.380
<v ->I would just encourage everyone,</v>

1005
37:22.380 --> 37:23.400
and I think this group here

1006
37:23.400 --> 37:25.320
is the innovative forward-thinking group, right?

1007
37:25.320 --> 37:26.940
But go back to your organizations

1008
37:26.940 --> 37:29.010
and see who else is out there that you have to convince

1009
37:29.010 --> 37:30.360
to explore new technologies,

1010
37:30.360 --> 37:31.860
to explore a different workforce.

1011
37:31.860 --> 37:33.540
You know, when we work with frontline workers,

1012
37:33.540 --> 37:34.860
like how can a community health worker

1013
37:34.860 --> 37:37.080
now support more clinics?

1014
37:37.080 --> 37:39.990
We actually train barbershops and barbers

1015
37:39.990 --> 37:41.370
on how to do health screenings

1016
37:41.370 --> 37:43.620
and we're doing that in LA and they're getting paid for it.

1017
37:43.620 --> 37:45.180
So how do they now work with the healthcare system?

1018
37:45.180 --> 37:46.890
So think outside the box.

1019
37:46.890 --> 37:48.300
We need your advocacy, we need your support,

1020
37:48.300 --> 37:49.680
we need your conviction

1021
37:49.680 --> 37:51.900
to look at technology and a different kind of workforce

1022
37:51.900 --> 37:54.207
to involve and support community health and wellbeing.

1023
37:54.207 --> 37:56.670
And I think together we can hopefully move bounds

1024
37:56.670 --> 37:57.503
and try things out

1025
37:57.503 --> 37:59.340
and hopefully get toward a more innovative

1026
37:59.340 --> 38:01.650
whole person care approach to care.

1027
38:01.650 --> 38:04.860
<v ->Yeah, I think the thing that's hard to change</v>

1028
38:04.860 --> 38:08.193
is the inertia against change.

1029
38:09.210 --> 38:13.410
My sister's a COO at a nursing home, she's a nurse.

1030
38:13.410 --> 38:15.030
And she, when I ask her some question

1031
38:15.030 --> 38:16.770
about some inefficiency in the healthcare system,

1032
38:16.770 --> 38:17.670
she'll say to me,

1033
38:17.670 --> 38:18.954
well, Joe, you don't understand,

1034
38:18.954 --> 38:21.270
that's just the way it's, right?

1035
38:21.270 --> 38:24.180
And I think we got to stop accepting things

1036
38:24.180 --> 38:25.530
the way they are, right?

1037
38:25.530 --> 38:26.610
We have to be outraged

1038
38:26.610 --> 38:28.110
the next time we walk into a doctor's office

1039
38:28.110 --> 38:30.210
and they ask us to fill out a HIPAA privacy form

1040
38:30.210 --> 38:31.830
on a clipboard with a pen.

1041
38:31.830 --> 38:32.910
That's outrageous, right?

1042
38:32.910 --> 38:34.380
We need to be bothered by that.

1043
38:34.380 --> 38:37.170
And we need to be developing innovative,

1044
38:37.170 --> 38:40.493
disruptive technologies that say this is status quo.

1045
38:40.493 --> 38:42.870
I mean, I make the point it's a little exaggerated,

1046
38:42.870 --> 38:46.230
but healthcare feels today

1047
38:46.230 --> 38:49.110
a lot like it felt 30 or 40 years ago.

1048
38:49.110 --> 38:51.540
Now that's not to say that we haven't made amazing advances

1049
38:51.540 --> 38:53.310
in terms of how to treat illness

1050
38:53.310 --> 38:54.600
and how to keep people living longer

1051
38:54.600 --> 38:56.100
and living healthier lives.

1052
38:56.100 --> 38:59.040
But the physical experience of healthcare

1053
38:59.040 --> 39:02.370
is almost identical to what it was for my grandfather.

1054
39:02.370 --> 39:03.420
That's crazy.

1055
39:03.420 --> 39:05.420
And we shouldn't accept that status quo.

1056
39:07.470 --> 39:09.000
<v ->So even at Kaiser Permanente,</v>

1057
39:09.000 --> 39:11.790
even though we have so many tools under our belt,

1058
39:11.790 --> 39:14.730
it's still there's a certain set of humility

1059
39:14.730 --> 39:15.720
that we sought to have,

1060
39:15.720 --> 39:16.860
certain Socratic wisdom

1061
39:16.860 --> 39:18.540
that you just know what you don't know.

1062
39:18.540 --> 39:21.030
So that's why I love coming to CES.

1063
39:21.030 --> 39:22.290
I encourage folks, you know,

1064
39:22.290 --> 39:23.430
I see a lot of first timers here,

1065
39:23.430 --> 39:24.504
I encourage you get involved.

1066
39:24.504 --> 39:26.550
You can get involved with CTA.

1067
39:26.550 --> 39:28.530
You can connect the dots with a lot of different folks

1068
39:28.530 --> 39:29.580
like I will be connecting dots

1069
39:29.580 --> 39:31.410
with you guys here afterwards.

1070
39:31.410 --> 39:33.270
And you learn to collaborate

1071
39:33.270 --> 39:35.310
and you learn to kind of grow the pie on

1072
39:35.310 --> 39:36.720
how to all of us solve these problems

1073
39:36.720 --> 39:38.820
because there's no one organization

1074
39:38.820 --> 39:39.805
that can solve everything.

1075
39:39.805 --> 39:41.790
We've seen some of the big guns

1076
39:41.790 --> 39:43.620
try to join in healthcare and try to solve,

1077
39:43.620 --> 39:45.060
and we saw how that lasted.

1078
39:45.060 --> 39:46.620
So I think it's the folks in this room

1079
39:46.620 --> 39:48.930
that are actually have passionate about healthcare.

1080
39:48.930 --> 39:50.340
You know, connect the dots with others around here

1081
39:50.340 --> 39:51.173
because I think that's where,

1082
39:51.173 --> 39:53.473
coming to here the last eight years

1083
39:53.473 --> 39:56.070
has really been enriching for me

1084
39:56.070 --> 39:58.260
to always learn something new and connect the dots.

1085
39:58.260 --> 40:00.480
And now we have many different partnerships

1086
40:00.480 --> 40:02.070
with Kaiser Permanente

1087
40:02.070 --> 40:04.080
with many other folks in the room.

1088
40:04.080 --> 40:05.760
<v ->If I can add one last.</v>

1089
40:05.760 --> 40:08.730
That is the thought of workplace safety

1090
40:08.730 --> 40:10.200
for healthcare workers.

1091
40:10.200 --> 40:13.650
Violence against healthcare workers is on the rise

1092
40:13.650 --> 40:16.257
and has grown exponentially since COVID.

1093
40:16.257 --> 40:20.370
And I've been so impressed by the level of security here.

1094
40:20.370 --> 40:22.800
Hospitals don't have that level of security

1095
40:22.800 --> 40:26.370
when nurses and physicians are walking out to their cars

1096
40:26.370 --> 40:28.830
or patients are escalating

1097
40:28.830 --> 40:31.890
because they're frustrated in the emergency room,

1098
40:31.890 --> 40:35.790
or in our mental health areas.

1099
40:35.790 --> 40:39.240
So thinking about safety for healthcare providers

1100
40:39.240 --> 40:40.950
if I could leave you with one thought

1101
40:40.950 --> 40:43.290
that would be real important as well.

1102
40:43.290 --> 40:44.123
<v ->That's fantastic.</v>

1103
40:44.123 --> 40:45.840
Thank you to everyone on our panel

1104
40:45.840 --> 40:47.490
and thanks to the audience for listening in.

1105
40:47.490 --> 40:49.366
We really appreciate it.

1106
40:49.366 --> 40:53.327
(audience applauding)

1107
40:53.327 --> 40:55.910
(upbeat music)
