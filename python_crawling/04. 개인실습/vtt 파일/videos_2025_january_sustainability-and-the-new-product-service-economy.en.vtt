00:00.003 --> 00:02.570
(bright music)

00:10.203 --> 00:12.503
- We're good. We have
a thumbs up, awesome.

00:12.503 --> 00:14.203
Well, thank you all for being here.

00:14.203 --> 00:18.703
It's a real treat for me
and hopefully for you.

00:18.703 --> 00:23.703
We have an extraordinary panel
of sustainability leaders,

00:23.970 --> 00:27.236
corporate leaders whose
companies are focusing on

00:27.236 --> 00:30.136
the greatest challenges
that humanity faces today,

00:30.136 --> 00:33.603
from very different
industrial perspectives,

00:33.603 --> 00:36.936
but united in a goal of inventing a future

00:36.936 --> 00:41.936
that is good for all of our
future citizens of this planet.

00:42.836 --> 00:44.970
So I'd like to just go down the row,

00:44.970 --> 00:46.603
these are actually the friends of mine,

00:46.603 --> 00:50.236
so we'll go down the row and
they can introduce themselves

00:50.236 --> 00:52.103
and then I'll give you a little context

00:52.103 --> 00:53.670
and we'll get right into it.

00:53.670 --> 00:55.503
So please.

00:55.503 --> 00:56.836
- Hi, I am Amelia DeLuca.

00:56.836 --> 00:59.236
I'm the Chief Sustainability
Officer at Delta Airlines

00:59.236 --> 01:01.170
and I won't make you raise your hands,

01:01.170 --> 01:03.670
as I often do to say how
many people flew in on Delta,

01:03.670 --> 01:05.236
but I'm hoping you're familiar with Delta

01:05.236 --> 01:07.536
and have enjoyed our
fast, free wifi recently.

01:07.536 --> 01:10.736
- (laughs) I'm Barbara Humpton,
a proud Sky Miles member.

01:10.736 --> 01:11.703
- Yes.
- At Delta.

01:11.703 --> 01:13.836
- Exactly.
- And CEO of Siemens

01:13.836 --> 01:15.370
in the US.

01:15.370 --> 01:18.403
- I'm Lars Stenqvist, I'm
the CTO of Volvo Group.

01:18.403 --> 01:21.503
And the Volvo Group is then trucks, buses,

01:21.503 --> 01:22.636
construction equipment.

01:22.636 --> 01:26.103
It's in principle everything
with a Volvo logo onto it,

01:26.103 --> 01:27.703
but not passenger cars.

01:28.570 --> 01:30.770
- I'm Angela Baker, Chief
Sustainability Officer

01:30.770 --> 01:34.470
of Qualcomm and I'll keep my
miles program just to myself.

01:35.936 --> 01:38.103
- Yes, we didn't invite her
to the sphere last night,

01:38.103 --> 01:40.703
but she lives in DC, so she's forgiven.

01:40.703 --> 01:41.570
- Fantastic.

01:41.570 --> 01:44.503
So what's really exciting
about the panel is,

01:44.503 --> 01:47.403
as I mentioned, each of
the companies is focused

01:47.403 --> 01:51.370
with laser sort of
intensity on sustainability.

01:51.370 --> 01:53.536
And we're gonna talk a
bit about that right now.

01:53.536 --> 01:56.203
It's really exciting,
too, to have companies

01:56.203 --> 02:00.603
that are so committed to
this and keynoting at CES

02:00.603 --> 02:02.370
and talking about sustainability,

02:02.370 --> 02:05.636
because the challenge is
so great and so close in.

02:05.636 --> 02:07.736
So let me give you a
little quick framework

02:07.736 --> 02:10.170
that we can think about
that we're gonna talk to you

02:10.170 --> 02:15.103
and the real experts are gonna
lead us on an exploration

02:15.103 --> 02:16.370
of where they see things going

02:16.370 --> 02:18.070
for their companies and industries.

02:18.070 --> 02:20.836
But when we talk about sustainability,

02:20.836 --> 02:25.836
we really focus on the
notion of the amount of CO2

02:25.936 --> 02:28.203
that's been put into the atmosphere.

02:28.203 --> 02:31.170
And I live about a mile
and a half or two miles

02:31.170 --> 02:32.870
from the fires that are going on

02:32.870 --> 02:36.770
in Southern California right
now and destroying homes,

02:36.770 --> 02:38.270
where I live is fine,

02:38.270 --> 02:41.603
but I think all of us have
seen the recent effects

02:41.603 --> 02:45.303
of weather and that could be storms

02:45.303 --> 02:50.303
for water located communities,
fire, all sorts of really,

02:50.436 --> 02:54.136
you know, impactful and almost

02:54.136 --> 02:56.936
leave you incredulous moments.

02:56.936 --> 03:01.370
And what you see in those
is a global atmosphere

03:01.370 --> 03:04.336
that's heating up and the
reason why it's heating up

03:04.336 --> 03:06.903
and putting more energy
into this closed system

03:06.903 --> 03:08.936
called the Earth that has an atmosphere

03:08.936 --> 03:11.803
that's only five miles high, roughly.

03:11.803 --> 03:13.703
And you can drive that in five minutes

03:14.536 --> 03:18.503
at highway speeds is because
we're taking dinosaurs

03:18.503 --> 03:22.136
and plants from under the
ground called fossil carbon.

03:22.136 --> 03:26.136
And they are all basically,
it's all sort of CO2

03:26.136 --> 03:28.770
and we're using it to energize our world

03:28.770 --> 03:30.036
and it goes in the atmosphere

03:30.036 --> 03:32.536
and it doesn't go away,
for thousands of years.

03:32.536 --> 03:35.370
So it's a massive challenge

03:35.370 --> 03:40.370
to rethink everything we do as humans

03:40.870 --> 03:44.570
in a way that we're not
utilizing that type of energy.

03:44.570 --> 03:47.236
And the good news is that
renewable energy sources

03:47.236 --> 03:50.236
are as prevalent as they
are and it's only growing

03:50.236 --> 03:52.136
and they're the cheapest.

03:52.136 --> 03:55.470
So the the last thing I want to say is

03:55.470 --> 03:59.236
that if you look at this as a negative,

03:59.236 --> 04:02.270
you'll put yourself in
that proverbial frog

04:02.270 --> 04:04.336
that's in the water and
the water's heating up.

04:04.336 --> 04:06.836
You're just in the hot water
and I can't do anything.

04:06.836 --> 04:08.670
The real way to flip this is

04:08.670 --> 04:10.870
that while it's an existential problem,

04:10.870 --> 04:13.303
it's the largest
opportunity for innovation

04:13.303 --> 04:15.070
in the history of humanity.

04:15.070 --> 04:18.503
And to give you a number just
that you might want to use,

04:18.503 --> 04:23.503
the IEA, which is a big
energy agency in Vienna,

04:24.570 --> 04:28.103
says we're spending $2 trillion
a year on clean energy.

04:28.103 --> 04:30.869
Most people think that number
in the next three to five

04:30.869 --> 04:34.069
years, we'll go up to
five trillion a year.

04:34.069 --> 04:36.136
We need to spend as much as we can.

04:36.136 --> 04:38.469
The global economy is
about a hundred trillion,

04:38.469 --> 04:39.969
so that's doable.

04:39.969 --> 04:42.269
It's a new business opportunity.

04:42.269 --> 04:44.603
And just to give you a sense
of how big that number is,

04:44.603 --> 04:46.503
the five largest companies in the world

04:46.503 --> 04:47.369
are all tech companies.

04:47.369 --> 04:50.169
Their market cap is total 15 trillion.

04:50.169 --> 04:53.336
We'll be spending that
every three years or more,

04:53.336 --> 04:55.336
granted to save ourselves from ourselves.

04:55.336 --> 04:57.869
But with companies like we have here,

04:57.869 --> 05:01.269
the focus truly is on mass
scaling the opportunity

05:01.269 --> 05:03.736
to reverse the problems that we're having

05:03.736 --> 05:07.136
and leave future generations
with an Earth they can inhabit.

05:07.136 --> 05:11.036
So with that, I would
actually like to dive right in

05:11.036 --> 05:12.869
and hopefully that was helpful.

05:12.869 --> 05:16.636
But I'd like to, you know, go to Barbara,

05:16.636 --> 05:20.736
because Barbara's company
has an unbelievable history

05:20.736 --> 05:24.269
in the world of sustainability
and its philosophy.

05:24.269 --> 05:26.469
And I was hoping you could
talk a little bit about that,

05:26.469 --> 05:28.369
Barbara, to the audience,
'cause it amazed me

05:28.369 --> 05:29.869
when you gave me the background.

05:29.869 --> 05:31.636
- Happy to do that, John.

05:31.636 --> 05:35.736
Siemens, born over 175 years ago,

05:35.736 --> 05:37.403
and it turned out in 2010,

05:37.403 --> 05:39.736
a year before I joined the company,

05:39.736 --> 05:42.236
the global strategists
came together and said,

05:42.236 --> 05:44.503
"How should we focus
our business strategy?"

05:44.503 --> 05:48.703
And they said, "We wanna
recognize the global mega trends

05:48.703 --> 05:51.836
that are gonna affect our
business for the next,

05:51.836 --> 05:54.436
between now and 2050," five of 'em.

05:54.436 --> 05:56.936
Climate change, urbanization,

05:56.936 --> 06:00.536
the aging demographics
of people everywhere,

06:00.536 --> 06:03.403
the ever increasing global supply chain,

06:03.403 --> 06:06.136
now we say glocal, and the
digitalization of everything,

06:06.136 --> 06:07.936
five global mega trends.

06:07.936 --> 06:10.936
The world is gonna look
completely different in 2050.

06:10.936 --> 06:13.803
How can Siemens technology

06:13.803 --> 06:16.103
actually address the global mega trends?

06:16.103 --> 06:18.636
And it turns out if you
try your business strategy

06:18.636 --> 06:22.236
to inexorable forces,
you're going to grow,

06:22.236 --> 06:23.836
you're going to succeed.

06:23.836 --> 06:28.136
This is the business
opportunity of our generation.

06:28.136 --> 06:32.603
And so today, we publish an
annual sustainability report,

06:32.603 --> 06:35.836
you would see that over
90% of our portfolio

06:35.836 --> 06:39.436
can be used to address
sustainability challenges.

06:39.436 --> 06:41.069
We're talking about decarbonization,

06:41.069 --> 06:43.503
we're talking about energy efficiency.

06:43.503 --> 06:46.569
We're giving people the tools to actually

06:46.569 --> 06:50.136
design for a circular economy.

06:50.136 --> 06:53.436
We're designing for
reusability even, you know,

06:53.436 --> 06:54.736
using materials.

06:54.736 --> 06:58.369
All of those tools, think about this,

06:58.369 --> 07:00.903
using the digital tools that have come

07:00.903 --> 07:02.369
to the commercial world,

07:02.369 --> 07:04.103
to our entertainment world, et cetera,

07:04.103 --> 07:07.036
and applying those to the real world.

07:07.036 --> 07:09.903
I'm talking about AI for real,

07:09.903 --> 07:12.036
combining the real and the digital,

07:12.036 --> 07:14.769
so that we are designing things
that are more sustainable.

07:14.769 --> 07:18.636
We're living in a more sustainable
way with digitalization,

07:18.636 --> 07:20.569
with the tools and technologies

07:20.569 --> 07:22.503
you're seeing at this very show.

07:22.503 --> 07:25.403
We have the ability to do all of this

07:25.403 --> 07:29.936
and be more productive, be more efficient,

07:29.936 --> 07:32.836
and driving profitability,
driving sustainability,

07:32.836 --> 07:34.603
it all goes hand in hand.

07:34.603 --> 07:36.069
It's a fantastic opportunity.

07:36.069 --> 07:36.903
- [John] I love that.

07:36.903 --> 07:39.869
And if you do not do anything else,

07:39.869 --> 07:43.536
but get down to our group members' booths,

07:43.536 --> 07:44.369
at the Siemens booth,

07:44.369 --> 07:47.236
you'll just see a brilliant explanation

07:47.236 --> 07:48.836
of this future vision.

07:48.836 --> 07:49.736
So that really, that really-
- Thanks.

07:49.736 --> 07:52.703
I mean, what we've tried to
do is show our technology

07:52.703 --> 07:54.669
through our customer's work.

07:54.669 --> 07:57.069
So please come visit us.
- Please do.

07:57.069 --> 08:01.603
I want to go to Lars next before Amelia,

08:04.103 --> 08:07.103
then Angela, because Lars's industry,

08:07.103 --> 08:10.936
they create extraordinarily large things.

08:10.936 --> 08:14.136
And just to give you a sense,
we put 40 gigatons of CO2

08:14.136 --> 08:16.636
into the atmosphere every year.

08:16.636 --> 08:19.569
That would be the equivalent
of, just to give you,

08:19.569 --> 08:21.336
that's a large amount, right?

08:21.336 --> 08:23.003
So how large is that?

08:23.003 --> 08:28.003
That would be 311 million Airbus A321s

08:29.603 --> 08:33.469
or Lars's new state-of-the-art truck.

08:33.469 --> 08:37.036
It would be roughly three
and a half billion of those.

08:37.036 --> 08:40.436
My favorite is 8 billion elephants.

08:40.436 --> 08:45.436
But the world that Lars works
in is called hard to abate.

08:45.903 --> 08:48.236
It's very hard to make
these industries green,

08:48.236 --> 08:51.436
like all of our and we're
gonna get to the others, too.

08:51.436 --> 08:53.603
Can you tell me about how
you're thinking about this

08:53.603 --> 08:58.103
as a complete system, because
it's really quite eye-opening.

08:59.036 --> 08:59.869
- Yes, John.

08:59.869 --> 09:04.303
And for us, since we are
in transport and logistics,

09:04.303 --> 09:06.136
we have defined it very, very clearly

09:06.136 --> 09:08.236
that we are in a fantastic industry,

09:08.236 --> 09:10.936
because there will be a lot
of growth going forward.

09:10.936 --> 09:13.836
We are a true growth case as a company.

09:13.836 --> 09:16.403
So there will be much more
transport in the world

09:16.403 --> 09:18.969
going forward, there's no doubt about it.

09:18.969 --> 09:21.703
But we cannot go on as we are doing today,

09:21.703 --> 09:24.069
because the planet can simply not cope

09:24.069 --> 09:28.703
with even what we are
delivering in emissions today.

09:28.703 --> 09:31.969
That means that the new
logistic and transport system

09:31.969 --> 09:35.069
must be sustainable to a
completely different level

09:35.069 --> 09:36.303
compared to today.

09:36.303 --> 09:40.069
So our business idea, our
strategy going forward

09:40.069 --> 09:44.836
is to deliver on the promise
of being fossil free by 2040.

09:44.836 --> 09:47.436
Fossil free, both from
an emission perspective

09:47.436 --> 09:49.769
coming out of the vehicles
but also and completely

09:49.769 --> 09:52.903
decarbonized in the value chain upstreams.

09:52.903 --> 09:54.269
And why 2040?

09:54.269 --> 09:57.036
Because our vehicles are
on the road for 10 years

09:57.036 --> 10:00.802
and by 2050, according
to the Paris Agreement,

10:00.802 --> 10:02.969
our commitment is that the rolling fleet

10:02.969 --> 10:06.936
of Volvo vehicles should
be CO2 free or fossil free.

10:06.936 --> 10:09.802
So for us, John, we are
total around much about this.

10:09.802 --> 10:13.402
This with sustainability is not
besides the normal business,

10:13.402 --> 10:16.602
it's not anything that we are
discussing Friday afternoon

10:16.602 --> 10:18.902
after three o'clock or
something like that.

10:18.902 --> 10:21.836
That's really the business
idea of the company

10:21.836 --> 10:24.736
and we believe that it's both necessary,

10:24.736 --> 10:26.536
from a planet perspective

10:26.536 --> 10:29.502
and it's definitely good business case.

10:29.502 --> 10:32.269
- See, I think exactly to the point.

10:32.269 --> 10:34.336
You have to remember, for the audience,

10:34.336 --> 10:38.436
that roughly 85% of the
emissions of companies

10:38.436 --> 10:40.636
have happened after their product

10:40.636 --> 10:44.236
leaves the actual company's
factories and the like.

10:44.236 --> 10:46.236
So this thinking that we're hearing about

10:46.236 --> 10:50.002
is systems thinking and
it's an extremely complex

10:50.002 --> 10:51.169
challenge and problem.

10:51.169 --> 10:55.136
And that was what Lars,
you know, said so clearly

10:55.136 --> 10:56.869
and what we all have to be doing.

10:56.869 --> 10:59.469
You know, as Barbara as
well was talking about that.

10:59.469 --> 11:03.436
Amelia, I'd like to, you
know, get your thoughts on,

11:03.436 --> 11:07.336
you know, the vision in terms
of where you see Delta going

11:07.336 --> 11:09.536
and you know, the opportunities,

11:09.536 --> 11:11.469
but also there are significant challenges

11:11.469 --> 11:13.569
in all of the industries represented here.

11:13.569 --> 11:16.036
And aviation has a
specifically difficult one,

11:16.036 --> 11:19.269
'cause it's basically moving
fuel and people around.

11:19.269 --> 11:22.636
But you guys have taken a
very, very focused approach

11:22.636 --> 11:25.702
of thinking about what the
next 20 or 30 years looks like,

11:25.702 --> 11:28.636
even in what was called
a hard to abate industry.

11:28.636 --> 11:30.436
So can you just give us,
you know, sort of the

11:30.436 --> 11:33.036
thought process and how you
guys are looking at that?

11:33.036 --> 11:34.569
- Yeah, exactly. We were really proud.

11:34.569 --> 11:36.536
For those that did not
have a chance to join us

11:36.536 --> 11:38.769
at the sphere last night, we
kicked off our celebration

11:38.769 --> 11:42.102
of our hundred year, you know,
centennial birthday of Delta.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.736
And so a hundred years ago,

11:43.736 --> 11:45.369
there was no commercial aircraft flying.

11:45.369 --> 11:46.602
There was crop dusters.

11:46.602 --> 11:47.969
And you think about how far we've come

11:47.969 --> 11:50.402
and how many of us now
travel by, you know, air,

11:50.402 --> 11:52.469
but still only one in
five people in the world

11:52.469 --> 11:53.802
have access to air travel.

11:53.802 --> 11:55.669
And so our mission is to continue to grow

11:55.669 --> 11:57.769
the number of communities that
are connected to air travel,

11:57.769 --> 12:00.936
the number of opportunities
are facilitated by air travel

12:00.936 --> 12:03.002
and we believe we can do
that with all the things

12:03.002 --> 12:04.536
that make Delta special, right?

12:04.536 --> 12:08.436
Safety, best in class,
operational reliability,

12:08.436 --> 12:11.436
incredible customer experience
in a premium service,

12:11.436 --> 12:13.102
and sustainability.

12:13.102 --> 12:15.202
And so last night, we talked
about these three acts.

12:15.202 --> 12:17.502
The past, the present, and the future.

12:17.502 --> 12:19.569
And everything in the
future that Delta's gonna do

12:19.569 --> 12:21.669
is gonna be all the things we're known for

12:21.669 --> 12:23.002
and sustainability.

12:23.002 --> 12:26.169
And we nestle sustainability
in thinking about what we fly,

12:26.169 --> 12:28.069
how we fly, and the fuel we use.

12:28.069 --> 12:29.436
We announced a partnership with Airbus.

12:29.436 --> 12:31.436
We have many partners, of course.

12:31.436 --> 12:33.869
Airbus is just a really
special partner to us.

12:33.869 --> 12:36.436
And they, you know, we
don't make airplanes, right?

12:36.436 --> 12:38.002
There are things we
can do in our operation

12:38.002 --> 12:40.236
to control our fuel efficiency,
and we're doing that.

12:40.236 --> 12:41.769
And then when it comes to
the fuels of the future,

12:41.769 --> 12:43.502
it's gonna take a whole
ecosystem around that.

12:43.502 --> 12:45.302
And so Airbus is committed to helping us

12:45.302 --> 12:46.702
rethink the airplane of the future

12:46.702 --> 12:48.869
that can be immensely more fuel efficient.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.969
They're gonna help us think
about what can we do today,

12:50.969 --> 12:52.936
especially looking at
the way nature operates,

12:52.936 --> 12:55.569
biomimicry to potentially fly like geese,

12:55.569 --> 12:57.969
to be able to start to do
some sort of drafting system,

12:57.969 --> 13:00.436
where the airplane in the
lead is generating the draft

13:00.436 --> 13:02.336
so that the airplane in the
back is potentially saving

13:02.336 --> 13:05.336
five to 8% of fuel as it
crosses the transatlantic.

13:05.336 --> 13:06.436
And then they're gonna help us

13:06.436 --> 13:07.602
with many other great partners

13:07.602 --> 13:09.469
try to rethink about
the fuels of the future.

13:09.469 --> 13:12.169
That they don't need to come
from these finite resources

13:12.169 --> 13:13.336
in the earth, but they can come from

13:13.336 --> 13:16.769
renewable resources, while also
building rural communities.

13:16.769 --> 13:18.736
And that exactly is what has been said.

13:18.736 --> 13:19.936
That is a business imperative.

13:19.936 --> 13:22.069
That's a win-win-win all around.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.036
- Again, you're hearing
about the opportunity

13:24.036 --> 13:25.502
mixed with the challenge,

13:25.502 --> 13:28.269
and the challenge is
driving the opportunity.

13:28.269 --> 13:30.669
So it's really exciting that people,

13:30.669 --> 13:34.069
your companies are really
embracing this in such a big way.

13:34.069 --> 13:36.902
Of course we want as many companies

13:36.902 --> 13:38.269
to think the way you are.

13:38.269 --> 13:41.269
Now we're gonna turn to something
that I think is, you know,

13:41.269 --> 13:43.902
at the core of all of what is going on

13:43.902 --> 13:47.169
in all of our economies, which
is the semiconductor world.

13:47.169 --> 13:49.036
And Angela works at Qualcomm,

13:49.036 --> 13:51.036
which is one of the largest
semiconductor companies,

13:51.036 --> 13:52.702
one of the most innovative
semiconductor companies

13:52.702 --> 13:56.902
in the world, powers so many
devices and large scale things.

13:56.902 --> 14:00.469
And we know that there's some,
you know, issues in terms

14:00.469 --> 14:03.469
of the amount of electricity
being consumed for AI.

14:03.469 --> 14:06.136
I know you're, we could go through stats,

14:06.136 --> 14:07.436
but we won't right now, it's a lot.

14:07.436 --> 14:09.102
It could double the
amount of electricity used

14:09.102 --> 14:10.802
within the next three to five years.

14:10.802 --> 14:12.802
It's roughly, I'll do it, it's roughly..

14:15.136 --> 14:18.002
Data centers are roughly
two to 4% of total CO2

14:18.002 --> 14:19.769
output in the world.

14:19.769 --> 14:23.502
Energy use and GDP are highly correlated.

14:23.502 --> 14:26.569
So the work that you guys are doing

14:26.569 --> 14:29.536
is helping to power a new economy,

14:29.536 --> 14:31.836
and yet there are challenges
that you have in your business.

14:31.836 --> 14:34.102
Could you lay that out
in whatever way you think

14:34.102 --> 14:36.436
the audience would get the
benefit of your thinking

14:36.436 --> 14:39.669
around sort of the
semiconductor sustainability,

14:39.669 --> 14:40.969
you know, cross cut?

14:40.969 --> 14:43.736
- Yeah, absolutely. I mean,
it's a very interesting point.

14:43.736 --> 14:45.136
It's a point that's talked about a lot.

14:45.136 --> 14:46.869
I mean, I think if you've
walked the show floor at all,

14:46.869 --> 14:49.802
you see AI everywhere,
everybody's talking about it.

14:49.802 --> 14:51.469
And there's a lot of promises as to what

14:51.469 --> 14:52.769
AI can deliver, right?

14:52.769 --> 14:54.636
And so from a Qualcomm perspective,

14:54.636 --> 14:59.636
we are really focusing on AI
at the edge or AI on device,

14:59.869 --> 15:03.402
which will have less of an
impact from an energy perspective

15:03.402 --> 15:05.202
than if it goes to the cloud.

15:05.202 --> 15:08.669
And so working with developers
across the ecosystem

15:08.669 --> 15:10.936
to develop technologies
that can be, you know,

15:10.936 --> 15:13.436
where inference can be done
on the edge or at the edge

15:13.436 --> 15:15.436
or on device, which will use less,

15:15.436 --> 15:16.869
it won't be driving
everything to the cloud.

15:16.869 --> 15:19.202
It won't be needing all of
these massive data centers

15:19.202 --> 15:20.169
to power it.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.602
At the same time, there
will still be data centers.

15:22.602 --> 15:24.269
There's a lot of large
cloud companies, right,

15:24.269 --> 15:27.036
that are coming up with, I
think you saw Three Mile Islands

15:27.036 --> 15:28.202
being reopened, right?

15:28.202 --> 15:30.602
Nuclear, like a lot of
these new technologies

15:30.602 --> 15:32.602
or old technologies that
companies are gonna try

15:32.602 --> 15:33.735
to use again.

15:33.735 --> 15:36.669
We're also a member of the
semi climate consortium, right?

15:36.669 --> 15:38.769
We're working with other
semiconductor companies.

15:38.769 --> 15:40.335
Right, 'cause Qualcomm sits
in a unique place, right?

15:40.335 --> 15:42.002
We're primarily fabless.

15:42.002 --> 15:44.069
We don't manufacture the
technology that we make,

15:44.069 --> 15:46.435
we design it for the most part,

15:46.435 --> 15:49.002
but working with others
with across the value chain

15:49.002 --> 15:53.702
to help governments or
work with governments

15:53.702 --> 15:56.269
in these areas like
Singapore, you know, Korea,

15:56.269 --> 15:59.035
Taiwan, where it's very
expensive to get renewable energy

15:59.035 --> 16:01.369
or impossible to get renewable energy,

16:01.369 --> 16:03.435
to help them bring more
green energy to the grid

16:03.435 --> 16:08.269
so that when you've got the
fabs or the the foundries

16:09.102 --> 16:11.135
where they're making
these technologies, right?

16:11.135 --> 16:12.969
So that they can be powered
by renewable energy.

16:12.969 --> 16:13.802
So I think there's a lot of really

16:13.802 --> 16:15.669
interesting things happening.

16:15.669 --> 16:18.269
We're looking, you know,
AI use cases across auto,

16:18.269 --> 16:20.069
you know, in handsets, MPCs.

16:20.069 --> 16:21.435
And if you stop by the Qualcomm booth,

16:21.435 --> 16:23.535
you can see sort of all of
these latest technologies.

16:23.535 --> 16:25.669
We're really focused on
sort of this on-prem, right?

16:25.669 --> 16:27.402
Like on device or AI at the edge.

16:27.402 --> 16:29.469
And we think this is
gonna be a game changer

16:29.469 --> 16:33.435
in terms of, you know, not
driving everything to the cloud,

16:33.435 --> 16:36.602
which is really gonna increase
energy and water usage,

16:36.602 --> 16:37.802
which is also a huge problem.

16:37.802 --> 16:39.302
- It's a great counterintuitive point,

16:39.302 --> 16:42.135
'cause a lot of people think
that charging your iPhone

16:42.135 --> 16:45.469
or your Android phone is
actually the largest energy use.

16:45.469 --> 16:48.569
It's actually the phone talking
to servers all the time.

16:48.569 --> 16:52.535
So charging it is almost
nil in the global context.

16:52.535 --> 16:53.369
- And a lot of it's
around the build, right?

16:53.369 --> 16:55.202
So for a company like Qualcomm
who's mixed semiconductor,

16:55.202 --> 16:56.635
it's very small piece of the phone,

16:56.635 --> 16:58.669
but the plastic and the
phone and those other things

16:58.669 --> 17:00.302
obviously have a much larger footprint.

17:00.302 --> 17:02.002
- So when you're thinking about climate,

17:02.002 --> 17:06.402
as Angela was just saying,
or sorry, around carbon,

17:06.402 --> 17:08.569
you have to look at what
are the biggest pieces

17:08.569 --> 17:11.802
of the system that are
providing, you know,

17:11.802 --> 17:16.802
the fossil fuel outputs
or inputs to the system.

17:16.935 --> 17:18.902
And when I think about, you know,

17:18.902 --> 17:20.335
where each of you have been,

17:20.335 --> 17:25.235
it's a integrated world of supply chains

17:25.235 --> 17:29.535
and partners on the downstream,
which is outta the factory

17:29.535 --> 17:33.969
who are often, you know,
they sell to end customers.

17:33.969 --> 17:35.502
And then you have all the people,

17:35.502 --> 17:36.502
Volvo told us this morning

17:36.502 --> 17:38.569
they have 50,000 direct suppliers,

17:38.569 --> 17:40.169
which is just extraordinary.

17:42.469 --> 17:44.702
Barbara, I know you have
a great example on this,

17:44.702 --> 17:46.035
of thinking this way,

17:46.035 --> 17:49.502
and then Lars, you can
speak to this as well,

17:49.502 --> 17:51.735
that supply chain is a great place

17:51.735 --> 17:55.202
for helping make this problem one,

17:55.202 --> 17:57.069
an opportunity for suppliers,

17:57.069 --> 17:59.702
but two, for really reducing
carbon output quickly.

17:59.702 --> 18:01.569
And I know you're focused on that.

18:01.569 --> 18:03.169
- We are, we're focused on that.

18:03.169 --> 18:06.302
Again, the question is
what knowhow can we bring

18:06.302 --> 18:10.702
to the table in order to
facilitate this progress

18:10.702 --> 18:12.335
with our groups of customers?

18:12.335 --> 18:15.535
And you quickly see systems
thinking is required.

18:15.535 --> 18:18.502
There's no one company, no
matter how big they get,

18:18.502 --> 18:20.935
that actually verticalizes everything.

18:20.935 --> 18:24.135
You really have to believe in ecosystems.

18:24.135 --> 18:27.369
And actually what's even more
powerful is when industries,

18:27.369 --> 18:30.402
whether it's the airline
industry or the tech industry,

18:30.402 --> 18:32.469
you see their Chief
Sustainability Officers

18:32.469 --> 18:35.002
stepping forward and saying,
"We're gonna work together,

18:35.002 --> 18:36.835
because there are things we
need to do as a community."

18:36.835 --> 18:39.435
Well, the automotive industry
in Europe is a great example.

18:39.435 --> 18:42.102
If this is the example
you're thinking of, Catena-X.

18:42.102 --> 18:43.035
- That's it,
- Right?

18:43.035 --> 18:47.135
So what is the carbon
footprint of an automobile?

18:47.135 --> 18:49.102
Well, to answer that question,

18:49.102 --> 18:50.969
you have to get into the supply chain.

18:50.969 --> 18:54.102
And I'm telling you it is
many, many, many layers deep.

18:54.102 --> 18:56.902
Well, who's gonna be
revealing that kind of company

18:56.902 --> 18:59.835
proprietary information and
building all of that up?

18:59.835 --> 19:03.602
Turns out that we can use a
technology like blockchain,

19:03.602 --> 19:07.469
which gives us the ability
to anonymize certain data,

19:07.469 --> 19:09.569
but to share critical components,

19:09.569 --> 19:12.302
put it onto a secure blockchain

19:12.302 --> 19:14.102
so that within that supply chain,

19:14.102 --> 19:17.369
there's clear communication
about the carbon footprint.

19:17.369 --> 19:20.535
It can be then built up and
calculated using the data

19:20.535 --> 19:23.702
that's in this very secure format.

19:23.702 --> 19:26.835
This kind of commitment from
European car manufacturers

19:26.835 --> 19:31.335
to recognize that solving this problem

19:31.335 --> 19:33.235
helps us solve the bigger problem.

19:33.235 --> 19:35.902
To me, this is a brilliant example.

19:35.902 --> 19:37.669
- I just love it because you know,

19:37.669 --> 19:39.869
the words that people often say is

19:39.869 --> 19:41.669
you can't solve a system problem,

19:41.669 --> 19:44.069
which is the climate problem in silos.

19:44.069 --> 19:46.635
And the key piece is
bringing data together

19:46.635 --> 19:49.135
that typically was competitive data

19:49.135 --> 19:51.469
that you didn't want others to see.

19:51.469 --> 19:53.769
But that is, of course,
cutting your nose off

19:53.769 --> 19:56.902
to spite your face and trying
to solve a systems problem.

19:56.902 --> 19:59.335
So there was an example this morning

19:59.335 --> 20:03.102
that was so impactful to me, which is,

20:03.935 --> 20:06.402
and Lars, you can tell us about it,

20:06.402 --> 20:08.535
which is the Volvo group partnering

20:08.535 --> 20:10.669
with its largest competitor

20:10.669 --> 20:13.135
to solve the problem for humanity.

20:13.135 --> 20:15.002
Can you tell us a little
more what you talked about?

20:15.002 --> 20:16.035
It was amazing.

20:16.035 --> 20:18.502
- Well, if I may start then John,

20:18.502 --> 20:20.802
for us then we see very clearly that this

20:20.802 --> 20:22.769
partnership is so important.

20:22.769 --> 20:25.869
Our CEO and President Martin
Lundstedt has an expression

20:25.869 --> 20:29.569
where he's stating partnership
is truly the new leadership.

20:29.569 --> 20:32.569
And we are coming from a
point, let's say 10 years ago,

20:32.569 --> 20:35.235
where we were extremely transactional,

20:35.235 --> 20:36.569
extremely transactional,

20:36.569 --> 20:40.535
sending out thick books of
specifications to suppliers

20:40.535 --> 20:43.335
and asking them to suppliers exactly

20:43.335 --> 20:45.302
according to that specification.

20:45.302 --> 20:49.035
That doesn't work anymore. That's gone.

20:49.035 --> 20:52.335
Now we know approximately in
what direction we are going.

20:52.335 --> 20:54.069
We need to team up with those ones

20:54.069 --> 20:58.202
that are on the same path,
thinking in the same direction,

20:58.202 --> 21:00.569
sharing the same values,
wanting to solve the same

21:00.569 --> 21:04.335
kind of problem without a
thick book of specifications.

21:04.335 --> 21:08.135
So we are doing that
downstreams towards customers,

21:08.135 --> 21:10.435
upstreams with normal suppliers,

21:10.435 --> 21:13.302
but all sudden a little
bit unorthodox for us,

21:13.302 --> 21:15.502
reaching out to our competitors.

21:15.502 --> 21:16.368
And in this case,

21:16.368 --> 21:20.435
we are reaching out to our main
competitor, Daimler Trucks.

21:20.435 --> 21:23.935
It's really us and them against
each other in the world.

21:23.935 --> 21:28.435
And we have decided that we
want to set up a joint venture

21:28.435 --> 21:32.735
around something as core
as the software defined

21:32.735 --> 21:36.035
vehicle platform, hardware and software

21:36.035 --> 21:39.002
up to the level of the operative system.

21:39.002 --> 21:42.202
This is really the core
of the future vehicles.

21:42.202 --> 21:44.535
And that means that in the longer run,

21:44.535 --> 21:47.502
we will have identical computers on board

21:47.502 --> 21:49.335
on the vehicles, in both groups.

21:49.335 --> 21:53.535
We will have identical software
after operative system.

21:53.535 --> 21:55.368
But from that level and onwards,

21:55.368 --> 21:58.635
we will continue to be fierce competitors.

21:58.635 --> 22:00.768
So we are creating a joint venture,

22:00.768 --> 22:03.402
where we are going to be friends, family,

22:03.402 --> 22:06.335
hug each other in the board
meetings once a quarter

22:06.335 --> 22:09.535
and every single minute of
the rest of the quarter,

22:09.535 --> 22:11.002
the instruction to my engineers

22:11.002 --> 22:12.835
is to beat the **** out of them.

22:12.835 --> 22:15.235
(panelists laughing)
- Love that.

22:15.235 --> 22:18.002
- And you know, so why are we doing this?

22:18.002 --> 22:20.735
Because we see that it
will be excessive amount

22:20.735 --> 22:23.402
of investments in these
areas going forward.

22:23.402 --> 22:26.002
Volumes in our industry
is relatively small

22:26.002 --> 22:28.102
compared to (indistinct) et cetera.

22:28.102 --> 22:30.302
So what we are doing here is that we are

22:30.302 --> 22:33.335
freeing up resources in this development.

22:33.335 --> 22:36.635
And to be honest, it is
not a computer as such,

22:36.635 --> 22:38.668
it is not operative system as such

22:38.668 --> 22:40.868
that will define customer value.

22:40.868 --> 22:45.168
That will define if we
will win or lose the game.

22:45.168 --> 22:48.502
It's all the vehicle
functions on top of this,

22:48.502 --> 22:50.535
which we are going to develop on our own.

22:50.535 --> 22:52.868
So for us, it's so
interesting with partnership,

22:52.868 --> 22:56.735
it's downstreams, it's
upstream, it is with academia,

22:56.735 --> 22:58.668
it is with competitors.

22:58.668 --> 23:01.335
Partnership is the new leadership.

23:01.335 --> 23:02.702
- I love that phrase.

23:02.702 --> 23:05.802
And you know, it reminds me
an example that you can use

23:05.802 --> 23:09.068
is from Angela's world.

23:09.068 --> 23:12.468
Semiconductors are
customized in a lot of cases,

23:12.468 --> 23:13.835
but they're often not.

23:13.835 --> 23:16.035
They're put together to
provide different products

23:16.035 --> 23:17.102
and services.

23:17.102 --> 23:20.135
Lars, you're working in a
particularly important vertical,

23:20.135 --> 23:22.802
but the innovation happens
on top in product service

23:22.802 --> 23:24.135
differentiation.

23:24.135 --> 23:27.168
But it would be as if we
didn't have a, you know,

23:27.168 --> 23:31.135
specification for how our cell
phones talk to the network.

23:31.135 --> 23:32.835
You're not gonna innovate unless you have

23:32.835 --> 23:35.535
something like that, which
brings the thought to mind,

23:35.535 --> 23:37.935
which is, and anybody can raise their hand

23:37.935 --> 23:41.768
and take this one, which is this notion of

23:41.768 --> 23:45.302
you have this world and
we're enthralled by it,

23:45.302 --> 23:49.102
specifically here in the US,
of Silicon Valley innovation,

23:49.102 --> 23:51.102
one of the most innovative
places in the world.

23:51.102 --> 23:53.068
But what we were talking about before

23:53.068 --> 23:55.935
and what I like to say is
the greatest VC companies

23:55.935 --> 23:58.535
in the world mostly were software focused

23:58.535 --> 24:02.902
and they would get maybe
one to 10% success rates

24:02.902 --> 24:04.035
in their portfolios.

24:04.035 --> 24:08.435
That means 90 to 99% of their activities

24:08.435 --> 24:10.268
and investments fail.

24:10.268 --> 24:13.168
Well, if the planet is at
the state that it's in,

24:13.168 --> 24:15.235
we can't only rely on that.

24:15.235 --> 24:18.035
It's sort of a mythology that goes on.

24:18.035 --> 24:19.335
But there's something really important

24:19.335 --> 24:22.168
that I've learned about and
these companies here have,

24:22.168 --> 24:24.202
which is called entrepreneurship.

24:24.202 --> 24:26.835
And so anybody would like to pick it up

24:26.835 --> 24:31.835
or you know, from aerospace
to, what is this feeling

24:32.235 --> 24:34.702
that you have about driving innovation

24:34.702 --> 24:36.435
in working with the outside world?

24:36.435 --> 24:38.002
Lars was just mentioning it,

24:38.002 --> 24:39.635
but does someone wanna pick up on that,

24:39.635 --> 24:40.835
'cause it's super important, I think.

24:40.835 --> 24:42.535
- Yeah, I'll take it.

24:42.535 --> 24:44.935
You know, I think sometimes
we wonder what is our role

24:44.935 --> 24:46.968
as an airline to be innovative, right?

24:46.968 --> 24:49.535
And one of the things that we
stood up at CES two years ago

24:49.535 --> 24:51.035
was our Sustainable Skies lab.

24:51.035 --> 24:52.968
And there was such a great
example yesterday that came up

24:52.968 --> 24:55.468
with Airbus, again, coming
back to this flying V concept

24:55.468 --> 24:57.702
that Airbus has proven
the science of this.

24:57.702 --> 24:59.402
We know that this works, that the airplane

24:59.402 --> 25:02.468
that's following behind
will get a 5% reduction.

25:02.468 --> 25:05.135
The challenge is how do you
operationalize that, right?

25:05.135 --> 25:07.102
And that's where you need
that entrepreneurial spirit,

25:07.102 --> 25:08.835
but it has to also work in the real world.

25:08.835 --> 25:10.235
And so these labs take that

25:10.235 --> 25:13.802
and essentially translate
this exercise from a lab

25:13.802 --> 25:15.968
into the real world because that is often

25:15.968 --> 25:17.235
the hardest step, to a degree.

25:17.235 --> 25:19.135
Yes, financing is a challenge.

25:19.135 --> 25:20.568
Proving technology is a challenge,

25:20.568 --> 25:22.668
but at least in our world,
the hardest thing is

25:22.668 --> 25:24.002
how do you push it into an industry

25:24.002 --> 25:27.602
that is just so complex
in terms of what we do.

25:27.602 --> 25:29.235
But we have to start to
do these little pilots

25:29.235 --> 25:30.635
and we also have to accept failure.

25:30.635 --> 25:32.668
We did one this last year
with a company called Taxi,

25:32.668 --> 25:33.968
but it wasn't a failure.

25:33.968 --> 25:35.802
But it also didn't end up,

25:35.802 --> 25:37.668
we didn't end the year
the way we thought it was.

25:37.668 --> 25:40.068
And we had to come to terms
with that to celebrate the fact

25:40.068 --> 25:42.368
that we piloted the product
not in the way we thought

25:42.368 --> 25:43.935
we would, we didn't
necessarily get the results

25:43.935 --> 25:46.068
that we wanted, we didn't
get all the parties on board,

25:46.068 --> 25:47.868
but we still did something about it.

25:47.868 --> 25:50.202
And learning that is
better than doing nothing.

25:50.202 --> 25:51.702
- So, you know, I like that,

25:51.702 --> 25:53.902
'cause these learning
systems are really important

25:53.902 --> 25:55.668
and they're not traditional to the books

25:55.668 --> 25:58.035
that Lars was mentioning
about product spec

25:58.035 --> 26:01.502
to now needing innovation to
come from the supply chain.

26:01.502 --> 26:03.368
And Barbara, in your world,

26:03.368 --> 26:05.335
you work on some of the most complex,

26:05.335 --> 26:08.502
multi-dimensional engineering
challenges at city scale

26:08.502 --> 26:11.902
and beyond and building
entire infrastructures.

26:11.902 --> 26:13.635
So to the extent that, you know,

26:13.635 --> 26:16.435
you need to partner and have
an entrepreneurial spirit

26:16.435 --> 26:18.268
and look for outside partnerships,

26:18.268 --> 26:19.835
how do you guys think about that

26:19.835 --> 26:21.935
just in terms of making it work

26:21.935 --> 26:24.568
and we need to all make it work
faster, as you pointed out?

26:24.568 --> 26:27.102
- Yeah, you know, this is
the lifeblood of a company

26:27.102 --> 26:28.602
that survives more than a hundred years,

26:28.602 --> 26:31.335
or in our case, 175 years.

26:31.335 --> 26:34.668
It's pivot or die. It's innovate or die.

26:35.735 --> 26:38.802
And I have a popcorn popper in my head

26:38.802 --> 26:43.601
because this is where the opportunity is.

26:43.601 --> 26:45.135
I'm looking at Annie Satto here,

26:45.135 --> 26:46.935
she is our Head of Communications.

26:46.935 --> 26:49.435
She introduced me to Fast Company

26:49.435 --> 26:51.401
when I first stepped into the CEO role.

26:51.401 --> 26:55.035
And I remember talking to the
editor at the time who said,

26:55.035 --> 26:55.968
"Whoa.

26:55.968 --> 26:59.068
Whoa, wait, you're telling me
a large company like yours,

26:59.068 --> 27:01.035
sounds like you guys
are really innovative."

27:01.035 --> 27:03.835
And a couple of years later after proving,

27:03.835 --> 27:06.368
you know, showing the kind of
innovation we've been doing,

27:06.368 --> 27:08.868
it's not just Silicon Valley companies

27:08.868 --> 27:10.768
who can drive this.

27:10.768 --> 27:13.868
Siemens was named World
Changing Company of the Year

27:13.868 --> 27:15.001
by Fast Company.

27:15.001 --> 27:17.601
One of the proudest moments of my tenure.

27:17.601 --> 27:19.068
Well, where does this come from?

27:19.068 --> 27:24.068
It comes from imbuing that
feeling, that innovation happens

27:27.135 --> 27:28.835
with two people over a napkin.

27:29.735 --> 27:30.868
Right?

27:30.868 --> 27:33.235
That's where every innovation starts.

27:33.235 --> 27:36.035
There's no magic, you know, machine

27:36.035 --> 27:37.101
that puts out innovation.

27:37.101 --> 27:40.235
No, it's people getting ideas

27:40.235 --> 27:42.101
and then putting them into action.

27:42.101 --> 27:44.068
Now in our case, what we try to do

27:44.068 --> 27:47.635
is foster this in every aspect.

27:47.635 --> 27:49.035
We've got a VC arm,

27:49.035 --> 27:52.168
it's off exploring what's
the startup community doing

27:52.168 --> 27:53.268
and are there things going on

27:53.268 --> 27:55.035
that we need to be paying attention to?

27:55.035 --> 27:56.701
We do it by investing.

27:56.701 --> 27:59.735
We're actually, we have a
Siemens Financial Services

27:59.735 --> 28:02.835
that goes and invests in an
ecosystem of small companies.

28:02.835 --> 28:05.701
They've chosen things like
the future of agriculture

28:05.701 --> 28:08.201
or battery manufacturing as areas

28:08.201 --> 28:10.435
where we can deploy capital

28:10.435 --> 28:14.001
with outside entrepreneurs
to get things going.

28:14.001 --> 28:15.301
But when we did that, we say,

28:15.301 --> 28:17.335
"But wait, what have we got inside?

28:17.335 --> 28:19.035
We've got battery experts here."

28:19.035 --> 28:20.135
And when you come to our booth,

28:20.135 --> 28:22.101
right, you'll be able to meet folks.

28:22.101 --> 28:25.668
So how can we tap into the
knowhow in our own organization.

28:25.668 --> 28:30.435
We actually built a
decarbonization business optimizer

28:30.435 --> 28:33.701
using Siemens knowhow,
handing it to our Siemens

28:33.701 --> 28:35.535
Financial Services colleagues

28:35.535 --> 28:38.868
so they could be advising
outside companies

28:38.868 --> 28:41.901
about how they could start
their sustainability journey.

28:41.901 --> 28:44.401
I mean, this is everywhere.

28:44.401 --> 28:47.601
The challenge to our
organization is to simply say

28:47.601 --> 28:51.701
"What talent, what resources
do you have in your remit?

28:51.701 --> 28:53.501
And how can you be working toward

28:53.501 --> 28:54.968
that sustainability objective?"

28:54.968 --> 28:56.068
- I think it's a great point because

28:56.068 --> 28:58.035
what it really reflects in my mind

28:58.035 --> 29:00.568
is this need to be able to scale quickly

29:00.568 --> 29:02.735
given the timeframes
that we're dealing with.

29:02.735 --> 29:07.001
So you know, the classic
example in material science

29:07.001 --> 29:12.001
to get green steel, you'd go
from lab and literally grams.

29:12.501 --> 29:15.868
But to make the tons that Lars needs

29:15.868 --> 29:19.968
could be decades in just
literally getting it to work.

29:19.968 --> 29:22.535
So we're not talking about
like finding investors,

29:22.535 --> 29:26.835
it's literally material
science, physics, chemistry.

29:26.835 --> 29:29.535
So these types of amplifications

29:29.535 --> 29:31.701
that we're talking about are what we need

29:31.701 --> 29:33.035
because we don't have all the time.

29:33.035 --> 29:35.235
- I'd love to ask how this
works in the semiconductor.

29:35.235 --> 29:36.735
- I was just gonna go to semiconductors.

29:36.735 --> 29:38.301
- Well, I mean, but mainly because,

29:38.301 --> 29:40.835
I mean, it's such a
capital intensive business,

29:40.835 --> 29:43.168
it has such long development cycles.

29:43.168 --> 29:44.701
How do you drive that kind of innovation?

29:44.701 --> 29:45.635
- And can I add to that?

29:45.635 --> 29:47.735
Just maybe it'll help frame it too

29:47.735 --> 29:50.735
is you're the most
partner driven industry.

29:50.735 --> 29:52.101
I'm not saying the rest aren't,

29:52.101 --> 29:55.068
but your partners spec in
many respects what you need.

29:55.068 --> 29:57.868
So can you combine your
answer with that thought

29:57.868 --> 29:59.368
and what Barbara just asked you,

29:59.368 --> 30:00.601
or take it wherever you'd like?

30:00.601 --> 30:02.768
- Yeah, I mean obviously
I'm not on the design side,

30:02.768 --> 30:03.601
so I think there's probably other people-

30:03.601 --> 30:06.168
- Chief Sustainability
Officer, doing the good work.

30:06.168 --> 30:07.501
- Yeah, there's probably
other people at the company.

30:07.501 --> 30:09.035
- With the green outfit on, perfect.

30:09.035 --> 30:10.668
- Yeah. I'm very on brand.

30:10.668 --> 30:13.001
But I do think for a
company like Qualcomm,

30:13.001 --> 30:15.401
I mean obviously many
companies are very innovative,

30:15.401 --> 30:17.235
but innovation at the heart of what we do,

30:17.235 --> 30:18.601
we're 40-year-old tech company, right?

30:18.601 --> 30:19.868
We've been doing this for a long time.

30:19.868 --> 30:22.035
And under our current CEO,

30:22.035 --> 30:24.335
really looking at a
diversification strategy.

30:24.335 --> 30:26.568
So traditionally, right,
had been in handsets,

30:26.568 --> 30:31.001
but it's handsets, it's auto,
it's AI, it's PCs, right?

30:31.001 --> 30:33.768
And so those all have slightly different,

30:35.168 --> 30:36.435
call it what you will, right?

30:36.435 --> 30:37.668
And in addition to that,

30:37.668 --> 30:39.335
once the semiconductor is developed

30:39.335 --> 30:41.001
or once the chip is developed

30:41.001 --> 30:44.168
and then it's out there, what
are the use cases for it?

30:44.168 --> 30:46.635
Because there's so many use cases for it.

30:46.635 --> 30:48.035
And the way that, you know,

30:48.035 --> 30:50.735
I might be approaching use
cases, better for the planet,

30:50.735 --> 30:54.168
better for people, for
humanity, social, you know,

30:54.168 --> 30:57.368
might not have been the intended use.

30:57.368 --> 30:58.935
You can think about like
GPS when GPS was designed,

30:58.935 --> 31:02.068
it was for emergency services obviously,

31:02.068 --> 31:05.235
but now like we've got programs
where fishermen are using it

31:05.235 --> 31:07.135
or fisherpeople are using
it in many countries

31:07.135 --> 31:08.735
around the world to ensure
that they're not crossing

31:08.735 --> 31:10.568
international waters when
they're fishing, right?

31:10.568 --> 31:12.768
So I mean, that's like
a very basic example,

31:12.768 --> 31:15.068
but I think that's the key for innovation.

31:15.068 --> 31:16.201
And for a company like Qualcomm,

31:16.201 --> 31:18.135
which continues to innovate.

31:18.135 --> 31:20.135
We are looking at things, I
mean it's been in our DNA,

31:20.135 --> 31:22.635
but reducing the power that's needed.

31:22.635 --> 31:25.801
Every chip, every new product
that we design, right?

31:25.801 --> 31:28.635
That's not a sustainability
play, that's a customer play.

31:28.635 --> 31:30.468
We've been doing that for a long time.

31:30.468 --> 31:32.235
We wanna continue to drive performance

31:32.235 --> 31:34.901
and to increase performance
while reducing power usage.

31:34.901 --> 31:37.601
Why? Because our customers
are demanding that.

31:37.601 --> 31:39.535
I'm a big fan of it because
from an energy perspective

31:39.535 --> 31:40.368
it's a good thing.

31:40.368 --> 31:41.901
But I think at the end of the day,

31:41.901 --> 31:43.635
it's a business imperative.

31:43.635 --> 31:45.835
And so I think for a company like Qualcomm

31:45.835 --> 31:48.301
with over 140,000 patent or you know,

31:48.301 --> 31:50.068
we continue to innovate.

31:50.068 --> 31:52.535
It's something that the
company is very focused on.

31:52.535 --> 31:54.535
And I think whether it's the process,

31:54.535 --> 31:57.101
whether it's using digital
twins to design semiconductors,

31:57.101 --> 31:59.901
like whatever that's
gonna be in the future,

31:59.901 --> 32:02.568
I think it's imperative for us.

32:02.568 --> 32:04.601
- [John] So I wanna ask, oh just..

32:04.601 --> 32:06.401
Do you want a quick follow on on that?

32:06.401 --> 32:09.401
- Sure. Because it's so good
to listen to you, Angela.

32:09.401 --> 32:13.135
Because so much needs to happen
in the electronics industry.

32:13.135 --> 32:15.501
What we are doing when
we are decarbonizing

32:15.501 --> 32:18.034
the manufacturing footprint
of our vehicle as we take it

32:18.034 --> 32:21.668
as a sort kind of
(indistinct) steel, aluminum,

32:21.668 --> 32:23.534
rubber, et cetera, et cetera.

32:23.534 --> 32:26.934
Electronics comes surprisingly high, 10%,

32:26.934 --> 32:29.934
all the manufacturing
footprint is electronics.

32:29.934 --> 32:32.868
So Barbara, and you know,
there is some work to do here.

32:32.868 --> 32:37.634
- We are hearing from-
(group chattering)

32:39.101 --> 32:42.134
- I do wanna, the points
are really interesting,

32:42.134 --> 32:44.434
'cause if you think about
how we've been talking

32:44.434 --> 32:46.134
and what we've been talking about,

32:46.134 --> 32:48.868
we've been talking from a
leadership point of view

32:48.868 --> 32:53.668
and so you know, many
companies, 30% of the S&amp;P 500

32:53.668 --> 32:55.768
does not have a net zero plan.

32:55.768 --> 32:57.834
So there are many company and the US

32:57.834 --> 33:00.001
is a little bit all
over the place on this,

33:00.001 --> 33:03.301
but many companies don't have
the commitment you're hearing.

33:03.301 --> 33:04.868
Commitment doesn't mean it's easy.

33:04.868 --> 33:06.734
Commitment doesn't mean
you'll hit the targets

33:06.734 --> 33:09.168
at the right point, but it's a commitment.

33:09.168 --> 33:12.801
I wanna flip it because in
many engineering driven firms,

33:12.801 --> 33:15.534
the real issue in carbon
is in the bottom up,

33:15.534 --> 33:18.334
the material science, how
you make things and the like.

33:18.334 --> 33:21.701
But there's another really
important opportunity

33:21.701 --> 33:26.501
in business around climate,
climate tech and sustainability,

33:26.501 --> 33:28.101
which is your own people

33:28.101 --> 33:30.934
and them feeling that
they are part of something

33:30.934 --> 33:33.934
that's not destroying the planet.

33:33.934 --> 33:35.734
You know, think cigarette companies,

33:35.734 --> 33:38.601
once we all knew it caused
cancer and they said it wasn't.

33:38.601 --> 33:43.068
But Angela, I can only
imagine what it might do

33:43.068 --> 33:46.501
for the broader population
of people who work for Delta

33:46.501 --> 33:48.534
to know that you're in
a leadership position

33:48.534 --> 33:49.868
in a hard to abate industry.

33:49.868 --> 33:52.834
Can you tell us about how that
actually changes the dynamic

33:52.834 --> 33:53.668
in your company?

33:53.668 --> 33:55.234
- You know, I think part
of this is evolution, too.

33:55.234 --> 33:57.468
When we all started on our
sustainability journeys, right?

33:57.468 --> 33:59.401
We talked so much about net zero,

33:59.401 --> 34:01.634
being aligned to the Paris
Agreement, getting investors,

34:01.634 --> 34:03.268
you know, satisfied with where we were at.

34:03.268 --> 34:05.768
And now I think we spent
the last year-ish not only

34:05.768 --> 34:08.001
building into our business,
that's the business imperative,

34:08.001 --> 34:10.468
but making sure we deeply
understand how our customers

34:10.468 --> 34:12.301
and our employees feel about the topic

34:12.301 --> 34:13.468
so that we're meeting their needs.

34:13.468 --> 34:14.901
Every one of us is an individual

34:14.901 --> 34:16.568
and I think when it
comes to sustainability,

34:16.568 --> 34:19.534
it's a very individual feeling
about what's important to me,

34:19.534 --> 34:21.501
both at work and on the personal side.

34:21.501 --> 34:23.968
So a couple examples I'll give
you from our customer data,

34:23.968 --> 34:27.934
75% of customers, Gen Z,
premium loyalists, you name it,

34:27.934 --> 34:29.501
they expect us to be sustainable.

34:29.501 --> 34:32.468
We are a premium brand. They
expect us to be sustainable.

34:32.468 --> 34:34.801
So that was great news.
Probably not super unsurprising.

34:34.801 --> 34:36.134
That's great news.

34:36.134 --> 34:39.434
When you actually ask them
what is causing you tension,

34:39.434 --> 34:41.834
what is making you feel like
we're not sustainable, right?

34:41.834 --> 34:43.601
I live and breathe CO2,

34:43.601 --> 34:46.034
their issue is the plastic cup, right?

34:46.034 --> 34:47.768
They're like, "I don't have
any plastic in my life.

34:47.768 --> 34:49.101
And then I get on board this plane

34:49.101 --> 34:50.234
and I have five plastic cups

34:50.234 --> 34:51.901
that I see you're throwing in the trash."

34:51.901 --> 34:53.968
Okay, so we prioritize and fast tracked,

34:53.968 --> 34:56.768
making sure that we had a
truly plastic free paper cup,

34:56.768 --> 34:58.034
which we debuted a couple months ago.

34:58.034 --> 34:59.501
We'll roll out to the whole system.

34:59.501 --> 35:02.101
Does that solve my carbon
problem? It does not.

35:02.101 --> 35:04.468
But it keeps that trust
coming along with us

35:04.468 --> 35:07.034
as we decarbonize a hard
to decarbonize sector.

35:07.034 --> 35:08.968
Similarly, on the employee front,

35:08.968 --> 35:10.501
they have so many different ideas

35:10.501 --> 35:12.134
because they see our operation.

35:12.134 --> 35:13.801
One of the things we're
trying to do is make sure

35:13.801 --> 35:16.068
every employee who's a
frontline employee at Delta

35:16.068 --> 35:18.101
knows what they can do to contribute

35:18.101 --> 35:19.334
to our sustainability goals.

35:19.334 --> 35:21.401
And I'm proud to say that
more than half of Delta's

35:21.401 --> 35:24.268
100,000 people and almost all
of our frontline employees

35:24.268 --> 35:27.234
now every single day know
what action they can take

35:27.234 --> 35:28.201
to help us save fuel.

35:28.201 --> 35:29.301
Now again, are they into it

35:29.301 --> 35:30.568
because they're into saving the planet

35:30.568 --> 35:32.434
or they're into our
saving our bottom line,

35:32.434 --> 35:34.601
doesn't really matter,
it works either way.

35:34.601 --> 35:35.434
- It's an opportunity.
- And those have been

35:35.434 --> 35:37.701
the unlocks, 'cause each one
of us, we're in our roles,

35:37.701 --> 35:39.434
but we will move on at some point.

35:39.434 --> 35:40.968
And so when you talk about systems,

35:40.968 --> 35:42.568
you have to build it into the system

35:42.568 --> 35:44.134
so that the customers and employees both

35:44.134 --> 35:47.268
will carry it forward,
regardless of if I'm the CSO.

35:47.268 --> 35:49.801
- Yes. Yes, and.

35:49.801 --> 35:51.634
So I'll share with you all
that I've been approached

35:51.634 --> 35:54.134
by several Chief Sustainability Officers

35:54.134 --> 35:55.368
from different companies going,

35:55.368 --> 35:57.368
"How did you do this at Siemens?"

35:57.368 --> 36:00.668
You know, it's integral
to the business plan.

36:00.668 --> 36:02.134
And I shared with you that we were

36:02.134 --> 36:03.534
looking at the mega trends.

36:03.534 --> 36:05.301
And by the way, in 2015,

36:05.301 --> 36:08.268
Siemens was the first
large industrial company

36:08.268 --> 36:10.968
to make a commitment to
be carbon neutral by 2030.

36:10.968 --> 36:12.668
To be halfway there by 2020

36:12.668 --> 36:15.101
and do the hard stuff in this decade

36:15.101 --> 36:16.534
we're living through now.

36:16.534 --> 36:19.034
But the company did more than that.

36:19.034 --> 36:21.834
The board actually made it measurable.

36:21.834 --> 36:24.568
We've insisted that if we set targets,

36:24.568 --> 36:26.268
they have to be auditable.

36:26.268 --> 36:28.134
So we've got the financial reporting

36:28.134 --> 36:29.534
we're doing on a regular basis.

36:29.534 --> 36:30.834
Quarterly, quarterly, quarterly,

36:30.834 --> 36:33.468
and annually we're putting out a document

36:33.468 --> 36:35.334
of our non-financial measures.

36:35.334 --> 36:39.034
This is showing the world that
we're true to the strategy

36:39.034 --> 36:42.034
that we've put in place and
we hold ourselves accountable.

36:42.034 --> 36:43.534
We audit the results.

36:43.534 --> 36:46.268
And I think employees
feel great when they go,

36:46.268 --> 36:49.834
"Oh, this rises to the same
level as our accountability

36:49.834 --> 36:51.001
to shareholders."

36:51.001 --> 36:52.268
- I do want to just,

36:54.101 --> 36:55.334
those two answers were fantastic.

36:55.334 --> 36:57.268
I just wanna highlight, 'cause
Amelia gave you a really

36:57.268 --> 37:02.101
great point, which is you
can't just look at the thing

37:02.101 --> 37:05.001
that people think is gonna
make a big difference.

37:05.001 --> 37:07.801
Only 10% of plastic in
the world is recycled.

37:07.801 --> 37:09.334
Plastic is made of oil.

37:09.334 --> 37:11.201
So to the extent it's
reducing the amount of oil

37:11.201 --> 37:13.434
you take outta the ground
and put into the atmosphere,

37:13.434 --> 37:14.901
that's decent, but 10%,

37:14.901 --> 37:18.201
we're long gone before
that's a difference.

37:18.201 --> 37:20.534
What you said was build trust,

37:20.534 --> 37:25.534
do that and primarily do the carbon thing.

37:26.234 --> 37:30.601
'Cause that is the key consequential
thing to be working on.

37:30.601 --> 37:32.268
- And John, I would be
remiss if I didn't add

37:32.268 --> 37:33.334
that we did paper cups

37:33.334 --> 37:35.734
and we also saved 41
million gallons of jet fuel

37:35.734 --> 37:36.968
through our carbon council last year.

37:36.968 --> 37:38.868
But our customers,
honestly, they don't know.

37:38.868 --> 37:39.701
They don't care about it.

37:39.701 --> 37:41.168
Anytime you land into LA anyone,

37:41.168 --> 37:43.368
guys, we've changed how you're
landing, you'll never know.

37:43.368 --> 37:45.134
But we're saving a bunch
of fuel when we do that.

37:45.134 --> 37:46.767
Do you want to know that? No, you don't.

37:46.767 --> 37:48.301
No you don't. And that's okay, right?

37:48.301 --> 37:50.634
And so the whole point is
it's really, I agree with you,

37:50.634 --> 37:53.234
it's the, and right now,
everything about sustainability

37:53.234 --> 37:55.634
is we do everything else
at our companies perfectly.

37:55.634 --> 37:57.234
Then we add in this other and,

37:57.234 --> 37:59.867
and then we meet you where
your individual needs are at.

37:59.867 --> 38:03.067
- So in a B2C world, that
has a different flavor

38:03.067 --> 38:04.967
than in a Qualcomm world.

38:04.967 --> 38:07.734
So in a Qualcomm world, Angela,

38:07.734 --> 38:10.367
what is the sort of the challenges

38:10.367 --> 38:11.834
and therefore I think of the longest-

38:11.834 --> 38:12.667
- I have many.

38:12.667 --> 38:16.101
- That's where I was gonna
go, for the bottom up of,

38:16.101 --> 38:19.167
you know, not only just the
engineering and the like,

38:19.167 --> 38:22.434
but getting it to sort of
move from the C-suite down to,

38:22.434 --> 38:25.601
there's the virtual fab shop floor.

38:25.601 --> 38:27.934
- Yeah, I mean I think,
you know, as I said,

38:27.934 --> 38:30.234
we sit in a unique place
in the industry and right,

38:30.234 --> 38:34.501
we have basically eight primary
manufacturing suppliers.

38:34.501 --> 38:36.134
And those eight suppliers
are the suppliers

38:36.134 --> 38:37.701
that supply to everybody else, right?

38:37.701 --> 38:40.034
It's the TSMCs and the
Samsungs of the world.

38:42.801 --> 38:45.367
And you know, we are working
with our supply chain

38:45.367 --> 38:46.834
as our supply chain is also working

38:46.834 --> 38:47.701
with all these other customers,

38:47.701 --> 38:49.701
but there's only so far you can move them

38:49.701 --> 38:52.134
because we have to make products, right?

38:52.134 --> 38:53.767
So I think that is a challenge.

38:53.767 --> 38:55.301
It's something that we're
continuing to work through.

38:55.301 --> 38:56.901
A big part of us for scope three, right,

38:56.901 --> 38:59.601
is that category 11, which
is use of sold goods.

38:59.601 --> 39:01.334
That's like way bigger footprint

39:01.334 --> 39:04.134
than purchase goods or
like the procurement,

39:04.134 --> 39:05.934
the money you're spending on things.

39:06.867 --> 39:09.801
But there's no one way to quantify that.

39:09.801 --> 39:12.401
It's like if you looked at all
five semiconductor companies,

39:12.401 --> 39:13.867
everybody would have a different formula.

39:13.867 --> 39:14.934
It would look completely different.

39:14.934 --> 39:17.401
You can't compare it, half of it's voodoo.

39:17.401 --> 39:19.601
Like because no one's
figured it out yet, right?

39:19.601 --> 39:20.967
So we're trying to work together

39:20.967 --> 39:23.801
with other semiconductor companies
to identify what is that,

39:23.801 --> 39:25.134
what does that look like?

39:25.134 --> 39:26.834
I think it's really
interesting what Delta's done.

39:26.834 --> 39:29.767
I mean, I think you really
do need that employee buy-in.

39:29.767 --> 39:31.334
And a lot of this regulation,

39:31.334 --> 39:33.434
particularly that's coming out of Europe,

39:33.434 --> 39:36.267
I mean, we are just working
with so many more folks

39:36.267 --> 39:38.267
in the last two years across the company

39:38.267 --> 39:39.267
than we were before.

39:39.267 --> 39:40.967
And arguably we probably
should have been doing it.

39:40.967 --> 39:44.367
But again, as a B2B company,
there wasn't as much of a push.

39:44.367 --> 39:49.201
But I think getting employees
engaged from the C-suite,

39:49.201 --> 39:52.434
but all the way to, you know,
front, what'd you call them,

39:52.434 --> 39:53.434
frontline employees?

39:53.434 --> 39:55.601
And I mean, everybody really
has to be part of this journey

39:55.601 --> 39:57.167
because it's not just gonna
happen in engineering,

39:57.167 --> 39:58.834
it's not just gonna
happen in sustainability.

39:58.834 --> 40:00.267
It's not just gonna happen at the C-suite.

40:00.267 --> 40:02.901
It really, it's procurement,
it's legal, it's finance,

40:02.901 --> 40:05.767
it's supply chain, right, it's everybody.

40:07.234 --> 40:10.001
- So we are at the end
of what I would've called

40:10.001 --> 40:14.434
a C-suite and practical Masterclass

40:14.434 --> 40:16.901
in how the best corporations in the world

40:16.901 --> 40:20.834
can focus on trying to
change and make a future

40:20.834 --> 40:22.934
that really is better for all.

40:22.934 --> 40:26.501
I think the things that
have risen to the top for me

40:26.501 --> 40:30.434
is this new notion of
thinking in a system,

40:30.434 --> 40:33.867
partnering data collection
and being analytic

40:33.867 --> 40:35.434
about what you're doing.

40:35.434 --> 40:37.634
Being very open and transparent

40:37.634 --> 40:40.734
where there are very
hard to solve problems.

40:40.734 --> 40:44.534
And if the leading companies in the world

40:44.534 --> 40:48.001
that we have on stage are emphasizing that

40:48.001 --> 40:50.901
and making it part of their core DNA,

40:50.901 --> 40:52.967
it allows other companies,

40:52.967 --> 40:55.034
no matter what the political environment,

40:55.034 --> 40:57.567
no matter what the, you know,

40:57.567 --> 41:01.934
speed bumps to use a car, a truck example.

41:01.934 --> 41:04.301
But no matter what the problems are,

41:04.301 --> 41:09.101
the long-term trajectory
has object lesson companies

41:09.101 --> 41:13.334
that you can point to so that
others in the financial world,

41:13.334 --> 41:16.701
in the investing world that
have a lot of influence,

41:16.701 --> 41:18.801
say "They're doing it."

41:18.801 --> 41:20.801
Not only government saying,
"You need to do it,"

41:20.801 --> 41:23.601
they're doing it, it's
good business, and do it.

41:23.601 --> 41:26.834
And I'll leave you with the
point that we started with.

41:26.834 --> 41:29.334
This is the largest investment opportunity

41:29.334 --> 41:30.901
in the history of humanity.

41:30.901 --> 41:33.034
Every three years we'll spend as much

41:33.034 --> 41:36.867
as the entire market cap for
the 10 most valuable companies.

41:36.867 --> 41:39.867
Each of you, wherever
you are in your company,

41:39.867 --> 41:42.501
can advocate for the consequential actions

41:42.501 --> 41:45.567
which are about carbon that
you heard everybody talk about.

41:45.567 --> 41:48.434
And if you do that, it becomes infectious.

41:48.434 --> 41:51.701
As a positive example,
I've heard these companies,

41:51.701 --> 41:53.967
you could say, that are
really making this a core,

41:53.967 --> 41:57.134
whether it's to keep
their employees engaged

41:57.134 --> 42:00.334
and then build on that, or
to reinvent supply chains

42:00.334 --> 42:03.367
or to deliver products that
have never existed before

42:03.367 --> 42:05.534
in the truck and equipment world,

42:05.534 --> 42:08.534
or to change the way the world computes.

42:08.534 --> 42:11.734
So you're all part of this as we are,

42:11.734 --> 42:15.167
and that's the solution
to a systems problem.

42:15.167 --> 42:18.767
It's a system of a social
nature, coming together

42:18.767 --> 42:21.367
first over a napkin,
to use Barbara's point,

42:21.367 --> 42:23.067
and then delivering at scale.

42:23.067 --> 42:25.567
So we thank you, an incredible panel.

42:25.567 --> 42:27.701
I couldn't have learned more.

42:27.701 --> 42:29.201
And thank you for listening to us

42:29.201 --> 42:30.367
and thank you to our panelists.

42:30.367 --> 42:32.867
(audience applauding)

42:32.867 --> 42:35.467
(bright music)
