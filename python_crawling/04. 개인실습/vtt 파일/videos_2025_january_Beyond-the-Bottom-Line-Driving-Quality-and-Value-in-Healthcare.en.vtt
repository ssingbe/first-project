00:00.149 --> 00:02.732
(upbeat music)

00:10.590 --> 00:15.270
- Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Beyond the Bottom Line:

00:15.270 --> 00:16.890
Driving Quality and Value in Healthcare."

00:16.890 --> 00:18.840
My name is Jesse Ehrenfeld.

00:18.840 --> 00:20.610
I'm a physician, I'm an informaticist,

00:20.610 --> 00:22.950
anesthesiologist at practice
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,

00:22.950 --> 00:24.660
and I am the immediate past president

00:24.660 --> 00:26.970
of the American Medical Association.

00:26.970 --> 00:29.100
Round of applause, please.

00:29.100 --> 00:31.140
It's mostly for my mother who's
gonna watch the recording.

00:31.140 --> 00:31.973
Okay.
(audience applauds)

00:31.973 --> 00:35.670
So we have a phenomenal group
of folks, experts here today

00:35.670 --> 00:39.630
to have a great conversation
about how do we drive value,

00:39.630 --> 00:41.370
and I'm gonna let them
introduce themselves.

00:41.370 --> 00:43.020
We've got Jared Augenstein

00:43.020 --> 00:45.480
who's the managing
director of Manatt Health,

00:45.480 --> 00:48.540
Carolyn Jasik, former med
school classmate of mine,

00:48.540 --> 00:51.270
Chief Medical Officer of Omada Health,

00:51.270 --> 00:52.800
and Dr. Barbara Levy,

00:52.800 --> 00:55.590
who is the chair of the
AMA CPT Editorial Panel.

00:55.590 --> 00:57.150
Could you all just a few minutes

00:57.150 --> 00:58.440
about who you are and what you do?

00:58.440 --> 00:59.430
- Sure.

00:59.430 --> 01:01.350
Thanks, Jesse. It's great to be here.

01:01.350 --> 01:03.120
My name is Jared Augenstein.

01:03.120 --> 01:04.380
I'm with Manatt Health.

01:04.380 --> 01:06.630
We're a consulting policy and law firm,

01:06.630 --> 01:09.960
and we work with technology
companies, physicians,

01:09.960 --> 01:11.070
health systems, and others

01:11.070 --> 01:13.070
on making technology work in healthcare.

01:14.160 --> 01:15.240
- Hi, good afternoon.

01:15.240 --> 01:16.410
I'm Carolyn Jasik.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.300
I'm Chief Medical Officer at Omada Health.

01:18.300 --> 01:21.390
We are a in-between care visit provider

01:21.390 --> 01:24.240
of behavioral interventions
for chronic disease,

01:24.240 --> 01:27.240
and I am a pediatrician by training

01:27.240 --> 01:29.100
and very proud to be on the stage

01:29.100 --> 01:30.870
with my former med school classmate.

01:30.870 --> 01:32.220
Very fun.

01:32.220 --> 01:34.080
- And hi, everyone, I'm Barbara Levy.

01:34.080 --> 01:36.000
I am an obstetrician/gynecologist.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.020
I've done women's health
for 40 years or more.

01:40.020 --> 01:42.420
I'm vice chair of the CPT Editorial Panel

01:42.420 --> 01:45.240
and we'll talk a little
bit about what CPT is,

01:45.240 --> 01:49.080
but I've been involved
in policy for 25 years

01:49.080 --> 01:52.320
and really interested in
the evolution of medicine

01:52.320 --> 01:56.733
and how we deliver
quality at a lower cost.

01:57.810 --> 01:58.980
- Well, thanks, guys.

01:58.980 --> 02:01.470
There's been a lot of
progress on the journey

02:01.470 --> 02:03.000
to delivering value-based care

02:03.000 --> 02:06.030
and obviously an explosion
in the digital health space

02:06.030 --> 02:07.740
over the last decade.

02:07.740 --> 02:11.190
You know, where are we today
and why is it important

02:11.190 --> 02:14.583
for us to be having this
conversation at CES?

02:17.190 --> 02:20.850
- So I thought we would
morph into value-based care

02:20.850 --> 02:24.060
about 15, 20 years ago
because it made so much sense.

02:24.060 --> 02:28.230
And of course, here we
are 15 or 20 years later.

02:28.230 --> 02:31.950
It's really challenging to change a system

02:31.950 --> 02:34.140
that is so embedded,

02:34.140 --> 02:36.000
and where we need to be

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
is a place where we've
defined value to whom and how.

02:41.640 --> 02:45.300
And those are things that we
are trying to do at the panel

02:45.300 --> 02:46.980
and trying to help with,

02:46.980 --> 02:49.380
but it really takes a
village, if you will.

02:49.380 --> 02:53.220
It takes everyone getting
on board to make a decision

02:53.220 --> 02:57.210
that this is how we are now
going to pay for healthcare.

02:57.210 --> 03:00.900
And I think that's a
challenge that we all face.

03:00.900 --> 03:03.840
There's no question that technology

03:03.840 --> 03:06.570
is essential to getting us to that place.

03:06.570 --> 03:09.090
And why it didn't work 15 or 20 years ago

03:09.090 --> 03:12.753
was because we didn't have
the tools to get there.

03:15.420 --> 03:18.750
- Yeah, I will add, I agree
with all of that and say,

03:18.750 --> 03:20.430
because of the conference that we're at

03:20.430 --> 03:21.990
and the day that it is,

03:21.990 --> 03:24.000
this is just really an inflection point,

03:24.000 --> 03:25.530
I believe, for healthcare.

03:25.530 --> 03:30.480
We now have the monitoring
tools, the home data collection,

03:30.480 --> 03:33.450
the consumer awareness,
especially coming out of COVID,

03:33.450 --> 03:35.340
of the importance of in-home care.

03:35.340 --> 03:38.490
And one of the things that's
held value-based care back

03:38.490 --> 03:41.790
for a while is even if we
know what the value is,

03:41.790 --> 03:42.750
how do we measure it?

03:42.750 --> 03:44.580
And are we measuring it in the same way

03:44.580 --> 03:46.110
and are we using the same language?

03:46.110 --> 03:47.910
And that's the beauty of technology

03:47.910 --> 03:49.680
because we can have streamlined data,

03:49.680 --> 03:51.960
streamlined data collection methods,

03:51.960 --> 03:54.120
and we can have data
collection in the home,

03:54.120 --> 03:55.260
which has been lacking.

03:55.260 --> 03:58.380
And so, this is just
really an exciting time

03:58.380 --> 04:01.710
to have that data available
and those devices available,

04:01.710 --> 04:05.220
assuming their clinical grade
to support value-based care

04:05.220 --> 04:08.250
in a way that we haven't
been able to to date.

04:08.250 --> 04:09.083
- [Jesse] That's perfect, Jared?

04:09.083 --> 04:10.260
- Yeah, I was just gonna say,

04:10.260 --> 04:12.840
I mean, I think from, you
know, a technology perspective,

04:12.840 --> 04:15.420
it's sort of like it's, you
know, it was the best of times,

04:15.420 --> 04:16.953
it was the worst of times.

04:17.850 --> 04:22.850
You know, I have yet to meet a technology

04:24.570 --> 04:27.180
more just generally disliked by physicians

04:27.180 --> 04:29.340
than the electronic health record.

04:29.340 --> 04:32.310
And I've also yet to meet a technology

04:32.310 --> 04:35.400
more universally loved
than an ambient scribe.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.880
And so, you know, from a
technology development perspective,

04:38.880 --> 04:40.350
you walk around the show floor here

04:40.350 --> 04:42.960
and you see some of the
advancements being made.

04:42.960 --> 04:43.920
It's really incredible.

04:43.920 --> 04:47.190
We have amazing technology
today that, to Dr. Levy's point,

04:47.190 --> 04:49.410
we didn't have 15 years ago, you know,

04:49.410 --> 04:52.740
in order to deliver the
types of care models

04:52.740 --> 04:54.450
that we wanna deliver.

04:54.450 --> 04:57.060
But from a how you
integrate that technology

04:57.060 --> 04:58.983
into workflow perspective, you know,

05:00.480 --> 05:04.080
for most technologies, it's
sort of been a disaster.

05:04.080 --> 05:06.570
- And obviously how we integrate

05:06.570 --> 05:10.230
what's coming off of
consumer grade devices

05:10.230 --> 05:13.020
into the ecosystem that
influences care decisions

05:13.020 --> 05:14.700
and can influence that value equation

05:14.700 --> 05:16.260
is a part of what we
wanna talk about today.

05:16.260 --> 05:20.790
So by the way, number one
dissatisfier for almost a decade

05:20.790 --> 05:23.310
for physicians, the
electronic health record

05:23.310 --> 05:25.380
that has now been supplanted
by prior authorization,

05:25.380 --> 05:27.330
it's number two.
(panelist laughs)

05:27.330 --> 05:30.990
So, Jared, the AMA and Manatt Health

05:30.990 --> 05:32.310
recently published some research

05:32.310 --> 05:35.940
about the role that
CPT code set is playing

05:35.940 --> 05:38.010
in accelerating the adoption
of value-based care.

05:38.010 --> 05:39.750
Can you tell us a little
bit about that research,

05:39.750 --> 05:41.820
the findings and the
implications for the space?

05:41.820 --> 05:42.653
- Yeah.

05:42.653 --> 05:47.600
So, AMA was curious
about how CPT is utilized

05:48.690 --> 05:49.560
in value-based care,

05:49.560 --> 05:52.380
how does it support
value-based care delivery?

05:52.380 --> 05:54.300
What are the ways in which
it might be improved?

05:54.300 --> 05:56.910
And so we spoke with a
couple dozen experts,

05:56.910 --> 05:58.860
including many of the folks in this room,

05:58.860 --> 06:01.650
to try and get to the
bottom of the question.

06:01.650 --> 06:04.230
And interestingly, what we heard is CPT

06:04.230 --> 06:07.110
supports value-based care
along three dimensions.

06:07.110 --> 06:09.210
First is that it supports
population health

06:09.210 --> 06:12.450
and quality improvement by
helping to identify patients

06:12.450 --> 06:16.560
who are eligible for clinical
interventions and also

06:16.560 --> 06:19.980
by supporting payer quality
improvement initiatives.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.380
Second thing is that it
supports cost management

06:22.380 --> 06:24.210
by supporting cost benchmarking,

06:24.210 --> 06:26.490
by supporting risk adjustment,

06:26.490 --> 06:31.490
by enabling identification
of high-cost patient events

06:31.860 --> 06:33.120
and high-cost patient cohorts,

06:33.120 --> 06:36.210
and also by supporting
provider network management.

06:36.210 --> 06:38.820
And third, it supports
the actual contracting

06:38.820 --> 06:42.960
between providers and payers
around in a value-based way

06:42.960 --> 06:45.120
by supporting patient attribution

06:45.120 --> 06:47.160
into different value-based care models,

06:47.160 --> 06:49.710
by supporting the
enablement of care bundles

06:49.710 --> 06:52.440
that can be used to
support value-based care.

06:52.440 --> 06:55.710
And finally, by actually
enabling the contracting process,

06:55.710 --> 06:57.390
you know, the contracting itself

06:57.390 --> 06:59.340
between payers and providers.

06:59.340 --> 07:00.720
And I think if you add all that up,

07:00.720 --> 07:02.310
what you realize is that, you know,

07:02.310 --> 07:05.250
CPT is really the interoperability layer

07:05.250 --> 07:06.873
for value-based care.

07:08.892 --> 07:09.990
It didn't strike me that way

07:09.990 --> 07:11.340
when I initially thought
about the question,

07:11.340 --> 07:12.270
but that's really, you know,

07:12.270 --> 07:14.010
what we learned from this research.

07:14.010 --> 07:16.230
There were things that, you
know, we heard in the research,

07:16.230 --> 07:18.420
areas of opportunity for improvement

07:18.420 --> 07:21.510
in terms of thinking about
the way the CPT code set

07:21.510 --> 07:22.350
needs to evolve,

07:22.350 --> 07:24.330
given new models of care delivery,

07:24.330 --> 07:26.280
new types of bundled payments,

07:26.280 --> 07:28.590
new types of providers who
are coming into practice

07:28.590 --> 07:30.480
and how that gets accounted for.

07:30.480 --> 07:32.790
But it's hard to think
about making progress

07:32.790 --> 07:35.130
against our value-based care objectives

07:35.130 --> 07:39.180
without CPT as sort of the
underlying interoperability layer

07:39.180 --> 07:41.010
for achieving that advancement.

07:41.010 --> 07:41.843
- Okay, so you just said

07:41.843 --> 07:44.460
that CPT has done a whole bunch of things,

07:44.460 --> 07:45.360
but there are folks in this room

07:45.360 --> 07:46.830
who probably really
don't know what CPT is,

07:46.830 --> 07:49.230
and there's nobody on this stage.

07:49.230 --> 07:50.610
There's probably, in
fact, nobody in the world

07:50.610 --> 07:53.610
who understands CPT better than Dr. Levy.

07:53.610 --> 07:58.320
So, can you just give a
thumbnail sketch of what CPT is

07:58.320 --> 08:01.590
and how it's doing the things
that Jared just described?

08:01.590 --> 08:03.300
Because it sounds like
a great guideline to me,

08:03.300 --> 08:05.610
but it turns out it's a code set.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.020
- It's a language.

08:07.020 --> 08:12.020
So it's the way that we
describe what we do in medicine.

08:12.060 --> 08:15.870
And CPT Panel is a group of physicians

08:15.870 --> 08:20.870
and practicing clinicians
who do those procedures.

08:21.240 --> 08:24.870
So the concept is, yes, it's a code set,

08:24.870 --> 08:27.150
but to create a code,

08:27.150 --> 08:31.260
we need to use a common language,
and we all need to agree

08:31.260 --> 08:35.040
when we talk about the
interoperability, that when I say

08:35.040 --> 08:40.040
somebody has a high-level
emergency kind of situation,

08:40.950 --> 08:43.050
that we're all speaking the same language,

08:43.050 --> 08:45.510
and what things are included or excluded

08:45.510 --> 08:49.770
in a particular event are
things that we describe

08:49.770 --> 08:51.120
in the code set.

08:51.120 --> 08:55.500
So think of it as the unifying language,

08:55.500 --> 08:57.330
of a way to communicate

08:57.330 --> 09:02.040
what's happening with a patient
or a family or an encounter.

09:02.040 --> 09:03.810
- So let me stay with you and
then I'll come to Carolyn.

09:03.810 --> 09:07.440
So, we've got a lot of tech
companies in this room.

09:07.440 --> 09:09.540
What are misconceptions
that a company might have

09:09.540 --> 09:11.310
about the code set, the language

09:11.310 --> 09:12.840
as they're doing development

09:12.840 --> 09:15.780
and trying to enter into a space

09:15.780 --> 09:17.280
where they can bring these
digital tools forward

09:17.280 --> 09:18.510
to support value-based care?

09:18.510 --> 09:21.030
- Yeah, so I think one
of the misconceptions

09:21.030 --> 09:23.520
is that we're some group of people

09:23.520 --> 09:26.790
that are esoteric and
academic and, you know,

09:26.790 --> 09:28.800
don't live in the real world.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.060
We're practicing doctors

09:30.060 --> 09:31.830
and we do practice in the real world

09:31.830 --> 09:36.510
and we're aware and
excited by new technology.

09:36.510 --> 09:39.690
That said, there are certain
rules that we have to follow,

09:39.690 --> 09:42.360
just like the grammar in a language,

09:42.360 --> 09:45.420
that a procedure or for a new code,

09:45.420 --> 09:48.240
it has to describe something that's unique

09:48.240 --> 09:50.370
that hasn't been described before,

09:50.370 --> 09:52.920
that isn't a fragmentation

09:52.920 --> 09:55.290
of something that's already been there

09:55.290 --> 09:59.970
and that it has to have
the data to support it.

09:59.970 --> 10:03.750
So at the panel, this group of physicians

10:03.750 --> 10:06.270
who are really volunteers doing this

10:06.270 --> 10:08.580
in support of the public,

10:08.580 --> 10:12.060
we are saying, "Show me the data.

10:12.060 --> 10:15.630
Show me that this
intervention, whatever it is,

10:15.630 --> 10:18.750
actually does what it
says it's going to do,

10:18.750 --> 10:21.300
and impacts patient
care in the right way."

10:21.300 --> 10:24.540
And so, it takes time to accumulate data,

10:24.540 --> 10:27.240
and you do have to have
published literature

10:27.240 --> 10:29.220
to get a Category I code.

10:29.220 --> 10:31.710
All of those things
though are very important

10:31.710 --> 10:33.843
in many ways to protect the public.

10:34.830 --> 10:36.900
And they're not intended to be barriers,

10:36.900 --> 10:39.480
they're intended to be benchmarks really

10:39.480 --> 10:44.480
for how we include the
rules in the code set.

10:45.420 --> 10:46.680
- Over cocktails,
someday I'm gonna ask you

10:46.680 --> 10:47.880
what your favorite code is,

10:47.880 --> 10:49.830
but could you give an
example of like a new code

10:49.830 --> 10:51.841
that, you know, they might
see as a new technology or-

10:51.841 --> 10:52.950
- Sure.

10:52.950 --> 10:55.560
So, you know, we were
really light on our feet

10:55.560 --> 10:58.260
during the COVID crisis.

10:58.260 --> 11:01.830
We created new codes, it
felt like every two weeks,

11:01.830 --> 11:05.700
but for the testing, so
COVID tests needed codes

11:05.700 --> 11:10.700
to describe them for each
individual immunization

11:10.920 --> 11:14.430
and the administration of the immunization

11:14.430 --> 11:17.250
because all of that was happening
in a public health arena,

11:17.250 --> 11:18.840
but we had to keep track of it

11:18.840 --> 11:21.360
and we had to keep track
of which immunization

11:21.360 --> 11:23.850
was being given to whom,
whether it was the first one,

11:23.850 --> 11:25.260
the second one, the third one.

11:25.260 --> 11:27.630
So we created codes for that.

11:27.630 --> 11:29.340
But also over the past 10 years,

11:29.340 --> 11:33.120
we've created episodes of care codes

11:33.120 --> 11:36.480
that are really designed
around value-based care,

11:36.480 --> 11:38.550
so chronic care management.

11:38.550 --> 11:40.620
Over a 30-day period,

11:40.620 --> 11:42.900
how much time is your
clinical staff spending

11:42.900 --> 11:46.470
coordinating the care
for a complex patient?

11:46.470 --> 11:49.380
Or principal care management
for an individual,

11:49.380 --> 11:53.490
let's say a cancer patient who
really needs care navigation?

11:53.490 --> 11:54.660
How do we pay?

11:54.660 --> 11:58.170
How do we account for the
services that are being provided?

11:58.170 --> 12:02.520
So we've created codes that
capture some of the newer things

12:02.520 --> 12:04.800
that are happening in value-based care.

12:04.800 --> 12:08.670
- All right, so Dr. Jasik,
Carolyn, my colleague,

12:08.670 --> 12:10.500
Omada, your company,

12:10.500 --> 12:14.160
virtual first company
doing evidence-based work

12:14.160 --> 12:16.440
to advance chronic disease management

12:16.440 --> 12:19.260
by providing supplemental
support for patients.

12:19.260 --> 12:22.650
Can you describe a little
bit about how Omada works

12:22.650 --> 12:24.300
and how you're using digital tools

12:24.300 --> 12:26.250
to support value-based care?

12:26.250 --> 12:27.083
- Sure.

12:27.083 --> 12:29.190
Well, I know what my favorite CPT code is,

12:29.190 --> 12:33.210
and that would be Omada CPT code

12:33.210 --> 12:36.720
that we were the first
digital health company

12:36.720 --> 12:39.060
to, I believe, apply for and receive

12:39.060 --> 12:42.780
a digital health delivered CPT
code with the AMA committee.

12:42.780 --> 12:44.520
And I think the story behind that

12:44.520 --> 12:46.440
really is a lot about value-based care.

12:46.440 --> 12:48.630
So when I first started at Omada,

12:48.630 --> 12:51.480
what we noticed about
the CPT coding system

12:51.480 --> 12:52.710
that's really special,

12:52.710 --> 12:54.720
and I think you started to allude to that,

12:54.720 --> 12:57.600
is it is essentially a
badge of certification

12:57.600 --> 13:01.800
that the care that is
covered by that CPT code

13:01.800 --> 13:04.110
is evidence-based and is effective.

13:04.110 --> 13:06.120
And so, we quickly realized

13:06.120 --> 13:09.270
that were there a CPT code
that we could bill under,

13:09.270 --> 13:12.570
it would essentially tell our customers

13:12.570 --> 13:16.950
that we were a medical provider
of care that was worthwhile,

13:16.950 --> 13:18.423
that was worthy of payment.

13:19.350 --> 13:21.870
What a lot of people in my
company thought and didn't know

13:21.870 --> 13:23.820
and I knew at the time is a CPT code

13:23.820 --> 13:24.900
does not come with payment.

13:24.900 --> 13:27.180
You have to talk to the payer about that.

13:27.180 --> 13:29.640
But the way that we used our CPT code

13:29.640 --> 13:31.800
and what was unique
about it, it's not ours,

13:31.800 --> 13:34.080
it's part of the catalog,

13:34.080 --> 13:37.650
is we asked the question of
what would a CPT code look like

13:37.650 --> 13:41.580
if it was adjudicated based on outcomes,

13:41.580 --> 13:45.000
not based on time and not
based on medical complexity.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.130
And this was really unique at the time

13:47.130 --> 13:49.260
because we were in the
field of weight loss.

13:49.260 --> 13:50.640
And so we were asking the question,

13:50.640 --> 13:52.020
because we are virtual care

13:52.020 --> 13:55.500
and we don't have episodic
visits that we could cover,

13:55.500 --> 13:57.810
could we have a code
that instead reflected

13:57.810 --> 13:59.130
the value that we were delivering

13:59.130 --> 14:00.900
for the people sponsoring our care?

14:00.900 --> 14:02.880
So if the point of the
behavioral counseling

14:02.880 --> 14:05.250
and lifestyle medicine was to lose weight,

14:05.250 --> 14:07.170
why wouldn't the CPT code be linked

14:07.170 --> 14:09.150
to the amount of weight
loss that was lost?

14:09.150 --> 14:10.830
And that was the code

14:10.830 --> 14:13.530
that we worked on using the DPP Program.

14:13.530 --> 14:16.470
And it's pretty much what
we've been billing under since,

14:16.470 --> 14:19.590
and it's what a lot of the
groups in our industry use

14:19.590 --> 14:22.470
and what was very special
about that process

14:22.470 --> 14:25.620
is we drop the code once a month

14:25.620 --> 14:29.220
based on a little bit of
the service that we provide,

14:29.220 --> 14:31.260
but then we have a modifier on top

14:31.260 --> 14:34.560
for the amount of weight loss
that our member has lost.

14:34.560 --> 14:36.420
And our customers really like that

14:36.420 --> 14:38.100
because we use our remote device

14:38.100 --> 14:41.520
to support the data so they
can feel good about that

14:41.520 --> 14:43.890
and they know that
they're paying for value,

14:43.890 --> 14:47.400
not just services without the value.

14:47.400 --> 14:50.880
- Okay, so Jared, we've
talked about wanting to move

14:50.880 --> 14:53.520
from a fee-for-service environment

14:53.520 --> 14:55.740
to a value-based care environment,

14:55.740 --> 14:59.010
and it's like a road filled
with potholes and barriers

14:59.010 --> 15:01.320
and left turns that go nowhere.

15:01.320 --> 15:03.780
Can you give a quick overview
from your perspectives?

15:03.780 --> 15:06.330
I know Manatt Health
does a lot in this space.

15:06.330 --> 15:09.450
Why is it so difficult
to make this transition

15:09.450 --> 15:11.970
from fee-for-service to value-based care?

15:11.970 --> 15:12.803
- Yeah.

15:12.803 --> 15:14.970
Well, so just some basic facts.

15:14.970 --> 15:18.030
So if you look at the
percentage of healthcare

15:18.030 --> 15:21.390
that's paid for on a
fee-for-service chassis,

15:21.390 --> 15:23.584
it's still 90% of care today.

15:23.584 --> 15:24.417
- [Jesse] 90%.

15:24.417 --> 15:25.250
- 90%.

15:25.250 --> 15:27.280
So 10% is paid on sort of

15:28.830 --> 15:31.080
a population health payment-based model.

15:31.080 --> 15:33.750
90% is paid for on a
fee-for-service chassis.

15:33.750 --> 15:36.000
That includes, you know,
pay-for-performance

15:36.000 --> 15:39.570
and other sorts of sort
of low-risk population,

15:39.570 --> 15:41.340
a value-based payment.

15:41.340 --> 15:44.340
That's the macro national number.

15:44.340 --> 15:46.620
There's a lot of variability by payer.

15:46.620 --> 15:48.030
So in Medicare Advantage,

15:48.030 --> 15:50.910
25% of payments are population based.

15:50.910 --> 15:54.360
In Medicaid, 6% of payments
are population based.

15:54.360 --> 15:55.470
And in the commercial market,

15:55.470 --> 15:57.840
only 4% of payments are population based.

15:57.840 --> 16:00.240
So that's sort of the
macro payer level view.

16:00.240 --> 16:02.610
Now imagine you're a physician

16:02.610 --> 16:06.060
and you're trying to deliver
a virtual diabetes model

16:06.060 --> 16:09.240
or you're trying to deliver OB care,

16:09.240 --> 16:11.610
and you're trying to deliver care

16:11.610 --> 16:14.160
in a way that is value-based,

16:14.160 --> 16:16.530
and you're trying to get
paid for delivering that care

16:16.530 --> 16:19.200
because you need to get paid
in order to deliver services.

16:19.200 --> 16:22.380
You're dealing with the
traditional Medicare way

16:22.380 --> 16:23.640
of paying for services.

16:23.640 --> 16:25.830
You're dealing with the
way that Aetna has set up

16:25.830 --> 16:27.720
their value-based payment model.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.850
You're dealing with the way
that your local Blues plan

16:29.850 --> 16:31.305
has set up their
value-based payment model.

16:31.305 --> 16:33.690
You're dealing with your
state Medicaid agency

16:33.690 --> 16:36.030
and probably five different
Medicaid managed care plans

16:36.030 --> 16:37.200
depending on the state you're in.

16:37.200 --> 16:41.100
And so, you know, it's
easy to go a little nuts

16:41.100 --> 16:43.980
trying to figure out how to, you know,

16:43.980 --> 16:46.320
which models you're in,
which quality measures

16:46.320 --> 16:48.840
you're being subjected to reporting on,

16:48.840 --> 16:51.240
and how you deliver care
in a way that's consistent

16:51.240 --> 16:53.940
for all patients, but
also allows you to hit

16:53.940 --> 16:55.860
your value-based payment benchmarks.

16:55.860 --> 16:58.080
And I think that that fragmentation

16:58.080 --> 17:00.900
and the lack of alignment across payers

17:00.900 --> 17:03.810
in terms of how these
programs are constructed

17:03.810 --> 17:05.700
is sort of, you know, a real inhibitor

17:05.700 --> 17:07.650
that's getting in the
way of making progress.

17:07.650 --> 17:09.870
- So, alright, those are
some of the barriers.

17:09.870 --> 17:10.770
What are the some of the things

17:10.770 --> 17:13.980
that are accelerating the
movement in the places

17:13.980 --> 17:16.020
that value-based care is being adopted?

17:16.020 --> 17:17.670
Obviously there are digital tools,

17:17.670 --> 17:20.100
there are new models that are
showing benefit and promise

17:20.100 --> 17:21.540
in real outcomes for patients

17:21.540 --> 17:24.930
that Omada has obviously
been a pioneer in.

17:24.930 --> 17:26.460
And then there's obviously
the whole conversation

17:26.460 --> 17:29.760
about, well what do things
like our infrastructure layers

17:29.760 --> 17:32.730
like CPT do when we move
from a fee-for-service

17:32.730 --> 17:33.930
to a value-based care environment?

17:33.930 --> 17:35.013
Anybody wanna start?

17:37.290 --> 17:41.910
- So, there is a little
known healthcare innovator.

17:41.910 --> 17:44.100
I think it's the biggest
innovator in healthcare

17:44.100 --> 17:45.240
that we don't talk about,

17:45.240 --> 17:48.510
and that is the benefits
leader at an employer.

17:48.510 --> 17:50.790
And those benefits leaders,

17:50.790 --> 17:51.750
I would say you were saying

17:51.750 --> 17:53.700
what's the biggest driver
to value-based care?

17:53.700 --> 17:56.670
I would say it's the fatigue
of the U.S. employer.

17:56.670 --> 17:58.320
The fatigue of the US employer

17:58.320 --> 18:00.240
for spending all this money on healthcare

18:00.240 --> 18:01.860
and not getting value out of it.

18:01.860 --> 18:06.360
We've saddled the U.S. employer
with our healthcare spend

18:06.360 --> 18:08.520
for the most part, other
than our government spend,

18:08.520 --> 18:10.200
which is the taxpayers.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.700
And they're tired.

18:11.700 --> 18:13.590
They're tired of spending all this money

18:13.590 --> 18:14.580
and not getting value.

18:14.580 --> 18:17.250
And so, what I have found
is the most innovative

18:17.250 --> 18:19.320
and open minds in healthcare

18:19.320 --> 18:22.260
to look at alternative
reimbursement models,

18:22.260 --> 18:24.030
alternative care models,

18:24.030 --> 18:27.090
payment models are the benefits buyers

18:27.090 --> 18:28.890
that are adjudicating the benefits

18:28.890 --> 18:30.210
on behalf of the employer.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.650
And they are also the,

18:31.650 --> 18:33.480
especially if they're a large employer,

18:33.480 --> 18:34.920
the primary constituent

18:34.920 --> 18:39.450
for the U.S. health insurance
company industry and PBMs.

18:39.450 --> 18:42.570
So they're a very loud voice,
a very influential voice

18:42.570 --> 18:47.100
and very creative and open
to new ideas and new models

18:47.100 --> 18:49.620
due to this fatigue of
having to spend more.

18:49.620 --> 18:51.210
And I think this year in particular

18:51.210 --> 18:53.580
with the GLP medication coming on

18:53.580 --> 18:57.780
and being faced with this
just gut wrenching decision

18:57.780 --> 18:59.280
of here's a great medication

18:59.280 --> 19:03.540
that is pretty much
unaffordable at a large scale,

19:03.540 --> 19:05.070
how do we afford it

19:05.070 --> 19:08.730
and how do we make it work
and get the value out of it?

19:08.730 --> 19:13.260
So lots of interesting
ideas around innovation,

19:13.260 --> 19:16.320
open-mindedness about the type
of care that can be provided,

19:16.320 --> 19:18.903
how it can be billed
for, what kind of value.

19:19.920 --> 19:20.753
Yeah.

19:21.750 --> 19:22.583
- [Jesse] Barbara.

19:22.583 --> 19:25.170
- Yeah, I think there's a
challenge with the structure

19:25.170 --> 19:26.190
that we have right now.

19:26.190 --> 19:29.610
So we have big health systems,
we have consolidation,

19:29.610 --> 19:31.620
and they still make most of their money

19:31.620 --> 19:33.450
in a fee-for-service world.

19:33.450 --> 19:36.780
And so doing more creates more revenue.

19:36.780 --> 19:40.290
And until we fix that, I
think we're challenged.

19:40.290 --> 19:43.140
So the employer can drive some of that,

19:43.140 --> 19:46.650
but unless they're a major
employer in a geography,

19:46.650 --> 19:50.250
they're not going to help
me and my private practice

19:50.250 --> 19:52.710
be able to have the systems in place

19:52.710 --> 19:56.850
that I need to have to do
really good value-based care.

19:56.850 --> 20:01.110
So I think for telemedicine,
for virtual care,

20:01.110 --> 20:03.660
for the kinds of things
that Omada is doing,

20:03.660 --> 20:05.670
that's fabulous.

20:05.670 --> 20:08.280
For some of the things that I need to do

20:08.280 --> 20:11.730
in a women's health space,
it doesn't work, right?

20:11.730 --> 20:15.500
It still drives surgery,
it still drives...

20:16.800 --> 20:21.800
And our population expects
more prescriptions,

20:21.840 --> 20:26.010
more tests and more intervention

20:26.010 --> 20:29.490
rather than sitting back and
looking at the whole picture

20:29.490 --> 20:31.830
and changing lifestyle
and all of those things.

20:31.830 --> 20:34.530
So I think there has to be a sea change

20:34.530 --> 20:37.810
in the way we look at health

20:38.670 --> 20:42.540
and preserving health as
opposed to sick medicine.

20:42.540 --> 20:45.870
And I think that's a
challenge for all of us,

20:45.870 --> 20:48.570
but it's happening, and
that's really exciting.

20:48.570 --> 20:51.153
Omada is a great example
of how it's happening.

20:52.170 --> 20:53.910
- I think it's also, you know, helpful

20:53.910 --> 20:56.703
to sort of give credit
where credit is due.

20:57.990 --> 21:01.650
You know, thanks to the
work of Dr. Levy and others,

21:01.650 --> 21:05.220
the CPT Editorial Panel has been creating

21:05.220 --> 21:08.820
codes that have allowed
providers to start practicing

21:08.820 --> 21:12.210
delivering care in a
population health model.

21:12.210 --> 21:14.283
And so, if you go back to 2013,

21:14.283 --> 21:16.860
2013 is when the complex
chronic care management

21:16.860 --> 21:19.380
and transitional care management
codes were introduced.

21:19.380 --> 21:21.660
2015 was chronic care management.

21:21.660 --> 21:24.180
2019 was remote physiologic monitoring.

21:24.180 --> 21:25.340
2020 was eVisits.

21:25.340 --> 21:28.680
2022 was principal care management

21:28.680 --> 21:30.810
and remote physiologic monitoring.

21:30.810 --> 21:33.660
And if you look at the
utilization of all of those codes,

21:33.660 --> 21:37.170
they're increasing significantly
over the past few years.

21:37.170 --> 21:39.210
And what that's done is enabled,

21:39.210 --> 21:40.860
you know, there's companies like Omada

21:40.860 --> 21:44.430
which, you know, have our
virtual first types of models.

21:44.430 --> 21:46.890
They've always been sort of
delivering care in that way.

21:46.890 --> 21:50.400
But what these sets of
CPT codes have enabled

21:50.400 --> 21:53.130
sort of, you know, any
provider to do, if you will,

21:53.130 --> 21:55.640
is to begin to provide
care management services,

21:55.640 --> 21:57.870
is to begin to provide
care navigation services,

21:57.870 --> 22:00.150
to begin to remotely monitor patients.

22:00.150 --> 22:02.490
Those are sort of like the
foundations of delivering care

22:02.490 --> 22:04.590
in a population health-based model.

22:04.590 --> 22:07.500
So physicians, health
systems, provider groups

22:07.500 --> 22:08.640
are getting much more comfortable

22:08.640 --> 22:09.840
delivering care in that model

22:09.840 --> 22:11.640
because there's a way for them to be paid

22:11.640 --> 22:13.620
for delivering that service.

22:13.620 --> 22:15.630
I'm hopeful that because there's been

22:15.630 --> 22:18.750
such significant uptake of those code sets

22:18.750 --> 22:20.790
and because providers are
becoming more comfortable

22:20.790 --> 22:23.910
providing care in that
way, it'll sort of grease

22:23.910 --> 22:27.420
the wheels a little bit of
shifting the payment model

22:27.420 --> 22:28.890
to a value-based payment model.

22:28.890 --> 22:31.890
- Yeah, and you emphasized
an important point

22:31.890 --> 22:35.490
that Dr. Levy made, which is,
sometimes value-based care

22:35.490 --> 22:37.500
is actually about doing less.

22:37.500 --> 22:39.480
And that's a point that
I think we often lose

22:39.480 --> 22:43.290
in the conversation, but when
you are getting reimbursed

22:43.290 --> 22:45.510
for doing less for the patient,

22:45.510 --> 22:47.280
doing the chronic disease management

22:47.280 --> 22:48.600
and all of the wraparound services,

22:48.600 --> 22:50.850
obviously the patients can really win.

22:50.850 --> 22:53.550
So, you know, as we talk about, you know,

22:53.550 --> 22:55.320
where healthcare is going,

22:55.320 --> 22:58.740
obviously we want to continue
to try to reduce costs,

22:58.740 --> 23:00.300
provide more value.

23:00.300 --> 23:01.710
There's been a lot of evolution,

23:01.710 --> 23:04.260
and certainly we've learned
a lot, and digital tools

23:04.260 --> 23:07.290
have been an important
component of the journey.

23:07.290 --> 23:09.390
What else needs to be modernized

23:09.390 --> 23:11.730
on the infrastructure
layer, on the tool side,

23:11.730 --> 23:15.840
on the payment side around
how we align incentives?

23:15.840 --> 23:17.730
And Barbara is just champing
at the bit. (laughs)

23:17.730 --> 23:20.670
- Yeah, so I've really been
thinking about this a lot.

23:20.670 --> 23:24.780
And one of the issues is that
we have to stop being reactive

23:24.780 --> 23:27.840
to our patients coming
to us with a complaint

23:27.840 --> 23:30.930
and be proactive in terms of following.

23:30.930 --> 23:32.550
So if patient comes to me

23:32.550 --> 23:35.070
and she's got heavy bleeding, let's say,

23:35.070 --> 23:38.820
and we have an interaction and
we decide on a plan of care.

23:38.820 --> 23:41.610
In a classic fee-for-service model,

23:41.610 --> 23:44.400
I would write a prescription
or we would come up with a plan

23:44.400 --> 23:48.840
and she would go out and I
would wait until she complained

23:48.840 --> 23:49.983
if it wasn't working.

23:50.910 --> 23:53.190
Well, in a value-based care model,

23:53.190 --> 23:57.000
you wanna use tech and AI and other tools

23:57.000 --> 24:01.590
to be able to say after her
next period, "Did it work?

24:01.590 --> 24:03.720
Were you able to pick up your prescription

24:03.720 --> 24:05.430
or was there a barrier there?"

24:05.430 --> 24:08.610
So becoming proactive and using tools

24:08.610 --> 24:13.050
to enable us to be much more
interactive with patients,

24:13.050 --> 24:17.580
but also to know whether what
we've done is working or not,

24:17.580 --> 24:22.580
I think is a huge benefit
for tech to help us do

24:22.620 --> 24:25.533
and help us become proactive
instead of reactive.

24:27.450 --> 24:29.220
- I think I have my wishlist,

24:29.220 --> 24:32.760
which probably most innovators
in digital health have.

24:32.760 --> 24:33.870
The first, I would say,

24:33.870 --> 24:36.180
continue the good work with the CPT codes.

24:36.180 --> 24:40.080
I think that we all
appreciate that and need it.

24:40.080 --> 24:41.640
I think the second thing that we need

24:41.640 --> 24:43.860
is reform around licensure.

24:43.860 --> 24:45.330
If we wanna do value-based care,

24:45.330 --> 24:46.590
we need to follow our patients.

24:46.590 --> 24:48.240
All of us have traveled here, right?

24:48.240 --> 24:50.310
Someone in this room has
had a medical concern

24:50.310 --> 24:51.990
while you've been at this conference.

24:51.990 --> 24:54.510
Can you see your home
provider in Las Vegas

24:54.510 --> 24:55.560
if you're from the U.S.?

24:55.560 --> 24:58.710
You cannot because that person
is not licensed in Nevada,

24:58.710 --> 25:01.110
and so they can't do a
telehealth visit with you.

25:01.110 --> 25:04.500
So improving our licensure and
board certification process

25:04.500 --> 25:06.960
to make it easier for
multi-state licensure

25:06.960 --> 25:10.470
or even national licensure, I
think would be a big, big win.

25:10.470 --> 25:11.460
And then the third thing,

25:11.460 --> 25:13.110
which I would say to
many of you who are here

25:13.110 --> 25:15.960
who are innovators in devices is pursuing,

25:15.960 --> 25:19.560
it's easier to develop a device
and go the wellness route.

25:19.560 --> 25:22.140
It's easier, you'll get your
device out in the market,

25:22.140 --> 25:25.710
you'll get traction, you'll
get consumer dollars coming in.

25:25.710 --> 25:29.160
Please take the time and work
to go through the FDA process

25:29.160 --> 25:31.050
and produce a clinical grade device

25:31.050 --> 25:33.120
because that's how we're
going to have value-based care

25:33.120 --> 25:36.600
because the payer, the
government that benefits buyer,

25:36.600 --> 25:38.610
they're not gonna
reimburse for your device

25:38.610 --> 25:40.560
unless it has gone
through a vetting process

25:40.560 --> 25:43.440
to prove that it's delivering
outcomes that can be trusted,

25:43.440 --> 25:45.630
especially if they're
gonna link payment to it.

25:45.630 --> 25:47.820
So having access to your innovation

25:47.820 --> 25:50.190
on the clinical grade side,
we are dreaming over lunch

25:50.190 --> 25:52.350
of the future of blood pressure monitoring

25:52.350 --> 25:54.480
possibly not being cuffs.

25:54.480 --> 25:55.860
We do need that innovation,

25:55.860 --> 25:58.440
but I think our regulatory process

25:58.440 --> 26:00.190
kind of scares people a little bit.

26:01.260 --> 26:02.730
So that's my wishlist.

26:02.730 --> 26:04.222
- I do wanna give a quick shout out.

26:04.222 --> 26:08.430
You know, CTA has been very
involved in advancing standards

26:08.430 --> 26:10.920
for a lot of the consumer-facing
digital health products.

26:10.920 --> 26:12.990
And that's a space that
we'll continue to need to do

26:12.990 --> 26:14.760
a lot of work on to make
sure that the things

26:14.760 --> 26:19.440
actually do work for all
patients and all consumers.

26:19.440 --> 26:20.460
Jared?

26:20.460 --> 26:22.110
- Yeah, I mean, you know, I'll just share

26:22.110 --> 26:23.910
from my most recent healthcare experience.

26:23.910 --> 26:26.520
So I tore my meniscus two years ago.

26:26.520 --> 26:29.280
Carolyn asked in the prep if
it was doing something exciting

26:29.280 --> 26:30.393
like skiing.

26:31.260 --> 26:32.820
Unfortunately, it was like picking up

26:32.820 --> 26:35.250
my two-year-old at the time.

26:35.250 --> 26:38.100
But I needed surgery and then I needed PT.

26:38.100 --> 26:42.600
And I asked my surgeon if
I could do my PT virtually.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.280
And they said, "Well, you sort of can,

26:44.280 --> 26:46.320
but we don't think it's
as good as in-person PT,"

26:46.320 --> 26:49.950
which evidence shows it's
just as good as in-person PT.

26:49.950 --> 26:52.170
So I went and did in-person PT.

26:52.170 --> 26:53.580
And then three months later,

26:53.580 --> 26:56.017
I got a letter from Aetna saying,

26:56.017 --> 26:58.320
"We notice you have a health,"

26:58.320 --> 26:59.947
that's when the claim hit for the surgery.

26:59.947 --> 27:02.010
"We noticed you have a healthcare issue

27:02.010 --> 27:02.970
that you need PT for.

27:02.970 --> 27:03.930
Would you like to enroll

27:03.930 --> 27:05.970
in our partner's virtual PT program?"

27:05.970 --> 27:07.260
And I'm like, "Well, it
would've been really nice

27:07.260 --> 27:09.960
if I had had this letter,
you know, three months ago."

27:10.860 --> 27:15.030
And, you know, my ideal
model being a working parent

27:15.030 --> 27:17.580
would've been to have some
in-person PT in the beginning

27:17.580 --> 27:18.413
when they could've done

27:18.413 --> 27:20.280
the physical manipulation of my knee

27:20.280 --> 27:23.310
and then to sort of transition
to virtual PT over time,

27:23.310 --> 27:26.280
with AI to make sure I was
doing the exercises properly,

27:26.280 --> 27:27.390
with text messaging

27:27.390 --> 27:29.700
to make sure that I'm
actually doing the exercises,

27:29.700 --> 27:31.650
checking in if there's
anything that I need.

27:31.650 --> 27:32.730
So the care model for me

27:32.730 --> 27:34.800
is not like complicated to envision,

27:34.800 --> 27:36.360
but putting it all together in a way

27:36.360 --> 27:38.790
where that's offered to
me at the time of service,

27:38.790 --> 27:40.980
we're totally not there yet.

27:40.980 --> 27:43.080
And then I think the other
thing is we're gonna need

27:43.080 --> 27:45.360
the CPT code set to continue to evolve

27:45.360 --> 27:47.040
to keep up with those
types of care models,

27:47.040 --> 27:49.410
which I know Dr. Levy and
others are working on,

27:49.410 --> 27:51.600
you know, but I think
that's sort of the next step

27:51.600 --> 27:56.550
of making sure there's a
way of describing that care

27:56.550 --> 27:59.130
and getting paid for care
in a way that is, you know,

27:59.130 --> 28:00.960
what the way that I wanna receive it,

28:00.960 --> 28:03.060
you know, in a
patient-centric kind of way.

28:03.060 --> 28:05.460
- So, Dr. Jasik, you know,

28:05.460 --> 28:07.380
there's been a lot of concern

28:07.380 --> 28:09.210
about consolidation in healthcare,

28:09.210 --> 28:11.010
but we still have a lot of fragmentation

28:11.010 --> 28:13.080
in terms of where patients are receiving

28:13.080 --> 28:16.410
various components of the
things that they need.

28:16.410 --> 28:18.253
You know, what Jared just described,

28:18.253 --> 28:19.560
you know, you can imagine how

28:19.560 --> 28:21.990
if he didn't have a usual source of care

28:21.990 --> 28:23.850
and had these services,

28:23.850 --> 28:26.490
that it could be spread
across lots of places.

28:26.490 --> 28:28.470
And how on earth do you create a system

28:28.470 --> 28:31.350
that gives him the
nudge or the opportunity

28:31.350 --> 28:32.183
to be enrolled

28:32.183 --> 28:34.740
in a truly digitally-enabled
value-based care paradigm?

28:34.740 --> 28:37.560
You know, how is Omada
thinking about that?

28:37.560 --> 28:39.540
And what could that future look like,

28:39.540 --> 28:42.030
given that, you know,
he may be more likely

28:42.030 --> 28:45.660
to respond to a nudge
from a trusted clinician

28:45.660 --> 28:47.793
rather than his third-party payer?

28:48.960 --> 28:50.040
- Well, there are a couple things

28:50.040 --> 28:52.350
preventing you from getting that nudge.

28:52.350 --> 28:55.710
So the first is, I'll say it's wonder

28:55.710 --> 28:58.530
we haven't said this word
this long into this session.

28:58.530 --> 29:00.870
Interoperability of
data is not at the point

29:00.870 --> 29:04.090
where it needs to be, such that
you could receive that nudge

29:05.134 --> 29:08.160
from your payer, would
be the most likely place.

29:08.160 --> 29:11.310
And that really needs
to be in place for us

29:11.310 --> 29:16.310
to be able to get to a point
where those nudges will happen.

29:17.340 --> 29:19.780
But I think the other
thing that's going to

29:21.060 --> 29:23.160
make us not have fragmentation

29:23.160 --> 29:24.870
is just honestly a commitment.

29:24.870 --> 29:26.250
So the problem right now

29:26.250 --> 29:28.380
is the way that VC funding is

29:28.380 --> 29:31.110
for most of the digital health companies

29:31.110 --> 29:34.860
is there's a strong push
to come out with one thing

29:34.860 --> 29:38.550
in a niche area, show
traction and generate revenue.

29:38.550 --> 29:41.160
So what you end up having
is 20 different companies

29:41.160 --> 29:43.170
all doing 20 different types of care

29:43.170 --> 29:45.510
and you have almost
like a virtual pill mill

29:45.510 --> 29:47.790
where someone's going
here to get their GLP

29:47.790 --> 29:49.860
and here to get their hair loss medication

29:49.860 --> 29:51.780
and here to get their birth control.

29:51.780 --> 29:53.550
And now they've got
three different providers

29:53.550 --> 29:55.470
and oh no, they're in
the emergency room now

29:55.470 --> 29:58.830
with a medical complaint and
there's no interoperability,

29:58.830 --> 30:00.750
no one knows what medications they're on,

30:00.750 --> 30:03.360
and it's up to the patient
to be able to manage

30:03.360 --> 30:05.070
and be aware of all that care.

30:05.070 --> 30:08.310
And that's, at least in the U.S.,

30:08.310 --> 30:12.000
what our capitalistic
funding, you know, structure

30:12.000 --> 30:13.380
is pushing us toward.

30:13.380 --> 30:15.780
So it's gonna take us as
a collective community

30:15.780 --> 30:18.060
to say no and to commit.

30:18.060 --> 30:20.400
And this is part of what
Omada has tried to do

30:20.400 --> 30:24.450
by partnering with the AMA,
is embracing the complexity

30:24.450 --> 30:28.350
of asking could we do this
and not fragment the care?

30:28.350 --> 30:32.520
And it takes a lot of
creativity and diligence.

30:32.520 --> 30:34.740
We are a huge supporter
of the medical home,

30:34.740 --> 30:39.740
and whenever we think about
our care, we think about, okay,

30:39.960 --> 30:41.520
what would a care handoff look like?

30:41.520 --> 30:43.740
If we have a member who, for example,

30:43.740 --> 30:45.690
has a concerning diabetes number,

30:45.690 --> 30:47.250
how can we reach that provider?

30:47.250 --> 30:49.350
In an ideal world, we
would have interoperability

30:49.350 --> 30:50.940
and I could exchange that data.

30:50.940 --> 30:52.350
It's not the world we live in.

30:52.350 --> 30:56.070
So in my world, we send
an eFax to that provider

30:56.070 --> 30:59.250
and let them know, you know,
or we call them actually

30:59.250 --> 31:01.530
and let them know, you
know, the sugar is high,

31:01.530 --> 31:02.730
but we've made that commitment

31:02.730 --> 31:04.020
because that's the right thing to do

31:04.020 --> 31:05.430
to not have fragmented care.

31:05.430 --> 31:09.750
And so, that's what I
think is needed, yeah.

31:09.750 --> 31:11.460
- And I will say in the hat that I wear

31:11.460 --> 31:12.660
as a chief medical officer

31:12.660 --> 31:15.300
for a virtual women's health company,

31:15.300 --> 31:18.780
we are using the principal
care management code

31:18.780 --> 31:21.750
to do care coordination care navigation

31:21.750 --> 31:23.730
and be that medical home.

31:23.730 --> 31:28.140
So it takes effort, to your point exactly,

31:28.140 --> 31:29.730
to reduce that fragmentation,

31:29.730 --> 31:34.380
to be sure that someone is
gathering all of the information

31:34.380 --> 31:37.290
from all of the specialists and the care,

31:37.290 --> 31:42.290
putting it into a single place
and then designing a chart,

31:42.930 --> 31:45.990
frankly, that has the problem
list that's up to date

31:45.990 --> 31:48.873
that keeps the med list up to date.

31:50.040 --> 31:51.903
That costs money to do.

31:52.770 --> 31:56.253
It costs human beings right
now to do a lot of it.

31:57.750 --> 32:01.260
But we are getting traction
in a value-based care world

32:01.260 --> 32:04.560
to say to payers and to employers,

32:04.560 --> 32:07.350
this is a really valuable service,

32:07.350 --> 32:10.890
that that fragmentation
if I know that an employer

32:10.890 --> 32:15.890
has those services available,
Jared, if your employer

32:16.080 --> 32:20.100
had had the virtual services
available or your payer,

32:20.100 --> 32:23.340
then a medical home that
was coordinating your care,

32:23.340 --> 32:27.000
not so much the surgeon who
was part of a health system

32:27.000 --> 32:30.690
that was trying to drive
services to their own system,

32:30.690 --> 32:33.780
but your employer, your payer or someone

32:33.780 --> 32:35.730
who was gathering all of that information.

32:35.730 --> 32:39.900
I think that interoperability
is absolutely critical

32:39.900 --> 32:43.920
and it's really bringing value to patients

32:43.920 --> 32:46.440
because they don't end
up stuck in the middle.

32:46.440 --> 32:49.590
They don't end up explaining
to the psychiatrist

32:49.590 --> 32:52.623
what the OB/GYN said about
their menopause care.

32:53.850 --> 32:57.480
- So, you know, if
interoperability is like,

32:57.480 --> 32:58.620
you know, a full on marathon,

32:58.620 --> 33:00.150
I don't even know what
mile marker we're at,

33:00.150 --> 33:01.680
but we're early in the race

33:01.680 --> 33:03.390
and there are things at the policy level,

33:03.390 --> 33:05.520
and I don't know if any of our
federal colleagues are here

33:05.520 --> 33:07.620
that have tried to move
that needle forward

33:07.620 --> 33:09.930
and have been important and helpful,

33:09.930 --> 33:12.810
but what is CPT doing and what's its role

33:12.810 --> 33:14.220
in supporting interoperability?

33:14.220 --> 33:16.380
'Cause it's not just about
using HL7 as a framework

33:16.380 --> 33:17.940
to shift data bits around.

33:17.940 --> 33:18.960
Obviously there's an implication

33:18.960 --> 33:20.670
on the coding infrastructure.

33:20.670 --> 33:23.310
- No, it's really about creating codes

33:23.310 --> 33:28.310
that describe that work, that
work of care coordination,

33:28.860 --> 33:32.400
care navigation, of bringing
all of that together.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.140
And we do have a work group

33:34.140 --> 33:36.690
that's working on
value-based care right now

33:36.690 --> 33:39.990
that's trying to say where
are the gaps in the CPT code?

33:39.990 --> 33:44.990
Where can we fill those
gaps so that practices

33:45.120 --> 33:48.570
can create a medical
home kind of environment?

33:48.570 --> 33:50.670
You know, CMS tried that, what was it?

33:50.670 --> 33:54.210
15 years ago or so, and
it sort of kind of worked

33:54.210 --> 33:56.070
and generally didn't

33:56.070 --> 33:59.820
in terms of reducing
cost and improving value,

33:59.820 --> 34:03.690
but given the tools that
we have now, it can work.

34:03.690 --> 34:06.750
And so we are working to create the codes

34:06.750 --> 34:11.750
that will allow practices and
allow health systems as well

34:12.390 --> 34:14.340
to be able to capture

34:14.340 --> 34:17.763
the work that's being
done and get paid for it.

34:18.840 --> 34:20.880
- Alright, so let me
ask one final question,

34:20.880 --> 34:23.490
then I'll give everybody
a minute to wrap up.

34:23.490 --> 34:26.640
So, you know, there's a lot
of stuff here at this meeting,

34:26.640 --> 34:29.130
exciting new technology

34:29.130 --> 34:32.220
and the number one question
that physicians want to know

34:32.220 --> 34:36.420
when they are looking at a new
technology is, does it work?

34:36.420 --> 34:38.040
And that's a hard question,

34:38.040 --> 34:39.930
and it's a hard question for consumers

34:39.930 --> 34:41.910
and consumer-facing technology.

34:41.910 --> 34:43.290
So how should we be thinking

34:43.290 --> 34:45.840
about the generation of evidence,

34:45.840 --> 34:47.940
the level of evidence?

34:47.940 --> 34:49.890
You know, Dr. Jasik, you made a comment

34:49.890 --> 34:52.770
about going through the
FDA clearance process

34:52.770 --> 34:55.350
for consumer-facing products,

34:55.350 --> 34:58.470
but it's a complicated space
and it's not always clear

34:58.470 --> 35:00.390
what level of evidence we should require

35:00.390 --> 35:03.000
for an algorithm or a tool.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.920
How should we advise companies

35:04.920 --> 35:06.570
that are trying to enter the marketplace,

35:06.570 --> 35:09.117
whether it's on the
professional-facing side

35:09.117 --> 35:10.980
or on the consumer-facing side

35:10.980 --> 35:13.380
to be thinking about
this important question?

35:13.380 --> 35:15.330
- Thank you for this question.

35:15.330 --> 35:17.640
At Omada, we have an internal phrase

35:17.640 --> 35:20.460
called we start with science
and we insist on outcomes.

35:20.460 --> 35:24.930
And the outcomes that we talk
about is we're very committed

35:24.930 --> 35:29.100
to publishing the peer-reviewed
journal mechanism.

35:29.100 --> 35:31.170
And I would say that healthcare,

35:31.170 --> 35:32.400
at least in the United States,

35:32.400 --> 35:34.110
I know this is an international audience,

35:34.110 --> 35:35.400
but really across the world,

35:35.400 --> 35:38.250
we have amazing structures
to adjudicate evidence.

35:38.250 --> 35:39.750
We have the CPT Coding Committee

35:39.750 --> 35:41.550
to review our evidence to give us codes.

35:41.550 --> 35:43.440
We have the FDA to review evidence

35:43.440 --> 35:47.070
to reassure us that our
devices are are safe and good.

35:47.070 --> 35:49.230
We have professional bodies like the AMA

35:49.230 --> 35:51.420
and professional societies
that review evidence

35:51.420 --> 35:53.250
to write clinical practice guidelines.

35:53.250 --> 35:55.140
We have the U.S. Preventive
Services Task Force.

35:55.140 --> 35:57.120
I was reading one of
their guidelines today,

35:57.120 --> 35:59.370
reviewing preventive healthcare evidence

35:59.370 --> 36:01.380
and making recommendations there.

36:01.380 --> 36:05.670
So I would say digital health
should not reinvent the wheel.

36:05.670 --> 36:09.150
We don't need another place or environment

36:09.150 --> 36:11.820
to review the evidence, but
we do need to participate

36:11.820 --> 36:15.270
and get to know and embrace
those structures that do exist

36:15.270 --> 36:16.890
and do the proper studies,

36:16.890 --> 36:18.900
submit them to the proper organizations,

36:18.900 --> 36:23.640
publish your work, hire a
scientist or part of a scientist

36:23.640 --> 36:25.890
to help you evaluate your technology,

36:25.890 --> 36:28.740
partner with the AMA,
if they're interested,

36:28.740 --> 36:30.540
on whatever your technology is

36:30.540 --> 36:31.890
because they will help you,

36:31.890 --> 36:33.870
and start with science

36:33.870 --> 36:36.810
and make sure you're building
something that is worthwhile.

36:36.810 --> 36:40.470
And so get to know the
healthcare community.

36:40.470 --> 36:42.300
We're messy.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.640
The evidence review is slow sometimes.

36:44.640 --> 36:46.290
The regulatory process is slow,

36:46.290 --> 36:49.080
but it does work and it
protects our consumer.

36:49.080 --> 36:53.283
And I think it's up to all
of us to participate in that.

36:54.120 --> 36:56.227
I think tech people
often are kind of like,

36:56.227 --> 36:58.080
"Oh, I'm here to disrupt.

36:58.080 --> 37:00.930
I'm not gonna participate in
that institutional structure."

37:00.930 --> 37:02.820
I think that holds a lot of companies back

37:02.820 --> 37:05.280
and a lot of technology back.

37:05.280 --> 37:06.930
You should need to get to know the system

37:06.930 --> 37:07.950
and work within it.

37:07.950 --> 37:09.420
- [Jesse] Jared's nodding.

37:09.420 --> 37:11.190
- Yeah, no, I really agree.

37:11.190 --> 37:14.160
I mean, I think it's been
a real problem though.

37:14.160 --> 37:16.350
I mean, I think if you
look back at the history

37:16.350 --> 37:19.230
of digital health back to the early 2000s,

37:19.230 --> 37:21.090
you know, for every a hundred companies

37:21.090 --> 37:23.550
that got seed stage funding,

37:23.550 --> 37:25.680
you know, maybe one or two or three

37:25.680 --> 37:28.950
has generated a
high-quality clinical study

37:28.950 --> 37:31.440
in a high-quality peer-reviewed journal.

37:31.440 --> 37:34.860
And it's just, you know, it
was never really acceptable

37:34.860 --> 37:36.360
and it's shaking out in the market

37:36.360 --> 37:38.340
in terms of who's doing
well and who's not.

37:38.340 --> 37:41.130
And I think any company
that's raising money now

37:41.130 --> 37:42.420
or getting off the ground,

37:42.420 --> 37:44.070
that's just gonna be the expectation,

37:44.070 --> 37:46.440
is that you do a really
high-quality study,

37:46.440 --> 37:48.180
publish in a peer-reviewed journal

37:48.180 --> 37:50.400
and you have evidence of clinical impact

37:50.400 --> 37:52.260
and you have evidence
that it can save money

37:52.260 --> 37:53.880
and that it's worth buying.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.860
And so I think that's
gonna be the standard

37:55.860 --> 37:58.230
and I'll add that I think one of the ways

37:58.230 --> 38:00.060
in which you can generate that evidence

38:00.060 --> 38:01.920
is through using real world evidence,

38:01.920 --> 38:04.470
which almost always relies on CPT codes.

38:04.470 --> 38:05.910
And so, there is an infrastructure

38:05.910 --> 38:06.870
through which you can measure

38:06.870 --> 38:09.690
whether your service or product

38:09.690 --> 38:12.810
is delivering the clinical
outcome that you want.

38:12.810 --> 38:15.000
- I have to say again about the CPT code,

38:15.000 --> 38:19.260
this is how we found
Omada's cost, the footprint

38:19.260 --> 38:22.080
of finding our CPT code
billing and our provider code.

38:22.080 --> 38:24.030
That's how I've done
all of my claim studies,

38:24.030 --> 38:25.500
is we have that digital footprint.

38:25.500 --> 38:27.000
- All right, I think,
Barbara, it's the final word

38:27.000 --> 38:27.833
'cause we're running out of time.

38:27.833 --> 38:28.890
- Okay.
- The clock is about to go

38:28.890 --> 38:30.150
flashing and expire.

38:30.150 --> 38:32.040
- No, I would just, you know,

38:32.040 --> 38:33.480
echo what everyone else has said,

38:33.480 --> 38:36.150
that the data is really
important, the science,

38:36.150 --> 38:38.250
the studies are very important.

38:38.250 --> 38:43.050
You have to be addressing a
problem that's really a problem

38:43.050 --> 38:46.230
and you have to think about who benefits.

38:46.230 --> 38:49.350
So is this benefiting a
payer by reducing cost

38:49.350 --> 38:51.330
or an employer by reducing cost?

38:51.330 --> 38:53.550
Is this benefiting a patient,

38:53.550 --> 38:56.400
but a payer isn't gonna pay for it?

38:56.400 --> 39:01.400
So there are a lot of questions
in designing your studies

39:01.800 --> 39:03.630
to be able to answer those questions.

39:03.630 --> 39:04.463
- Amazing.

39:04.463 --> 39:05.640
Alright, Jared, Carolyn, Barbara,

39:05.640 --> 39:08.130
everybody stand up in the
audience please for me.

39:08.130 --> 39:09.420
Come on, come on. There you go.

39:09.420 --> 39:11.792
Standing ovation, look
at that, in Vegas, guys.

39:11.792 --> 39:13.290
(audience applauding)

39:13.290 --> 39:14.610
Really appreciate you being here

39:14.610 --> 39:17.880
and thank you all for
coming to our session.

39:17.880 --> 39:19.127
That's a wrap.

39:19.127 --> 39:21.710
(upbeat music)
