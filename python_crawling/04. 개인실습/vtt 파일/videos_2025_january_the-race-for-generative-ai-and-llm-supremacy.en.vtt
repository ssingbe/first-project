00:01.618 --> 00:04.201
(upbeat music)

00:11.310 --> 00:13.650
<v Presenter>Welcome back everyone, please take your seats.</v>

00:13.650 --> 00:16.320
I hope you all had a chance to recharge

00:16.320 --> 00:19.650
because we're diving straight into the race for Gen AI

00:19.650 --> 00:21.720
and LLM supremacy.

00:21.720 --> 00:23.250
Let me introduce the moderator

00:23.250 --> 00:25.410
who will be leading this discussion,

00:25.410 --> 00:27.900
as one of the country's foremost authorities

00:27.900 --> 00:30.420
on artificial intelligence and blockchain,

00:30.420 --> 00:33.420
Sandy Carter has been a notable expert working

00:33.420 --> 00:38.420
with AI since 2013 and with blockchain since 2019.

00:38.460 --> 00:40.140
She has had a distinguished career

00:40.140 --> 00:44.092
holding leadership positions as a chief operations officer,

00:44.092 --> 00:45.780
chief product officer,

00:45.780 --> 00:47.520
and chief sales officer working

00:47.520 --> 00:50.940
for Amazon Web Services and IBM.

00:50.940 --> 00:55.940
She's also top 10 AI entrepreneur from Microsoft MSN.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.890
Sandy, this stage is yours.

00:58.890 --> 01:00.150
<v ->Thank you so much</v>

01:00.150 --> 01:02.370
and thank you guys for going out and coming back in.

01:02.370 --> 01:04.530
We're so excited for this panel.

01:04.530 --> 01:08.460
We have an amazing, amazing set of leaders

01:08.460 --> 01:09.900
who are gonna talk to you today.

01:09.900 --> 01:12.780
How many of you guys were at Jensen's keynote?

01:12.780 --> 01:17.780
Yeah, did you hear Gary say if I had placed a bet

01:17.910 --> 01:21.630
on NVIDIA when Jensen first spoke,

01:21.630 --> 01:24.030
I would have retired by now.

01:24.030 --> 01:25.260
That's the same thing you're gonna hear

01:25.260 --> 01:27.540
about these companies today and what they're doing

01:27.540 --> 01:30.780
in this LLM and Gen AI space.

01:30.780 --> 01:32.760
So I have three wishes for you today

01:32.760 --> 01:34.530
to take away from the panel.

01:34.530 --> 01:38.310
One, I want you to see what people are doing today

01:38.310 --> 01:41.160
with LLMs and Gen AI.

01:41.160 --> 01:43.860
Two, I want you to hear about the future

01:43.860 --> 01:45.240
of what's happening.

01:45.240 --> 01:49.320
And then finally, I want you to hear from these experts

01:49.320 --> 01:51.030
on how to get started.

01:51.030 --> 01:52.080
Does that sound good?

01:53.160 --> 01:55.817
Yeah, you guys have to participate with me.

01:55.817 --> 01:56.940
Does that sound great?

01:56.940 --> 01:59.700
Okay, there we go, I want the energy up in the room.

01:59.700 --> 02:01.620
Okay, so let me just introduce very quickly,

02:01.620 --> 02:05.613
the panelist sitting beside me is Hassan Sawaf,

02:07.890 --> 02:11.580
yeah, founder and CEO of aiXplain.

02:11.580 --> 02:12.840
He'll talk a little bit about there,

02:12.840 --> 02:15.330
he is ex-AWS with me as well.

02:15.330 --> 02:17.163
Please give him a warm welcome.

02:18.233 --> 02:20.370
(audience clapping)

02:20.370 --> 02:22.620
Okay, I think we can do better than that.

02:22.620 --> 02:25.680
Sitting beside him is Stephanie Buckner.

02:25.680 --> 02:28.830
She is the COO of a company called Altair.

02:28.830 --> 02:31.140
They've been doing AI for quite a long time

02:31.140 --> 02:32.580
and if you haven't seen the news,

02:32.580 --> 02:34.560
they've announced a potential acquisition

02:34.560 --> 02:38.370
by Siemens for $11 billion.

02:38.370 --> 02:39.860
Welcome Stephanie.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.510
(audience clapping)

02:42.510 --> 02:45.937
And sitting beside Stephanie is Yujing Qian.

02:45.937 --> 02:48.060
He is the vice president

02:48.060 --> 02:51.420
of engineering at GMI, one of the sponsors of the event.

02:51.420 --> 02:53.709
So please give him a warm welcome.

02:53.709 --> 02:56.760
(audience clapping)

02:56.760 --> 02:58.530
And then finally, last but not least,

02:58.530 --> 03:00.720
you'll wanna get your picture with Ray Wang.

03:00.720 --> 03:03.660
He is the founder and CEO of Constellation,

03:03.660 --> 03:05.550
but you've probably seen him,

03:05.550 --> 03:10.080
he does almost daily updates on CNBC, Fox Business News,

03:10.080 --> 03:13.254
Bloomberg, et cetera, welcome to Ray.

03:13.254 --> 03:16.560
(audience clapping)

03:16.560 --> 03:18.690
Okay, so let's go ahead and get started,

03:18.690 --> 03:21.060
now, just some facts to get us started.

03:21.060 --> 03:24.120
Did you guys know that 77%

03:24.120 --> 03:28.800
of companies said they're exploring LLMs right now

03:28.800 --> 03:32.130
for use in their company for production?

03:32.130 --> 03:34.350
The gen AI market is expected

03:34.350 --> 03:38.100
to be $1.3 trillion,

03:38.100 --> 03:41.170
not billion, trillion dollars by 2030

03:42.570 --> 03:45.930
and 90%, 90% of enterprises said

03:45.930 --> 03:50.430
that they will use Gen AI in 2025.

03:50.430 --> 03:52.740
So I think those are some phenomenal numbers,

03:52.740 --> 03:54.690
but Ray is our expert on research.

03:54.690 --> 03:56.160
So Ray, tell us what do you see

03:56.160 --> 03:59.460
as the top trends in this space and if you can, maybe one

03:59.460 --> 04:01.050
or two unexpected ones.

04:01.050 --> 04:02.850
<v ->Oh yeah, okay, happy to do that.</v>

04:02.850 --> 04:04.650
How many people here actually like take something

04:04.650 --> 04:05.910
like Otter and run it on your meeting

04:05.910 --> 04:08.910
so you don't have to listen to them, anyone do that?

04:08.910 --> 04:10.830
That actually is when we look at the research,

04:10.830 --> 04:12.600
like the most practical future of work thing

04:12.600 --> 04:13.980
that people are doing because they don't wanna listen

04:13.980 --> 04:15.810
to their boss and they just wanna like record the meeting

04:15.810 --> 04:17.910
and do work while they're at work.

04:17.910 --> 04:20.010
But meeting avoidance is actually number one.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.270
But there are other amazing issues

04:21.270 --> 04:22.530
that Otter are being used, right?

04:22.530 --> 04:25.620
So procurement and any kind of legal contracts,

04:25.620 --> 04:27.240
we're seeing that pick up really quickly

04:27.240 --> 04:29.790
because there's only so much you can do with a legal intern

04:29.790 --> 04:32.250
to go find case law, see what's happening.

04:32.250 --> 04:34.440
We're definitely seeing in customer experience, the ability

04:34.440 --> 04:35.760
to do deflection or the ability

04:35.760 --> 04:37.980
to improve self-service using agents

04:37.980 --> 04:39.960
to personify what people are doing.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.610
We're also seeing it in terms of your ability

04:41.610 --> 04:44.010
for HR in terms of like interviewings

04:44.010 --> 04:46.560
and screenings for anything from regulatory requirements.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.570
Like do you have the right set of candidates?

04:48.570 --> 04:50.400
Do you have the right set of pools?

04:50.400 --> 04:52.350
Are you doing inclusion properly?

04:52.350 --> 04:53.640
Those are popping up as well.

04:53.640 --> 04:56.520
And then of course, code gen is number one by far, right?

04:56.520 --> 04:58.170
People are building code.

04:58.170 --> 04:59.640
What might have taken you a year

04:59.640 --> 05:01.560
to do is gonna take you a month to do,

05:01.560 --> 05:02.910
what might have taken you a month to do,

05:02.910 --> 05:05.040
some people are doing in like two days.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.750
That's the level of what's going on.

05:06.750 --> 05:08.490
And you know, if you're a CS major

05:08.490 --> 05:10.170
that's graduating this year, I really apologize

05:10.170 --> 05:12.030
because you probably will be unemployed, right?

05:12.030 --> 05:14.040
So we're gonna see stuff like that pop up.

05:14.040 --> 05:16.377
Now, the surprising piece that people like,

05:16.377 --> 05:18.630
and the last one actually is the creative sides.

05:18.630 --> 05:21.180
You've seen how much power it is to be able to create music

05:21.180 --> 05:23.790
or create, look at arts, looking at the ability

05:23.790 --> 05:25.860
to look at a whole set of portfolio of changes,

05:25.860 --> 05:27.930
things that you're able to do, most important,

05:27.930 --> 05:30.030
if you're doing a global campaign,

05:30.030 --> 05:31.320
it would take you five weeks

05:31.320 --> 05:33.330
to actually get each country up and going.

05:33.330 --> 05:35.790
It'll take you five weeks to get all of them up and done.

05:35.790 --> 05:36.990
And so it's a speed thing.

05:36.990 --> 05:40.110
It's this notion that we call exponential efficiency

05:40.110 --> 05:41.580
and enterprise acceleration.

05:41.580 --> 05:43.020
Those two things are happening

05:43.020 --> 05:45.840
at the same time, the surprise use.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.820
<v ->Tell us.</v>
<v ->I think it's gonna be.</v>

05:47.820 --> 05:49.400
<v Sandy>Like what we've heard here at CES,</v>

05:49.400 --> 05:50.350
give us a surprise.

05:51.390 --> 05:53.340
<v ->It's really the way people are punking people</v>

05:53.340 --> 05:55.170
with different types of videos,

05:55.170 --> 05:58.410
unintentional misinformation, sometimes intentional.

05:58.410 --> 05:59.730
I think that's the surprise use,

05:59.730 --> 06:01.050
but the ability to detect

06:01.050 --> 06:03.600
that on the other end is now the surprise use

06:03.600 --> 06:05.550
because you're using AI to fight AI

06:05.550 --> 06:07.770
and you're gonna see more of that come up.

06:07.770 --> 06:09.020
<v ->Awesome, thank you Ray.</v>

06:09.967 --> 06:11.160
And those insights I think are interesting

06:11.160 --> 06:13.770
because they come from Ray's research where he works

06:13.770 --> 06:16.830
with thousands of companies, not just vendors

06:16.830 --> 06:20.070
but end users as well, which I think gives Constellation

06:20.070 --> 06:23.310
a leg up on a lot of the other analyst companies out there.

06:23.310 --> 06:26.400
So Stephanie, Altair has been doing AI since

06:26.400 --> 06:29.190
before AI was really popular and sexy.

06:29.190 --> 06:32.040
So tell us what you are seeing out there

06:32.040 --> 06:34.410
from an Altair perspective, what kind of usage do you see

06:34.410 --> 06:36.630
with LLMs or Gen AI?

06:36.630 --> 06:37.920
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

06:37.920 --> 06:41.580
So a large number of our customers are really exploring

06:41.580 --> 06:43.890
and engaging and every company's at sort

06:43.890 --> 06:47.163
of a different stage in their AI journey, I will say.

06:48.480 --> 06:50.190
A huge concern

06:50.190 --> 06:53.790
that is popping up right now for our customer base is

06:53.790 --> 06:55.290
around control.

06:55.290 --> 06:57.750
And what I mean by that is governance.

06:57.750 --> 07:01.560
So now the LLM concept allows

07:01.560 --> 07:04.650
for huge transfer of information,

07:04.650 --> 07:05.940
but you have to make sure

07:05.940 --> 07:08.130
that the right employees can access

07:08.130 --> 07:09.570
the right information still.

07:09.570 --> 07:12.930
So that's a really core piece to what we've focused on.

07:12.930 --> 07:16.260
And then in addition, you've got hallucination

07:16.260 --> 07:20.940
and when you're really looking at using LLMs in production,

07:20.940 --> 07:25.020
hallucination is absolutely something you cannot tolerate.

07:25.020 --> 07:27.570
And so there are many ways around it,

07:27.570 --> 07:29.670
particularly using technology such

07:29.670 --> 07:33.240
as the RapidMiner platform with the graph base,

07:33.240 --> 07:35.236
the knowledge graph technology.

07:35.236 --> 07:37.320
And so that's really core.

07:37.320 --> 07:40.440
But what I would say actually what I'm hearing

07:40.440 --> 07:44.700
from customers what is our number one challenge around AI

07:44.700 --> 07:48.630
and LLMs, it's actually about transformation.

07:48.630 --> 07:52.320
And what they mean by that is the concern all

07:52.320 --> 07:57.060
of their employees have around the lack of future job

07:57.060 --> 08:01.710
that I am now creating something that will take my job

08:01.710 --> 08:03.780
and what is that gonna mean for me in the future.

08:03.780 --> 08:07.380
And the reality is, is many of the skill sets today

08:07.380 --> 08:11.010
as Ray was talking about, are not gonna be needed.

08:11.010 --> 08:13.410
But there will be new skill sets needed.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.170
I'm not somebody that believes every single role

08:16.170 --> 08:21.170
in an organization is gonna be completely obsolete with AI

08:21.330 --> 08:24.660
but I do think that the roles that we have today will

08:24.660 --> 08:27.660
dramatically transform into the future.

08:27.660 --> 08:29.070
<v ->I think those are great points.</v>

08:29.070 --> 08:31.650
You know, I have two daughters, I have one getting ready

08:31.650 --> 08:33.360
to go to college and one in college

08:33.360 --> 08:37.170
and they are talking about that a lot now at the university.

08:37.170 --> 08:39.120
And in fact, hallucinations come up

08:39.120 --> 08:40.770
and one of the classes,

08:40.770 --> 08:43.860
my daughter was given the opportunity to do research

08:43.860 --> 08:46.380
with a couple of the gen AI tools

08:46.380 --> 08:49.560
like Claude and ChatGPT.

08:49.560 --> 08:52.740
And she found that in one of her pieces of research,

08:52.740 --> 08:54.210
all three of the references,

08:54.210 --> 08:57.180
even though they gave a book, a page number, a person

08:57.180 --> 08:59.670
to quote, none of those were actually real.

08:59.670 --> 09:01.110
So you do have to be really careful.

09:01.110 --> 09:04.050
So those are really, really great points.

09:04.050 --> 09:06.570
Yujing, I know that GMI works really closely

09:06.570 --> 09:09.120
with a lot of engineering leaders out there,

09:09.120 --> 09:10.860
so they're gonna be really interested

09:10.860 --> 09:13.590
in hearing about the patterns that you are seeing

09:13.590 --> 09:17.250
and what's really transforming the space out there.

09:17.250 --> 09:20.640
<v ->Yes, so we work with a lot of enterprises</v>

09:20.640 --> 09:23.820
and we see typical phases that also depends on

09:23.820 --> 09:26.970
how digitalized each enterprise is at this current phase.

09:26.970 --> 09:30.420
But one typical thing we saw is they usually give us five

09:30.420 --> 09:33.800
to six bullet points as if they wanna fire like 50%

09:33.800 --> 09:35.900
of the company but doubling their revenue.

09:37.680 --> 09:39.630
This is very common, like they wanna do this,

09:39.630 --> 09:42.303
they wanna do that like six to seven goals,

09:43.320 --> 09:47.340
but they will soon realize this is not the case, right?

09:47.340 --> 09:49.710
And they then fall down to their engineering department,

09:49.710 --> 09:51.663
say what we can do at this point.

09:52.869 --> 09:55.530
And they're usually starting with some small low risk

09:55.530 --> 09:58.800
but high revenue or our high ROI projects,

09:58.800 --> 10:00.600
which is a very good thing to start.

10:02.130 --> 10:04.740
And then they'll stall on a deeper integration side,

10:04.740 --> 10:08.280
like how are we gonna deal with the data compliance issue,

10:08.280 --> 10:11.730
now that we've tried some prompt using OpenAI or Claude?

10:11.730 --> 10:13.680
How should we proceed with our own data

10:15.090 --> 10:17.370
and how can we get more compute resource?

10:17.370 --> 10:20.160
You know, inferencing the new models is

10:20.160 --> 10:23.070
very costly these days and especially

10:23.070 --> 10:26.070
if you use like high-end models these days.

10:26.070 --> 10:29.520
Like some enterprise even ask specifically for example

10:29.520 --> 10:32.824
for Llama 405B or DeepSeek, which requires

10:32.824 --> 10:34.863
a huge amount of money to run on.

10:35.928 --> 10:38.100
And then that's where, for example,

10:38.100 --> 10:41.100
platforms like GMI Cloud will kick in to help them,

10:41.100 --> 10:43.260
for example, build their private clusters

10:43.260 --> 10:45.160
or do some on-prem deployment

10:46.110 --> 10:50.160
to further help them facilitate their end goals,

10:50.160 --> 10:51.840
for example, to do the rest of the five

10:51.840 --> 10:53.760
or six bullet points.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.170
So this is what I've seen from

10:55.170 --> 10:58.609
what they're doing versus what they plan to do.

10:58.609 --> 11:01.170
Of course there's data issue,

11:01.170 --> 11:05.940
there is data compliance issue, how to handle data PIIs,

11:05.940 --> 11:08.280
how to do data encryptions.

11:08.280 --> 11:12.210
So there is a long, long list for them to went through.

11:12.210 --> 11:14.580
And for companies with a good start, for example,

11:14.580 --> 11:17.310
if they have, already have a unified data layers

11:17.310 --> 11:19.470
like a data lake, congratulations,

11:19.470 --> 11:21.120
they're off to a good start.

11:21.120 --> 11:24.303
But we've also seen some companies are still in,

11:25.622 --> 11:28.260
still not very mature when it comes to digitalization.

11:28.260 --> 11:31.620
So our recommendation would be try to start small, try

11:31.620 --> 11:33.600
to find the data

11:33.600 --> 11:37.230
or database that has the best quality in that domain

11:37.230 --> 11:42.230
or that's most consistent to start with, yeah.

11:42.330 --> 11:44.040
<v ->Interesting, so can you tell us, like if you had</v>

11:44.040 --> 11:45.300
to look at all those five bullets

11:45.300 --> 11:47.190
that everybody's given you, what's the number one bullet

11:47.190 --> 11:48.750
that you see over and over again?

11:48.750 --> 11:50.370
<v ->Oh yeah, the number one bullet is always</v>

11:50.370 --> 11:53.250
like some kind of Copilot workflow.

11:53.250 --> 11:55.590
If it's working on, for example, software, hardware,

11:55.590 --> 11:56.910
that's pretty obvious

11:56.910 --> 12:01.203
and it has been a proven use case that works.

12:02.220 --> 12:04.260
For other, for example, customer services

12:04.260 --> 12:06.510
or other 2B business.

12:06.510 --> 12:08.790
They have this human in the loop chat bot

12:08.790 --> 12:10.230
that's also very popular.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.810
So these two I think are currently the most mature

12:14.685 --> 12:17.100
use case that we've seen so far.

12:17.100 --> 12:18.210
But they want

12:18.210 --> 12:21.036
to build other stuff like enterprise RAG,

12:21.036 --> 12:24.840
knowledge base Q&amp;A, which will also require

12:24.840 --> 12:26.590
deeper integration into their data.

12:27.540 --> 12:30.000
<v ->Interesting, so you know,</v>

12:30.000 --> 12:34.350
implementation really separates leaders from laggards

12:34.350 --> 12:37.170
and how you actually execute, not just how you plan,

12:37.170 --> 12:39.510
but how you actually execute as well.

12:39.510 --> 12:42.690
So moving to production sometimes is the big challenge,

12:42.690 --> 12:45.480
even though you've had a small success.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.670
I know Hassan, that you guys are working on a lot

12:47.670 --> 12:50.670
of really interesting things at aiXplain

12:50.670 --> 12:54.946
even making coders, implementers that are not

12:54.946 --> 12:57.600
typically coders like myself, right?

12:57.600 --> 12:59.310
Someone with go to market skills.

12:59.310 --> 13:02.700
So can you talk us through some of what you're doing

13:02.700 --> 13:05.340
and some of what you have in your architecture

13:05.340 --> 13:07.290
or your infrastructure that's crucial

13:07.290 --> 13:09.180
for everyone out here to know about?

13:09.180 --> 13:13.260
<v ->Yeah, thank you Sandy, so yeah, I do AI for,</v>

13:13.260 --> 13:15.420
since, is the microphone working?

13:15.420 --> 13:19.710
<v ->Yeah, there you go.</v>
<v ->Perfect, so I do AI since 92</v>

13:19.710 --> 13:21.120
and I have seen a lot of.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.666
<v ->Wow wait, did you say 1992?</v>

13:23.666 --> 13:25.530
<v ->1992.</v>
<v ->Wow.</v>

13:25.530 --> 13:29.250
<v ->My first language model was 95, my first agent</v>

13:29.250 --> 13:32.370
as we describe it today in 2015.

13:32.370 --> 13:36.600
So the concepts which we are dealing with are not as new

13:36.600 --> 13:40.890
as we might think, but they are more ready

13:40.890 --> 13:42.150
because of the environment.

13:42.150 --> 13:44.730
Compute is ready, data is ready,

13:44.730 --> 13:47.100
people have a better understanding on where to use.

13:47.100 --> 13:49.140
I mean this is definitely something

13:49.140 --> 13:51.900
to be said about ChatGPT when it came

13:51.900 --> 13:53.880
and educated basically millions

13:53.880 --> 13:58.154
and millions of people, which were like distant to AI.

13:58.154 --> 14:03.154
Now I was at AWS, we were building cool technology.

14:04.080 --> 14:08.580
I mean, it was an excellent experience,

14:08.580 --> 14:11.220
20 startups within three

14:11.220 --> 14:14.280
and a half years at AWS, that was,

14:14.280 --> 14:16.050
for me personally, a great experience.

14:16.050 --> 14:19.650
But we were actually addressing the engineer mainly, right?

14:19.650 --> 14:22.560
I mean we wanted to enable them

14:22.560 --> 14:25.490
to basically put things into their hands.

14:25.490 --> 14:30.490
And the reason why we started aiXplain is

14:32.130 --> 14:35.670
what about the 95 other percent of the world?

14:35.670 --> 14:36.840
We need to enable them,

14:36.840 --> 14:39.270
we need to give them tools into their hands

14:39.270 --> 14:40.830
to build capabilities similar

14:40.830 --> 14:43.410
to what an engineer would be doing.

14:43.410 --> 14:44.520
To be able to do that,

14:44.520 --> 14:48.210
we have multiple challenges which need to be addressed.

14:48.210 --> 14:52.860
One is we as AI scientists know what RAG is.

14:52.860 --> 14:57.330
We know what LLM is, we know what signal processing is.

14:57.330 --> 14:58.920
We know, so we know basically

14:58.920 --> 15:00.540
how to put these things together

15:00.540 --> 15:03.600
so that they can work a certain way.

15:03.600 --> 15:08.600
Maybe one model can do it all at once, but typically not.

15:08.730 --> 15:12.930
So to serve that, to solve that problem,

15:12.930 --> 15:17.790
we built basically an our own agent, Bel Esprit,

15:17.790 --> 15:22.169
to take basically a conversation

15:22.169 --> 15:27.169
from an executive into an architecture

15:27.420 --> 15:32.420
of solutions using multiple models right there and so forth.

15:33.030 --> 15:36.660
So now a chief claims officer can actually

15:36.660 --> 15:39.630
immediately converse with a chatbot experience

15:39.630 --> 15:41.070
and build a solution.

15:41.070 --> 15:45.390
Build an agent just by conversing, just by telling it

15:45.390 --> 15:46.980
what is the pain point?

15:46.980 --> 15:49.800
Where do I need to do, what do I need?

15:49.800 --> 15:51.510
What kind of data do I have?

15:51.510 --> 15:53.190
Et cetera, et cetera.

15:53.190 --> 15:58.190
Now, so building the solution is an important component,

16:00.540 --> 16:03.420
but like Stephanie has actually earlier mentioned,

16:03.420 --> 16:05.310
this is not the only thing you need to do

16:05.310 --> 16:07.530
to take basically a solution.

16:07.530 --> 16:11.160
I mean at that point you just have a demo, just prototype.

16:11.160 --> 16:13.590
It's not really deployable

16:13.590 --> 16:15.210
because you don't have the guardrails,

16:15.210 --> 16:17.550
you don't have the data security,

16:17.550 --> 16:19.050
you don't know what's gonna happen

16:19.050 --> 16:21.240
when an algorithm does something

16:21.240 --> 16:23.460
and potentially is biased or something like that.

16:23.460 --> 16:27.720
So you need to build technologies to help you with that.

16:27.720 --> 16:31.830
We implemented things, what we call,

16:31.830 --> 16:35.610
I mean micro agents, what like we call them bodyguards,

16:35.610 --> 16:40.610
dealing, managing data, data access and so forth.

16:41.883 --> 16:44.910
We build micro agents, which are called inspectors,

16:44.910 --> 16:49.680
paying attention to what is, is a certain policy being hurt

16:49.680 --> 16:53.280
for example, does the data need to comply

16:53.280 --> 16:55.020
with HIPAA or something like that.

16:55.020 --> 16:59.490
Sometimes the solution will recruit out of 40,000

16:59.490 --> 17:04.490
of existing agents in aiXplain, multiple inspectors.

17:05.310 --> 17:09.000
One is HIPAA, one is SOC 2, one is, I don't know,

17:09.000 --> 17:12.900
maybe something which generates content which is feasible

17:12.900 --> 17:15.840
to be shown to a 7-year-old, et cetera, et cetera.

17:15.840 --> 17:19.050
And building these kind of capabilities is

17:19.050 --> 17:21.930
what we are enabling our users to do.

17:21.930 --> 17:26.220
So we are trying to reduce the, I mean it's getting more

17:26.220 --> 17:30.051
and more confusing, the more we are,

17:30.051 --> 17:32.610
I mean continuing this AI journey,

17:32.610 --> 17:37.610
the more confusing it is, for me as a like long timer in AI,

17:37.710 --> 17:40.980
it's not easy anymore to say I don't know

17:40.980 --> 17:43.560
what models are coming on a daily basis.

17:43.560 --> 17:48.050
There's new LLMs coming, which one to choose is hard.

17:48.050 --> 17:52.464
Let the AI help us to figure out what AI to use.

17:52.464 --> 17:53.940
So this is what aiXplain offers.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.449
<v ->Interesting.</v>

17:55.449 --> 17:58.080
I think I need a bodyguard too, I think that's really cool.

17:58.080 --> 18:02.850
And so this trend of looking at non-coders starting to code,

18:02.850 --> 18:04.380
do you see that Ray as something

18:04.380 --> 18:07.860
that people are talking about what Hassan is working on?

18:07.860 --> 18:09.180
<v ->Oh yeah, I mean we're definitely gonna see</v>

18:09.180 --> 18:10.743
like a 10th less coders.

18:12.129 --> 18:13.380
You know, you're gonna see definitely people jump in

18:13.380 --> 18:16.410
and just describe business descriptions, right?

18:16.410 --> 18:18.690
I mean the point of AI is not more AI the point of AI is

18:18.690 --> 18:20.010
to make better decisions.

18:20.010 --> 18:21.330
And what's gonna happen over time is

18:21.330 --> 18:23.820
you're gonna draw decision maps and you're gonna say,

18:23.820 --> 18:24.900
that's not where I wanna automate.

18:24.900 --> 18:26.100
You're actually gonna say a different question.

18:26.100 --> 18:28.500
You're gonna say, this is where I want

18:28.500 --> 18:30.540
to insert a human to change the process.

18:30.540 --> 18:32.190
And that's really gonna change the way you look

18:32.190 --> 18:34.380
at how you automate decisions

18:34.380 --> 18:36.240
because that's really the goal of AI

18:36.240 --> 18:38.970
in the end is automating as many decisions as you can

18:38.970 --> 18:40.530
and then back to production ready.

18:40.530 --> 18:42.660
I mean, the question you're gonna ask is

18:42.660 --> 18:45.150
who do you sue when something goes wrong, right?

18:45.150 --> 18:46.380
Very, very important because that's

18:46.380 --> 18:48.240
where you're gonna jump in so you're not production ready

18:48.240 --> 18:49.830
until you can answer that question.

18:49.830 --> 18:52.110
And sometimes that means a human has to be there

18:52.110 --> 18:54.540
or another, you know, another body has to be there

18:54.540 --> 18:57.030
to assume liability, so you'll see that.

18:57.030 --> 18:58.740
Back on the implementation thing,

18:58.740 --> 19:01.710
I think that's just really important is LLMs, you know,

19:01.710 --> 19:05.040
if I told you my LLM is 85% accurate

19:05.040 --> 19:06.960
for customer experience, would people feel good here?

19:06.960 --> 19:09.236
Like raise your hands if you feel good.

19:09.236 --> 19:10.980
It's not bad, right?

19:10.980 --> 19:15.180
But what about 85% for supply chain, anyone up for that?

19:15.180 --> 19:18.150
No, right, it's a million dollars lost per minute.

19:18.150 --> 19:21.630
What about 85% accuracy for finance, anyone?

19:21.630 --> 19:23.430
Anybody wanna go to jail?

19:23.430 --> 19:26.040
All right, what about 85% accuracy for healthcare?

19:26.040 --> 19:29.550
Anyone in, okay, so that's the challenge, right?

19:29.550 --> 19:31.650
And so the other part that's really important is

19:31.650 --> 19:33.240
to make sure you partner for data.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.400
So we're going to see data collectives emerge

19:35.400 --> 19:38.100
and these data collectives basically play a role in terms

19:38.100 --> 19:40.200
of sharing information you're gonna give and get.

19:40.200 --> 19:42.180
And one of the things that you don't realize is

19:42.180 --> 19:44.220
we keep talking about the battle for LLMs

19:44.220 --> 19:45.720
and that's a really cool battle

19:45.720 --> 19:47.730
and we can go into that so deep.

19:47.730 --> 19:50.250
But your data sets are gonna be just as important

19:50.250 --> 19:52.763
because the next 15%, right, that 10%

19:52.763 --> 19:56.490
and then the next 5% is equally valuable.

19:56.490 --> 19:58.020
So don't give away your data

19:58.020 --> 20:00.120
because it's gonna be used somewhere else

20:00.120 --> 20:02.550
because we're competing for precision decisions.

20:02.550 --> 20:04.620
And if you can get to 99%,

20:04.620 --> 20:06.990
that means less humans involved in that process.

20:06.990 --> 20:10.140
If you're at 85%, there's a lot more humans in that process.

20:10.140 --> 20:12.510
And so that level of precision means

20:12.510 --> 20:13.860
we need more data sources

20:13.860 --> 20:16.290
and so that partnership becomes important.

20:16.290 --> 20:18.090
<v ->Yeah, that's interesting, I was just talking actually</v>

20:18.090 --> 20:20.970
to Fei-Fei and she was telling me that everybody thinks

20:20.970 --> 20:23.670
that it's gonna be LLMs that either determine success

20:23.670 --> 20:26.880
or failure, it is gonna be around your data.

20:26.880 --> 20:30.180
And Stephanie, I know at Altair you guys have been working

20:30.180 --> 20:34.560
on helping customers by industry, looking at data models,

20:34.560 --> 20:37.470
looking at compute models to scale.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.600
So what lessons would you give the audience

20:39.600 --> 20:43.290
on data compute at scale?

20:43.290 --> 20:45.450
<v ->Yeah, I mean at the end of the day,</v>

20:45.450 --> 20:47.700
you don't want one AI model.

20:47.700 --> 20:51.330
You're gonna want hundreds of thousands at the end

20:51.330 --> 20:54.780
and that becomes a big challenge when you're in production

20:54.780 --> 20:59.100
and everything needs to work not just at 85%.

20:59.100 --> 21:02.430
And so for us, you know, on the Altair side,

21:02.430 --> 21:05.850
we have deep expertise on the high performance computing

21:05.850 --> 21:07.950
and we're the number one player for workload

21:07.950 --> 21:09.750
and workflow scheduling.

21:09.750 --> 21:13.020
And so our technology is on the largest computers

21:13.020 --> 21:15.690
in the world today, the exoscale computers.

21:15.690 --> 21:19.230
And we're leveraging this expertise really

21:19.230 --> 21:23.910
and applying it into our AI operations and our AI platform.

21:23.910 --> 21:27.090
But scalability is one of the major concerns

21:27.090 --> 21:30.390
that really comes out as a customer progresses

21:30.390 --> 21:31.410
through their journey.

21:31.410 --> 21:35.400
To begin, it always starts more on the data side

21:35.400 --> 21:38.280
of I need to have the right data.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.920
And that's really complicated for customers today

21:40.920 --> 21:42.660
because most customers,

21:42.660 --> 21:45.450
their data is segmented into different silos.

21:45.450 --> 21:49.380
You've got an ERP, you've got a PLM, you've got, you know,

21:49.380 --> 21:51.030
all these different silos of data

21:51.030 --> 21:53.100
that are not necessarily connected.

21:53.100 --> 21:55.980
You may have dumped them into a data lake,

21:55.980 --> 21:58.530
but that doesn't actually create the relationships

21:58.530 --> 22:01.470
that are needed across those different silos.

22:01.470 --> 22:05.790
And so the data aspect becomes even more important

22:05.790 --> 22:07.590
into the future.

22:07.590 --> 22:10.500
And one of the core concepts

22:10.500 --> 22:15.500
that Altair focuses on is a data fabric and AI fabric.

22:15.690 --> 22:19.080
And this is really creating that layer over top

22:19.080 --> 22:20.550
of those different data silos.

22:20.550 --> 22:23.010
Because as Ray was talking about, you're gonna have data,

22:23.010 --> 22:24.030
whether it's your own data

22:24.030 --> 22:27.030
or outside data that's coming in that's needed

22:27.030 --> 22:28.890
to help train the models

22:28.890 --> 22:31.530
but also to give responses

22:31.530 --> 22:35.610
in real time on different actions, sensors,

22:35.610 --> 22:37.560
things like that that are happening.

22:37.560 --> 22:40.920
And so, you know, it's really gonna be, I think one

22:40.920 --> 22:43.200
of the most important and critical aspects.

22:43.200 --> 22:46.950
Most people are always thinking about AI modeling

22:46.950 --> 22:50.280
and how do I get my models out into operation?

22:50.280 --> 22:52.200
But that's sort of the second step.

22:52.200 --> 22:55.286
You have to start with the right data.

22:55.286 --> 22:57.990
<v ->Absolutely, data, data, data.</v>

22:57.990 --> 22:59.310
But there is one other thing

22:59.310 --> 23:01.530
besides data, which is integration.

23:01.530 --> 23:02.820
How many of you out there have

23:02.820 --> 23:05.730
to integrate these solutions into what you're doing?

23:05.730 --> 23:07.920
Or are all of you guys startups?

23:07.920 --> 23:10.530
No, okay, most people here have to integrate.

23:10.530 --> 23:13.080
So Yujing, talk to us a little bit about integration

23:13.080 --> 23:16.260
'cause integration can sometimes be the Achilles heel

23:16.260 --> 23:18.120
in a solution for AI.

23:18.120 --> 23:21.210
<v ->Exactly, especially when you're given this black box</v>

23:21.210 --> 23:25.110
of large language models, people usually just, oh no,

23:25.110 --> 23:26.730
how should I integrate into our business?

23:26.730 --> 23:29.430
Right, I know how to type in and receive the response,

23:29.430 --> 23:32.520
but what about our existing workflow?

23:32.520 --> 23:34.830
I think that's the most asked questions

23:34.830 --> 23:37.053
for established business at these days.

23:37.950 --> 23:41.016
So from an engineering perspective, we will say

23:41.016 --> 23:44.070
don't be afraid of the existing frameworks.

23:44.070 --> 23:45.900
I know like if you live in San Francisco,

23:45.900 --> 23:48.990
you'll probably be dragging to different kind of hackathons

23:48.990 --> 23:53.973
and see like seven to 10 different AI frameworks every week.

23:55.770 --> 23:58.230
That's where like expertise is needed.

23:58.230 --> 24:01.890
Like you need to pick the right expertise as consultant

24:01.890 --> 24:05.070
to tell you what kind of framework is needed

24:05.070 --> 24:07.350
to suit your actual use case.

24:07.350 --> 24:10.050
For example, somebody have their own data lakes already

24:10.050 --> 24:13.470
established on Databricks, then it's probably fairly easy

24:13.470 --> 24:15.960
to streamline everything into this,

24:15.960 --> 24:18.093
what we call the LLM ops framework.

24:19.290 --> 24:23.190
If they're still not in this kind of data lake process,

24:23.190 --> 24:26.430
then we need to figure out where the data sits right now,

24:26.430 --> 24:29.280
what kind of compliance they need to follow,

24:29.280 --> 24:32.820
what about data privacies, how sensitive they are.

24:32.820 --> 24:35.070
And most importantly, we need to see the thing

24:35.070 --> 24:39.240
as a pipeline, not just a snapshot.

24:39.240 --> 24:40.950
Because like Stephanie has mentioned,

24:40.950 --> 24:43.290
model training is just one thing.

24:43.290 --> 24:46.230
The most important is how you manage your actual data flow.

24:46.230 --> 24:48.540
And what's most important is this,

24:48.540 --> 24:51.630
how this data flow would flow into your business

24:51.630 --> 24:55.593
and in the end be integrated by different components.

24:56.910 --> 25:00.870
For example, agent is one of the most debated

25:00.870 --> 25:02.793
or discussed topic these days.

25:03.660 --> 25:07.680
So my take is don't be afraid of starting using a framework.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.180
I know there is a debate

25:09.180 --> 25:11.220
between framework or no framework.

25:11.220 --> 25:15.180
Somebody says no framework is the best engineering practice.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.890
Somebody says, oh, just use a framework.

25:16.890 --> 25:19.020
So our recommendation is trivial.

25:19.020 --> 25:20.640
Just try using a framework

25:20.640 --> 25:22.170
and establish a framework

25:22.170 --> 25:26.820
to prototype your business pain point or your business need.

25:26.820 --> 25:28.560
And then you will figure out what you need

25:28.560 --> 25:29.730
and what's lacking.

25:29.730 --> 25:33.033
So don't be afraid to try, that's my take.

25:34.350 --> 25:36.990
<v ->So we've been talking a lot about the technology today,</v>

25:36.990 --> 25:38.820
but I'm a Forbes contributor

25:38.820 --> 25:43.770
and I wrote an article on ROI, ROI, ROI for AI.

25:43.770 --> 25:46.410
It was one of my top rated articles

25:46.410 --> 25:49.470
because everybody now is moving into, I have to prove

25:49.470 --> 25:54.470
to my boss that this is not just cool, it's not just AI

25:54.660 --> 25:58.290
but it actually delivers a measurable business outcome.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.670
So Ray, I'm gonna go first to you

25:59.670 --> 26:02.610
'cause I know you've recently done some research here

26:02.610 --> 26:07.170
on what are the elements that cause a project

26:07.170 --> 26:10.020
to be ROI positive, to be successful

26:10.020 --> 26:13.500
and what are the things that these folks could watch out for

26:13.500 --> 26:16.680
that might deter from that ROI mission?

26:16.680 --> 26:17.513
<v ->Yeah, no, Sandy,</v>

26:17.513 --> 26:18.720
everybody wants to know what the payback is.

26:18.720 --> 26:22.230
And if you think about what happened last year,

26:22.230 --> 26:25.590
and we basically robbed budgets to pay for AI, right?

26:25.590 --> 26:26.910
You saw it all across the board,

26:26.910 --> 26:28.470
like your marketing budget got robbed,

26:28.470 --> 26:30.780
your cybersecurity budget got robbed

26:30.780 --> 26:33.480
and people were trying to pay for all these AI innovations.

26:33.480 --> 26:36.450
And then the question was really did anybody succeed?

26:36.450 --> 26:40.920
And we saw about 15 to 17% of POCs,

26:40.920 --> 26:42.870
proof of concepts succeed.

26:42.870 --> 26:44.490
And the companies that did succeed,

26:44.490 --> 26:46.680
they were able to see a lot of gains.

26:46.680 --> 26:47.820
I'll give you a great example.

26:47.820 --> 26:50.370
We were interviewing the CEO of Sam's Club

26:50.370 --> 26:54.390
on stage at our AI forum and basically he goes,

26:54.390 --> 26:57.270
we got rid of 10 million tasks, right?

26:57.270 --> 26:59.348
And the next thing you would think is like, yeah,

26:59.348 --> 27:00.660
and we also got rid of X number of people, right?

27:00.660 --> 27:02.340
That's probably what you would think.

27:02.340 --> 27:04.350
But instead he actually said,

27:04.350 --> 27:07.050
we actually added 3% more frontline workers

27:07.050 --> 27:09.180
because we needed a human touch, right?

27:09.180 --> 27:11.940
So you're starting to see that type of ROI,

27:11.940 --> 27:14.790
if you're looking for the next AI stocks to invest in,

27:14.790 --> 27:17.700
it's not the NVIDIAs of the world, it's the companies

27:17.700 --> 27:19.290
that are putting AI to work.

27:19.290 --> 27:21.780
So if you look at what Uber did,

27:21.780 --> 27:23.190
you only got a certain number of drivers

27:23.190 --> 27:24.990
and they can only drive a certain number of days.

27:24.990 --> 27:27.420
But what they did was they took their data science

27:27.420 --> 27:29.160
and their machine learning capabilities

27:29.160 --> 27:31.290
and figure out how to do ride batching,

27:31.290 --> 27:33.300
putting more people into the car, right?

27:33.300 --> 27:35.490
And able to actually figure out how

27:35.490 --> 27:37.050
to do dynamic pricing on the backend.

27:37.050 --> 27:39.510
And those two things means the driver gets more rides

27:39.510 --> 27:40.343
or more fares.

27:40.343 --> 27:41.580
And of course Uber takes their cut,

27:41.580 --> 27:44.220
but you get the idea, they can then build against that.

27:44.220 --> 27:46.860
So we're starting to see this happen in places

27:46.860 --> 27:48.117
and you're gonna see more and more companies

27:48.117 --> 27:50.190
who actually have that data foundation

27:50.190 --> 27:51.330
improve personalization,

27:51.330 --> 27:52.650
which means maybe you're more loyal,

27:52.650 --> 27:54.750
which means you're gonna buy more from them.

27:54.750 --> 27:57.060
Or they can figure out at risk employees

27:57.060 --> 27:58.890
who might be leaving and understand,

27:58.890 --> 28:00.240
hey, what are the factors behind that?

28:00.240 --> 28:01.410
Well, their boss left

28:01.410 --> 28:03.120
or their best friends have left, right?

28:03.120 --> 28:05.190
Okay, that's gonna create a cascading effect.

28:05.190 --> 28:07.260
Let's go do something to actually improve retention

28:07.260 --> 28:10.170
because hiring people is not fun, nor is it cheap.

28:10.170 --> 28:12.120
So you'll see more examples like that.

28:12.120 --> 28:13.500
<v ->I love the research that Ray did</v>

28:13.500 --> 28:15.780
'cause he gave kind of three core things

28:15.780 --> 28:18.120
that he saw from successful projects.

28:18.120 --> 28:19.710
Let me see if I get this right.

28:19.710 --> 28:24.000
One was that the people in the company viewed it not

28:24.000 --> 28:26.820
as an AI project but as a business project.

28:26.820 --> 28:29.190
So it wasn't, I'm gonna do this cool LLM

28:29.190 --> 28:31.110
or I'm gonna do this gen AI thing,

28:31.110 --> 28:33.150
it's I'm gonna improve my supply chain,

28:33.150 --> 28:35.490
I'm gonna do something around the business.

28:35.490 --> 28:38.100
The second one was data, they had the right data.

28:38.100 --> 28:39.960
They knew the data that they needed

28:39.960 --> 28:41.640
as they were gonna move forward

28:41.640 --> 28:44.700
because this would help them to ensure

28:44.700 --> 28:47.130
that they didn't reach that 85% point,

28:47.130 --> 28:49.050
but they reached even further.

28:49.050 --> 28:51.270
And then the third one that I saw

28:51.270 --> 28:54.900
that Ray talked about from his research was start small.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.880
A lot of the companies, 'cause you said 15

28:56.880 --> 28:59.610
to 17% were successful, a lot of those

28:59.610 --> 29:02.490
who were not successful started really big.

29:02.490 --> 29:03.780
They started to accomplish something

29:03.780 --> 29:07.170
that was huge versus starting small, learning.

29:07.170 --> 29:08.823
And then moving on from that.

29:09.810 --> 29:11.850
Hassan, I know that you guys are looking

29:11.850 --> 29:13.890
at a lot of economics as well.

29:13.890 --> 29:16.110
Talk to me about what you are seeing in economics.

29:16.110 --> 29:18.870
I know you're working with some insurance companies,

29:18.870 --> 29:20.400
oil companies, et cetera.

29:20.400 --> 29:21.960
Talk to us about what you are seeing in terms

29:21.960 --> 29:23.463
of economics and ROI.

29:24.840 --> 29:29.160
<v ->So we have this customer,</v>

29:29.160 --> 29:34.160
which is an insurance company in Florida.

29:34.200 --> 29:37.620
They are actually, so homeowners insurance doing a great job

29:37.620 --> 29:39.660
with what they're doing on a day-to-day basis.

29:39.660 --> 29:43.200
But then the hurricane hits, and then suddenly,

29:43.200 --> 29:46.290
their less than a hundred human agents have

29:46.290 --> 29:50.130
to solve problems, which are for 10,000 people.

29:50.130 --> 29:51.780
The people cannot be at home.

29:51.780 --> 29:54.090
They cannot, they have big issues.

29:54.090 --> 29:56.733
I mean, it's a big impact.

29:57.810 --> 30:01.410
One of their executives came to explain

30:01.410 --> 30:03.450
and build basically an agent

30:03.450 --> 30:08.000
to augment the human agents with AI

30:09.383 --> 30:14.383
so that an agent can now converse with a customer,

30:14.400 --> 30:16.140
take on the claim,

30:16.140 --> 30:19.470
figure out whether it is within a certain

30:19.470 --> 30:22.170
like approvable budget,

30:22.170 --> 30:23.970
and then basically approve it right away

30:23.970 --> 30:26.070
without the human needing to be involved.

30:26.070 --> 30:29.030
And that includes asking the user to,

30:29.030 --> 30:32.280
or the policy holder to take pictures of the roof

30:32.280 --> 30:34.980
to identify how is the roof looking like?

30:34.980 --> 30:37.650
What material is it, how big is it?

30:37.650 --> 30:38.940
By taking information,

30:38.940 --> 30:42.693
coming from, for example, satellite images and whatnot.

30:44.760 --> 30:48.120
The 75 agents turned into more agents,

30:48.120 --> 30:50.130
more than a hundred agents

30:50.130 --> 30:54.270
because I mean, while they were able

30:54.270 --> 30:57.210
to like solve the majority, the belly

30:57.210 --> 31:00.297
of the distribution was actually be solved by the AI.

31:00.297 --> 31:04.110
Now the actual customer had more time

31:04.110 --> 31:07.290
or the agent had more time to invest with the customers,

31:07.290 --> 31:10.803
which are outside the things the AI can actually solve.

31:12.690 --> 31:14.880
They saved a lot of money, millions and millions.

31:14.880 --> 31:18.600
I can't disclose how much, but I can tell you

31:18.600 --> 31:23.600
that the user experience increased dramatically

31:23.610 --> 31:26.700
from the two point x to four point x,

31:26.700 --> 31:30.180
I mean out of a five point scale.

31:30.180 --> 31:33.270
So that was actually more important almost

31:33.270 --> 31:37.500
than the US dollar, which was actually gained as well.

31:37.500 --> 31:39.630
So winning on these two things.

31:39.630 --> 31:44.280
So I want to talk also about the data.

31:44.280 --> 31:48.120
Data, while it is great

31:48.120 --> 31:50.910
to have the right data to basically build these agents

31:50.910 --> 31:53.490
to have access to, they don't need

31:53.490 --> 31:56.070
to be in double quotes, clean.

31:56.070 --> 31:58.980
We have learned over the 30 years,

31:58.980 --> 32:02.640
cleanliness can be done using AI as well.

32:02.640 --> 32:05.220
I mean, you can utilize, build an agent to learn

32:05.220 --> 32:06.540
on how to deal with your data,

32:06.540 --> 32:09.120
for example, it is the right data,

32:09.120 --> 32:10.710
meaning not how clean they are,

32:10.710 --> 32:14.040
but how much information is encoded in the data

32:14.040 --> 32:16.560
and whether it's gonna be valuable to you,

32:16.560 --> 32:18.870
is it accessible, et cetera, et cetera.

32:18.870 --> 32:21.600
So I have seen a lot

32:21.600 --> 32:26.600
of companies being concerned about their data being messy

32:26.609 --> 32:31.609
and hence never started actually experimenting with AI

32:32.100 --> 32:35.550
just because they felt no, it needs to be all in databases

32:35.550 --> 32:37.470
and structured and this and that.

32:37.470 --> 32:39.120
This is not the way,

32:39.120 --> 32:41.610
this is not the bottleneck.

32:41.610 --> 32:43.860
The bottleneck is to have the right data

32:43.860 --> 32:47.340
to solve a certain problem, so I thought that's.

32:47.340 --> 32:48.853
<v ->That's awesome.</v>

32:48.853 --> 32:50.880
Yeah, don't wait and definitely get started for sure.

32:50.880 --> 32:52.740
<v ->And start small.</v>
<v ->And start small.</v>

32:52.740 --> 32:56.790
That's right, okay, so we've covered kind of

32:56.790 --> 32:59.220
what we see people doing today.

32:59.220 --> 33:01.770
We've covered how you might get started.

33:01.770 --> 33:04.560
We just have time for one more question that we're gonna go

33:04.560 --> 33:08.130
through, which is what do you see for the future?

33:08.130 --> 33:10.620
So Yujing, I'm gonna start with you

33:10.620 --> 33:12.630
and we're gonna go through each and every person.

33:12.630 --> 33:14.730
What is one thing that you want everyone here

33:14.730 --> 33:18.813
to take away about the future of LLM and gen AI?

33:21.750 --> 33:25.113
<v ->One thing I wanna say is there's always a trend,</v>

33:26.340 --> 33:28.990
for example, for this year, agent might be the trend.

33:30.690 --> 33:32.940
Video generation might be the trend,

33:32.940 --> 33:36.963
but you gotta pick what actually works for your business.

33:39.030 --> 33:41.970
I think both our panelists have mentioned starting small,

33:41.970 --> 33:43.293
this is really good.

33:44.880 --> 33:48.240
I also want to add something is pay attention to

33:48.240 --> 33:51.033
how you set things up and your infrastructure.

33:52.140 --> 33:56.460
Because one thing to increase ROI definitely is

33:56.460 --> 33:57.813
by reducing the costs,

34:00.270 --> 34:02.313
find the right infrastructure provider,

34:03.330 --> 34:04.290
try different things.

34:04.290 --> 34:07.110
For example, actually a smaller model rather than,

34:07.110 --> 34:11.280
for example, ChatGPT o1 or Claude Sonnet,

34:11.280 --> 34:13.080
that's very expensive.

34:13.080 --> 34:16.130
Maybe a small model can solve like 90%

34:16.130 --> 34:18.363
or 95% of your core problem.

34:22.890 --> 34:26.430
If there has to be something that you really pay attention,

34:26.430 --> 34:31.260
I will say for the near future, that will still be agent

34:31.260 --> 34:34.800
because that is the thing that can solve,

34:34.800 --> 34:38.410
I will say most of the established business problems

34:40.890 --> 34:45.300
as an agent can really work like a real employee

34:45.300 --> 34:49.650
at this point with some level of function called capability,

34:49.650 --> 34:51.880
the ability to read through documentations

34:53.243 --> 34:56.155
and these knowledge are actually hidden

34:56.155 --> 34:58.650
within your own data.

34:58.650 --> 35:02.870
So my take is focusing on agent thing,

35:02.870 --> 35:06.390
pay more attention to your own data

35:06.390 --> 35:09.633
and get a good infrastructure support.

35:09.633 --> 35:12.150
<v ->Hmm, really good one, so for the future,</v>

35:12.150 --> 35:15.120
AI agent as an employee, that's what I heard him say.

35:15.120 --> 35:16.740
And data, data, data.

35:16.740 --> 35:19.050
Okay Steph, I'm gonna go to you next.

35:19.050 --> 35:20.610
<v ->Sure, so I mean,</v>

35:20.610 --> 35:24.930
the way I think about AI really is it can help reduce cost,

35:24.930 --> 35:27.690
but it also can help increase your revenue.

35:27.690 --> 35:31.050
And so I think it can be used in both directions

35:31.050 --> 35:33.720
and I think it's important that you're looking at it.

35:33.720 --> 35:37.680
The other piece is, there's been a lot of discussion on,

35:37.680 --> 35:40.050
is AI too hyped up?

35:40.050 --> 35:42.930
Is this really gonna be, you know,

35:42.930 --> 35:44.940
is the value gonna be there in the future?

35:44.940 --> 35:46.050
What's that gonna look like?

35:46.050 --> 35:49.290
And my personal belief is that

35:49.290 --> 35:52.830
absolutely AI is gonna transform the world.

35:52.830 --> 35:56.760
I mean, this is something that there's no stepping back from

35:56.760 --> 36:00.210
as a complete society here.

36:00.210 --> 36:03.420
And so the sooner companies embrace

36:03.420 --> 36:07.906
and begin to move forward on that path, the better.

36:07.906 --> 36:12.840
I would recommend that you find a way to work

36:12.840 --> 36:17.610
with somebody who knows the space, has experience in it.

36:17.610 --> 36:20.400
There's a lot of really capable vendors out there.

36:20.400 --> 36:23.790
But I really think it's important you choose a partner

36:23.790 --> 36:26.550
who has done many of the mistakes

36:26.550 --> 36:29.940
and seen lots of the different examples in the past,

36:29.940 --> 36:32.310
rather than doing everything yourself

36:32.310 --> 36:33.810
from the very beginning.

36:33.810 --> 36:36.720
You know, I've met with a number of customers who,

36:36.720 --> 36:39.600
they will invest in giant data science teams,

36:39.600 --> 36:42.570
bringing on hundreds of people just to come back

36:42.570 --> 36:46.470
and realize that actually my number one problem

36:46.470 --> 36:49.020
isn't creating AI models

36:49.020 --> 36:53.880
or my ROI that I expected actually isn't gonna be there.

36:53.880 --> 36:55.680
And so I think it's super important

36:55.680 --> 36:57.360
and you know, we always try

36:57.360 --> 37:01.110
to focus on basically creating a heat map

37:01.110 --> 37:04.050
that shows you what's the value you're gonna extract

37:04.050 --> 37:06.930
versus how hard is it to implement

37:06.930 --> 37:08.970
and to get into production.

37:08.970 --> 37:12.600
And so you're constantly going against that metric to see

37:12.600 --> 37:15.150
what the right next move should be.

37:15.150 --> 37:16.170
<v ->Really good.</v>

37:16.170 --> 37:17.880
So make sure you get started.

37:17.880 --> 37:20.070
Don't wait, but start at the right place.

37:20.070 --> 37:22.620
So start with someone who understands your business.

37:22.620 --> 37:25.203
So you can start at the right place, Hassan.

37:26.670 --> 37:29.560
<v ->Yeah, I think what we should be doing is we need</v>

37:30.845 --> 37:35.100
to turn even engineers into entrepreneurs.

37:35.100 --> 37:37.620
Think about the problem, the metric you want

37:37.620 --> 37:40.560
to optimize first, start small.

37:40.560 --> 37:45.240
Don't start in solving the whole company's problem.

37:45.240 --> 37:48.510
And then start building startups.

37:48.510 --> 37:49.980
Start companies

37:49.980 --> 37:53.430
and companies can actually be companies of agents.

37:53.430 --> 37:56.370
So we heard about crews of agents,

37:56.370 --> 37:58.680
we heard about swarms of agents.

37:58.680 --> 38:02.010
Start with building companies of agents.

38:02.010 --> 38:05.610
Start recruiting the right agents to solve real problem.

38:05.610 --> 38:07.920
You don't need to think about LLM anymore.

38:07.920 --> 38:11.220
You can actually start recruiting existing agents,

38:11.220 --> 38:15.330
specializing them, and then start from there

38:15.330 --> 38:16.530
and experiment,

38:16.530 --> 38:18.690
experiment, experiment, experiment, experiment.

38:18.690 --> 38:20.214
Because the rate

38:20.214 --> 38:24.810
of innovation is linearly correlated with the rate

38:24.810 --> 38:26.190
of experimentation.

38:26.190 --> 38:27.900
The more you can experiment,

38:27.900 --> 38:29.730
the more you're gonna be innovative,

38:29.730 --> 38:31.080
the more you're gonna wait,

38:31.080 --> 38:33.780
the more you're gonna be unfortunately behind.

38:33.780 --> 38:35.580
So that's my suggestion.

38:35.580 --> 38:36.413
<v ->I like that.</v>

38:36.413 --> 38:39.000
So Hassan and I worked at Amazon Web services together

38:39.000 --> 38:41.340
and that's what we did as part of our secret of success.

38:41.340 --> 38:42.780
We just kept replicating,

38:42.780 --> 38:46.320
creating startup, startup, startups, okay, Ray.

38:46.320 --> 38:48.000
<v ->Well, I think I was gonna start with time is</v>

38:48.000 --> 38:49.710
of the essence, but actually I'm gonna take

38:49.710 --> 38:52.500
a much more critical conversation point.

38:52.500 --> 38:53.730
In the age of the internet,

38:53.730 --> 38:56.190
things were decentralized, they were open,

38:56.190 --> 38:58.980
they were cheaper, there are lots of competition.

38:58.980 --> 39:00.990
Age of AI is completely different.

39:00.990 --> 39:02.370
We are closed, we are centralized,

39:02.370 --> 39:03.420
things are more expensive.

39:03.420 --> 39:06.690
And there are a few players, if you want to break that,

39:06.690 --> 39:10.470
I'm gonna ask you guys to do something very important.

39:10.470 --> 39:13.290
We're gonna have to fight for rights in terms

39:13.290 --> 39:15.360
of public knowledge on what an LM is.

39:15.360 --> 39:16.680
So just like we have copyright

39:16.680 --> 39:18.630
and patent law on ideas,

39:18.630 --> 39:20.340
the insights in an LLM might have

39:20.340 --> 39:22.440
a ten second expiration date,

39:22.440 --> 39:26.130
a one minute expiration date, an hour expiration date,

39:26.130 --> 39:28.920
a day expiration date, you get it, right?

39:28.920 --> 39:30.570
Because there's so much public knowledge

39:30.570 --> 39:32.370
that's being locked into the few hands

39:32.370 --> 39:35.640
of individual companies that you're gonna see a demand

39:35.640 --> 39:38.190
for all that information, insight to be shared and brokered.

39:38.190 --> 39:39.900
And we're gonna actually completely change

39:39.900 --> 39:41.340
the patent copyright law.

39:41.340 --> 39:43.560
And I think that's what we're gonna have to fight for

39:43.560 --> 39:47.880
if you want to have AI in the hands of everybody's space,

39:47.880 --> 39:49.770
because at the rate we're going right now,

39:49.770 --> 39:51.030
it is not gonna be cheap,

39:51.030 --> 39:53.010
it's not gonna be easily accessible

39:53.010 --> 39:54.960
and only a few people have access to it.

39:54.960 --> 39:58.290
So maybe it's something to fight for, starting here at CES.

39:58.290 --> 40:00.360
<v ->Awesome, so I'll just close with this story,</v>

40:00.360 --> 40:02.340
and this is a true story.

40:02.340 --> 40:05.670
Yesterday I was walking down the strip and I looked down

40:05.670 --> 40:07.170
and there was a bottle on the street.

40:07.170 --> 40:09.900
So I reached down and I picked it up and I rubbed it.

40:09.900 --> 40:13.530
And out popped a genie, true story by the way.

40:13.530 --> 40:16.770
And this genie said to me, Sandy, this is your lucky day.

40:16.770 --> 40:21.360
Not only do you get to be on the Modev AI House panel,

40:21.360 --> 40:23.100
but you also get three wishes.

40:23.100 --> 40:25.290
However, with those wishes, there's a catch.

40:25.290 --> 40:27.570
There's always a catch, isn't there?

40:27.570 --> 40:29.970
So I said, okay, what's the catch?

40:29.970 --> 40:31.350
And he said, well, whatever you wish for,

40:31.350 --> 40:33.393
your evil arch enemy gets double.

40:34.318 --> 40:35.220
I said, okay, I'll do that.

40:35.220 --> 40:39.000
So first I wish for a Red Tesla, I wanted a Cybertruck.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.560
So he said, you get a Red Tesla,

40:40.560 --> 40:43.110
but your evil arch enemy gets two.

40:43.110 --> 40:45.180
So the second thing I wish for is a house at the beach

40:45.180 --> 40:46.740
'cause I love the beach.

40:46.740 --> 40:48.150
I got this beautiful house at the beach,

40:48.150 --> 40:50.910
but, my evil arch enemy got two.

40:50.910 --> 40:53.820
So for my final wish, I said, genie,

40:53.820 --> 40:56.163
would you scare me half to death?

40:58.170 --> 41:01.170
Now I wanna end this panel by not scaring you half

41:01.170 --> 41:03.270
to death, but by giving you three wishes

41:03.270 --> 41:06.330
that this magnificent panel, Ray, Yujing,

41:06.330 --> 41:08.610
Stephanie, and Hassan, delivered to you.

41:08.610 --> 41:11.580
Three wishes, one, start, start, start.

41:11.580 --> 41:15.690
But start small, two, data, data, data.

41:15.690 --> 41:18.750
You need to make sure that you're looking at your data.

41:18.750 --> 41:21.390
And three, know that AI is going

41:21.390 --> 41:23.940
to encompass everything out there.

41:23.940 --> 41:26.160
So don't just get your engineers involved

41:26.160 --> 41:27.390
in what you're working on.

41:27.390 --> 41:30.390
Make sure that ROI project involves the business too.

41:30.390 --> 41:31.890
Thank you guys so much.

41:31.890 --> 41:35.648
Make sure you talk to these wonderful folks.

41:35.648 --> 41:38.231
(upbeat music)
