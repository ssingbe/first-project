00:00.853 --> 00:03.936
(lively funky music)

2
00:06.992 --> 00:11.160
(lively funky music ends)

3
00:11.160 --> 00:11.993
<v Lori>How's everybody doing?</v>

4
00:11.993 --> 00:13.830
We're getting ready to just start.

5
00:13.830 --> 00:15.060
For those of you in the back,

6
00:15.060 --> 00:18.090
this is like an intimate session, so don't be afraid.

7
00:18.090 --> 00:21.990
There's actually keys to a Chevy taped

8
00:21.990 --> 00:24.000
to the bottom of one of these chairs.

9
00:24.000 --> 00:26.190
So if you guys come on up closer,

10
00:26.190 --> 00:27.960
we're very attractive people also.

11
00:27.960 --> 00:29.370
I think if you see us closer,

12
00:29.370 --> 00:30.450
'cause I know a couple of you

13
00:30.450 --> 00:32.250
in the back are very nearsighted,

14
00:32.250 --> 00:34.950
so come closer 'cause we're gonna have

15
00:34.950 --> 00:36.540
a really fun discussion.

16
00:36.540 --> 00:37.890
We're gonna show some examples.

17
00:37.890 --> 00:39.840
So I'd love to see all of you up here.

18
00:39.840 --> 00:41.580
So my name is Lori H. Schwartz.

19
00:41.580 --> 00:44.190
I'm gonna be your moderator for this panel.

20
00:44.190 --> 00:46.410
This is actually the last session

21
00:46.410 --> 00:50.880
of the Tech to Lead a Better Life, to lead a good life.

22
00:50.880 --> 00:53.850
And we're very excited to wrap it up

23
00:53.850 --> 00:57.750
with some insights about really interesting technology

24
00:57.750 --> 01:00.300
that is going to change how we live

25
01:00.300 --> 01:02.490
and how it's all coming together.

26
01:02.490 --> 01:06.210
Have any of you had a chance to walk the Venetian at all?

27
01:06.210 --> 01:10.260
The Venetian Expo? It's absolutely fascinating this year.

28
01:10.260 --> 01:12.930
I'm privileged enough through my company, StoryTech,

29
01:12.930 --> 01:15.570
to provide show floor tours for CES.

30
01:15.570 --> 01:17.190
And so, I've been on that floor

31
01:17.190 --> 01:19.410
a lot the last couple of days

32
01:19.410 --> 01:22.110
and one of the most exciting things is the decision

33
01:22.110 --> 01:25.410
for CTA to literally move digital health

34
01:25.410 --> 01:27.840
and wellness to the Venetian

35
01:27.840 --> 01:29.910
where there was all this lifestyle tech.

36
01:29.910 --> 01:31.380
And so, now, what we have on

37
01:31.380 --> 01:34.350
that Venetian floor is not just a series

38
01:34.350 --> 01:36.630
of products all over the place,

39
01:36.630 --> 01:39.720
but it's really a whole expo dedicated

40
01:39.720 --> 01:41.250
to how we're going to live.

41
01:41.250 --> 01:43.650
And so, on this great panel, we're gonna really dig into it.

42
01:43.650 --> 01:46.500
So to kick us off, I wanna introduce an old friend of mine,

43
01:46.500 --> 01:48.360
Sandy Abrams, and she's gonna help us get

44
01:48.360 --> 01:50.657
into the zone of thinking about all of this.

45
01:50.657 --> 01:52.357
<v Sandy>That's right, thank you.</v>

46
01:53.520 --> 01:56.280
Yeah, this is gonna be an amazing conversation

47
01:56.280 --> 01:58.920
about the importance of measuring

48
01:58.920 --> 02:03.060
and understanding key biomarkers for our well-being.

49
02:03.060 --> 02:06.240
And I'm here to share just about two minutes

50
02:06.240 --> 02:07.800
of breath practice with you

51
02:07.800 --> 02:12.660
because breath is a really powerful modality for wellness

52
02:12.660 --> 02:15.960
to help you improve things like stress

53
02:15.960 --> 02:17.670
and lower your blood pressure,

54
02:17.670 --> 02:20.040
improve your heart rate variability

55
02:20.040 --> 02:22.620
to sleep better and improve your cognition.

56
02:22.620 --> 02:25.200
So I'm gonna share three breath practices

57
02:25.200 --> 02:29.130
that will help you calm and relax your nervous system.

58
02:29.130 --> 02:31.350
So let's begin by getting comfortable

59
02:31.350 --> 02:34.140
in your chairs and closing your eyes.

60
02:34.140 --> 02:37.260
When was the last time you closed your eyes during the day?

61
02:37.260 --> 02:42.060
Notice how luxurious this can just feel on its own.

62
02:42.060 --> 02:46.140
And the first breath practice that we're going to do,

63
02:46.140 --> 02:48.420
I'll explain it, so you can keep your eyes closed

64
02:48.420 --> 02:52.050
if you'd like, is called a physiological sigh.

65
02:52.050 --> 02:55.200
It's the fastest way to calm your nervous system,

66
02:55.200 --> 02:58.320
and it's two parts on the inhale through your nose.

67
02:58.320 --> 03:01.460
The first part, you fill up your lungs about three quarters

68
03:01.460 --> 03:04.800
of the way full, and then the second part,

69
03:04.800 --> 03:06.990
you just completely fill your lungs

70
03:06.990 --> 03:10.020
and then the exhale (breathes) through your mouth.

71
03:10.020 --> 03:13.256
We'll do two of these together. It sounds like this.

72
03:13.256 --> 03:17.726
(Sandy inhales and exhales)

73
03:17.726 --> 03:21.534
(Sandy inhales and exhales)

74
03:21.534 --> 03:24.660
And that's something you can do anywhere, anytime.

75
03:24.660 --> 03:27.060
The second breath practice

76
03:27.060 --> 03:29.700
is called humming or buzzing breath.

77
03:29.700 --> 03:32.070
And this activates your vagus nerve,

78
03:32.070 --> 03:36.090
the V-A-G-U-S nerve which is responsible

79
03:36.090 --> 03:38.850
for relaxing your nervous system.

80
03:38.850 --> 03:41.490
And humming or bumblebee breath sounds like this.

81
03:41.490 --> 03:45.210
Again, you'll be inhaling through your nose (inhales)

82
03:45.210 --> 03:48.524
and on the entire exhale you make a humming, buzzing sound

83
03:48.524 --> 03:51.774
(imitates buzzing bee)

84
03:54.750 --> 03:57.030
for the entire length of your exhale.

85
03:57.030 --> 03:59.040
Let's just do one of these together.

86
03:59.040 --> 04:03.592
Slowly inhale (inhales) through your nose and exhale.

87
04:03.592 --> 04:06.842
(imitates buzzing bee)

88
04:10.770 --> 04:13.950
Sometimes just one of those really feels like you hit

89
04:13.950 --> 04:16.860
the jackpot for relaxation.

90
04:16.860 --> 04:21.030
The third breath tool for calming your nervous system

91
04:21.030 --> 04:25.020
that we're gonna do today is to make your exhales twice

92
04:25.020 --> 04:27.150
as long as your inhales.

93
04:27.150 --> 04:30.210
So let's take an inhale (inhales)

94
04:30.210 --> 04:32.580
and exhale either through the nose or mouth,

95
04:32.580 --> 04:35.010
making it feel about twice as long.

96
04:35.010 --> 04:38.310
Slow, (exhales) exhale.

97
04:38.310 --> 04:41.130
Let your shoulders come away from your ears.

98
04:41.130 --> 04:43.560
We'll do two of these, inhaling.

99
04:43.560 --> 04:45.420
Even smile on the inhale,

100
04:45.420 --> 04:49.140
it changes your biochemistry (inhales)

101
04:49.140 --> 04:54.140
and lean into that slow, long exhale. (exhales)

102
04:54.510 --> 04:56.610
One more of these at your own pace.

103
04:56.610 --> 05:01.610
Inhale, (inhales) slowly exhale (exhales)

104
05:03.480 --> 05:07.200
and again, take these practices home with you

105
05:07.200 --> 05:10.860
because they can be done in small moments throughout the day

106
05:10.860 --> 05:15.180
to help you relax your nervous system.

107
05:15.180 --> 05:17.790
Thanks for breathing and enjoy the panel.

108
05:17.790 --> 05:19.391
<v Ramses>Thank you.</v>

109
05:19.391 --> 05:21.373
<v Lori>Let's have a calm hand for Sandy.</v>

110
05:21.373 --> 05:22.890
(Lori and Sandy laugh)
(audience applauds)

111
05:22.890 --> 05:25.560
That was great and I love that all of you did it.

112
05:25.560 --> 05:28.200
Not that I was not having my eyes closed too.

113
05:28.200 --> 05:29.610
Okay. (laughs)

114
05:29.610 --> 05:31.740
All right, so I wanna do just a speed round

115
05:31.740 --> 05:34.980
to introduce our speakers today who are each coming

116
05:34.980 --> 05:38.730
with a very unique value prop on this concept.

117
05:38.730 --> 05:39.870
And then we're gonna dig

118
05:39.870 --> 05:41.310
in a little bit more to each of them.

119
05:41.310 --> 05:42.780
So let's start with you, Thomas,

120
05:42.780 --> 05:45.660
and just go down the line for a little speed intro.

121
05:45.660 --> 05:49.920
<v ->So I'm Thomas Serval. I'm the CEO of Baracoda,</v>

122
05:49.920 --> 05:52.800
and we focus on turning your bathroom into a primary point

123
05:52.800 --> 05:55.410
of care by collecting data from a lot

124
05:55.410 --> 05:58.650
of useful and usual devices.

125
05:58.650 --> 06:00.750
<v Pranitha>Hi, everyone, Pranitha Patil.</v>

126
06:00.750 --> 06:04.140
I am Co-Founder and COO of Function Health.

127
06:04.140 --> 06:06.750
We are a all-in-one healthcare platform

128
06:06.750 --> 06:09.630
that looks at comprehensive analysis of all

129
06:09.630 --> 06:11.220
of your organs in your organ systems,

130
06:11.220 --> 06:13.770
and I'll get into that in a little bit.

131
06:13.770 --> 06:16.680
<v ->Hey, everybody. My name is Dr. Ramses Alcaide.</v>

132
06:16.680 --> 06:18.210
I am the CEO of Neurable,

133
06:18.210 --> 06:20.700
and we work on brain computer interfaces,

134
06:20.700 --> 06:25.290
specifically to help track brain-related disease states.

135
06:25.290 --> 06:27.030
Think of neurodegenerative diseases

136
06:27.030 --> 06:30.190
or neurodiverse issues, but in everyday wearables

137
06:31.080 --> 06:32.400
<v Lori>This is so exciting 'cause they're</v>

138
06:32.400 --> 06:35.070
all collecting data in different ways.

139
06:35.070 --> 06:37.410
So we're gonna really get into how significant this is.

140
06:37.410 --> 06:40.020
So, Thomas, I know you wanna show us some slides

141
06:40.020 --> 06:42.180
and dig in a little deeper.

142
06:42.180 --> 06:44.820
And while Thomas is making his way up to the computer,

143
06:44.820 --> 06:47.400
how many of you just, raise your hand,

144
06:47.400 --> 06:49.530
are leveraging wearables

145
06:49.530 --> 06:51.693
of some kind right now in your life?

146
06:52.530 --> 06:53.363
Okay, great.

147
06:53.363 --> 06:57.420
And then how many of you are leveraging connected solutions

148
06:57.420 --> 07:00.660
in your home that are reporting back data on how you live?

149
07:00.660 --> 07:01.770
One of you, okay.

150
07:01.770 --> 07:03.810
And how many of you are making products

151
07:03.810 --> 07:05.193
in this space right now?

152
07:06.480 --> 07:09.600
Okay. And some of you are strategists or just,

153
07:09.600 --> 07:11.763
or any of you in the medical profession?

154
07:13.350 --> 07:16.530
Okay, any of you under felony investigation?

155
07:16.530 --> 07:18.980
Okay, just checking. All right, Thomas, go ahead.

156
07:20.490 --> 07:22.673
<v Ramses>We're just waiting for the clicker here.</v>

157
07:32.400 --> 07:34.800
<v Thomas>So Baracoda started 10 years ago</v>

158
07:34.800 --> 07:38.340
because my daughter was not brushing her teeth correctly,

159
07:38.340 --> 07:41.010
and I invented a smart brush called, Kolibree,

160
07:41.010 --> 07:42.270
which is humming bird.

161
07:42.270 --> 07:45.543
So it resonates with her, last exercise we just done.

162
07:47.220 --> 07:50.640
And we found a way to track

163
07:50.640 --> 07:52.380
the way she was brushing her teeth.

164
07:52.380 --> 07:55.200
So somehow one of the most insightful information,

165
07:55.200 --> 07:57.840
how do your children do when they brush their teeth?

166
07:57.840 --> 07:59.850
And we extended this, from this insight,

167
07:59.850 --> 08:04.590
we extended our vision of if we could know what's happening

168
08:04.590 --> 08:06.030
in everybody's bathroom

169
08:06.030 --> 08:10.050
without jeopardizing anybody's privacy is such a great place

170
08:10.050 --> 08:13.530
to collect the most valuable data about your health.

171
08:13.530 --> 08:16.710
You spend on average one hour in your bathroom every day.

172
08:16.710 --> 08:19.950
A mirror or a sensor are seeing you always

173
08:19.950 --> 08:23.310
under the same angle which is a terrific data set,

174
08:23.310 --> 08:26.100
and you will not bring many new devices.

175
08:26.100 --> 08:28.890
Actually, 82% of the people are already bringing

176
08:28.890 --> 08:31.110
their phone despite the privacy challenges.

177
08:31.110 --> 08:32.790
So what we have been doing is trying

178
08:32.790 --> 08:36.600
to wire correctly the bathroom.

179
08:36.600 --> 08:38.250
So starting with the toothbrushes,

180
08:38.250 --> 08:40.590
then we invented a smart bath mat,

181
08:40.590 --> 08:43.290
then a smart screen which we call a smart mirror.

182
08:43.290 --> 08:45.120
And then we turned it into a platform

183
08:45.120 --> 08:47.100
which is the best way to collect data,

184
08:47.100 --> 08:49.863
but also to add other devices to the ecosystem.

185
08:50.730 --> 08:52.380
And we believe this is going

186
08:52.380 --> 08:54.690
to be the future whether we want it or not.

187
08:54.690 --> 08:56.160
And this vision has been proven true

188
08:56.160 --> 08:59.190
because A, we were lucky to be 10 years in a row,

189
08:59.190 --> 09:00.360
world winners at CES.

190
09:00.360 --> 09:02.520
So at least the journalists like us,

191
09:02.520 --> 09:06.390
but also, because we see adoption across the world

192
09:06.390 --> 09:08.740
where there is not enough doctors

193
09:09.720 --> 09:11.790
and practitioners of healthcare,

194
09:11.790 --> 09:14.440
or you have a growing population of aging people

195
09:15.390 --> 09:17.580
for which the first reason for them

196
09:17.580 --> 09:19.710
to move out of their home is actually

197
09:19.710 --> 09:20.670
that they can no longer use

198
09:20.670 --> 09:22.320
their bathroom in the proper way.

199
09:23.160 --> 09:27.093
So with this vision, I'm just trying to,

200
09:28.170 --> 09:31.230
we try to build the underlying platform

201
09:31.230 --> 09:33.030
that number one, we are European.

202
09:33.030 --> 09:35.370
It's critical for us protect your data,

203
09:35.370 --> 09:38.913
so it's privacy by design, otherwise it would be illegal.

204
09:40.140 --> 09:42.690
There's a growing number of challenges

205
09:42.690 --> 09:44.850
'cause in a bathroom, you have, in Asia,

206
09:44.850 --> 09:48.000
three generation overlapping to each other.

207
09:48.000 --> 09:50.430
In Europe and US, two generation, but basically,

208
09:50.430 --> 09:52.923
their needs and interface should be different.

209
09:53.861 --> 09:58.470
And so, platform by platform,

210
09:58.470 --> 10:00.630
the first one which has direct impact on your health,

211
10:00.630 --> 10:03.480
and we keep discovering new insights

212
10:03.480 --> 10:05.370
is what's happening in your mouth.

213
10:05.370 --> 10:07.530
I think above 80% of all the disease

214
10:07.530 --> 10:09.630
are actually caught through your mouth.

215
10:09.630 --> 10:11.310
So knowing what's going on in your mouth

216
10:11.310 --> 10:13.740
is actually a great way to diagnose

217
10:13.740 --> 10:15.330
or prevent a lot of things.

218
10:15.330 --> 10:18.510
And also, know that with children,

219
10:18.510 --> 10:22.140
proper health habits are actually increasing

220
10:22.140 --> 10:24.330
their life expectancy by 10 years.

221
10:24.330 --> 10:25.830
So it's not minimal.

222
10:25.830 --> 10:28.140
And another one reason why people

223
10:28.140 --> 10:29.790
in emerging country are not going

224
10:30.690 --> 10:33.243
to school is actually oral care diseases.

225
10:34.740 --> 10:36.840
I'm just trying to get to the slide.

226
10:36.840 --> 10:39.843
So what a bathroom that is fully connected will mean?

227
10:41.790 --> 10:44.610
With a smart bath mat, we can collect your weight.

228
10:44.610 --> 10:46.470
As you probably know, if you combine your weight

229
10:46.470 --> 10:48.810
and your height, you have your life expectancy

230
10:48.810 --> 10:50.220
with a 5% accuracy.

231
10:50.220 --> 10:52.840
Insurers have got it since 1943

232
10:54.018 --> 10:55.710
or okay, I already mentioned

233
10:55.710 --> 10:57.360
and the mirror or the smart mirror,

234
10:57.360 --> 11:00.420
we introduced last year at CES, a mirror called BMind.

235
11:00.420 --> 11:02.820
25% of Americans wake up in the morning

236
11:02.820 --> 11:06.390
with a little low moment, you know, little depressed times.

237
11:06.390 --> 11:10.500
There is not a hundred million dollar of psychiatrists

238
11:10.500 --> 11:12.690
that can deal with those things.

239
11:12.690 --> 11:14.520
AI is the only way forward.

240
11:14.520 --> 11:17.340
And so, by building some smart way

241
11:17.340 --> 11:20.160
to do triage about how well are you doing?

242
11:20.160 --> 11:24.720
And so, we invented a way to ask you how you're doing

243
11:24.720 --> 11:27.600
and by just listening to you,

244
11:27.600 --> 11:30.330
we get so much more information beyond your language.

245
11:30.330 --> 11:32.280
We understand what you say, I'm great.

246
11:32.280 --> 11:33.960
We understand the where you sit, I'm great,

247
11:33.960 --> 11:36.630
actually your sound, it means you're not great,

248
11:36.630 --> 11:39.510
and we understand your posture is also a great message.

249
11:39.510 --> 11:41.430
So beyond the biomarker

250
11:41.430 --> 11:43.620
and the things that are very hard to catch,

251
11:43.620 --> 11:46.410
there is a lot of signals that are logging fruit

252
11:46.410 --> 11:49.233
for us to work on the future of healthcare.

253
11:50.550 --> 11:53.080
The other thing we have been working on recently

254
11:54.000 --> 11:57.510
is a smart bath mat, was also two CES award.

255
11:57.510 --> 12:00.540
So you walk on the bath mat and we track your weight.

256
12:00.540 --> 12:03.570
Your weight is one of the most interesting information.

257
12:03.570 --> 12:06.330
But beyond the weight, your balance,

258
12:06.330 --> 12:08.670
the one reason why you have problem

259
12:08.670 --> 12:10.220
in your home is you're falling.

260
12:11.130 --> 12:14.040
And the risk of falling is now based on the data,

261
12:14.040 --> 12:15.900
something we can predict.

262
12:15.900 --> 12:17.580
Falling is not an accident.

263
12:17.580 --> 12:21.180
It's actually a dysfunction of some of your major muscle,

264
12:21.180 --> 12:23.400
and you have four system in your body

265
12:23.400 --> 12:25.650
to rebalance you which have become defect,

266
12:25.650 --> 12:28.240
either by brain damage or by just aging

267
12:29.460 --> 12:31.050
the you falling.

268
12:31.050 --> 12:33.510
And then usually, it's a very bad prediction

269
12:33.510 --> 12:35.670
for your health expectancy.

270
12:35.670 --> 12:36.900
And the good news about that

271
12:36.900 --> 12:39.187
is now we know it's somehow a disease.

272
12:39.187 --> 12:42.780
There is a way to reverse those symptoms

273
12:42.780 --> 12:45.210
and by doing simple exercise every day.

274
12:45.210 --> 12:46.560
And that's why this smart mat

275
12:46.560 --> 12:49.560
has been awarded Best Startup in Korea

276
12:49.560 --> 12:51.710
which is a most aging population right now.

277
12:53.280 --> 12:55.263
We can find a way for this to work.

278
12:56.220 --> 12:57.540
Analyzing your skin, you know,

279
12:57.540 --> 13:01.230
melanoma, most of the of the mirrors,

280
13:01.230 --> 13:06.120
most of the cancer are not happening overnight.

281
13:06.120 --> 13:08.040
They are actually a long decay of some things

282
13:08.040 --> 13:10.440
that you can actually collect in skin cancer,

283
13:10.440 --> 13:15.120
not all, but collecting the inner markers,

284
13:15.120 --> 13:17.880
fluids, and the outside visible marker

285
13:17.880 --> 13:19.290
is actually a good way

286
13:19.290 --> 13:22.323
to help diagnose what's going on with your skin.

287
13:23.400 --> 13:25.953
And last but not least, I think it's important,

288
13:26.910 --> 13:29.040
the challenge for wearables is actually

289
13:29.040 --> 13:31.403
when the battery is dead, you no longer wear them.

290
13:32.400 --> 13:35.700
And which means that all the data collection,

291
13:35.700 --> 13:37.353
which I call daily healthtech,

292
13:38.190 --> 13:43.190
or longitudinal healthcare is lost.

293
13:43.260 --> 13:47.190
And I've bought sixth version of my Apple watch,

294
13:47.190 --> 13:49.650
and I'm no longer because at some point,

295
13:49.650 --> 13:52.740
actually it happens two days after CES, battery is dead,

296
13:52.740 --> 13:56.700
and the data set that I can collect is no longer accurate

297
13:56.700 --> 13:58.590
because it's interrupted.

298
13:58.590 --> 14:03.153
So with this, we have been,

299
14:04.890 --> 14:07.560
with this, what we have been able to do was

300
14:07.560 --> 14:09.900
to use your body as a battery,

301
14:09.900 --> 14:12.720
so that was also 2023 CES award.

302
14:12.720 --> 14:14.880
And this wristband is actually very promising

303
14:14.880 --> 14:18.240
for all people who need long-term tracks of their vital.

304
14:18.240 --> 14:19.828
We measure HRV.

305
14:19.828 --> 14:21.330
We measure activity and temperature,

306
14:21.330 --> 14:23.700
whether it's for women health or aging people,

307
14:23.700 --> 14:26.370
or for everybody that wants to take care of their health.

308
14:26.370 --> 14:28.650
And it's not that complicated.

309
14:28.650 --> 14:31.620
So on that note, those are all the new devices we

310
14:31.620 --> 14:34.380
are bringing together and if you want to visit our booth,

311
14:34.380 --> 14:37.350
what we are showing is actually the underling platform we

312
14:37.350 --> 14:40.980
call BConnect that enable the creation of all those devices

313
14:40.980 --> 14:45.150
and new devices allowing those devices to be interoperable,

314
14:45.150 --> 14:48.480
not only ours, but also all the 65 makers

315
14:48.480 --> 14:52.110
of devices that collect well-being or healthcare data.

316
14:52.110 --> 14:54.960
And making those data available for further research,

317
14:54.960 --> 14:57.420
further discovery, has probably a huge impact

318
14:57.420 --> 14:59.700
on longevity and well-being.

319
14:59.700 --> 15:00.720
Thank you very much.

320
15:00.720 --> 15:03.420
<v ->I wanted to just ask you just really quickly,</v>

321
15:03.420 --> 15:07.020
have you seen folks that are using your solutions

322
15:07.020 --> 15:09.240
or whatever data you're collecting,

323
15:09.240 --> 15:11.730
are they getting more used to this idea

324
15:11.730 --> 15:13.980
of having all these connected solutions?

325
15:13.980 --> 15:15.330
You know, is it something

326
15:15.330 --> 15:18.150
that we're all jumping into quickly?

327
15:18.150 --> 15:21.253
<v ->Well, each new data source open new opportunities.</v>

328
15:21.253 --> 15:23.580
Initially, the scale we wanted to do

329
15:23.580 --> 15:25.500
for just monitoring your weight

330
15:25.500 --> 15:28.170
and now, we discover we can actually predict falling.

331
15:28.170 --> 15:30.210
So that's a typical usage.

332
15:30.210 --> 15:33.210
Another one we have had with a toothbrush was

333
15:33.210 --> 15:36.150
that we invented the connected toothbrush

334
15:36.150 --> 15:38.700
because my daughter was not brushing her teeth.

335
15:38.700 --> 15:41.580
Then we receive emails from parents

336
15:41.580 --> 15:45.510
of people who have autism.

337
15:45.510 --> 15:47.160
And brushing your teeth if you have

338
15:47.160 --> 15:49.650
an autistic child is a nightmare.

339
15:49.650 --> 15:53.310
Suddenly, you can focus the attention of on the child,

340
15:53.310 --> 15:56.220
on playing a game and then it becomes easy.

341
15:56.220 --> 16:00.090
So not only application are invented by even a researcher,

342
16:00.090 --> 16:04.050
but actually users find new ways to use your tools

343
16:04.050 --> 16:06.180
beyond what the inventor have thought through.

344
16:06.180 --> 16:07.530
<v ->Now, that's so interesting.</v>

345
16:07.530 --> 16:09.570
All right, let's, and I think we're gonna find a lot

346
16:09.570 --> 16:11.070
of commonalities between these guys

347
16:11.070 --> 16:12.210
once we dig in a little bit more.

348
16:12.210 --> 16:14.040
So let's go over to Pranitha.

349
16:14.040 --> 16:15.840
Tell us about your fabulous company

350
16:15.840 --> 16:18.360
which I can't wait to use myself.

351
16:18.360 --> 16:19.380
I love it.

352
16:19.380 --> 16:21.330
<v ->Can I have the clicker?</v>

353
16:21.330 --> 16:22.163
Thank you.

354
16:24.810 --> 16:27.963
And, yeah, so Pranitha Patil, Co-founder, COO.

355
16:29.550 --> 16:31.680
And I will just take you into kind

356
16:31.680 --> 16:34.743
of how we're thinking about our platform and what we do.

357
16:35.580 --> 16:38.070
I think we know especially if we're at CES,

358
16:38.070 --> 16:39.630
that the applications of AI

359
16:39.630 --> 16:43.470
with healthcare are finally actually here.

360
16:43.470 --> 16:45.540
What we are with Function Health is we are

361
16:45.540 --> 16:48.570
an annual membership for $500 a year.

362
16:48.570 --> 16:50.640
We start with diagnostic testing.

363
16:50.640 --> 16:52.620
So blood and urine that you collect

364
16:52.620 --> 16:55.230
at your local Quest Diagnostics.

365
16:55.230 --> 16:57.180
Once you complete those tests,

366
16:57.180 --> 16:58.770
it's about a hundred biomarkers.

367
16:58.770 --> 17:00.060
We're looking at all organs

368
17:00.060 --> 17:01.980
and organ systems, your heart, your hormones,

369
17:01.980 --> 17:03.630
your liver, your thyroid.

370
17:03.630 --> 17:06.870
We're really getting a full view of what's happening

371
17:06.870 --> 17:08.790
with your body and then we're presenting

372
17:08.790 --> 17:10.320
that information back to you

373
17:10.320 --> 17:13.680
in a digestible, actionable way.

374
17:13.680 --> 17:15.690
And then over time, how we think about this

375
17:15.690 --> 17:19.620
as we apply past medical records, self-reported data,

376
17:19.620 --> 17:21.900
and any other data sets that you can think about,

377
17:21.900 --> 17:25.620
think imaging, think you're wearable that you're wearing,

378
17:25.620 --> 17:28.020
stool testing, saliva testing,

379
17:28.020 --> 17:29.790
we really think of ourselves as a platform.

380
17:29.790 --> 17:32.160
But today, what we focus on is $500

381
17:32.160 --> 17:33.930
for those a hundred biomarkers twice a year

382
17:33.930 --> 17:35.730
to establish a baseline.

383
17:35.730 --> 17:37.530
And this is just quickly kind of how it works.

384
17:37.530 --> 17:41.550
Once you set up your account, you schedule your lab tests.

385
17:41.550 --> 17:45.270
Those results are tracked in this dashboard.

386
17:45.270 --> 17:46.530
These are the tests that we do.

387
17:46.530 --> 17:48.390
I won't sit here and list all of them,

388
17:48.390 --> 17:50.520
but they're meant to be incredibly comprehensive

389
17:50.520 --> 17:53.040
because if you go to a traditional physician today,

390
17:53.040 --> 17:54.000
your annual physical,

391
17:54.000 --> 17:57.090
you're getting about 15 to 20 biomarkers done.

392
17:57.090 --> 17:59.820
They see you, they say, okay, cool, you look great.

393
17:59.820 --> 18:01.320
See you in a couple years,

394
18:01.320 --> 18:03.420
unless you come back with something severe.

395
18:03.420 --> 18:04.830
And that's what we're trying to fix.

396
18:04.830 --> 18:08.700
We're trying to say let's be as proactive as possible.

397
18:08.700 --> 18:10.500
Let's really understand what's happening

398
18:10.500 --> 18:12.690
in our body because we deserve to have

399
18:12.690 --> 18:14.310
that information on our health.

400
18:14.310 --> 18:15.750
The science is there.

401
18:15.750 --> 18:18.840
There's been only a delay in a hierarchy in getting

402
18:18.840 --> 18:22.620
that information into people's hands in a proactive way.

403
18:22.620 --> 18:25.620
So this is the list of a hundred tests that we do.

404
18:25.620 --> 18:28.170
We also have a host of add-ons.

405
18:28.170 --> 18:31.830
So you'll see cancer detection, autoimmunity, allergy.

406
18:31.830 --> 18:36.120
We just released several other add-ons that look at PFAS

407
18:36.120 --> 18:40.530
and a couple other just new tests that really take,

408
18:40.530 --> 18:42.870
you know, 18 years to get to market.

409
18:42.870 --> 18:44.970
We're trying to say let's get you access as soon

410
18:44.970 --> 18:48.450
as the research and the data and the test is there.

411
18:48.450 --> 18:50.520
I'll just quickly talk you through kind of the dashboard.

412
18:50.520 --> 18:53.250
Once you do get your tests, we have,

413
18:53.250 --> 18:55.200
you'll see here your biological age,

414
18:55.200 --> 18:58.050
the biomarkers that you've gotten tested,

415
18:58.050 --> 19:01.410
and we go category by category, so by organ system,

416
19:01.410 --> 19:05.880
kind of how you're doing and we'll take you into specifics.

417
19:05.880 --> 19:09.090
So look here, this is H-S-C-R-P. Why does it matter?

418
19:09.090 --> 19:12.420
A summary, the causes, foods you might eat,

419
19:12.420 --> 19:14.280
foods you should limit, other things

420
19:14.280 --> 19:17.310
that you might find beneficial of like what's going on.

421
19:17.310 --> 19:20.820
And in that chart, you'll see that tracks over time,

422
19:20.820 --> 19:23.310
which if I ask probably this audience,

423
19:23.310 --> 19:25.740
I don't know who has their electronic medical records

424
19:25.740 --> 19:29.160
in a clean, easy-to-access way today.

425
19:29.160 --> 19:30.720
This is meant to not only be that,

426
19:30.720 --> 19:33.690
but say, hey here's actually what you should do about it.

427
19:33.690 --> 19:36.270
We also, obviously, provide clinician notes.

428
19:36.270 --> 19:37.530
So a clinician actually goes

429
19:37.530 --> 19:40.020
through your entire medical history as well

430
19:40.020 --> 19:42.240
as the biomarkers that you got tested to provide you

431
19:42.240 --> 19:43.740
with a summary of, you know,

432
19:43.740 --> 19:45.030
what's the most important thing you need

433
19:45.030 --> 19:46.380
to be focusing on today?

434
19:46.380 --> 19:47.910
'Cause it can be kind of overwhelming

435
19:47.910 --> 19:50.940
to get results for a hundred plus biomarkers.

436
19:50.940 --> 19:52.170
So that is provided here.

437
19:52.170 --> 19:55.623
And then a clean action plan as your health stack.

438
19:56.610 --> 19:57.870
I will tell a quick story

439
19:57.870 --> 19:59.940
of an individual, his name is Jeff.

440
19:59.940 --> 20:02.010
He was able to find prostate cancer

441
20:02.010 --> 20:04.140
through the gallery test.

442
20:04.140 --> 20:06.360
I speak to members every single day,

443
20:06.360 --> 20:08.820
and it's incredible to really hear

444
20:08.820 --> 20:11.250
and understand how folks' lives are being changed with this

445
20:11.250 --> 20:13.290
because they're proactively able

446
20:13.290 --> 20:15.510
to identify not just cancer,

447
20:15.510 --> 20:19.260
but hypertension, cardiovascular risk, the list goes on,

448
20:19.260 --> 20:22.020
on things folks are able to find proactively

449
20:22.020 --> 20:24.483
and actually make a change in their day to day.

450
20:25.500 --> 20:28.230
And then, I'll end with our founding team,

451
20:28.230 --> 20:29.850
and you can join by going

452
20:29.850 --> 20:31.550
to functionhealth.com if you want.

453
20:32.670 --> 20:34.740
<v ->Awesome. I'm so going.</v>

454
20:34.740 --> 20:37.320
Before we jump over to Ramses, I just wanted to ask you,

455
20:37.320 --> 20:39.330
you have some unique brand partnerships

456
20:39.330 --> 20:43.050
with what you would call other category,

457
20:43.050 --> 20:44.970
you know, brands like Equinox,

458
20:44.970 --> 20:47.130
and I think you also have one with Thrive Global.

459
20:47.130 --> 20:49.140
Can you just talk a little bit about how

460
20:49.140 --> 20:52.530
that fills out the story of what you're trying to do?

461
20:52.530 --> 20:55.230
<v ->Yeah, I mean, if you think, take a step back.</v>

462
20:55.230 --> 20:56.940
This is an 8-billion-person problem.

463
20:56.940 --> 21:00.210
This is not just a handful of people that need this.

464
21:00.210 --> 21:03.390
When we go out and talk to potential partners,

465
21:03.390 --> 21:05.580
you can think about Function as a platform

466
21:05.580 --> 21:07.680
and apply your gym and your fitness

467
21:07.680 --> 21:09.150
on top of your biomarkers.

468
21:09.150 --> 21:12.450
You can apply Thrive Global. You can apply grocery stores.

469
21:12.450 --> 21:16.050
You can really think about this as applied as a foundation

470
21:16.050 --> 21:18.960
which is why when we speak to potential partners,

471
21:18.960 --> 21:20.370
it's a no-brainer

472
21:20.370 --> 21:22.740
because this data has been lacking for so long

473
21:22.740 --> 21:25.740
that folks want the access to what's going on in their body

474
21:25.740 --> 21:27.780
and then they can make more informed decisions

475
21:27.780 --> 21:29.370
about how they should live their life

476
21:29.370 --> 21:31.890
versus going off of a symptom.

477
21:31.890 --> 21:33.030
<v ->That's awesome.</v>

478
21:33.030 --> 21:36.060
I just like the idea of all of it coming together.

479
21:36.060 --> 21:38.790
'Cause how many of you have like a separate app, maybe,

480
21:38.790 --> 21:42.270
for your scale and a separate app for your diet

481
21:42.270 --> 21:44.040
and exercise, and all of that.

482
21:44.040 --> 21:45.810
So it would be wonderful to have it sort

483
21:45.810 --> 21:47.370
of all talk to each other-

484
21:47.370 --> 21:48.261
<v ->Yes.</v>

485
21:48.261 --> 21:49.470
<v ->which I know is the goal for all of you.</v>

486
21:49.470 --> 21:51.990
All right, let's jump over to Ramses and then again,

487
21:51.990 --> 21:55.200
after Ramses goes, we're gonna connect back to everybody.

488
21:55.200 --> 21:57.210
So Ramses, take it over.

489
21:57.210 --> 21:59.370
<v ->Hey, before I get started though,</v>

490
21:59.370 --> 22:01.890
I wanna ask for a volunteer.

491
22:01.890 --> 22:03.150
Does somebody wanna come up here

492
22:03.150 --> 22:05.250
and do something with their brain real quick?

493
22:05.250 --> 22:07.710
Just raise your hand. I need one.

494
22:07.710 --> 22:10.170
I'm not moving forward until I get a volunteer, so.

495
22:10.170 --> 22:13.050
<v ->Ramses, I'll do it if nobody will do it, so. (laughs)</v>

496
22:13.050 --> 22:14.978
<v ->Let's try to get somebody from the audience.</v>

497
22:14.978 --> 22:15.811
<v ->Come on up. Yay.</v>

498
22:15.811 --> 22:17.220
<v ->Come on. Let's make this engaging.</v>

499
22:17.220 --> 22:19.611
Come on. There we go. Thank you.

500
22:19.611 --> 22:21.270
(audience applauding)

501
22:21.270 --> 22:23.250
All right, let's get my slides up real quick.

502
22:23.250 --> 22:24.930
<v Lori>Are we gonna find out anything weird about you?</v>

503
22:24.930 --> 22:25.763
<v Ramses>You come up here.</v>

504
22:25.763 --> 22:27.000
You're gonna sit up here with me.

505
22:27.000 --> 22:27.833
<v Lori>That's great.</v>

506
22:27.833 --> 22:28.812
<v Ramses>What's your name?</v>

507
22:28.812 --> 22:29.970
<v Aven>Aven.</v>
<v Ramses>Aiden?</v>

508
22:29.970 --> 22:30.803
<v Aven>Aven.</v>

509
22:30.803 --> 22:32.880
<v Ramses>Aven. Thank you, Aven.</v>

510
22:32.880 --> 22:34.230
Awesome. Have a seat right here.

511
22:34.230 --> 22:35.930
We'll get to you in just a second.

512
22:36.990 --> 22:39.270
So really, what we work on at Neurable

513
22:39.270 --> 22:42.360
is trying to unlock the mind, right?

514
22:42.360 --> 22:44.070
A lot of you have wearable devices.

515
22:44.070 --> 22:46.230
Could you just raise your hand if you have one?

516
22:46.230 --> 22:47.970
Yeah, pretty much everybody here, right?

517
22:47.970 --> 22:49.980
That's why we're all biased in this area,

518
22:49.980 --> 22:51.810
but outside of this group,

519
22:51.810 --> 22:54.360
three outta 10 people have a wearable device, right?

520
22:54.360 --> 22:56.070
It's primarily used for things like understanding

521
22:56.070 --> 22:58.410
the body at scale and longitudinally.

522
22:58.410 --> 23:00.600
That's a thing that wearable devices really

523
23:00.600 --> 23:02.310
are changing the world with, right?

524
23:02.310 --> 23:04.170
Right now, when you go to the doctor,

525
23:04.170 --> 23:07.260
you just get a snapshot of what your life is

526
23:07.260 --> 23:08.130
and what your state is,

527
23:08.130 --> 23:10.470
and some of these wearable companies up here

528
23:10.470 --> 23:11.970
are changing that.

529
23:11.970 --> 23:13.260
But that's the big win,

530
23:13.260 --> 23:14.580
being able to do at scale,

531
23:14.580 --> 23:17.820
longitudinal analysis about your body.

532
23:17.820 --> 23:20.100
But the key thing is what about your brain?

533
23:20.100 --> 23:23.070
The most important organ in your body, right?

534
23:23.070 --> 23:26.250
Why aren't we tracking that, right?

535
23:26.250 --> 23:27.720
And there is technology to track that.

536
23:27.720 --> 23:29.190
They're called brain computer interfaces.

537
23:29.190 --> 23:31.170
They're basically technology that allows you

538
23:31.170 --> 23:32.700
to read brain activity

539
23:32.700 --> 23:35.160
and then use it to control other types of systems

540
23:35.160 --> 23:37.230
or better understand yourself.

541
23:37.230 --> 23:41.730
And I'll tell you why these systems aren't everyday devices.

542
23:41.730 --> 23:44.040
It's because essentially, even though they have

543
23:44.040 --> 23:47.100
this huge amount of aspects that you can track

544
23:47.100 --> 23:49.470
and look at, you know, imagine tracking Alzheimer's

545
23:49.470 --> 23:51.000
before you get it, right?

546
23:51.000 --> 23:53.130
Imagine tracking your focus even though

547
23:53.130 --> 23:56.820
the value proposition is enormous for these devices.

548
23:56.820 --> 23:58.620
They look like this, right?

549
23:58.620 --> 24:02.523
They're large cap systems with gel electrodes, you know,

550
24:03.360 --> 24:05.400
essentially prongs that go through your hair.

551
24:05.400 --> 24:07.860
And while it would be incredible to have this type

552
24:07.860 --> 24:10.260
of technology and to be able to track these biomarkers,

553
24:10.260 --> 24:12.410
something that no other type of device can.

554
24:13.710 --> 24:15.690
We're limited to this type of form factor.

555
24:15.690 --> 24:17.010
And that's where Neurable comes in.

556
24:17.010 --> 24:18.630
It was developed in 2011.

557
24:18.630 --> 24:20.250
It's a signal processing technology

558
24:20.250 --> 24:21.630
from the University of Michigan

559
24:21.630 --> 24:23.880
that boost the signal of brain data.

560
24:23.880 --> 24:26.580
So instead of having to use these large head cap systems

561
24:26.580 --> 24:29.043
that you see here to your left,

562
24:29.910 --> 24:31.350
we essentially boost the signal,

563
24:31.350 --> 24:33.210
and we can bring it down to a pair of headphones.

564
24:33.210 --> 24:35.970
So here, I have a beautiful pair of headphones.

565
24:35.970 --> 24:38.280
They're a premium-end headphone

566
24:38.280 --> 24:39.840
from a company called Master &amp; Dynamic.

567
24:39.840 --> 24:42.600
We license our AI to this device.

568
24:42.600 --> 24:45.900
On the inside, you will see these gray bands,

569
24:45.900 --> 24:47.340
and Aven, you're gonna be controlling

570
24:47.340 --> 24:48.829
something with your brain.

571
24:48.829 --> 24:49.662
<v Aven>Okay.</v>

572
24:49.662 --> 24:51.390
<v Ramses>Yeah. Oh, how cool is that, right?</v>

573
24:51.390 --> 24:53.220
So go ahead and put these on just like

574
24:53.220 --> 24:54.570
a normal pair of headphones.

575
24:54.570 --> 24:57.060
Now, normally, to put on a brain computer interface,

576
24:57.060 --> 24:59.340
it would take about 20 to 30 minutes.

577
24:59.340 --> 25:02.580
We'd have to put gel all over you. All this other stuff.

578
25:02.580 --> 25:04.800
Yeah, just, yep. Awesome.

579
25:04.800 --> 25:06.630
But essentially, what we're gonna do right now

580
25:06.630 --> 25:08.550
is we are just having you put it on

581
25:08.550 --> 25:10.680
like a pair of headphones.

582
25:10.680 --> 25:12.730
So I'm gonna make sure they're turned on.

583
25:20.160 --> 25:20.993
Okay.

584
25:23.070 --> 25:25.720
Wake up my computer 'cause it decided to fall asleep.

585
25:27.450 --> 25:28.740
And how many of you actually used

586
25:28.740 --> 25:30.840
brain computer interfaces before?

587
25:30.840 --> 25:32.103
Anybody? Raise your hand.

588
25:33.210 --> 25:36.243
You two are biased 'cause you guys came here for me, so.

589
25:40.920 --> 25:41.850
All right.

590
25:41.850 --> 25:44.313
And if we could switch to my computer, please.

591
25:45.390 --> 25:47.040
So for those of you that are interested,

592
25:47.040 --> 25:49.830
please stand up and move over here real quick,

593
25:49.830 --> 25:51.480
and we're gonna show you some really cool,

594
25:51.480 --> 25:52.830
brain-related things.

595
25:52.830 --> 25:54.810
And if you haven't seen a brain computer interface,

596
25:54.810 --> 25:56.975
this is gonna be really sick, so.

597
25:56.975 --> 25:59.400
(Lori laughs)

598
25:59.400 --> 26:02.310
<v Lori>And Ramses, is there a website also where some</v>

599
26:02.310 --> 26:05.670
of these can be looked at in case folks don't get

600
26:05.670 --> 26:06.750
to see everything we wanna see?

601
26:06.750 --> 26:09.540
<v Ramses>Yes, yes. 'll share that in a second.</v>

602
26:09.540 --> 26:12.240
Aven, can you come down to this red chair?

603
26:12.240 --> 26:14.190
And then we'll get everybody over here.

604
26:16.020 --> 26:16.853
Awesome.

605
26:18.638 --> 26:22.423
So, Aven, just have a seat right there.

606
26:23.910 --> 26:26.430
So you guys can see this graph here?

607
26:26.430 --> 26:28.830
It represents Aven's focus.

608
26:28.830 --> 26:30.480
Now, Aven, what I want you to do is,

609
26:30.480 --> 26:31.710
do you see these numbers scrolling

610
26:31.710 --> 26:33.540
on the screen right there?

611
26:33.540 --> 26:35.190
I want you to start saying those numbers

612
26:35.190 --> 26:37.113
in your head as intensely as you can.

613
26:38.197 --> 26:40.447
(no audio)

614
26:45.027 --> 26:47.490
(no audio)

615
26:47.490 --> 26:49.230
Are you chewing gum?

616
26:49.230 --> 26:52.650
Yeah, could you take that out real quick? (laughs)

617
26:52.650 --> 26:54.180
No worries. All right.

618
26:54.180 --> 26:56.370
So go ahead and just start focusing

619
26:56.370 --> 26:57.990
on these numbers as they pop up.

620
26:57.990 --> 27:00.263
Say them in your head as intensely as you can.

621
27:01.501 --> 27:03.751
(no audio)

622
27:08.216 --> 27:10.466
(no audio)

623
27:12.576 --> 27:15.960
So you can see that his focus just spiked up, right?

624
27:15.960 --> 27:17.460
Right there.

625
27:17.460 --> 27:18.660
And now, that he's distracted

626
27:18.660 --> 27:21.930
'cause I'm distracting him, you see it drop down.

627
27:21.930 --> 27:23.680
So go ahead and focus one more time

628
27:26.040 --> 27:27.510
and then you can see his focus go up.

629
27:27.510 --> 27:28.800
Now, I'm gonna show you guys something really cool.

630
27:28.800 --> 27:30.461
Hold this for a second.

631
27:30.461 --> 27:32.794
(no audio)

632
27:37.230 --> 27:39.990
I want you to read this article.

633
27:39.990 --> 27:41.970
So, Aven is about to read an article,

634
27:41.970 --> 27:44.043
and you're gonna see his focus go up.

635
27:45.420 --> 27:47.970
<v Aven>This is my favorite headphones at CSE.</v>

636
27:47.970 --> 27:48.803
<v Ramses>You can read it in your head.</v>

637
27:48.803 --> 27:49.636
Don't worry about it.
<v Aven>Oh, oh.</v>

638
27:49.636 --> 27:51.770
<v Ramses>Yeah, yeah, it's okay. Don't worry.</v>

639
27:54.060 --> 27:56.850
<v Lori>Don't worry everybody, (chuckles) it's okay.</v>

640
27:56.850 --> 27:58.080
<v Ramses>All right, awesome.</v>

641
27:58.080 --> 28:00.330
So you see this area right here?

642
28:00.330 --> 28:02.250
This was him reading?
<v Aven>Yep.</v>

643
28:02.250 --> 28:05.640
<v Ramses>Oh, and then he saw the picture,</v>

644
28:05.640 --> 28:07.650
and it dropped his focus, right?

645
28:07.650 --> 28:09.450
'Cause he got distracted as he scrolled past

646
28:09.450 --> 28:11.520
this picture right here.

647
28:11.520 --> 28:12.810
And then when he went back to reading,

648
28:12.810 --> 28:14.130
it shot back up, right?

649
28:14.130 --> 28:16.710
So we're tracking his brain activity in real time.

650
28:16.710 --> 28:19.170
Something that would require a full-scalp EEG

651
28:19.170 --> 28:21.090
to get this level of capability.

652
28:21.090 --> 28:22.260
But we're able to do it essentially

653
28:22.260 --> 28:23.940
with an everyday device, right?

654
28:23.940 --> 28:26.550
So that's the real key type of technology.

655
28:26.550 --> 28:28.590
Cool, thank you all so much, Aven.

656
28:28.590 --> 28:29.423
<v Lori>Let's have a hand.</v>

657
28:29.423 --> 28:30.750
<v Ramses>A round of applause for Aven, real quick.</v>

658
28:30.750 --> 28:32.880
<v Lori>Being very creative about the demo there.</v>

659
28:32.880 --> 28:35.370
Let's just get into some group discussion.

660
28:35.370 --> 28:38.160
We have eight minutes left and I'd love for you all

661
28:38.160 --> 28:41.400
to hear from these great entrepreneurs.

662
28:41.400 --> 28:45.210
So just the question I was asking during our prep,

663
28:45.210 --> 28:46.710
not to spend too much time on this,

664
28:46.710 --> 28:49.770
but I'm wondering as we look

665
28:49.770 --> 28:54.120
at diagnostic therapies and how the FDA

666
28:54.120 --> 28:57.300
and our health insurance companies are finally paying

667
28:57.300 --> 29:00.210
for things for consumers, are all of you looking

668
29:00.210 --> 29:03.300
at the role that insurance companies will have with this

669
29:03.300 --> 29:06.720
and how doctors are treating this and things like that?

670
29:06.720 --> 29:10.380
So anyone on the panel wanna answer that?

671
29:10.380 --> 29:11.820
<v ->So my first customer,</v>

672
29:11.820 --> 29:13.290
when we started the toothbrush business

673
29:13.290 --> 29:16.860
was actually Delta Dental from California.

674
29:16.860 --> 29:20.040
'Cause it's an obvious change of the value, however,

675
29:20.040 --> 29:24.450
and it's quite disappointing, despite the fact

676
29:24.450 --> 29:26.403
that insurers show interests,

677
29:28.140 --> 29:30.360
at this moment, most of the market,

678
29:30.360 --> 29:35.360
not all, are more focusing on short-term,

679
29:35.520 --> 29:39.180
simplified interface, better user experience,

680
29:39.180 --> 29:40.260
less paperwork.

681
29:40.260 --> 29:42.480
So digitization of the user relationship

682
29:42.480 --> 29:44.820
is actually lowering the risk because somehow,

683
29:44.820 --> 29:47.580
the risk right now is properly redistributed.

684
29:47.580 --> 29:49.230
The insurance business is actually sharing

685
29:49.230 --> 29:51.840
the risk because if the risk increase,

686
29:51.840 --> 29:53.580
they will just increase the premium,

687
29:53.580 --> 29:55.260
and that's not bad for the business.

688
29:55.260 --> 30:00.260
So the insurance pathway is a long-term path.

689
30:01.830 --> 30:03.990
But for entrepreneur, we're looking for,

690
30:03.990 --> 30:07.260
I would say, quicker exit is probably not the best way

691
30:07.260 --> 30:11.130
in many areas, but it needs to be appreciated state by state

692
30:11.130 --> 30:14.220
because actually, insurance is actually regulated

693
30:14.220 --> 30:17.310
quite heavily in a state by state.

694
30:17.310 --> 30:19.470
<v Pranitha>Yeah. Similarly, we are focused</v>

695
30:19.470 --> 30:20.730
on consumers directly.

696
30:20.730 --> 30:23.310
We have a hundred thousand customers today.

697
30:23.310 --> 30:27.300
I think insurance is, to your point, the long-term play.

698
30:27.300 --> 30:29.940
But it really, really helps

699
30:29.940 --> 30:33.480
to have the direct consumer feedback right away.

700
30:33.480 --> 30:36.600
Like the number of folks that we get feedback from,

701
30:36.600 --> 30:38.400
so immediately and we can iterate

702
30:38.400 --> 30:40.440
on our product is outstanding.

703
30:40.440 --> 30:42.270
So that's our take at the moment.

704
30:42.270 --> 30:43.320
<v Lori>And Ramses.</v>

705
30:43.320 --> 30:44.610
<v Ramses>Yeah, I mean we're taking</v>

706
30:44.610 --> 30:46.500
a similar approach to like what Apple did.

707
30:46.500 --> 30:48.630
You know, they released a product,

708
30:48.630 --> 30:50.310
but it wasn't a medical product, right?

709
30:50.310 --> 30:53.070
It tracked your heart rate and then from there,

710
30:53.070 --> 30:54.900
they said, "Hey, you might have heart arrhythmia.

711
30:54.900 --> 30:56.250
Go see a doctor."

712
30:56.250 --> 30:58.020
And now, they're FDA approved,

713
30:58.020 --> 30:59.670
and they're going through that.

714
30:59.670 --> 31:01.320
And now, insurance companies are starting

715
31:01.320 --> 31:02.400
to leverage the data and so,

716
31:02.400 --> 31:03.480
we're taking a similar approach.

717
31:03.480 --> 31:05.310
That way, we can collect a ton of data,

718
31:05.310 --> 31:09.030
provide value and not be overburdened by FDA

719
31:09.030 --> 31:12.390
or insurance as a small startup company.

720
31:12.390 --> 31:13.470
<v ->That's great. I love that.</v>

721
31:13.470 --> 31:18.090
And do you see a moment in time where, you know,

722
31:18.090 --> 31:21.450
all of you are training consumers to be advocates

723
31:21.450 --> 31:25.350
for themselves, so that's gonna push the market forward.

724
31:25.350 --> 31:27.850
Am I correct? You know, the goal, that's the goal?

725
31:28.800 --> 31:29.823
<v ->Yeah, I think there is a point</v>

726
31:29.823 --> 31:32.910
where insurer actually are distributors of product

727
31:32.910 --> 31:35.190
and don't know actually how to sell hardware.

728
31:35.190 --> 31:37.440
So eventually, if there is no customer demand,

729
31:37.440 --> 31:40.140
if there is no desirability, if there is no brand,

730
31:40.140 --> 31:41.730
there is no value for the customer.

731
31:41.730 --> 31:43.530
So there is no value for the insurer.

732
31:43.530 --> 31:45.420
So really, the customer-first approach

733
31:45.420 --> 31:47.250
is really the only way forward.

734
31:47.250 --> 31:49.380
There is no big incentive despite

735
31:49.380 --> 31:51.180
whatever we can sell long-term

736
31:51.180 --> 31:53.430
for a manager that stays three years in a job

737
31:53.430 --> 31:57.210
to take a risk to actually buy a lot of hardware

738
31:57.210 --> 31:59.000
and try to see the value of five

739
31:59.000 --> 32:00.750
to 10 years down from the road.

740
32:00.750 --> 32:03.480
<v ->Yeah, wearables really like flip the script.</v>

741
32:03.480 --> 32:04.680
That's the key part, right?

742
32:04.680 --> 32:07.110
Like think about when you go to the doctor, right?

743
32:07.110 --> 32:08.430
You go to the doctor,

744
32:08.430 --> 32:11.220
and they say everything's fine.

745
32:11.220 --> 32:13.140
Go back next year, everything's fine.

746
32:13.140 --> 32:15.990
Go back next year. This happens for five, 10 years.

747
32:15.990 --> 32:19.710
And then they say, oh, your heart is abnormal, right?

748
32:19.710 --> 32:21.420
It's not that your heart hasn't been abnormal

749
32:21.420 --> 32:23.880
for the last 10 years and it just magically happened.

750
32:23.880 --> 32:26.580
It's probably been happening slowly over the last 10 years.

751
32:26.580 --> 32:30.660
But when they measured your heart at the hospital,

752
32:30.660 --> 32:32.130
they didn't detect it right?

753
32:32.130 --> 32:33.570
And so, wearables are flipping the script

754
32:33.570 --> 32:37.320
because now, you can measure that change as it's occurring.

755
32:37.320 --> 32:39.600
You can get it that information years beforehand,

756
32:39.600 --> 32:41.100
and that enables preventative care.

757
32:41.100 --> 32:43.530
That enables you to interject earlier.

758
32:43.530 --> 32:47.220
And so, that consumer-first approach enables

759
32:47.220 --> 32:49.170
that type of disruption to happen

760
32:49.170 --> 32:51.600
that using our current healthcare system,

761
32:51.600 --> 32:54.090
it's not well set up to do.

762
32:54.090 --> 32:55.140
<v ->Just maybe adding one thing.</v>

763
32:55.140 --> 32:57.270
I think there is two condition,

764
32:57.270 --> 33:00.030
when people are consumer and when people are patient.

765
33:00.030 --> 33:02.070
And there is a big, big difference.

766
33:02.070 --> 33:03.210
When people are consumer,

767
33:03.210 --> 33:06.180
it's their desire that will drive the adoption

768
33:06.180 --> 33:08.040
and insurer are not going to push it

769
33:08.040 --> 33:09.690
because it's extra cost for them,

770
33:09.690 --> 33:12.510
and the return on investment is too far away,

771
33:12.510 --> 33:14.730
in most cases, not all.

772
33:14.730 --> 33:17.460
Then when the consumer is becoming a patient,

773
33:17.460 --> 33:19.050
you're entering a brand new world

774
33:19.050 --> 33:21.810
where once you have proven the clinical value,

775
33:21.810 --> 33:24.120
which is not really, I mean some of our product are

776
33:24.120 --> 33:27.900
in that space, some of their product might enter that space.

777
33:27.900 --> 33:30.150
To enter that space takes two, three, four years

778
33:30.150 --> 33:31.710
to get the FDA approval

779
33:31.710 --> 33:33.810
and to have the clinical to support your claims.

780
33:33.810 --> 33:37.347
But there is a real benefit to the patients

781
33:37.347 --> 33:40.800
and a clinical benefit then insurers start going in

782
33:40.800 --> 33:43.110
because somehow if there is a better practice

783
33:43.110 --> 33:47.160
of care then it will be adopted by the healthcare community

784
33:47.160 --> 33:49.050
and become almost mandatory.

785
33:49.050 --> 33:52.020
But that's a complete different game for which startups

786
33:52.020 --> 33:56.580
who go to CES who have a short innovation cycle

787
33:56.580 --> 33:59.103
are not really prepared or funded to do.

788
33:59.103 --> 34:01.650
<v ->I'll also add one thing with physicians, right?</v>

789
34:01.650 --> 34:03.390
The insurance companies, that's one thing.

790
34:03.390 --> 34:04.620
The physicians on the other side,

791
34:04.620 --> 34:06.750
we've spoke to countless number of them

792
34:06.750 --> 34:09.870
that are finally getting hip to the idea of,

793
34:09.870 --> 34:12.330
yes, doing this many tests is okay,

794
34:12.330 --> 34:14.160
even though I was trained in medical school

795
34:14.160 --> 34:17.010
to think differently and taught to do differently,

796
34:17.010 --> 34:18.750
the incentive structure is not set up.

797
34:18.750 --> 34:20.640
There's so many things that are,

798
34:20.640 --> 34:23.460
honestly, battling preventative healthcare for physicians

799
34:23.460 --> 34:25.800
as they're burnt out, they have five minutes to see you.

800
34:25.800 --> 34:27.510
So if we really start to flip the script

801
34:27.510 --> 34:29.340
and say in your visit,

802
34:29.340 --> 34:32.070
we're super optimizing that time together

803
34:32.070 --> 34:34.560
because we know exactly what we need to get out of it.

804
34:34.560 --> 34:37.980
That is major change in how we do health

805
34:37.980 --> 34:40.200
and think about healthcare.

806
34:40.200 --> 34:42.150
<v ->Let me just ask the tricky question</v>

807
34:42.150 --> 34:44.640
that's a big conversation on the floor right now.

808
34:44.640 --> 34:47.100
And that's just about data security

809
34:47.100 --> 34:49.770
and also the other question in the air

810
34:49.770 --> 34:52.140
for everything right now is sustainability.

811
34:52.140 --> 34:54.570
So are those two conversations also wrapping

812
34:54.570 --> 34:56.190
into what you guys are all doing?

813
34:56.190 --> 34:58.950
Are you looking at, you know, security,

814
34:58.950 --> 35:01.050
and then also do we make a product

815
35:01.050 --> 35:03.060
that will move forward in this world?

816
35:03.060 --> 35:06.180
You know, where we're limited in resources?

817
35:06.180 --> 35:09.420
<v ->So on security, the biggest weakness</v>

818
35:09.420 --> 35:12.900
of connected device is inventor don't know cybersecurity,

819
35:12.900 --> 35:14.340
otherwise, they won't invent

820
35:14.340 --> 35:15.810
because it's so heavy and complicated.

821
35:15.810 --> 35:18.360
So that's why we introduce this BConnect platform

822
35:18.360 --> 35:22.110
to accelerate the best practice of cyber security diffusion

823
35:22.110 --> 35:25.770
as well as implementing the best practices in data privacy.

824
35:25.770 --> 35:27.510
Because data privacy, best practice

825
35:27.510 --> 35:30.660
actually not embedded in the software.

826
35:30.660 --> 35:31.890
You have to build it yourself,

827
35:31.890 --> 35:33.780
and you need to build it out of experience.

828
35:33.780 --> 35:36.390
On the sustainability, it's an economic question.

829
35:36.390 --> 35:39.990
What we have seen so far is only a few percentage

830
35:39.990 --> 35:43.350
of the population can afford paying sustainable product

831
35:43.350 --> 35:46.410
and when people are suffering from purchasing power change,

832
35:46.410 --> 35:49.434
they will focus on the price versus sustainability,

833
35:49.434 --> 35:50.613
and that's gonna last,

834
35:50.613 --> 35:52.740
<v ->I'll start with sustainability first.</v>

835
35:52.740 --> 35:54.270
If you think about pro-anything,

836
35:54.270 --> 35:56.250
proactive or preventative,

837
35:56.250 --> 36:00.840
the idea is to stave off the cost you would have

838
36:00.840 --> 36:04.290
for treating diabetes, treating heart disease.

839
36:04.290 --> 36:07.350
That is a major win if you're able to get that

840
36:07.350 --> 36:08.850
and get that outcome.

841
36:08.850 --> 36:10.620
And then as far as security, absolutely,

842
36:10.620 --> 36:13.140
our members own their data.

843
36:13.140 --> 36:15.030
They choose who they send it to,

844
36:15.030 --> 36:17.760
and that is of utmost priority with function

845
36:17.760 --> 36:20.040
because that can impact your insurance.

846
36:20.040 --> 36:21.810
It can impact a number of things down the line

847
36:21.810 --> 36:24.300
if we don't keep that top of mind.

848
36:24.300 --> 36:25.710
<v ->Yeah, ours is pretty simple.</v>

849
36:25.710 --> 36:28.680
Similar to yours, the consumer owns the data.

850
36:28.680 --> 36:31.500
If they wanna share it to us, that's wonderful

851
36:31.500 --> 36:35.070
and by sharing it to us, we give them more value, right?

852
36:35.070 --> 36:36.540
But if they just wanna use the product

853
36:36.540 --> 36:39.180
in its simplest form, that's totally fine.

854
36:39.180 --> 36:40.950
<v ->That's awesome. And just 'cause we're running outta time,</v>

855
36:40.950 --> 36:43.020
can you guys do another lightning round

856
36:43.020 --> 36:45.180
of where everybody in the audience can learn more

857
36:45.180 --> 36:48.000
about your platforms, so they can play?

858
36:48.000 --> 36:50.460
<v ->Yeah you can go to neurable.com</v>

859
36:50.460 --> 36:51.930
and actually see what we're building.

860
36:51.930 --> 36:53.610
Also, come talk to me afterwards.

861
36:53.610 --> 36:54.990
I'm happy to give you guys demos,

862
36:54.990 --> 36:57.840
and you guys can mess around with the system yourself.

863
36:57.840 --> 36:59.310
<v ->Are you on LinkedIn as well</v>

864
36:59.310 --> 37:00.510
posting about what you're doing?

865
37:00.510 --> 37:02.040
<v ->I am on LinkedIn.</v>

866
37:02.040 --> 37:04.230
You won't be able to add me 'cause I have a blocker on,

867
37:04.230 --> 37:07.770
but I will add you if you show me your QR code.

868
37:07.770 --> 37:11.670
<v ->Oh, I love that. Privacy issue there. Okay. (laughs)</v>

869
37:11.670 --> 37:14.370
<v ->I'm on LinkedIn, Pranitha Patil is my name.</v>

870
37:14.370 --> 37:16.470
And then you can learn more about Function

871
37:16.470 --> 37:17.940
by going to functionhealth.com.

872
37:17.940 --> 37:20.890
I'm also happy to chat and answer any questions after this.

873
37:21.870 --> 37:23.564
<v ->I am on all possible platform.</v>

874
37:23.564 --> 37:26.910
LinkedIn, WeChat, WhatsApp, Thomas Serval.

875
37:26.910 --> 37:29.700
You can find me or tserval on the X.

876
37:29.700 --> 37:32.460
We are on CES show floor at Eureka Park

877
37:32.460 --> 37:34.110
in the French pavilion.

878
37:34.110 --> 37:37.697
And our website has plenty of example, baracoda.com,

879
37:37.697 --> 37:40.140
B-A-R-A-C-O-D-A.com.

880
37:40.140 --> 37:41.370
<v ->Wait a minute, you're French?</v>

881
37:41.370 --> 37:43.440
Just kidding (laughs)

882
37:43.440 --> 37:45.120
All right. Let's have a big hand for our panelists.

883
37:45.120 --> 37:46.740
Such great entrepreneurs,

884
37:46.740 --> 37:49.290
really changing the way we're gonna live our lives.

885
37:49.290 --> 37:51.210
I love it. Thank you guys so much

886
37:51.210 --> 37:52.950
and please check out all their companies.

887
37:52.950 --> 37:55.380
They're just doing amazing work. Thanks, everybody.

888
37:55.380 --> 37:57.540
This ends this track,

889
37:57.540 --> 37:59.910
but there are more sessions here in the hall,

890
37:59.910 --> 38:02.340
so please check them out and have a great,

891
38:02.340 --> 38:04.800
