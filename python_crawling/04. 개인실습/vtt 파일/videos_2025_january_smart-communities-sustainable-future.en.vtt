1
00:00.120 --> 00:03.287
(upbeat gentle music)

2
00:11.659 --> 00:16.020
<v ->We are here to explore the future of communities</v>

3
00:16.020 --> 00:18.840
through the lens of technology in the session titled,

4
00:18.840 --> 00:21.753
Smart Communities, Sustainable Future.

5
00:23.100 --> 00:27.750
So BCG did a study recently and it predicts that by 2050,

6
00:27.750 --> 00:31.470
70% of the world's population will live in cities.

7
00:31.470 --> 00:34.800
That's several billion people moving to cities

8
00:34.800 --> 00:36.423
in the next couple decades.

9
00:37.500 --> 00:40.650
The integration of smart technologies into cities

10
00:40.650 --> 00:43.080
isn't something that we're just going to plan for

11
00:43.080 --> 00:45.510
and talk about innovation.

12
00:45.510 --> 00:48.123
It's something that's a necessity now.

13
00:49.470 --> 00:53.160
It's going to bring sustainability, efficiency

14
00:53.160 --> 00:55.260
and quality of life to our cities,

15
00:55.260 --> 00:57.483
which we all know is what attracts people.

16
00:58.710 --> 01:02.670
Today, I have the pleasure of moderating this discussion

17
01:02.670 --> 01:04.080
with these fine people

18
01:04.080 --> 01:06.930
who are some of the deepest industry experts you'll find.

19
01:07.830 --> 01:10.560
We have Philip Tucker here from Panasonic,

20
01:10.560 --> 01:12.570
Kristin Bell from Siemens

21
01:12.570 --> 01:16.353
and Marco Stracuzzi from Telit Cinterion.

22
01:18.780 --> 01:22.410
Today we'll dive in to how we harness technology

23
01:22.410 --> 01:26.190
to overcome some of the challenges that smart cities bring

24
01:26.190 --> 01:30.330
and how those can become opportunities.

25
01:30.330 --> 01:32.310
We're going to focus on some of the fundamentals

26
01:32.310 --> 01:33.570
of smart cities.

27
01:33.570 --> 01:35.970
That's your sustainable infrastructure,

28
01:35.970 --> 01:38.310
connectivity and communications,

29
01:38.310 --> 01:42.723
data-driven decision making as well as smart mobility.

30
01:44.160 --> 01:48.060
Before we begin, let's see how many of you

31
01:48.060 --> 01:50.190
are already living in smart cities

32
01:50.190 --> 01:53.070
or experienced smart cities technology firsthand?

33
01:53.070 --> 01:54.003
Show of hands.

34
01:56.010 --> 01:59.610
We have a very well-versed audience today.

35
01:59.610 --> 02:02.580
I'm sure they'll have tons of questions for us as well.

36
02:02.580 --> 02:05.943
So to kick things off, I'm going to start with you, Philip.

37
02:06.900 --> 02:10.230
Share your perspectives on any technology advancements

38
02:10.230 --> 02:14.610
in some of the core and fundamental areas of smart cities.

39
02:14.610 --> 02:16.560
<v ->Definitely, thank you.</v>

40
02:16.560 --> 02:19.470
So Philip Tucker, nice to meet all of you.

41
02:19.470 --> 02:22.320
I'm with Panasonic Smart Mobility Office.

42
02:22.320 --> 02:25.350
So we're a group located out of Denver, Colorado.

43
02:25.350 --> 02:28.680
And our main focus, we're a smaller group within Panasonic

44
02:28.680 --> 02:31.710
and we're incubating new (indistinct) within Panasonic,

45
02:31.710 --> 02:34.740
specifically in the mobility and the energy space

46
02:34.740 --> 02:39.270
and bringing those to the market where we can help achieve

47
02:39.270 --> 02:40.650
some of Panasonic's goals,

48
02:40.650 --> 02:44.280
especially around our green impact initiative

49
02:44.280 --> 02:47.640
where we're trying to reduce emissions globally

50
02:47.640 --> 02:49.170
by 300 million tons.

51
02:49.170 --> 02:51.330
I don't know if you guys heard Kusumi-san talk

52
02:51.330 --> 02:53.040
about that in the keynote,

53
02:53.040 --> 02:55.740
but it's a really, really big objective for us

54
02:55.740 --> 02:56.930
and we're playing a big role in that

55
02:56.930 --> 02:59.160
in bringing some of the new technologies

56
02:59.160 --> 03:00.720
and new solutions that Panasonic

57
03:00.720 --> 03:02.340
is developing around the world,

58
03:02.340 --> 03:07.080
bringing those to the US and other big markets here.

59
03:07.080 --> 03:10.080
I came from the electric power industry.

60
03:10.080 --> 03:12.000
I've worked with municipal utilities,

61
03:12.000 --> 03:13.590
investor-owned utilities.

62
03:13.590 --> 03:16.860
I've helped them design demand management programs,

63
03:16.860 --> 03:19.260
specifically around electric vehicles,

64
03:19.260 --> 03:22.350
integrating directly with vehicle OEMs,

65
03:22.350 --> 03:26.160
working with chargers, finding ways to integrate

66
03:26.160 --> 03:28.740
additional electric vehicles onto our grid

67
03:28.740 --> 03:32.130
in a way that's not going to damage our grid.

68
03:32.130 --> 03:35.460
We can incorporate more electric vehicles more quickly

69
03:35.460 --> 03:39.340
without investing tremendously into the grid

70
03:40.470 --> 03:42.843
and the additional assets to support that.

71
03:43.740 --> 03:47.370
So that's why I came to Panasonic, though.

72
03:47.370 --> 03:50.760
That really excites me and I found within Panasonic,

73
03:50.760 --> 03:53.610
I can kind of unite that power background

74
03:53.610 --> 03:58.230
and join a team that has these massive global resources

75
03:58.230 --> 04:01.380
to tackle this big problem that we're facing.

76
04:01.380 --> 04:03.840
So what I wanted to share about today was two areas

77
04:03.840 --> 04:07.380
where our team is specifically working on,

78
04:07.380 --> 04:10.950
smart city objectives in smart communities.

79
04:10.950 --> 04:15.270
So one is around smart grids, specifically around fleets

80
04:15.270 --> 04:18.300
and how we can help fleets decarbonize

81
04:18.300 --> 04:22.800
more quickly and more cost effectively in a way that, again,

82
04:22.800 --> 04:26.490
can actually help support the grid in a lot of good ways.

83
04:26.490 --> 04:28.920
And the other is around connected vehicles

84
04:28.920 --> 04:33.240
and how we can help communities operate their vehicles

85
04:33.240 --> 04:35.400
in a smarter way with assets

86
04:35.400 --> 04:37.320
they actually already have in the vehicle,

87
04:37.320 --> 04:40.560
so they don't have to go and make massive investments

88
04:40.560 --> 04:42.120
to get more value out of the vehicles

89
04:42.120 --> 04:43.983
they are already operating.

90
04:44.940 --> 04:47.580
So the first example I want to talk about

91
04:47.580 --> 04:49.440
is with the city of Fort Collins.

92
04:49.440 --> 04:50.670
If you're not familiar with it,

93
04:50.670 --> 04:52.560
it's the fourth largest city in Colorado,

94
04:52.560 --> 04:55.740
in Northern Colorado, about 60 miles north of Denver.

95
04:55.740 --> 04:59.130
And this is a city well-known for their innovation.

96
04:59.130 --> 05:01.740
They are recognized in the Smithsonian Museum

97
05:01.740 --> 05:03.120
for their innovation.

98
05:03.120 --> 05:04.260
So they're very cutting edge

99
05:04.260 --> 05:08.160
and they have sustainability plans to reduce their emissions

100
05:08.160 --> 05:12.210
from 2005 by 80% by 2030.

101
05:12.210 --> 05:15.000
So they are really working very hard to this,

102
05:15.000 --> 05:17.640
they're making huge gains and electrifying their fleet

103
05:17.640 --> 05:21.330
is a very big component of achieving that goal.

104
05:21.330 --> 05:23.160
And so we've been working with them

105
05:23.160 --> 05:24.420
on how they're going to do that.

106
05:24.420 --> 05:25.695
How are they going to electrify?

107
05:25.695 --> 05:29.010
They have 1,200 vehicles in their fleet,

108
05:29.010 --> 05:30.570
how are they going to make that plan

109
05:30.570 --> 05:32.650
to switch to electric vehicles

110
05:33.750 --> 05:38.020
while not damaging their grid, supporting their grid

111
05:39.000 --> 05:41.190
and also keeping their costs low?

112
05:41.190 --> 05:43.440
We've all heard examples of where fleets electrified

113
05:43.440 --> 05:44.340
and their costs went up,

114
05:44.340 --> 05:46.510
because they charged incorrectly

115
05:47.550 --> 05:50.190
or did other operations the wrong way.

116
05:50.190 --> 05:52.860
So we've been working with them on that

117
05:52.860 --> 05:54.810
to implement some solutions

118
05:54.810 --> 05:57.480
where they can advance their electrification plans,

119
05:57.480 --> 06:00.750
their decarbonization efforts

120
06:00.750 --> 06:03.330
in a way that achieves those outcomes.

121
06:03.330 --> 06:04.980
And the way we did that is we implemented

122
06:04.980 --> 06:08.460
our charging management solution with the city

123
06:08.460 --> 06:11.730
and we demonstrated that we can integrate with chargers

124
06:11.730 --> 06:14.340
throughout the city from various manufacturers,

125
06:14.340 --> 06:16.170
not just Panasonic chargers.

126
06:16.170 --> 06:18.900
Actually can't buy a Panasonic charger in the US anyway,

127
06:18.900 --> 06:23.610
so we're working with any vendor they wanted to adopt

128
06:23.610 --> 06:27.570
within the city there that could work with our software.

129
06:27.570 --> 06:29.880
So we're working with those across multiple sites.

130
06:29.880 --> 06:31.920
And we also integrated with their DERMS system.

131
06:31.920 --> 06:33.300
If you're not familiar with the DERMS

132
06:33.300 --> 06:36.720
that's Distributed Energy Resource Management System.

133
06:36.720 --> 06:39.120
It's a utilities tool that they use

134
06:39.120 --> 06:43.620
to manage assets on the grid, typically behind the meter,

135
06:43.620 --> 06:46.440
such as electric vehicle chargers.

136
06:46.440 --> 06:49.380
So we're getting signals from their DERM system.

137
06:49.380 --> 06:52.080
And then with the chargers that we're integrated with,

138
06:52.080 --> 06:55.020
we can actually manage the charging, we can shift it

139
06:55.020 --> 06:56.370
or we can delay charging

140
06:56.370 --> 06:59.700
or we can slow charging down a little bit,

141
06:59.700 --> 07:04.530
which will help the city to maintain a safe, reliable, clean

142
07:04.530 --> 07:07.680
and affordable grid for their entire community.

143
07:07.680 --> 07:11.613
And we're seeing some very good outcomes from that.

144
07:12.510 --> 07:15.270
For example, we did a forecast for them.

145
07:15.270 --> 07:17.340
They showed us the electric vehicles

146
07:17.340 --> 07:19.563
they're planning to adopt by 2030.

147
07:20.430 --> 07:22.260
And with our solution, they're actually able

148
07:22.260 --> 07:24.003
to reduce their costs,

149
07:25.920 --> 07:30.920
their exposure to these costs of $800,000 a year,

150
07:31.740 --> 07:33.660
which is quite a bit for a community that size.

151
07:33.660 --> 07:35.673
It's 150,000 people there.

152
07:36.720 --> 07:38.640
And that means a lot to me.

153
07:38.640 --> 07:42.510
That's $800,000 that can go to other community programs

154
07:42.510 --> 07:44.640
and services that really can produce

155
07:44.640 --> 07:46.350
a lot of benefit for the community.

156
07:46.350 --> 07:48.540
And it's not going towards more fuel,

157
07:48.540 --> 07:50.580
it's not going towards wires that go in the ground.

158
07:50.580 --> 07:53.100
It's going towards things that the community needs

159
07:53.100 --> 07:56.130
and can create a better city there.

160
07:56.130 --> 07:57.840
So that's pretty exciting.

161
07:57.840 --> 08:02.130
Other benefits include the emissions reductions.

162
08:02.130 --> 08:04.710
So we're helping them to decarbonize their fleet

163
08:04.710 --> 08:07.080
and with the forecast, they're looking at reducing

164
08:07.080 --> 08:11.700
their emissions by 1,000 metric tons of CO2 as well.

165
08:11.700 --> 08:13.950
So some great output from there.

166
08:13.950 --> 08:15.750
Other great things,

167
08:15.750 --> 08:18.420
outcomes from this project with them has been,

168
08:18.420 --> 08:20.670
we were able to integrate our CMS

169
08:20.670 --> 08:21.810
with their accounting system.

170
08:21.810 --> 08:23.760
So now they're actually able to track

171
08:23.760 --> 08:25.980
which department charged with and they can charge

172
08:25.980 --> 08:28.800
the right department for the fuel they were using.

173
08:28.800 --> 08:32.400
So the much more management that is required

174
08:32.400 --> 08:35.787
for adopting all of these vehicles.

175
08:35.787 --> 08:36.960
It also gives them a central place

176
08:36.960 --> 08:38.430
where they can see the charges

177
08:38.430 --> 08:41.250
if they're working, if they're not working.

178
08:41.250 --> 08:42.480
If you have an electric vehicle,

179
08:42.480 --> 08:45.300
you've probably pulled up to a charger that's not working,

180
08:45.300 --> 08:47.190
which is really, really frustrating.

181
08:47.190 --> 08:49.530
And that's kind of slowing things down.

182
08:49.530 --> 08:51.720
We're creating an alert system for them,

183
08:51.720 --> 08:54.300
so that if one's not working, they get a text,

184
08:54.300 --> 08:56.280
they know, roll a truck, go fix it.

185
08:56.280 --> 08:59.520
So we can keep the city running here.

186
08:59.520 --> 09:02.700
Also, we helped them apply to a grant to get more chargers

187
09:02.700 --> 09:05.220
and all the infrastructure they're going to need

188
09:05.220 --> 09:06.633
well into the future.

189
09:07.470 --> 09:09.330
And so we helped them apply to a grant.

190
09:09.330 --> 09:11.850
They won $11 million to advance this initiative

191
09:11.850 --> 09:13.450
within the city of Fort Collins.

192
09:15.120 --> 09:17.643
I think this is a really great project to show.

193
09:18.630 --> 09:23.130
When you plan out the charging for your operations well,

194
09:23.130 --> 09:24.570
you integrate with the utility,

195
09:24.570 --> 09:27.920
you create a smart grid using these assets,

196
09:27.920 --> 09:30.603
it can create a lot of benefit for the community.

197
09:32.010 --> 09:34.200
So that's that component.

198
09:34.200 --> 09:36.600
The other smart component I wanted to talk about

199
09:36.600 --> 09:38.640
was connected vehicles.

200
09:38.640 --> 09:40.890
So that's another group within the Smart Mobility Office.

201
09:40.890 --> 09:42.870
We have some focusing on charging management,

202
09:42.870 --> 09:45.243
others focused on connected vehicles.

203
09:47.340 --> 09:50.130
We have this group that's working with different fleets

204
09:50.130 --> 09:55.130
and intersection owner operators.

205
09:58.110 --> 10:02.370
They've been working with them to help traffic flow better,

206
10:02.370 --> 10:04.638
to create smarter cities for traffic

207
10:04.638 --> 10:06.990
to flow a little bit better.

208
10:06.990 --> 10:09.854
You can tell that's not my space, I'm the energy guy.

209
10:09.854 --> 10:11.460
(chuckles)

210
10:11.460 --> 10:15.783
But it's pretty exciting stuff when you get into it,

211
10:16.740 --> 10:19.170
because having these vehicles connected,

212
10:19.170 --> 10:22.080
communicating to the infrastructure within the city,

213
10:22.080 --> 10:24.630
it really can help reduce emissions,

214
10:24.630 --> 10:28.380
getting traffic to flow better, faster.

215
10:28.380 --> 10:30.810
We're going to reduce emissions from vehicles

216
10:30.810 --> 10:31.980
just sitting there.

217
10:31.980 --> 10:33.630
The one that gets me really excited

218
10:33.630 --> 10:36.990
is with emergency vehicle responses.

219
10:36.990 --> 10:41.110
So I have a a stat here that every minute

220
10:42.120 --> 10:46.500
that is increased by an emergency response vehicle

221
10:46.500 --> 10:48.540
to somebody who's having a heart attack increases

222
10:48.540 --> 10:51.210
the likelihood of fatality by 10%.

223
10:51.210 --> 10:53.850
So getting an emergency vehicle where it needs to go

224
10:53.850 --> 10:57.360
as fast as possible is absolutely critical

225
10:57.360 --> 11:00.990
for our smart cities moving forward.

226
11:00.990 --> 11:03.510
And one thing that we've been able to successfully do

227
11:03.510 --> 11:07.860
within our group's work with this team, the TOUGHBOOK team.

228
11:07.860 --> 11:09.900
Most emergency vehicles around the country

229
11:09.900 --> 11:11.820
have this already in the vehicle.

230
11:11.820 --> 11:13.800
And so by working with this team,

231
11:13.800 --> 11:16.530
we're able to develop new systems

232
11:16.530 --> 11:20.040
where we can understand where do these vehicles need to go,

233
11:20.040 --> 11:22.200
when they need to get there,

234
11:22.200 --> 11:24.060
what intersections they need to get to.

235
11:24.060 --> 11:25.470
We can communicate with those

236
11:25.470 --> 11:27.030
and we can clear the traffic out,

237
11:27.030 --> 11:30.270
so those vehicles can get there as fast as possible.

238
11:30.270 --> 11:31.650
And it's all through something

239
11:31.650 --> 11:32.940
that's already in the vehicle.

240
11:32.940 --> 11:36.210
You don't have to go buy some new widget and gadget.

241
11:36.210 --> 11:38.940
Use this, use what you've already got in the vehicle

242
11:38.940 --> 11:42.400
and we can help create a better community

243
11:43.290 --> 11:44.130
where you live there.

244
11:44.130 --> 11:47.550
So those are the two examples I wanted to share.

245
11:47.550 --> 11:51.090
<v ->I know, Kristin, you and I talked about how energy</v>

246
11:51.090 --> 11:54.570
and energy efficiency really underpins the smart city.

247
11:54.570 --> 11:56.858
You want to share your perspective on that and-

248
11:56.858 --> 11:57.720
<v ->Sure.</v>
<v ->What you all are doing</v>

249
11:57.720 --> 11:58.710
at Siemens?
<v ->Sure, thanks</v>

250
11:58.710 --> 12:00.260
for having me on the panel.

251
12:00.260 --> 12:05.040
I am from Siemens and I joined Siemens about a year ago,

252
12:05.040 --> 12:08.850
where I'd previously been at Salesforce for almost a decade.

253
12:08.850 --> 12:11.100
Was inspired to come to Siemens

254
12:11.100 --> 12:13.470
because of the role that they're playing,

255
12:13.470 --> 12:16.230
not only as being really the cornerstone

256
12:16.230 --> 12:17.640
of our hardware infrastructure,

257
12:17.640 --> 12:22.640
things like our train systems, our hospitals, our factories.

258
12:22.680 --> 12:25.020
They also built out the grid in many cases

259
12:25.020 --> 12:26.250
around the world globally,

260
12:26.250 --> 12:30.390
the infrastructure of this grid and this grid is aging

261
12:30.390 --> 12:35.373
and the grid is not at capable of servicing

262
12:36.300 --> 12:39.690
the growth of the population you talked about,

263
12:39.690 --> 12:41.880
but there are also a lot of challenges

264
12:41.880 --> 12:46.650
in addition to population growth that I'm really inspired by

265
12:46.650 --> 12:51.360
as we look towards a blueprint for the future at Siemens.

266
12:51.360 --> 12:53.610
So one of the things, I think,

267
12:53.610 --> 12:55.260
that I've really learned in the last year,

268
12:55.260 --> 12:58.020
I've done some research and really tried to become familiar

269
12:58.020 --> 13:00.180
with what's happening with our utilities,

270
13:00.180 --> 13:02.760
what is happening with the grid?

271
13:02.760 --> 13:05.670
And there's a number of things.

272
13:05.670 --> 13:09.210
There's the energy that we need to clean

273
13:09.210 --> 13:12.690
and there's a commitment towards that through regulations.

274
13:12.690 --> 13:15.270
There's the population that's growing,

275
13:15.270 --> 13:17.610
but there's also this complexity

276
13:17.610 --> 13:20.490
of the changing weather patterns.

277
13:20.490 --> 13:23.460
And we all know and we've heard about blackouts.

278
13:23.460 --> 13:27.600
But compounding that is actually our veracious appetite

279
13:27.600 --> 13:31.053
for energy through computation.

280
13:32.070 --> 13:34.080
So for any of you that heard these keynotes

281
13:34.080 --> 13:37.260
or heard in, certainly, the Nvidia keynote,

282
13:37.260 --> 13:39.600
we heard a lot about AI,

283
13:39.600 --> 13:44.600
but those data centers that support AI, the cloud,

284
13:44.880 --> 13:48.360
crypto, that is an always-on situation.

285
13:48.360 --> 13:49.500
So when it comes to energy,

286
13:49.500 --> 13:51.900
it's not just turning on our heat and keeping us warm

287
13:51.900 --> 13:53.580
and it's not just plugging in our light

288
13:53.580 --> 13:55.530
and hoping we can see.

289
13:55.530 --> 13:57.570
There's a lot more demand that we have.

290
13:57.570 --> 14:00.060
And so with the goals that have been set,

291
14:00.060 --> 14:04.380
there's tremendous pressure on the operators of the grid.

292
14:04.380 --> 14:07.710
And so I am so proud to work at Grid Software,

293
14:07.710 --> 14:10.860
which is this division of Siemens that is really committed

294
14:10.860 --> 14:15.860
to finding solutions for these utilities.

295
14:16.050 --> 14:18.840
Those solutions come in a number of areas.

296
14:18.840 --> 14:22.380
They come in understanding energy consumption,

297
14:22.380 --> 14:24.150
but also really knowing

298
14:24.150 --> 14:27.210
about where those distributed energy resources are.

299
14:27.210 --> 14:30.810
So as we get excited about electric vehicles,

300
14:30.810 --> 14:35.130
it's also daunting to think that five years ago,

301
14:35.130 --> 14:37.260
we would've probably not been here

302
14:37.260 --> 14:41.040
or if we were here, we'd be wearing masks because of COVID.

303
14:41.040 --> 14:45.660
Five years from now, there will be 18 times

304
14:46.500 --> 14:49.830
the number of electric vehicles there are today.

305
14:49.830 --> 14:54.830
Those vehicles need to plug in and they need to charge

306
14:54.840 --> 14:59.477
and our utilities are blind or not visible

307
15:00.360 --> 15:03.243
to all the charging that's coming their way.

308
15:04.200 --> 15:05.910
And this is truly a crisis.

309
15:05.910 --> 15:07.740
So we've got an aging grid

310
15:07.740 --> 15:09.990
and then we've got this increasing demand

311
15:09.990 --> 15:11.670
and the demand is exciting.

312
15:11.670 --> 15:13.650
We've got solar, we've got wind.

313
15:13.650 --> 15:16.740
How do we help these energies harness

314
15:16.740 --> 15:19.050
their centralized approach

315
15:19.050 --> 15:23.190
into having flexible autonomous grid management

316
15:23.190 --> 15:27.510
that accounts for the direction we need to go in?

317
15:27.510 --> 15:31.830
So we have a number of products in our portfolio

318
15:31.830 --> 15:35.580
that, in the end, are really committed to just that,

319
15:35.580 --> 15:38.010
getting more out of the grid

320
15:38.010 --> 15:41.880
by allowing software and technology to give visibility

321
15:41.880 --> 15:45.660
to where is the high and the low voltage,

322
15:45.660 --> 15:48.960
where are the distributed energy resources coming from

323
15:48.960 --> 15:53.960
and how can our grid operators come up with new strategies?

324
15:54.420 --> 15:57.510
We're also helping with grid simulation and the digital twin

325
15:57.510 --> 15:59.820
and really helping to be able to forecast

326
15:59.820 --> 16:01.830
and plan towards those changes.

327
16:01.830 --> 16:05.703
So we have some real success stories around,

328
16:06.570 --> 16:09.630
just a couple examples would be in Norway,

329
16:09.630 --> 16:12.660
we have a partnership with Elvia,

330
16:12.660 --> 16:15.120
which services over 2 million customers

331
16:15.120 --> 16:17.220
in Europe, in Norway.

332
16:17.220 --> 16:19.590
And they have extreme weather patterns,

333
16:19.590 --> 16:24.090
but they also have really aggressive sustainability goals.

334
16:24.090 --> 16:26.940
And we have developed software

335
16:26.940 --> 16:29.310
that they're co-innovating with us on

336
16:29.310 --> 16:30.930
to really have visibility

337
16:30.930 --> 16:32.490
to where the low voltage needs are,

338
16:32.490 --> 16:33.870
where the high voltage needs are

339
16:33.870 --> 16:37.050
and we're helping to get 20% more capacity

340
16:37.050 --> 16:39.120
out of the grid for them.

341
16:39.120 --> 16:41.700
Harnessing data is a really big challenge.

342
16:41.700 --> 16:43.170
Simulation of the grid.

343
16:43.170 --> 16:48.030
So in Vermont, we're partnered with the Vermont Electric,

344
16:48.030 --> 16:51.210
VELCO, that is doing just that, simulating the grid,

345
16:51.210 --> 16:54.660
so that we can really help them not just plan,

346
16:54.660 --> 16:56.310
but plan through those simulations

347
16:56.310 --> 16:58.500
so that they know how to prevent blackouts

348
16:58.500 --> 17:01.530
and they can take advantage of real time data.

349
17:01.530 --> 17:02.700
So there's a lot that we're doing,

350
17:02.700 --> 17:05.460
there's a lot that's impacting these communities,

351
17:05.460 --> 17:06.570
but I'm really excited.

352
17:06.570 --> 17:10.260
I'm excited to be here with both of you.

353
17:10.260 --> 17:14.370
<v ->I think what I heard from you was we've got</v>

354
17:14.370 --> 17:16.323
a lot going on in terms of managing.

355
17:17.280 --> 17:21.390
There's supply of these devices, there's the infrastructure,

356
17:21.390 --> 17:23.820
there's the things on the infrastructure

357
17:23.820 --> 17:25.620
and all of these things have to be connected

358
17:25.620 --> 17:27.360
and they have to speak to one another.

359
17:27.360 --> 17:30.090
And I think we take that for granted sometimes.

360
17:30.090 --> 17:32.130
We don't know that it's going on in the background.

361
17:32.130 --> 17:34.050
And so I wanted to invite Marco

362
17:34.050 --> 17:35.760
to share his perspectives on that,

363
17:35.760 --> 17:37.890
because he works on the invisible things

364
17:37.890 --> 17:41.160
that make it all happen and come together.

365
17:41.160 --> 17:42.480
<v ->Thank you.</v>

366
17:42.480 --> 17:45.060
I am honored to be part of this panel

367
17:45.060 --> 17:48.330
with this line up of speakers.

368
17:48.330 --> 17:51.390
So I'm Marco, I run product management

369
17:51.390 --> 17:54.600
for cellular technology at Telit Cinterion.

370
17:54.600 --> 17:56.730
I guess most of you have never heard

371
17:56.730 --> 17:58.620
about Telit Cinterion before.

372
17:58.620 --> 18:01.350
So we are a global company specialized

373
18:01.350 --> 18:04.410
in Internet of Things solutions.

374
18:04.410 --> 18:08.880
The reason why probably you have never seen our brand

375
18:08.880 --> 18:11.970
is because our technology is deeply integrated

376
18:11.970 --> 18:15.270
into devices from the top industry brands.

377
18:15.270 --> 18:18.960
So to make it simple, hopefully, for everyone,

378
18:18.960 --> 18:21.963
I'll tell you what we do through an example.

379
18:23.160 --> 18:25.440
And since we are talking about smart cities,

380
18:25.440 --> 18:27.780
I want to take the example of a smart bin.

381
18:27.780 --> 18:29.970
So think of a smart bin

382
18:29.970 --> 18:33.060
for a intelligent collection of waste.

383
18:33.060 --> 18:37.470
So the only way for the bin to communicate

384
18:37.470 --> 18:41.520
to the control center to the cloud, it's fill level.

385
18:41.520 --> 18:43.053
So whether it's full or empty.

386
18:44.040 --> 18:49.040
It's to have a radio transceiver that send the data

387
18:49.170 --> 18:51.150
through the cellular network to the cloud

388
18:51.150 --> 18:52.470
and the control center.

389
18:52.470 --> 18:55.800
So we do that wireless communication module.

390
18:55.800 --> 18:58.770
So we have a wide range of wireless communication modules

391
18:58.770 --> 19:00.660
across different technologies.

392
19:00.660 --> 19:05.283
Cellular 4G, 5G, but also Wi-Fi and GPS for location.

393
19:06.510 --> 19:10.020
Then the module itself is not enough,

394
19:10.020 --> 19:13.680
'cause just like your smartphone doesn't work without a sim

395
19:13.680 --> 19:16.530
and a subscription from a mobile operator,

396
19:16.530 --> 19:18.615
also the module needs a sim card.

397
19:18.615 --> 19:21.383
So we are a provider also of sim cards

398
19:21.383 --> 19:24.660
and data plan tailored for IoT applications.

399
19:24.660 --> 19:27.930
So we are a mobile virtual network operator.

400
19:27.930 --> 19:32.190
And the last piece is software solutions,

401
19:32.190 --> 19:35.370
both for the cloud and at the edge

402
19:35.370 --> 19:39.690
to make the communication as efficient as possible,

403
19:39.690 --> 19:41.640
because we are talking about sustainability,

404
19:41.640 --> 19:43.710
we are talking about energy consumption.

405
19:43.710 --> 19:48.710
So it's important to optimize as much as possible

406
19:48.720 --> 19:52.350
the exchange of data between the devices and the network,

407
19:52.350 --> 19:56.370
because this can save, for example, the power consumption

408
19:56.370 --> 19:59.220
because some of these devices are running on battery.

409
19:59.220 --> 20:03.360
They are not attached to the main power supply.

410
20:03.360 --> 20:08.040
So I could have made these examples, also,

411
20:08.040 --> 20:10.860
for other smart city devices.

412
20:10.860 --> 20:15.690
Think of utility smart meters for the automated reading

413
20:15.690 --> 20:20.370
of electricity, water, gas or street lights

414
20:20.370 --> 20:25.370
or precisely, Philip talked before about charging stations.

415
20:25.650 --> 20:27.690
They also need to be connected.

416
20:27.690 --> 20:32.130
So my point is there's no smart city without connectivity.

417
20:32.130 --> 20:35.460
Connectivity forms the backbone of the smart city

418
20:35.460 --> 20:37.535
and at Telit Cinterion,

419
20:37.535 --> 20:42.090
our mission is really to ensure that this connectivity

420
20:42.090 --> 20:45.663
is continuous, reliable and resilient.

421
20:47.010 --> 20:50.010
Kristin, you touched upon what happens

422
20:50.010 --> 20:51.660
in case of power outages.

423
20:51.660 --> 20:52.980
So that's important.

424
20:52.980 --> 20:57.664
The connectivity must be resilient also to power outages,

425
20:57.664 --> 21:01.650
to some emergency situations.

426
21:01.650 --> 21:05.850
And there are few ways to ensure this is happening.

427
21:05.850 --> 21:09.300
For example, a critical device

428
21:09.300 --> 21:12.690
should have multiple connectivity options.

429
21:12.690 --> 21:15.005
For example, think of a,

430
21:15.005 --> 21:17.069
I don't know, a surveillance camera

431
21:17.069 --> 21:19.380
for security in the city.

432
21:19.380 --> 21:21.690
It can work most of the time on Wi-Fi,

433
21:21.690 --> 21:23.220
but in case of power outage,

434
21:23.220 --> 21:25.560
the Wi-Fi network is not going to be available.

435
21:25.560 --> 21:28.710
So it should have a failover connectivity to cellular,

436
21:28.710 --> 21:30.870
for example and connect to the cellular network

437
21:30.870 --> 21:33.420
based on a backup battery.

438
21:33.420 --> 21:35.770
Also, when we talk about cellular connectivity,

439
21:36.900 --> 21:41.700
it's not enough to connect to just one operator network,

440
21:41.700 --> 21:45.210
because that network may not be available for some reason

441
21:45.210 --> 21:48.780
at some point in time or in some remote locations.

442
21:48.780 --> 21:53.470
So we usually provide solutions to have multiple options,

443
21:54.720 --> 21:58.650
so the device can select a primary operator,

444
21:58.650 --> 22:02.220
but then also can fall back to a secondary operator

445
22:02.220 --> 22:04.080
when the first one is not available.

446
22:04.080 --> 22:06.723
So redundancy is important in the connectivity.

447
22:07.860 --> 22:10.500
I think redundancy is fundamental also

448
22:10.500 --> 22:12.873
in the power supply system.

449
22:13.832 --> 22:16.800
So you need to have multiple power sources,

450
22:16.800 --> 22:21.243
can be renewable sources or can be backup batteries.

451
22:22.710 --> 22:27.450
And that's really the way to ensure all the devices,

452
22:27.450 --> 22:30.150
whatever they are, they are constantly connected,

453
22:30.150 --> 22:32.280
which means they can be remotely monitored,

454
22:32.280 --> 22:35.640
because at the end of the day, that's what is important

455
22:35.640 --> 22:38.463
to always be able to reach the device in the field,

456
22:39.587 --> 22:41.520
take out data from the device

457
22:41.520 --> 22:44.493
and analyze the data and take actions accordingly.

458
22:45.870 --> 22:47.160
<v ->No, thank you for that example.</v>

459
22:47.160 --> 22:49.620
I think simple examples like that,

460
22:49.620 --> 22:52.170
just a bin that everybody has in their home,

461
22:52.170 --> 22:54.070
it could really be something different

462
22:54.930 --> 22:58.350
once you start layering on the connectivity and the data

463
22:58.350 --> 23:02.580
and the ability to monitor and whatnot.

464
23:02.580 --> 23:05.253
So smart cities are here to stay.

465
23:06.480 --> 23:08.830
We're only hoping that they're getting smarter.

466
23:09.750 --> 23:12.300
So I'm going to ask you the tough question now.

467
23:12.300 --> 23:13.740
What excites you the most?

468
23:13.740 --> 23:16.170
What do you see coming in the future?

469
23:16.170 --> 23:20.136
If we were in 2050, what have we achieved?

470
23:20.136 --> 23:21.568
<v ->Hmm, hmm.</v>

471
23:21.568 --> 23:23.250
<v ->Hmm. (Philip chuckles)</v>

472
23:23.250 --> 23:24.930
<v ->I can dream about anything. (moderator chuckles)</v>

473
23:24.930 --> 23:26.103
The 2050.

474
23:28.800 --> 23:30.813
The things that excite me the most is,

475
23:32.040 --> 23:35.100
well, clearly electric vehicles. (chuckles)

476
23:35.100 --> 23:38.820
I think the amount of benefit that's going to bring

477
23:38.820 --> 23:41.400
to the entire world to decarbonize

478
23:41.400 --> 23:44.943
our transportation systems is huge.

479
23:45.840 --> 23:48.300
Transportation is one third of the emissions in the US.

480
23:48.300 --> 23:51.810
If we can solve that, we've tackled a third of it.

481
23:51.810 --> 23:56.793
That's a huge problem we can go after and solve.

482
23:57.930 --> 23:59.340
It's going to take all of us.

483
23:59.340 --> 24:01.380
I think what's exciting is getting to work

484
24:01.380 --> 24:03.540
with folks like this up on the stage

485
24:03.540 --> 24:05.910
and tackle these problems together.

486
24:05.910 --> 24:08.250
It's going to take more than just Panasonic.

487
24:08.250 --> 24:10.620
It's going to take Siemens, it's going to take everybody

488
24:10.620 --> 24:12.963
to get involved in this,

489
24:14.614 --> 24:16.890
to really solve this massive challenge

490
24:16.890 --> 24:18.690
we have in front of us.

491
24:18.690 --> 24:23.160
And I think there's a lot of great, exciting technology

492
24:23.160 --> 24:26.310
that we're seeing out there, especially around AI

493
24:26.310 --> 24:30.120
and all kinds of other amazing developments

494
24:30.120 --> 24:31.620
that are coming up and all of those

495
24:31.620 --> 24:33.810
are going to be necessary.

496
24:33.810 --> 24:37.200
But I think the bigger thing for us also to be focusing on

497
24:37.200 --> 24:40.830
is how do we get that from here where we're talking

498
24:40.830 --> 24:42.750
and demonstrating and from the lab

499
24:42.750 --> 24:45.090
and making this look really flashy and cool,

500
24:45.090 --> 24:46.680
how do we get it out into the field?

501
24:46.680 --> 24:49.620
We need to get this out into people's hands.

502
24:49.620 --> 24:53.340
We need to get new technology implemented

503
24:53.340 --> 24:55.440
and actually producing the benefits

504
24:55.440 --> 24:56.880
that we're talking about here.

505
24:56.880 --> 24:58.290
To me, that's the most important thing

506
24:58.290 --> 25:03.290
that we can be working on is moving from ideas

507
25:03.390 --> 25:07.590
and laboratories and getting it out into the cities

508
25:07.590 --> 25:09.870
and into people's hands and producing the benefits

509
25:09.870 --> 25:12.723
that we all really are here to try to achieve.

510
25:13.680 --> 25:15.993
<v ->What about you, Kristin, excites you?</v>

511
25:16.830 --> 25:21.830
<v ->2050, one, is a big year for goals around net zero</v>

512
25:22.650 --> 25:25.770
and I think there's a lot to achieve in getting there.

513
25:25.770 --> 25:29.850
So I love your comment about partnerships and collaboration,

514
25:29.850 --> 25:32.220
because I think right now,

515
25:32.220 --> 25:36.150
even though this is a global challenge, it's still tackled,

516
25:36.150 --> 25:38.190
even within the US, at the municipal level

517
25:38.190 --> 25:39.930
in terms of varying regulations,

518
25:39.930 --> 25:43.140
which makes it complicated to solve these problems.

519
25:43.140 --> 25:47.733
And so I think greater partnerships,

520
25:49.440 --> 25:51.780
that's probably within and beyond the utilities.

521
25:51.780 --> 25:54.030
Something I also think that's a little bit left field,

522
25:54.030 --> 25:56.160
but certainly important, passionate for me

523
25:56.160 --> 26:00.210
would be an ethical approach to AI,

524
26:00.210 --> 26:04.050
which is moving at quite an astronomical speed.

525
26:04.050 --> 26:08.190
And I think that so much of what we see through demos

526
26:08.190 --> 26:12.303
and ideas is exciting but also potentially frightening.

527
26:13.738 --> 26:17.010
And so I would hope that just as we're thinking

528
26:17.010 --> 26:20.850
about the grid, we're thinking about always on

529
26:20.850 --> 26:25.410
and being smart in our connectivity with community,

530
26:25.410 --> 26:28.150
I would hope that we're also really mindful

531
26:30.625 --> 26:32.640
of what we should be ethically thinking about

532
26:32.640 --> 26:36.603
in terms of safety and in terms of the future for all of us.

533
26:38.100 --> 26:39.976
<v ->Marco, what about you?</v>

534
26:39.976 --> 26:43.623
<v ->So there is a technology that is already deployed,</v>

535
26:46.080 --> 26:49.290
excite me a lot and it's digital twins,

536
26:49.290 --> 26:51.300
because at the beginning, it looked to me

537
26:51.300 --> 26:55.170
like a science fiction movie technology, but it's real.

538
26:55.170 --> 27:00.170
So digital twins are virtual replicas of physical entities,

539
27:00.300 --> 27:02.490
that can be buildings, infrastructure

540
27:02.490 --> 27:04.410
or an entire smart city.

541
27:04.410 --> 27:05.670
And I think this technology

542
27:05.670 --> 27:08.340
is going to be more and more important going forward,

543
27:08.340 --> 27:11.970
because it allows to simulate, analyze

544
27:11.970 --> 27:15.180
and optimize possible scenarios

545
27:15.180 --> 27:18.753
and understand where our criticalities in the smart city.

546
27:20.040 --> 27:24.300
Optimize, can be the traffic flow, we talked before

547
27:24.300 --> 27:29.300
or can be, also, you can detect heat highland

548
27:29.310 --> 27:32.130
where the temperature is going to be very hot

549
27:32.130 --> 27:35.670
and so you can plan where to plant trees.

550
27:35.670 --> 27:39.153
So there's a lot of things you can do with digital twins.

551
27:39.990 --> 27:41.610
Then there's something else that is more

552
27:41.610 --> 27:46.230
of something solving one of my private issues.

553
27:46.230 --> 27:49.140
I live in a city in Italy that it's not that big,

554
27:49.140 --> 27:53.280
but it's very dense so there's not much land

555
27:53.280 --> 27:56.463
for building houses and also parking slots.

556
27:57.840 --> 28:02.010
So I dream in 2050 to have my car driving me

557
28:02.010 --> 28:05.370
to the nearest available parking spot.

558
28:05.370 --> 28:09.750
So with my car talking with the smart parking system,

559
28:09.750 --> 28:13.200
finding for me the available parking spot

560
28:13.200 --> 28:15.090
and maybe driving me there.

561
28:15.090 --> 28:18.879
So that's something I think we are not that far

562
28:18.879 --> 28:20.280
to make it happen,

563
28:20.280 --> 28:23.550
but today, I'm losing hours of my day

564
28:23.550 --> 28:26.433
just looking myself for a parking spot.

565
28:27.510 --> 28:29.280
<v ->And as long as my car talks to your car</v>

566
28:29.280 --> 28:30.993
when you're done with that spot.

567
28:30.993 --> 28:33.390
(Philip chuckles)

568
28:33.390 --> 28:34.410
<v Philip>Perfect.</v>

569
28:34.410 --> 28:38.070
<v ->But no, thank you all for sharing your perspectives</v>

570
28:38.070 --> 28:43.050
and, in your roles, seeing what's coming down the pipe,

571
28:43.050 --> 28:46.650
what's next and being in that innovation role.

572
28:46.650 --> 28:47.790
We have a few minutes left,

573
28:47.790 --> 28:51.213
so we can take a couple questions if folks have questions.

574
28:52.140 --> 28:54.960
There are microphones around the room

575
28:54.960 --> 28:57.750
if anybody wants to step up to the questions

576
28:57.750 --> 29:01.950
or belch them out.

577
29:01.950 --> 29:03.360
<v Audience 1>I have a comment,</v>

578
29:03.360 --> 29:05.801
maybe something broad to get some opinions on.

579
29:05.801 --> 29:08.010
So you asked a really good question,

580
29:08.010 --> 29:10.650
but you look so far ahead, 2050

581
29:10.650 --> 29:13.920
and I think there's so much that can be done

582
29:13.920 --> 29:18.920
as you mentioned, Philip, in terms of what happens in 2050,

583
29:19.077 --> 29:21.030
but in your speaking, I'm also seeing

584
29:21.030 --> 29:23.730
some of the restrictions that,

585
29:23.730 --> 29:25.773
possibly, we ran into with IoT.

586
29:26.708 --> 29:29.910
And I wrote it down, I didn't write down right there,

587
29:29.910 --> 29:32.220
but there's these silos of ideas

588
29:32.220 --> 29:33.810
and some things were thrown out.

589
29:33.810 --> 29:38.810
So we need to collaborate more, vertical integrations.

590
29:39.660 --> 29:42.900
How do we facilitate that as an industry

591
29:42.900 --> 29:45.840
in terms of getting multiple,

592
29:45.840 --> 29:47.700
and some of this is legislation as well,

593
29:47.700 --> 29:49.620
multiple entities to work together,

594
29:49.620 --> 29:52.947
so we get to 2050 in 10 years instead of (indistinct)?

595
29:55.680 --> 29:58.530
<v ->I would say, certainly in the utilities industry,</v>

596
29:58.530 --> 30:01.050
the nice thing is there already is a lot of collaboration.

597
30:01.050 --> 30:03.603
Certainly even within the US, there's a lot of,

598
30:04.650 --> 30:07.170
it's a small finite universe

599
30:07.170 --> 30:11.073
and so learning and sharing best practices.

600
30:12.180 --> 30:14.940
Grid simulation's a great example and that digital twin,

601
30:14.940 --> 30:16.510
which is something that Siemens

602
30:17.460 --> 30:19.713
has really developed and built.

603
30:20.940 --> 30:25.940
Where those simulations are revealing critical information,

604
30:25.980 --> 30:28.290
that information really just needs to be shared

605
30:28.290 --> 30:32.160
that there's no winner in this game.

606
30:32.160 --> 30:36.720
We all win when we discover and uncover opportunities.

607
30:36.720 --> 30:38.610
And that's really what this presents for us.

608
30:38.610 --> 30:40.260
There's a big challenge.

609
30:40.260 --> 30:43.170
I talked about five years ago we were in masks,

610
30:43.170 --> 30:46.440
five years from now, the energy consumption

611
30:46.440 --> 30:49.980
will be three times what it is today.

612
30:49.980 --> 30:52.170
And I live in Oregon and there was an article

613
30:52.170 --> 30:56.010
in The Oregonian just three weeks ago warning us

614
30:56.010 --> 30:57.720
that there are going to be blackouts,

615
30:57.720 --> 31:01.350
because there are over a hundred data centers

616
31:01.350 --> 31:03.060
in the state of Oregon.

617
31:03.060 --> 31:05.700
And that consumption of those data centers,

618
31:05.700 --> 31:07.980
as I was talking about, that computation demand,

619
31:07.980 --> 31:10.860
how do we partner and collaborate,

620
31:10.860 --> 31:15.860
I think that regulation is sometimes the limiting factor.

621
31:16.620 --> 31:21.620
And so sometimes I think we can be a facilitator

622
31:22.020 --> 31:27.020
to those partnerships of one utility to another

623
31:27.090 --> 31:30.390
and I think eliminating this notion of competition,

624
31:30.390 --> 31:34.530
which luckily with utilities, it's a finite universe.

625
31:34.530 --> 31:35.910
They're not as competitive,

626
31:35.910 --> 31:38.560
so the collaboration tends to exist

627
31:39.630 --> 31:43.260
and just really sharing best practices is essential.

628
31:43.260 --> 31:45.120
Does anyone else have something to share?

629
31:45.120 --> 31:47.760
<v ->I think you touched on it earlier about partnerships.</v>

630
31:47.760 --> 31:51.660
I think it's partnerships within the ecosystem

631
31:51.660 --> 31:55.170
but also with the public sector as well, to your point.

632
31:55.170 --> 31:56.700
There's a lot of regulation.

633
31:56.700 --> 32:00.600
I think part of that partnership is shaping that regulation.

634
32:00.600 --> 32:02.190
And that's through a lot of education.

635
32:02.190 --> 32:04.720
And then to your point, how do we get things

636
32:05.640 --> 32:07.083
into the communities.

637
32:08.610 --> 32:11.010
Think of piloting things before we scale them

638
32:11.010 --> 32:14.673
and using those pilots to shape some of those regulations.

639
32:17.430 --> 32:20.043
<v ->Two thoughts, one along those lines.</v>

640
32:22.140 --> 32:25.170
Doing the pilots, I think working with cities

641
32:25.170 --> 32:30.170
and getting folks to think innovatively about their own task

642
32:30.270 --> 32:32.850
that they're doing right now.

643
32:32.850 --> 32:35.160
It doesn't always have to be, "Hey,

644
32:35.160 --> 32:37.290
revolutionize this brand new technology,"

645
32:37.290 --> 32:40.560
like switch completely from one technology to another.

646
32:40.560 --> 32:43.920
It can just be incremental step by step by step.

647
32:43.920 --> 32:46.020
Let's solve the next big challenge.

648
32:46.020 --> 32:47.043
So in Fort Collins,

649
32:49.200 --> 32:50.970
they have about 50 electric vehicles actually.

650
32:50.970 --> 32:54.720
They've been pushing quite, quite rapidly,

651
32:54.720 --> 32:56.700
but now they're ready to jump a little bit more

652
32:56.700 --> 32:58.650
and then they'll go even further.

653
32:58.650 --> 33:01.803
And so I think there's an incremental thing.

654
33:02.761 --> 33:04.320
When we're looking at 2050,

655
33:04.320 --> 33:05.640
it's not all going to happen at once.

656
33:05.640 --> 33:08.950
It's going to go step by step by step by step to get there

657
33:10.193 --> 33:13.440
and we'll build brick by brick by brick to get there.

658
33:13.440 --> 33:16.470
I think the other thing, to answer your question

659
33:16.470 --> 33:18.897
and maybe this goes along with the policies

660
33:18.897 --> 33:21.720
and the partnerships, standards.

661
33:21.720 --> 33:24.840
I think standardization is absolutely critical

662
33:24.840 --> 33:26.550
in lots of different fields.

663
33:26.550 --> 33:28.713
I mean I'm a mechanical engineer.

664
33:30.690 --> 33:32.430
Try to think of building a car

665
33:32.430 --> 33:35.760
without standards for screw sizes and thread sizes.

666
33:35.760 --> 33:36.750
You couldn't.

667
33:36.750 --> 33:38.040
We couldn't build something

668
33:38.040 --> 33:40.710
without those standards in place.

669
33:40.710 --> 33:42.450
And I think that's critical for us

670
33:42.450 --> 33:44.070
in some of these other technologies,

671
33:44.070 --> 33:47.283
especially around communications.

672
33:48.360 --> 33:50.580
Lots of different communications protocols

673
33:50.580 --> 33:54.090
between different systems, utility systems,

674
33:54.090 --> 33:58.110
systems that manage IoT devices.

675
33:58.110 --> 34:01.680
For us, a common protocol we use is OCPP,

676
34:01.680 --> 34:03.750
Open Charge Point Protocol.

677
34:03.750 --> 34:07.140
Having everything speak the same language allows us

678
34:07.140 --> 34:11.730
to build more complex and more sophisticated machines.

679
34:11.730 --> 34:16.500
And so I think that's going to be a very critical component

680
34:16.500 --> 34:19.410
as we build out these new systems and new technologies

681
34:19.410 --> 34:21.150
to make sure everything can communicate,

682
34:21.150 --> 34:23.820
'cause that's going to be one of the biggest components

683
34:23.820 --> 34:25.623
is things working together here.

684
34:26.700 --> 34:29.550
<v ->Absolutely I wanted to bring up some standardization.</v>

685
34:29.550 --> 34:31.560
So a hundred percent agree.

686
34:31.560 --> 34:36.560
So the way to allow interoperability and allow devices

687
34:36.990 --> 34:41.130
of different types from different vertical industry

688
34:41.130 --> 34:43.200
to exchange data with each other

689
34:43.200 --> 34:46.590
and leverage this data sharing

690
34:46.590 --> 34:50.943
is to have more standard protocols as much as possible.

691
34:52.050 --> 34:54.030
I want to add two more points,

692
34:54.030 --> 34:57.123
especially when we talk about data exchange.

693
34:58.920 --> 35:00.003
Cybersecurity.

694
35:02.199 --> 35:07.050
We need to make the public trust smart cities

695
35:07.050 --> 35:10.890
and not fear smart cities and the way to do that

696
35:10.890 --> 35:13.840
is to pay a lot of attention to cybersecurity

697
35:14.700 --> 35:15.780
in an holistic way.

698
35:15.780 --> 35:18.990
So we know that a chain is just as stronger

699
35:18.990 --> 35:23.430
as its weakest link, so the data must be secured,

700
35:23.430 --> 35:26.043
must be encrypted, in transit, addressed.

701
35:26.970 --> 35:31.480
We should leverage artificial intelligence algorithm

702
35:32.351 --> 35:36.990
to analyze the data patterns, detect anomalies

703
35:36.990 --> 35:40.200
that may be possible cyber threats

704
35:40.200 --> 35:43.620
and also train the end users

705
35:43.620 --> 35:46.233
to the best cybersecurity practices.

706
35:47.970 --> 35:49.170
<v ->That's a good one.</v>
<v ->And the other point</v>

707
35:49.170 --> 35:53.220
is privacy also, so when we talk about taking data

708
35:53.220 --> 35:54.445
out of devices is important

709
35:54.445 --> 35:58.650
that there are the right privacy policies in place.

710
35:58.650 --> 36:02.640
So the users, again, are not afraid

711
36:02.640 --> 36:05.520
of sharing data coming from devices maybe

712
36:05.520 --> 36:09.150
that are inside their homes or in their neighborhoods

713
36:09.150 --> 36:13.830
and they don't feel like their personal data

714
36:13.830 --> 36:14.663
is being shared.

715
36:14.663 --> 36:17.580
So that's also another important point in my opinion.

716
36:17.580 --> 36:19.320
<v ->That's a great one.</v>

717
36:19.320 --> 36:20.153
Question?

718
36:22.993 --> 36:25.070
<v Audience 2>- I think for the (indistinct) description,</v>

719
36:25.070 --> 36:28.781
I'm working for United Nation Environmental Program,

720
36:28.781 --> 36:32.100
so because of nature of our work,

721
36:32.100 --> 36:35.000
I am wondering what international (indistinct),

722
36:40.371 --> 36:45.121
because already, this year (indistinct),

723
36:49.049 --> 36:53.493
but these kind of issues is directly linked

724
36:53.493 --> 36:56.598
with the electronic car and the smart city.

725
36:56.598 --> 36:59.168
So that's why I would like to know

726
36:59.168 --> 37:02.123
how your companies is (indistinct)

727
37:02.123 --> 37:04.790
in this international agreement?

728
37:05.670 --> 37:06.503
<v ->It's a good question.</v>

729
37:06.503 --> 37:09.989
I'm not sure I know exactly how to answer that question.

730
37:09.989 --> 37:10.920
Do you have any?

731
37:10.920 --> 37:13.290
<v ->I had a hard time hearing your question, I'm sorry.</v>

732
37:13.290 --> 37:14.297
<v ->Could you come to the-</v>

733
37:14.297 --> 37:15.546
mic there?
<v ->There is a mic right there-</v>

734
37:15.546 --> 37:17.379
if you want to.

735
37:22.230 --> 37:23.580
Oh, maybe it's not working.

736
37:24.450 --> 37:25.380
Can we get that? (microphone thumping)

737
37:25.380 --> 37:26.427
There you go.
<v Audience 2>Hello.</v>

738
37:26.427 --> 37:29.790
I'm working for United Nation Environmental Program

739
37:29.790 --> 37:33.570
and I was wondering what international agreement

740
37:33.570 --> 37:36.060
the Panasonic and Siemens is considered,

741
37:36.060 --> 37:39.780
because already, the Basel convention will revise this year,

742
37:39.780 --> 37:42.450
at the same time Global Convention on Chemicals

743
37:42.450 --> 37:44.223
will be established this year.

744
37:45.630 --> 37:48.840
But this kind of conventions is directly linked

745
37:48.840 --> 37:52.260
with the smart city and the electronic vehicles

746
37:52.260 --> 37:54.120
and especially batteries.

747
37:54.120 --> 37:57.000
So that's why I would like to know how your companies

748
37:57.000 --> 37:59.250
is dealing with this international agreement.

749
38:02.520 --> 38:03.600
<v ->You mentioned Siemens in there, too.</v>

750
38:03.600 --> 38:07.053
I don't know of any agreements going on in place.

751
38:08.378 --> 38:11.640
<v Andrea>If you don't mind, so if we can speak tomorrow.</v>

752
38:11.640 --> 38:15.030
I know that there's a partnership between Panasonic

753
38:15.030 --> 38:19.048
and Siemens working on that and we keep going (indistinct).

754
38:19.048 --> 38:19.982
You can come back tomorrow.

755
38:19.982 --> 38:22.106
I actually believe we're having (indistinct).

756
38:22.106 --> 38:23.943
<v Audience 2>Oh good, thank you, awesome.</v>

757
38:23.943 --> 38:26.040
<v ->It's a directive environmental.</v>

758
38:26.040 --> 38:26.903
<v Audience 2>Thank you.</v>

759
38:32.130 --> 38:33.990
<v ->I'm not familiar with what you were talking about.</v>

760
38:33.990 --> 38:35.190
Sorry about that.

761
38:35.190 --> 38:37.020
<v ->One exciting thing I'll talk about</v>

762
38:37.020 --> 38:39.720
on that front though is,

763
38:39.720 --> 38:44.220
and Kusumi-san talked about this at the keynote today

764
38:44.220 --> 38:47.220
is we are really focused, as a company,

765
38:47.220 --> 38:50.580
on the circular economy and ensuring that,

766
38:50.580 --> 38:52.500
Panasonic is the largest producer

767
38:52.500 --> 38:54.090
of batteries in North America.

768
38:54.090 --> 38:58.410
And so that's a really important component to us

769
38:58.410 --> 38:59.760
is what goes into those batteries.

770
38:59.760 --> 39:02.310
How are we going to reuse those?

771
39:02.310 --> 39:04.360
We need to do that in a really smart way.

772
39:05.790 --> 39:07.590
We want to help protect the environment

773
39:07.590 --> 39:09.750
by introducing more electric vehicles,

774
39:09.750 --> 39:12.300
but we also want to protect the environment by making sure

775
39:12.300 --> 39:14.520
we're not taking more out of it than we need to.

776
39:14.520 --> 39:17.880
And so we have been working with redwood materials on that

777
39:17.880 --> 39:21.900
to develop some very advanced ways to recycle the materials

778
39:21.900 --> 39:24.480
from batteries, put that into new batteries

779
39:24.480 --> 39:26.130
and get them back out on the road again.

780
39:26.130 --> 39:28.560
So that's definitely a big component that we're working on,

781
39:28.560 --> 39:31.470
but looking forward to hearing why Andrea has to share

782
39:31.470 --> 39:33.993
in her sessions, too, sounds like some good stuff.

783
39:35.550 --> 39:37.890
<v ->So I think we're down to the last few seconds,</v>

784
39:37.890 --> 39:39.393
so we'll wrap it up.

785
39:40.290 --> 39:42.990
I want to thank everybody, I want to thank the panelists

786
39:42.990 --> 39:44.433
and the audience as well.

787
39:45.570 --> 39:48.483
I hope this is a conversation that we continue to have.

788
39:51.660 --> 39:53.220
Enjoy the rest of CES

789
39:53.220 --> 39:57.000
and find us for more questions on smart cities.

790
39:57.000 --> 39:59.548
Thank you. (audience applauding)

791
39:59.548 --> 40:02.131
(upbeat music)
