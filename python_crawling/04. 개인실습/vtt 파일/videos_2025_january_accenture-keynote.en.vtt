00:00.317 --> 00:02.900
(upbeat music)

00:10.380 --> 00:11.820
<v Announcer>Please welcome the President</v>

00:11.820 --> 00:15.883
of the Consumer Technology Association, Kinsey Fabrizio.

00:15.883 --> 00:18.466
(upbeat music)

00:23.981 --> 00:27.398
<v ->Good afternoon and welcome to CES 2025.</v>

00:29.400 --> 00:31.200
As you all in this room know,

00:31.200 --> 00:35.070
CES brings together the products and services

00:35.070 --> 00:36.870
driving the tech trends

00:36.870 --> 00:39.060
and the innovators whose vision

00:39.060 --> 00:42.420
is reinventing the world around us.

00:42.420 --> 00:47.190
That's why I am so thrilled to welcome Accenture,

00:47.190 --> 00:52.190
an innovation led company and longtime participant at CES.

00:53.700 --> 00:57.300
Accenture helps leaders reinvent themselves

00:57.300 --> 00:59.970
using emerging tech to be more efficient

00:59.970 --> 01:03.960
and create a great customer experiences,

01:03.960 --> 01:08.960
and serves as a trusted partner to more than 9,000 clients

01:09.330 --> 01:12.840
in more than 120 countries.

01:12.840 --> 01:16.320
And under Chair and CEO Julie Sweet,

01:16.320 --> 01:18.990
the company has reached new heights,

01:18.990 --> 01:23.990
delivering innovation and transformation on a global scale

01:24.030 --> 01:25.440
through cutting edge solutions

01:25.440 --> 01:29.700
in AI, cloud, computing, sustainability,

01:29.700 --> 01:31.653
and digital transformation.

01:32.610 --> 01:34.800
In addition to advising clients,

01:34.800 --> 01:38.700
Accenture has been rapidly reinventing itself too,

01:38.700 --> 01:42.630
using technology, data, and AI.

01:42.630 --> 01:44.400
Julie has been recognized

01:44.400 --> 01:48.630
as one of "Times" 100 most influential people

01:48.630 --> 01:52.410
and one of "Fortune's" most powerful women in business.

01:52.410 --> 01:57.410
As AI applications expand, she served as a trusted advisor

01:57.900 --> 02:01.110
helping businesses use AI and data

02:01.110 --> 02:03.660
to power their own reinvention,

02:03.660 --> 02:06.990
and a leading voice urging companies

02:06.990 --> 02:10.353
to develop and use AI responsibly.

02:11.610 --> 02:15.360
She'll be joined on stage by Julia Boorstin,

02:15.360 --> 02:19.590
CNBC's Senior Media and Tech Correspondent

02:19.590 --> 02:24.480
who covers both topics with a focus on tech innovation.

02:24.480 --> 02:28.207
Julia is also the author of the bestselling book,

02:28.207 --> 02:30.120
"When Women Lead"

02:30.120 --> 02:34.560
and a creator of CNBC's Disruptor 50 list of companies

02:34.560 --> 02:36.720
transforming our economy.

02:36.720 --> 02:41.290
Please help me and welcome Julie and Julia to the stage.

02:41.290 --> 02:46.290
(upbeat music)
(audience applauds)

02:55.230 --> 02:56.190
<v ->Thank you you so much,</v>

02:56.190 --> 03:00.450
and thank you to to the CTA and CES for having us here.

03:00.450 --> 03:02.283
Before we get started, I just wanna acknowledge something

03:02.283 --> 03:03.870
that I know is on a lot of our minds,

03:03.870 --> 03:06.360
which are these devastating fires

03:06.360 --> 03:08.910
in the Los Angeles area, my hometown,

03:08.910 --> 03:12.960
and I just hope that technology can be part of the solution

03:12.960 --> 03:15.600
for rebuilding and also preventing this kind of tragedy

03:15.600 --> 03:16.780
from happening again, so.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.540
<v ->Yeah, it's just, it's so hard.</v>

03:18.540 --> 03:21.390
We were just talking about this backstage,

03:21.390 --> 03:24.540
'cause my family is also, I grew up in southern California.

03:24.540 --> 03:27.510
My sister's still there, my brother's still there.

03:27.510 --> 03:29.040
I was up like you, like half the night.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.120
Like I was like,

03:30.120 --> 03:32.430
what if you fall asleep and you need to evacuate?

03:32.430 --> 03:33.990
I mean, it's just so hard.

03:33.990 --> 03:36.450
And when you see the devastation, it's terrible,

03:36.450 --> 03:39.120
so really our prayers are with everyone.

03:39.120 --> 03:42.240
<v ->Yes, well, just wanted to acknowledge that,</v>

03:42.240 --> 03:44.160
before we talk about some very exciting

03:44.160 --> 03:46.950
and very positive and optimistic news.

03:46.950 --> 03:50.700
And you had a number of different headlines out of CES.

03:50.700 --> 03:54.540
You launched your 12 industry agent solutions

03:54.540 --> 03:57.030
to help accelerate AI.

03:57.030 --> 04:01.440
Walk us through what this news means, the AI Refinery.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.453
What is an AI Refinery?

04:04.560 --> 04:06.510
<v ->Like, I like to think of it really simply.</v>

04:06.510 --> 04:10.200
So just think about all of us, we each have a brain,

04:10.200 --> 04:13.260
and in our brain they work kind of the same way, right?

04:13.260 --> 04:17.643
They've got the same structure and then we learn.

04:18.510 --> 04:21.840
So if you think about what's happening today in companies,

04:21.840 --> 04:24.510
every company I work with is doing a lot of pilots.

04:24.510 --> 04:27.060
Like they've got a million things going on

04:27.060 --> 04:29.167
and most of the CEOs I talk to are like,

04:29.167 --> 04:30.600
"Okay, this is hard.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.270
It's not really giving me the value."

04:33.270 --> 04:37.800
And a big step that companies have not so much missed,

04:37.800 --> 04:41.130
but now need to move to because they were really excited

04:41.130 --> 04:44.550
is how do they create a brain that has the structure

04:44.550 --> 04:48.600
that works, whether you're in the US or you're in Europe,

04:48.600 --> 04:50.490
wherever you are in the company,

04:50.490 --> 04:54.240
and then allows this AI to learn and change your company?

04:54.240 --> 04:57.930
And what people are missing is the structure

04:57.930 --> 05:00.570
and the ease of then being able to plug in.

05:00.570 --> 05:05.310
And so what we did is we created the brain.

05:05.310 --> 05:07.290
And that brain has,

05:07.290 --> 05:10.020
think of it as a way of like you're onboarding a new model,

05:10.020 --> 05:13.200
you wanna use a model, it comes in, it gets certified,

05:13.200 --> 05:14.670
it goes out.

05:14.670 --> 05:17.640
All of your people don't ever have to know about that.

05:17.640 --> 05:20.970
But you know, as CEO, it's safe.

05:20.970 --> 05:23.880
It has these agents that everyone's talking about

05:23.880 --> 05:26.610
that are all trained in your data

05:26.610 --> 05:28.320
and they will work with everything.

05:28.320 --> 05:31.290
And all of this works with all of your technology.

05:31.290 --> 05:36.290
So it was built on NVIDIA technology as part of the brain,

05:37.650 --> 05:40.260
and Accenture and NVIDIA have a complete,

05:40.260 --> 05:41.820
everything must be interoperable,

05:41.820 --> 05:44.820
so you're not now creating some new tech debt,

05:44.820 --> 05:47.610
but it's allowing you to have the structure

05:47.610 --> 05:48.930
so that you can do the holy grail

05:48.930 --> 05:50.340
that every CEO complains about.

05:50.340 --> 05:54.750
How do I scale, how do I make it easy for my people,

05:54.750 --> 05:57.510
and how do I focus on how to use it,

05:57.510 --> 06:01.860
as opposed to the very, very complex landscape that,

06:01.860 --> 06:03.540
you know, everyone's trying to learn about it?

06:03.540 --> 06:05.430
And we kind of, we try to make that simple

06:05.430 --> 06:06.630
for every organization.

06:06.630 --> 06:08.220
So we're really excited.

06:08.220 --> 06:10.110
It was something that we've been developing

06:10.110 --> 06:14.100
based on all of the work and all of our work

06:14.100 --> 06:17.880
with all of our partners is to how do we help our partners

06:17.880 --> 06:20.550
and our clients get to value faster?

06:20.550 --> 06:23.010
<v ->So AI Refinery is sort of the platform,</v>

06:23.010 --> 06:25.290
and then these industry agent solutions

06:25.290 --> 06:29.040
are tools that will help each individual company

06:29.040 --> 06:32.010
build their agents faster, more efficiently,

06:32.010 --> 06:34.410
but they're still customizing them to their own data set

06:34.410 --> 06:37.320
and their own corporate information.

06:37.320 --> 06:39.150
<v ->Absolutely, so if you think about Accenture, right?</v>

06:39.150 --> 06:40.770
We're a $65 billion company.

06:40.770 --> 06:42.660
We work across every industry.

06:42.660 --> 06:44.430
We work with the leaders in every industry.

06:44.430 --> 06:46.170
And what we've done is we've said,

06:46.170 --> 06:48.030
well, we have this new great technology,

06:48.030 --> 06:50.190
but rather than have each of our clients

06:50.190 --> 06:52.290
have to make up every single part of it,

06:52.290 --> 06:54.405
we're industry experts, we're functional experts,

06:54.405 --> 06:58.080
we know the processes, if you're a refinery in the energy,

06:58.080 --> 07:00.480
if you are doing claims or insurance.

07:00.480 --> 07:03.247
And so we've taken all of our knowledge and said,

07:03.247 --> 07:05.250
"Here's your starter kit.

07:05.250 --> 07:08.970
Now take the starter kit and make it your own."

07:08.970 --> 07:12.480
And using that brain, that AI Refinery,

07:12.480 --> 07:17.160
we then tie it to your internal data, to your external data,

07:17.160 --> 07:19.470
and now you've been supercharged,

07:19.470 --> 07:23.010
not just with the technology, but with your own data.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.140
And you're gonna go a lot faster

07:25.140 --> 07:28.380
because you get to leverage all of our expertise.

07:28.380 --> 07:29.640
<v ->And so give me an example</v>

07:29.640 --> 07:31.950
of one of these AI agent solutions

07:31.950 --> 07:33.480
and how it might work for a particular industry.

07:33.480 --> 07:34.770
I mean you mentioned oil refinery,

07:34.770 --> 07:36.990
but walk us sort of through how it might work.

07:36.990 --> 07:40.830
<v ->So I'll use Accenture because as always, right,</v>

07:40.830 --> 07:42.420
we try to do this to ourself

07:42.420 --> 07:44.730
and one of my favorite and first examples

07:44.730 --> 07:48.420
where we used an agent at scale was in marketing.

07:48.420 --> 07:52.560
Now, as you might imagine at Accenture with 700,000 people,

07:52.560 --> 07:53.490
we like to talk

07:53.490 --> 07:55.830
and we like to come up with new thought leadership, right?

07:55.830 --> 07:57.720
So starting a couple of years ago,

07:57.720 --> 07:59.370
we got all of that cleaned up

07:59.370 --> 08:02.940
so we know what's happening any place in our company.

08:02.940 --> 08:06.810
But when we wanna put out a new thought leadership piece

08:06.810 --> 08:08.520
had a lot of steps, right?

08:08.520 --> 08:10.770
You had somebody who'd go out into the market

08:10.770 --> 08:13.260
and they'd look at, what are our competitors saying?

08:13.260 --> 08:16.320
You'd say, look at, what are our ecosystem partners saying?

08:16.320 --> 08:18.090
Look at what our clients are saying.

08:18.090 --> 08:19.500
Then there was quality reviews.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.840
And someone has to look at, hey, is this new,

08:21.840 --> 08:23.370
or is someone, have we said it someplace?

08:23.370 --> 08:25.260
We're really big, right?

08:25.260 --> 08:26.850
All of those were tied to people

08:26.850 --> 08:29.010
and sure we use technology to do search in that,

08:29.010 --> 08:29.843
but that was all.

08:29.843 --> 08:33.120
Now today, I've got that creative idea,

08:33.120 --> 08:38.120
I wanna make a campaign out of it, and literally in minutes,

08:38.250 --> 08:39.660
as that person who wants to,

08:39.660 --> 08:42.300
I wanna sit down and write something.

08:42.300 --> 08:44.280
I have a digital agent who's gone

08:44.280 --> 08:47.520
and looked at everything that's being said externally

08:47.520 --> 08:49.710
by the areas that I want,

08:49.710 --> 08:52.860
that tells me everything that I already have,

08:52.860 --> 08:54.720
so I don't write something new.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.940
And then, and this is one of my favorite parts,

08:56.940 --> 08:59.643
when I start writing, it judges me.

09:00.720 --> 09:03.960
It tells me, "Hey, that's not very differentiated

09:03.960 --> 09:06.480
from what the competitors have said,"

09:06.480 --> 09:08.970
or "That has absolutely no difference

09:08.970 --> 09:10.080
than that other asset."

09:10.080 --> 09:14.250
And then as I write it, I get instant feedback, right?

09:14.250 --> 09:18.930
This all, this used to be people and time,

09:18.930 --> 09:21.000
it literally would take weeks,

09:21.000 --> 09:23.880
and now the first thing takes minutes,

09:23.880 --> 09:27.270
and we are cutting about half of the time

09:27.270 --> 09:30.750
from the creative idea to getting it into the market.

09:30.750 --> 09:33.960
<v ->So massive efficiency and more accuracy?</v>

09:33.960 --> 09:36.180
<v ->Much better quality, and, you know,</v>

09:36.180 --> 09:39.450
I can't afford to have every single person

09:39.450 --> 09:41.340
be the absolute best editor,

09:41.340 --> 09:44.010
to be the absolute best person who understands,

09:44.010 --> 09:45.030
you know, what's going on.

09:45.030 --> 09:48.210
And what this allows me to do is the quality is,

09:48.210 --> 09:50.250
you know, we'd get there in the end,

09:50.250 --> 09:51.943
but we're getting there like, you know,

09:51.943 --> 09:53.460
I call it first time right,

09:53.460 --> 09:56.670
because we're getting the highest quality inputs

09:56.670 --> 09:58.200
early in the process.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.930
Now we had to massively change how we work.

10:00.930 --> 10:03.330
And like when we go back to think about that brain, right,

10:03.330 --> 10:06.570
and that we're learning, the other thing we've had to do

10:06.570 --> 10:10.620
is change the structure of how we operate the company.

10:10.620 --> 10:14.400
Because all of that used to be a sequential process,

10:14.400 --> 10:16.140
and then you'd have these loops.

10:16.140 --> 10:18.007
Now, we had to sit back and say,

10:18.007 --> 10:20.490
"Well what's the new creative process

10:20.490 --> 10:21.420
when this is happening,

10:21.420 --> 10:24.420
and when do we have the human in the loop?

10:24.420 --> 10:26.610
And how do we now actually get people

10:26.610 --> 10:28.020
to change the way they do it?"

10:28.020 --> 10:30.557
And not by the way, go check themselves, right,

10:30.557 --> 10:32.790
'cause you have to build trust.

10:32.790 --> 10:34.560
And one of the most important things,

10:34.560 --> 10:36.030
you know, we just put out our tech vision

10:36.030 --> 10:37.083
that we talk a lot about is trust,

10:37.083 --> 10:38.760
<v Julia>Yeah.</v>
<v ->because if you have</v>

10:38.760 --> 10:42.783
this great technology and people don't use it,

10:43.890 --> 10:45.030
first of all it won't learn,

10:45.030 --> 10:47.490
so it won't get better and it won't create value,

10:47.490 --> 10:49.590
but it's also not, there's no return on your investment.

10:49.590 --> 10:51.660
<v ->So you just segued to my next question,</v>

10:51.660 --> 10:53.340
which is about this concept of trust.

10:53.340 --> 10:55.710
I mean, in your Accenture Technology Vision report,

10:55.710 --> 10:59.610
it's the 25th annual one, which is kind of amazing

10:59.610 --> 11:01.140
if you think about how much the technology world

11:01.140 --> 11:03.900
has changed in the past two and a half decades,

11:03.900 --> 11:06.450
but this idea of trust is really essential

11:06.450 --> 11:11.100
to the future of AI, but it's not just trust of people

11:11.100 --> 11:12.870
believing that it's gonna work.

11:12.870 --> 11:14.850
Walk us through sort of the nuances of that

11:14.850 --> 11:17.280
and how companies here should be thinking

11:17.280 --> 11:19.443
about building that trust.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.020
<v ->It's such an important question,</v>

11:22.020 --> 11:24.750
and I think part of what's been missing is sort of,

11:24.750 --> 11:27.063
there's two dimensions to the trust.

11:28.050 --> 11:32.580
One dimension, as you said, is does it actually work, right?

11:32.580 --> 11:37.020
And that trust comes from using it.

11:37.020 --> 11:39.240
And then as you use it, by the way,

11:39.240 --> 11:42.060
it doesn't work at the beginning, it has to learn and that.

11:42.060 --> 11:45.360
And so there's a defined way of building that trust, right?

11:45.360 --> 11:46.830
If you get people to learn it, et cetera,

11:46.830 --> 11:49.020
they can see that it works.

11:49.020 --> 11:51.240
Now you have to have change management,

11:51.240 --> 11:52.950
you have to build it in,

11:52.950 --> 11:56.010
but that's in some ways the easiest part of trust.

11:56.010 --> 11:58.083
It's an important step, but it's important.

11:58.083 --> 12:03.083
It's the emotional side of trust that is equally important,

12:04.230 --> 12:05.790
and that's the trust where it says,

12:05.790 --> 12:08.373
wait a minute, is this gonna take my job?

12:10.200 --> 12:14.160
You know, what's the future gonna look like, right?

12:14.160 --> 12:15.960
Is it gonna hurt parts of our business?

12:15.960 --> 12:19.710
It's the part that people get emotionally worried about.

12:19.710 --> 12:21.330
Are my kids gonna have a job?

12:21.330 --> 12:24.720
I mean, I travel and talk to people all over the world,

12:24.720 --> 12:26.910
and a lot of times in those casual conversations

12:26.910 --> 12:27.870
when I'm with companies,

12:27.870 --> 12:30.547
those are the things they kind of ask me on the side,

12:30.547 --> 12:32.907
"Julie, what should my kids study?"

12:34.110 --> 12:39.110
And that affects whether you're using it and embracing it.

12:40.020 --> 12:43.620
And so one of the things that we do is really recommend,

12:43.620 --> 12:46.440
and I talk to a lot of CEOs and CHRO's

12:46.440 --> 12:48.240
as you're thinking it is that

12:48.240 --> 12:52.860
it's important as you think about like change and adoption,

12:52.860 --> 12:55.800
that you recognize both components.

12:55.800 --> 12:59.070
One is about learning and practice.

12:59.070 --> 13:02.550
The other emotional is about transparency.

13:02.550 --> 13:04.710
It's about empathy, right?

13:04.710 --> 13:08.640
It's also, it's very much about being direct as well.

13:08.640 --> 13:11.670
If you get those two pieces right,

13:11.670 --> 13:14.220
you will accelerate your ability

13:14.220 --> 13:16.080
to really reinvent what you're doing,

13:16.080 --> 13:19.680
and instead of it sort of being a pull, right,

13:19.680 --> 13:21.450
you really open up.

13:21.450 --> 13:24.030
And I think people want this.

13:24.030 --> 13:25.200
I mean, we're all using it.

13:25.200 --> 13:28.620
I was cracking up because my fifth grade niece

13:28.620 --> 13:32.850
just sent all these AI avatars of our whole family.

13:32.850 --> 13:35.010
She's in fifth grade, like, you know,

13:35.010 --> 13:37.920
and she sent it on her grandmother's phone,

13:37.920 --> 13:39.420
and of course the grandmother's like thinking,

13:39.420 --> 13:40.253
this is great.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.330
Like this is a part of our life.

13:42.330 --> 13:43.807
It's not like you go to work and you say,

13:43.807 --> 13:44.970
"Well, I don't want AI there.

13:44.970 --> 13:47.340
I only want it at home."

13:47.340 --> 13:50.670
But it's incumbent on us as leaders

13:50.670 --> 13:53.820
to actually bring people along that journey.

13:53.820 --> 13:55.770
And at Accenture we have leadership essentials,

13:55.770 --> 13:58.710
like how, you know, this is what it takes to be a leader.

13:58.710 --> 14:03.710
And one of the most important is the courage to change

14:04.020 --> 14:08.490
and the ability to bring people along the journey.

14:08.490 --> 14:10.140
Both are important.

14:10.140 --> 14:14.220
You have to invest as a company and a leader.

14:14.220 --> 14:17.700
You owe it to your people to work on that piece.

14:17.700 --> 14:20.520
<v ->So that leads directly to this question of the workforce</v>

14:20.520 --> 14:23.310
and those concerns you hear from people all over the world,

14:23.310 --> 14:26.370
is this AI going to be taking my jobs?

14:26.370 --> 14:29.370
And if it's not gonna be taking someone's job,

14:29.370 --> 14:30.270
what do they need to do

14:30.270 --> 14:33.330
to make sure that they're still contributing

14:33.330 --> 14:35.520
and is what they do have to be different,

14:35.520 --> 14:36.690
have to be evolved?

14:36.690 --> 14:39.420
So one thing I think is so interesting about Accenture

14:39.420 --> 14:42.900
is as you are innovating and disrupting your own business

14:42.900 --> 14:45.600
and deploying all these technologies on your own business,

14:45.600 --> 14:46.650
you're advising companies

14:46.650 --> 14:50.103
across every single different sector on how to do the same.

14:50.940 --> 14:54.120
What are the workforce implications for your business,

14:54.120 --> 14:56.283
but also across industries?

14:57.930 --> 15:00.300
<v ->If you're only to remember one thing</v>

15:00.300 --> 15:02.400
about workforce implications, and again,

15:02.400 --> 15:05.140
I'm always the biases like on being practical

15:06.030 --> 15:11.030
is AI changes the skills that your leaders need.

15:12.150 --> 15:13.750
So I'm gonna start with leaders.

15:14.760 --> 15:19.560
And what I mean by that is if AI can reinvent

15:19.560 --> 15:21.330
like how you're going to market

15:21.330 --> 15:23.460
or how you're running finance,

15:23.460 --> 15:25.890
then everything you know about process

15:25.890 --> 15:27.720
and you have to actually understand,

15:27.720 --> 15:30.000
well, what can the technology do

15:30.000 --> 15:32.193
in order to now reinvent it?

15:33.840 --> 15:35.430
Most of us, almost all of us,

15:35.430 --> 15:37.650
didn't grow up with something called gen AI

15:37.650 --> 15:42.650
or gen tech architecture, so now skill is,

15:43.860 --> 15:45.990
you must understand this technology.

15:45.990 --> 15:46.983
That's a skill.

15:48.120 --> 15:52.620
And so you have to look at all of the job descriptions

15:52.620 --> 15:55.230
and say of the skills they need,

15:55.230 --> 15:56.400
this is one of those skills.

15:56.400 --> 15:57.780
And then you have to say,

15:57.780 --> 16:00.390
and how are they gonna get it, right?

16:00.390 --> 16:02.640
We've been talking about, and one of my most passionate,

16:02.640 --> 16:06.210
you know, things is around skills-based human resources.

16:06.210 --> 16:08.610
So about five years ago,

16:08.610 --> 16:11.910
we built our own database of all of our skills.

16:11.910 --> 16:13.920
So I have 780,000 people

16:13.920 --> 16:16.290
and I have all of their skills in a database.

16:16.290 --> 16:18.870
I can actually run an algorithm to say,

16:18.870 --> 16:20.490
hey, I need some more cloud people.

16:20.490 --> 16:23.700
Who could be upskilled in 20 hours, right?

16:23.700 --> 16:25.590
But why do I care so much about it?

16:25.590 --> 16:26.790
Is it goes back to,

16:26.790 --> 16:28.470
how are we gonna invest in our people

16:28.470 --> 16:29.940
to bring them along the journey?

16:29.940 --> 16:31.860
If you don't understand, first of all,

16:31.860 --> 16:33.390
what skills are needed to do the job

16:33.390 --> 16:35.190
and then how they're changing it,

16:35.190 --> 16:37.620
you won't be able to give them the education and training

16:37.620 --> 16:38.880
to allow them to do it.

16:38.880 --> 16:40.560
Which means you won't get the value,

16:40.560 --> 16:44.550
but it also means they can't rise to the occasion.

16:44.550 --> 16:46.440
And so we're doing that right now.

16:46.440 --> 16:47.610
The first thing we did

16:47.610 --> 16:50.100
when Jenny and I hit about two years earlier,

16:50.100 --> 16:51.180
we were already experimenting,

16:51.180 --> 16:54.210
the very first thing we did was we went to our technology,

16:54.210 --> 16:56.820
all of our main roles, and we said,

16:56.820 --> 17:00.450
which of the roles are affected in the different skills,

17:00.450 --> 17:01.710
and what are the brand new roles?

17:01.710 --> 17:04.230
Like prompt engineering didn't exist, right?

17:04.230 --> 17:06.360
And now we're systematically looking

17:06.360 --> 17:11.250
at every role at Accenture and saying, what are the skills,

17:11.250 --> 17:13.110
and then how are we gonna give it to them?

17:13.110 --> 17:16.410
<v ->But given that there are these additional efficiencies,</v>

17:16.410 --> 17:17.370
greater accuracy

17:17.370 --> 17:20.340
without having humans double checking things,

17:20.340 --> 17:23.370
will we see fundamentally that you need fewer people

17:23.370 --> 17:24.480
to do each job?

17:24.480 --> 17:26.250
Is that what it's gonna come down to,

17:26.250 --> 17:27.540
not just in your industry,

17:27.540 --> 17:29.850
but in in all these other industries as well?

17:29.850 --> 17:31.980
Will we have one paralegal

17:31.980 --> 17:34.593
be able to do the work of 20 paralegals?

17:35.430 --> 17:38.070
Are workforce reductions inevitable?

17:38.070 --> 17:41.943
<v ->Absolutely, this just to be clear.</v>

17:43.140 --> 17:46.890
AI does things that we have people,

17:46.890 --> 17:49.320
mostly it's tasks though.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.970
One of the biggest complaints they actually have

17:50.970 --> 17:53.287
is that people, CEOs will say,

17:53.287 --> 17:56.007
"I'm using all this AI and I don't have less people,"

17:57.300 --> 18:00.210
and that's because they haven't reimagined the work.

18:00.210 --> 18:02.730
They've just taken some of the tasks.

18:02.730 --> 18:05.610
<v ->But do you think they will end up doing mass layoffs?</v>

18:05.610 --> 18:06.750
I mean, what is the?
<v ->No,</v>

18:06.750 --> 18:08.670
the reason I don't think they'll end up doing massive,

18:08.670 --> 18:10.140
so will there be a reduction?

18:10.140 --> 18:12.750
Yes, there should be.

18:12.750 --> 18:14.790
This goes back to skills and training,

18:14.790 --> 18:19.320
but it opens up all these new opportunities for the company.

18:19.320 --> 18:23.430
And so that's where you have to get the balance, right?

18:23.430 --> 18:28.020
Every stage of technology, think about basic automation.

18:28.020 --> 18:31.680
Back in 2015, we put out our first platform called myWizard.

18:31.680 --> 18:36.680
We used to have tens of thousands of people doing testing,

18:38.520 --> 18:41.193
and that platform automated most of them away.

18:42.150 --> 18:46.380
We upskilled them and they're doing different things, right?

18:46.380 --> 18:49.623
We also have new businesses we didn't have in 2015.

18:50.490 --> 18:55.490
So you can't stop, each wave of technology can't stop.

18:55.980 --> 18:58.290
The question is,

18:58.290 --> 19:01.890
do you have the ability to use the technology

19:01.890 --> 19:03.960
to build the new businesses,

19:03.960 --> 19:05.880
and do you have the ability to re-skill,

19:05.880 --> 19:08.790
but not everybody's gonna be re-skilled, right?

19:08.790 --> 19:09.623
We know that.

19:09.623 --> 19:12.840
That's why public and private partnerships are so important.

19:12.840 --> 19:15.600
That's why we have to think about K through 12 education.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.640
We have to think about college education.

19:17.640 --> 19:21.390
And we as companies need to be able to invest.

19:21.390 --> 19:25.200
We launched a business last year called LearnVantage,

19:25.200 --> 19:27.540
which provides upskilling.

19:27.540 --> 19:30.690
We spend about 1,000,000,000 a year on it today.

19:30.690 --> 19:33.420
And a lot of our clients, once this AI hit,

19:33.420 --> 19:35.460
were really asking us to help them.

19:35.460 --> 19:37.440
So we launched the business.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.650
I viewed that as much about my purpose

19:40.650 --> 19:43.560
to deliver on the promise of technology and human ingenuity

19:43.560 --> 19:46.830
because we have to focus as companies now

19:46.830 --> 19:48.690
on the human ingenuity part.

19:48.690 --> 19:50.610
But anyone that said like,

19:50.610 --> 19:54.870
of course AI is going to reduce some jobs,

19:54.870 --> 19:57.480
and now the idea is, and what are they gonna create?

19:57.480 --> 19:58.770
There are jobs that don't exist,

19:58.770 --> 20:03.000
but there's also entirely new business models

20:03.000 --> 20:05.850
that can do hyper-personalization, for example,

20:05.850 --> 20:09.000
that opens a whole new way of working.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.860
We're working with clients now where the idea is at scale,

20:13.860 --> 20:18.000
how do you be able to interact with a product,

20:18.000 --> 20:22.860
create a whole campaign for a client to draw something new?

20:22.860 --> 20:25.590
Those are new skills for marketing, right?

20:25.590 --> 20:27.420
They're not gonna do the same repetitive stuff,

20:27.420 --> 20:30.510
but now they're interacting differently, right?

20:30.510 --> 20:32.220
We're working, if you think about

20:32.220 --> 20:34.950
some of the stuff we're doing, like in the energy piece,

20:34.950 --> 20:36.840
on the one hand we're driving efficiencies.

20:36.840 --> 20:40.080
Those same companies are then turning and using that money

20:40.080 --> 20:42.810
to invest in doing more in renewables.

20:42.810 --> 20:43.800
And they're taking people

20:43.800 --> 20:45.960
that they used to take more time

20:45.960 --> 20:47.850
in the refinery doing the turnaround,

20:47.850 --> 20:48.683
and now they're saying,

20:48.683 --> 20:50.550
okay, now we want you to come over here

20:50.550 --> 20:52.320
and we're training, right?

20:52.320 --> 20:54.930
It goes back to being quite intentional

20:54.930 --> 20:57.570
and strategic about your talent.

20:57.570 --> 20:59.820
<v ->Yeah, and it's interesting because it seems like</v>

20:59.820 --> 21:01.770
we know where some of these jobs will be lost,

21:01.770 --> 21:04.500
but all the future jobs will be created.

21:04.500 --> 21:05.700
Those are maybe in industries

21:05.700 --> 21:07.620
we're just starting to see emerge.

21:07.620 --> 21:08.453
Since I'm asking you

21:08.453 --> 21:11.550
about all the the negative potential implications

21:11.550 --> 21:14.550
of technologies like AI, I wanna talk about security,

21:14.550 --> 21:18.810
cybersecurity, data privacy, intellectual property security.

21:18.810 --> 21:20.670
How should the companies here,

21:20.670 --> 21:22.770
and how do you advise your clients

21:22.770 --> 21:25.410
to think about security in a different way,

21:25.410 --> 21:28.020
given just how much data is being collected

21:28.020 --> 21:30.360
and deployed through AI?

21:30.360 --> 21:33.210
<v ->Well, first of all, AI is one of the best tools</v>

21:33.210 --> 21:35.130
to make us all more secure.

21:35.130 --> 21:36.990
And you know,

21:36.990 --> 21:39.570
that's one of the most important things to understand

21:39.570 --> 21:42.690
is that a lot of the incidents around security

21:42.690 --> 21:45.930
come from people making mistakes, right?

21:45.930 --> 21:47.910
It's comes from human error, still,

21:47.910 --> 21:49.860
it's the number one cause, right?

21:49.860 --> 21:53.400
AI is actually gonna help protect data,

21:53.400 --> 21:55.170
it's gonna protect the enterprise.

21:55.170 --> 21:56.970
And that's probably the most important,

21:56.970 --> 21:59.310
you know, thing to walk away from on security

21:59.310 --> 22:03.150
is the question that I tell CEOs to ask is,

22:03.150 --> 22:08.150
how am I using the AI to now be more secure?

22:08.610 --> 22:13.610
And the idea of, you know, digital, the internet, all that,

22:14.130 --> 22:17.130
it's been expanding, that risk has been expanding.

22:17.130 --> 22:19.170
The biggest thing that's changed

22:19.170 --> 22:22.170
with the advent of accessible AI in this way

22:22.170 --> 22:27.170
is now we have much better tools than we did two years ago

22:27.450 --> 22:28.800
to help protect it.

22:28.800 --> 22:31.113
<v ->And do you think we'll see AI regulation?</v>

22:32.130 --> 22:32.963
<v ->I hope so.</v>

22:32.963 --> 22:35.820
<v ->And what kind of AI regulation would you like to see</v>

22:35.820 --> 22:36.960
and what type of regulation

22:36.960 --> 22:39.000
do you think could be detrimental?

22:39.000 --> 22:41.340
<v ->Well, I think for example, in the US,</v>

22:41.340 --> 22:44.280
we've taken a very much of a perspective

22:44.280 --> 22:46.170
of innovation first, right?

22:46.170 --> 22:49.350
So how do you do the innovative while doing the safeguards?

22:49.350 --> 22:52.170
Why do I say I hope so?

22:52.170 --> 22:55.650
Because there's certain things like around data privacy

22:55.650 --> 22:57.540
where you want consistency,

22:57.540 --> 23:01.470
which enables to the innovation, right?

23:01.470 --> 23:05.040
So no one, if you, you know,

23:05.040 --> 23:07.770
we're the partners with every ecosystem partner, right?

23:07.770 --> 23:09.810
I don't know a single ecosystem partner

23:09.810 --> 23:12.720
who says there should be no regulation.

23:12.720 --> 23:16.560
In fact, what they ask for is consistent regulations.

23:16.560 --> 23:19.177
So in the US, that means let's not have something different

23:19.177 --> 23:21.330
in every state.
<v Julia>The patchwork</v>

23:21.330 --> 23:22.163
is always a nightmare.
<v ->Right?</v>

23:22.163 --> 23:24.390
But also as global companies,

23:24.390 --> 23:27.570
let's try to be as interoperable as possible,

23:27.570 --> 23:29.980
so that you're not spending lots of money

23:31.200 --> 23:34.680
complying with different regulations which are different,

23:34.680 --> 23:37.380
but not in kind like, not really in kind, right?

23:37.380 --> 23:40.920
So we think regulation is really important

23:40.920 --> 23:43.950
and the principle is balancing innovation

23:43.950 --> 23:45.660
with regulation and protection.

23:45.660 --> 23:47.940
<v ->One of the most exciting things I've seen here at CES</v>

23:47.940 --> 23:49.560
are these autonomous robots,

23:49.560 --> 23:51.300
and I know you have a big partnership

23:51.300 --> 23:53.400
among your many announcements here,

23:53.400 --> 23:55.890
your partnership with NVIDIA and KION group

23:55.890 --> 23:59.610
to create these new AI powered digital twins,

23:59.610 --> 24:03.000
which aim to really transform warehouses.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.500
For those of us here

24:04.500 --> 24:06.420
who haven't gotten to see them in action

24:06.420 --> 24:08.130
or seen these, this announcement yet,

24:08.130 --> 24:09.030
walk us through what this means

24:09.030 --> 24:11.370
and why you think this is so meaningful.

24:11.370 --> 24:14.100
<v ->Well, so there's two things to remember.</v>

24:14.100 --> 24:17.490
50% and physical AI.

24:17.490 --> 24:22.380
So we created a warehouse solution with KION and NVIDIA.

24:22.380 --> 24:25.860
And so think about most warehouses today, right,

24:25.860 --> 24:29.640
still have lots of people, forklifts, you're running around,

24:29.640 --> 24:31.980
and we believe this solution

24:31.980 --> 24:34.380
will reduce manual labor by 50%,

24:34.380 --> 24:38.070
which is huge because in many countries in the world,

24:38.070 --> 24:39.720
you cannot get enough manual labor.

24:39.720 --> 24:42.750
Like there is a shortage of people for these jobs.

24:42.750 --> 24:47.040
It'll also reduce operating costs by 50% we believe,

24:47.040 --> 24:49.980
and planning and optimization by 50%.

24:49.980 --> 24:53.220
So those are real tangible business outcomes.

24:53.220 --> 24:56.430
But it's also super exciting because it's the first

24:56.430 --> 24:59.760
like really huge scale use of physical AI.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.290
In fact, I was with Jensen yesterday

25:01.290 --> 25:03.630
and we were doing an interview and you know,

25:03.630 --> 25:05.760
he's like, "This is the first of its kind,"

25:05.760 --> 25:10.380
and it's using these, the capabilities of AI,

25:10.380 --> 25:13.500
but in the physical world, right,

25:13.500 --> 25:18.420
which allows you to, you know, it senses gravity and objects

25:18.420 --> 25:23.310
and continuously learning, so safety is much better.

25:23.310 --> 25:24.300
You can, and it, you know,

25:24.300 --> 25:25.800
it's actually amazing as I dug into it,

25:25.800 --> 25:28.230
I had no idea actually how,

25:28.230 --> 25:29.760
I always talk about supply chain

25:29.760 --> 25:31.320
being the next digital frontier,

25:31.320 --> 25:32.670
but when you really get into it,

25:32.670 --> 25:35.640
like it's so not automated today, right?

25:35.640 --> 25:38.130
And yet, you know, preparing for Black Friday

25:38.130 --> 25:40.740
is very, very different from a slow summer period,

25:40.740 --> 25:43.560
and all of that is still so manual.

25:43.560 --> 25:47.850
So real tangible outcomes,

25:47.850 --> 25:52.350
breakthroughs in how to bring AI to the physical world.

25:52.350 --> 25:54.270
And so it's quite exciting.

25:54.270 --> 25:55.350
<v ->Yeah and it's interesting,</v>

25:55.350 --> 25:57.390
so it seems like this idea of physical AI,

25:57.390 --> 25:59.490
this is gonna be really what we hear more and more about

25:59.490 --> 26:01.470
after the past few years were dominated

26:01.470 --> 26:03.180
more by the AI software.

26:03.180 --> 26:05.430
Is this something you're watching being deployed more

26:05.430 --> 26:06.930
on the physical AI level?

26:06.930 --> 26:09.270
<v ->Yeah, in fact, if, I hope you all read our tech vision,</v>

26:09.270 --> 26:11.520
it is our 25th anniversary

26:11.520 --> 26:14.460
and one of the big trends we talk about are robotics,

26:14.460 --> 26:16.080
which I think are super exciting.

26:16.080 --> 26:17.640
And if you're walking the floor, you've seen,

26:17.640 --> 26:19.560
there's so many different manifestations

26:19.560 --> 26:20.880
in health and wellness.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.850
I mean, it's really incredible what's happening there,

26:23.850 --> 26:27.960
and it opens up a whole new way of really helping society

26:27.960 --> 26:28.793
and businesses,

26:28.793 --> 26:30.930
so robotics is something absolutely to watch.

26:30.930 --> 26:35.100
There's a lot of work still to be done, but it's, you know,

26:35.100 --> 26:38.280
really a breakthrough moment for physical AI.

26:38.280 --> 26:39.930
<v ->Yeah, I think this will be,</v>

26:39.930 --> 26:42.540
this year's CES will be the turning point for that.

26:42.540 --> 26:45.360
Before we're out of time, I wanna take a step back

26:45.360 --> 26:48.510
and have you reflect a little bit on what you have learned

26:48.510 --> 26:51.690
by being able to work across all these different industries.

26:51.690 --> 26:53.550
And one thing that I find so fascinating

26:53.550 --> 26:55.800
is that you're able to take these learnings

26:55.800 --> 26:57.300
from the retail space

26:57.300 --> 27:00.268
and figure out what will be valuable to something

27:00.268 --> 27:04.110
in a different sector, looking at how AI has been deployed

27:04.110 --> 27:05.880
and tech systems have been deployed

27:05.880 --> 27:07.620
across all of these different industries

27:07.620 --> 27:09.120
that Accenture works with,

27:09.120 --> 27:12.480
are there certain best practices or commonalities

27:12.480 --> 27:14.070
that you were surprised to find

27:14.070 --> 27:16.083
have a sort of a universal value?

27:17.995 --> 27:20.610
<v ->I guess I would say I'm not surprised,</v>

27:20.610 --> 27:22.980
and more than industries, you know,

27:22.980 --> 27:26.340
we've always talked about people, process, technology.

27:26.340 --> 27:29.490
I think it's now people, process, technology, and data.

27:29.490 --> 27:32.430
And when I look across the industries,

27:32.430 --> 27:36.360
creating value comes down to those things.

27:36.360 --> 27:38.310
And I think that whoever came up

27:38.310 --> 27:40.140
with the people, process, technology,

27:40.140 --> 27:42.000
you know, that we've always talked about

27:42.000 --> 27:44.764
was very deliberate in putting people first, right?

27:44.764 --> 27:48.960
And I think, you know, as we move forward,

27:48.960 --> 27:51.600
it does matter looking back, right,

27:51.600 --> 27:56.600
is that we have always succeeded when we start with people

27:56.820 --> 28:01.230
and we understand how people will experience things

28:01.230 --> 28:04.260
because the best idea, as I used to call it,

28:04.260 --> 28:07.140
you know, everything looks good in a PowerPoint,

28:07.140 --> 28:10.860
and you actually go take it, start with people,

28:10.860 --> 28:15.860
and then process comes next because the best technology,

28:15.870 --> 28:19.680
if you can't actually change the way you work,

28:19.680 --> 28:22.920
the technology can be super cool,

28:22.920 --> 28:25.380
but it'll never create value.

28:25.380 --> 28:28.470
And then data is the thing that most of us missed

28:28.470 --> 28:29.630
over the years, right?

28:29.630 --> 28:31.830
It was always the one that's super expensive,

28:31.830 --> 28:33.840
people didn't wanna fix it, right,

28:33.840 --> 28:38.070
and it's something that now everybody pays attention to.

28:38.070 --> 28:41.340
So those are the just sort of the basics of like,

28:41.340 --> 28:43.080
as you sort of think about,

28:43.080 --> 28:44.850
you know, wherever you are in the world,

28:44.850 --> 28:46.800
whatever you do as a leader,

28:46.800 --> 28:48.600
when you think about am I using AI,

28:48.600 --> 28:50.130
just kind of grounding yourselves

28:50.130 --> 28:53.160
in things that actually we've known for years,

28:53.160 --> 28:57.120
and it really doesn't matter which industry you're in.

28:57.120 --> 28:58.050
The last thing I'd just say

28:58.050 --> 29:01.050
is like just kind of you as a person, right,

29:01.050 --> 29:04.983
is it's a really exciting time.

29:06.250 --> 29:08.280
It can also feel like a scary time,

29:08.280 --> 29:11.640
and so I just wanna maybe share it as we close.

29:11.640 --> 29:14.070
I have this little thing in my mud room,

29:14.070 --> 29:17.220
I live in the DC area, that my husband hung up,

29:17.220 --> 29:18.540
and he hung it up, right,

29:18.540 --> 29:21.453
the last couple years before I became the global CEO.

29:22.530 --> 29:25.590
It says, he likes really cheesy things, by the way,

29:25.590 --> 29:27.750
I'm just gonna give you that up front,

29:27.750 --> 29:30.000
but he won in this case 'cause it's super cheesy

29:30.000 --> 29:32.610
and I didn't wanna hang it, but I live by it now.

29:32.610 --> 29:36.630
It says, "If your dreams don't scare you,

29:36.630 --> 29:38.520
they're not big enough.

29:38.520 --> 29:41.670
If your dreams don't scare you, they're not big enough."

29:41.670 --> 29:44.970
And it's a personal motto of mine

29:44.970 --> 29:46.560
as a leader and as a person,

29:46.560 --> 29:49.890
because, you know, when I'm feeling like,

29:49.890 --> 29:51.960
wow, like this is big and it's different,

29:51.960 --> 29:56.960
then I know I'm pushing my organization and myself.

29:57.090 --> 29:58.620
If you go to work every day

29:58.620 --> 30:00.360
and you never feel a little like,

30:00.360 --> 30:02.760
wow, can we really pull this off?

30:02.760 --> 30:06.990
Then most likely someone is passing you by, right?

30:06.990 --> 30:11.040
And as an individual, we are all gonna have to change.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.560
I, you know, I'm changing the whole way I work

30:13.560 --> 30:15.750
and integrating AI and, you know,

30:15.750 --> 30:17.187
it sometimes it feels uncomfortable and like,

30:17.187 --> 30:19.650
you know, am I getting it right?

30:19.650 --> 30:22.020
But that's where you're dreaming big enough.

30:22.020 --> 30:24.180
You're not gonna wake up, right,

30:24.180 --> 30:27.240
and find yourself individually passed by.

30:27.240 --> 30:28.650
So I wanted to share that with you

30:28.650 --> 30:32.070
'cause it's something that does inspire me

30:32.070 --> 30:34.170
on those moments when you sort of look at it

30:34.170 --> 30:36.210
and you come to a place, CES, and you think like,

30:36.210 --> 30:39.570
wow, the amount of change is tremendous.

30:39.570 --> 30:41.340
<v ->And you're very optimistic.</v>

30:41.340 --> 30:42.840
<v ->I'm hugely optimistic.</v>

30:42.840 --> 30:47.840
I feel so privileged to lead right now

30:48.420 --> 30:51.780
because the opportunities with AI,

30:51.780 --> 30:53.130
and we didn't even really talk about

30:53.130 --> 30:54.990
like some of the amazing things that are happening

30:54.990 --> 30:56.520
with drug discovery.

30:56.520 --> 30:57.480
If you read our tech division,

30:57.480 --> 31:00.480
we talk about a company that's like creating drugs now

31:00.480 --> 31:04.680
in half the time you know what we can do for safety,

31:04.680 --> 31:06.780
what we can do to open up new things.

31:06.780 --> 31:08.430
I think it's amazing.

31:08.430 --> 31:12.513
And so we've gotta be disciplined, right, that structure,

31:13.530 --> 31:17.100
and we've gotta dream big to make sure

31:17.100 --> 31:22.100
that we use this tremendous technology to benefit everyone.

31:22.170 --> 31:24.030
<v ->Well that is the perfect note to end on.</v>

31:24.030 --> 31:25.710
Julie Sweet CEO of Accenture Global,

31:25.710 --> 31:26.577
thank you so much

31:26.577 --> 31:27.410
for joining us.
<v ->Thank you so much.</v>

31:27.410 --> 31:28.923
Thanks Julia.
<v Julia>Thank you.</v>

31:28.923 --> 31:33.923
(audience applauds)
(upbeat music)
