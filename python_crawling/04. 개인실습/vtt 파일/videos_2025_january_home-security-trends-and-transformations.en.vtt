00:00.149 --> 00:02.732
(bright music)

2
00:11.700 --> 00:14.160
<v Elizabeth>Thank you all for joining us</v>

3
00:14.160 --> 00:16.470
for the sessions this afternoon,

4
00:16.470 --> 00:19.710
and one of our favorite topics at Parks Associates,

5
00:19.710 --> 00:22.950
really talking about the home security space.

6
00:22.950 --> 00:25.920
And we have a great session focused on

7
00:25.920 --> 00:28.230
the trends and transformation.

8
00:28.230 --> 00:30.453
But I don't think my clicker is working.

9
00:34.170 --> 00:35.550
Maybe, oh, there we go.

10
00:35.550 --> 00:37.890
Okay, so just a quick reminder.

11
00:37.890 --> 00:41.340
We are hosting a networking reception this evening

12
00:41.340 --> 00:42.750
at Treasure Island.

13
00:42.750 --> 00:43.740
If you'd like to join us

14
00:43.740 --> 00:47.220
in the Treasure Island Ballroom at 5:30.

15
00:47.220 --> 00:52.140
And again, a huge shout out to our sponsors of the event.

16
00:52.140 --> 00:53.010
Without their support,

17
00:53.010 --> 00:55.020
we wouldn't be hosting Connections Summit.

18
00:55.020 --> 00:58.200
This is our 19th year to partner with CTA

19
00:58.200 --> 01:00.990
for this conference.

20
01:00.990 --> 01:02.130
I'm Elizabeth Parks,

21
01:02.130 --> 01:04.830
I'm the president and CMO of Parks Associates,

22
01:04.830 --> 01:09.420
and I really welcome you to these sessions today

23
01:09.420 --> 01:11.400
to understand more about what's happening

24
01:11.400 --> 01:13.323
in the home security space.

25
01:15.330 --> 01:17.460
Just a few things that we're gonna be talking about,

26
01:17.460 --> 01:21.390
the reality of devices versus systems,

27
01:21.390 --> 01:24.690
how the installation is being simplified

28
01:24.690 --> 01:27.240
for security solutions

29
01:27.240 --> 01:31.980
and the impact of artificial intelligence on the experience,

30
01:31.980 --> 01:34.950
as well as where is the next stream of revenue.

31
01:34.950 --> 01:38.010
So big topics that we're gonna focus on.

32
01:38.010 --> 01:41.250
I'm gonna start here and just show a couple of slides,

33
01:41.250 --> 01:43.470
so you all can see a little bit more

34
01:43.470 --> 01:45.960
about the different players in the market

35
01:45.960 --> 01:49.560
and the solutions that they're offering.

36
01:49.560 --> 01:54.030
The market has expanded beyond just security systems,

37
01:54.030 --> 01:57.660
and now we are looking at devices in play

38
01:57.660 --> 01:59.430
with attached services.

39
01:59.430 --> 02:04.230
We also have self-monitoring as a possibility,

40
02:04.230 --> 02:07.710
there's paid security services without pro-monitoring,

41
02:07.710 --> 02:11.520
and there's also the installation side of the business

42
02:11.520 --> 02:14.193
with DIY and self-install.

43
02:15.630 --> 02:20.220
Currently 32% of all households in the United States,

44
02:20.220 --> 02:22.470
or about 40 million households are paying

45
02:22.470 --> 02:26.670
for some kind of security service.

46
02:26.670 --> 02:28.500
And if you were to break that up,

47
02:28.500 --> 02:33.500
you'd see that's 25% are attached to a security system.

48
02:33.630 --> 02:38.010
7% of these services attached to a security device.

49
02:38.010 --> 02:40.350
And this is a pretty important point

50
02:40.350 --> 02:42.360
that we'll be talking about.

51
02:42.360 --> 02:44.640
As we move into 2025,

52
02:44.640 --> 02:48.120
companies in the security solutions market

53
02:48.120 --> 02:52.560
are really gonna be looking at different technologies

54
02:52.560 --> 02:55.830
to enhance the offering across the board.

55
02:55.830 --> 02:58.800
Interoperability becomes much more important

56
02:58.800 --> 03:01.980
as consumers are looking to attach devices

57
03:01.980 --> 03:04.140
to existing systems

58
03:04.140 --> 03:08.040
and connect those different devices together

59
03:08.040 --> 03:09.990
through a centralized controller.

60
03:09.990 --> 03:13.320
We also see automation and routines

61
03:13.320 --> 03:15.630
being in demand from consumers,

62
03:15.630 --> 03:19.470
and obviously the big topic of AI and machine learning,

63
03:19.470 --> 03:23.430
all of the data that is being captured

64
03:23.430 --> 03:27.750
and ultimately looking for more and more RMR,

65
03:27.750 --> 03:30.480
or recurring monthly revenue.

66
03:30.480 --> 03:32.730
So today, we're gonna be talking about this.

67
03:32.730 --> 03:37.050
We've got an amazing group here of speakers representing

68
03:37.050 --> 03:41.250
really transformative companies in the industry

69
03:41.250 --> 03:44.220
who some have been around for 150 years

70
03:44.220 --> 03:47.550
and some of who are newer to the scene.

71
03:47.550 --> 03:50.430
And so we're gonna start off with quick introductions

72
03:50.430 --> 03:53.430
from each speaker and then get into our discussion.

73
03:53.430 --> 03:54.780
So Tim, we'll start with you,

74
03:54.780 --> 03:58.053
if you would please introduce yourself and Allegion.

75
03:58.889 --> 04:00.270
<v Tim>Hi, everybody.</v>

76
04:00.270 --> 04:02.970
Tim Eskew, I'm director of our residential

77
04:02.970 --> 04:04.650
electronic product portfolio.

78
04:04.650 --> 04:07.800
So I have responsibility for all of our smart lock products,

79
04:07.800 --> 04:10.380
as well as all the systems that back them up,

80
04:10.380 --> 04:13.080
our cloud platform, as well as our mobile app,

81
04:13.080 --> 04:16.290
based in Indianapolis and have been with Allegion

82
04:16.290 --> 04:18.060
just about three years now.

83
04:18.060 --> 04:19.830
<v Elizabeth>Okay, thank you.</v>

84
04:19.830 --> 04:21.060
Abe, welcome.

85
04:21.060 --> 04:21.990
<v Abe>Sure. Abe Kenney,</v>

86
04:21.990 --> 04:23.490
senior director of product management,

87
04:23.490 --> 04:25.710
and I'm involved with all of our hardware

88
04:25.710 --> 04:28.440
partner integrations as well as, you know,

89
04:28.440 --> 04:30.180
little bits of security

90
04:30.180 --> 04:32.190
and product strategy across the board.

91
04:32.190 --> 04:36.480
So Alarm.com's a professional security software platform,

92
04:36.480 --> 04:40.110
so we integrate, you know, devices from our partners.

93
04:40.110 --> 04:41.430
I see many of you in the audience as well.

94
04:41.430 --> 04:42.263
And then put it all together

95
04:42.263 --> 04:44.760
for the professional security path.

96
04:44.760 --> 04:47.190
You saw kind of Elizabeth lay out there.

97
04:47.190 --> 04:48.900
So really excited to talk about

98
04:48.900 --> 04:50.850
where we're headed in the future today.

99
04:50.850 --> 04:52.440
<v Elizabeth>Great, thanks for being here, Abe.</v>

100
04:52.440 --> 04:53.880
Leah, go ahead.

101
04:53.880 --> 04:55.500
Oops, I think we're a little outta order here.

102
04:55.500 --> 04:56.760
<v Leah>Hi everyone, I'm Leah Page.</v>

103
04:56.760 --> 04:58.740
I'm senior vice president of product strategy

104
04:58.740 --> 05:00.570
and innovation for ADT.

105
05:00.570 --> 05:02.280
ADT, the security company.

106
05:02.280 --> 05:04.590
You probably have seen the yard signs

107
05:04.590 --> 05:06.810
in either your yard or your neighbors.

108
05:06.810 --> 05:08.790
We've been around for about 150 years

109
05:08.790 --> 05:10.830
offering residential security.

110
05:10.830 --> 05:12.280
So nice to see everyone here.

111
05:13.470 --> 05:14.910
<v Elizabeth>Great. Welcome, Leah.</v>

112
05:14.910 --> 05:17.670
And Keith Puckett, thank you for joining us.

113
05:17.670 --> 05:18.570
<v Keith>Thank you for having me.</v>

114
05:18.570 --> 05:20.880
I am Keith Puckett, co-founder and CEO

115
05:20.880 --> 05:25.477
of Ubiety Technologies, about five years, not 150.

116
05:27.090 --> 05:29.910
But Ubiety, the brain behind what we've built

117
05:29.910 --> 05:33.270
is an artificial intelligence engine that can sense,

118
05:33.270 --> 05:35.640
categorize, and identify people

119
05:35.640 --> 05:37.800
based on the devices they're carrying.

120
05:37.800 --> 05:40.350
Really the emphasis there in security

121
05:40.350 --> 05:45.350
is situational awareness and how to provide really

122
05:45.540 --> 05:48.960
information to all stakeholders, right?

123
05:48.960 --> 05:53.490
The homeowners, the monitoring partners, law enforcement,

124
05:53.490 --> 05:56.640
and really give folks a true understanding

125
05:56.640 --> 05:58.620
of what's happening in the home.

126
05:58.620 --> 06:01.950
Folks that should be there and folks shouldn't be there.

127
06:01.950 --> 06:05.730
Our aim is to identify them based on the RF signaling

128
06:05.730 --> 06:06.963
off of their devices.

129
06:08.010 --> 06:08.910
<v Elizabeth>Okay, great.</v>

130
06:08.910 --> 06:10.740
So I wanna start the conversation

131
06:10.740 --> 06:13.020
just talking about the changed landscape

132
06:13.020 --> 06:14.910
and what we've seen over the past few years.

133
06:14.910 --> 06:17.640
And so Tim, I'm gonna start here with you.

134
06:17.640 --> 06:21.240
Can you characterize some of what you all were all seeing

135
06:21.240 --> 06:23.940
in the industry as more and more devices

136
06:23.940 --> 06:27.690
are coming into market for consumers in at home

137
06:27.690 --> 06:30.720
versus the systems play?

138
06:30.720 --> 06:31.553
<v ->Sure.</v>

139
06:32.610 --> 06:34.440
Kind of when I was thinking about this question,

140
06:34.440 --> 06:38.043
we were talking about it this last week in our pre-meeting.

141
06:39.120 --> 06:41.310
I started out with my first smart home device

142
06:41.310 --> 06:43.170
back about 15 years ago.

143
06:43.170 --> 06:45.720
I had a really simple desire

144
06:45.720 --> 06:47.520
to control my Christmas tree lights

145
06:47.520 --> 06:49.020
during the holidays with a schedule,

146
06:49.020 --> 06:50.760
so I didn't have to worry about turning it on

147
06:50.760 --> 06:51.990
and turning it off.

148
06:51.990 --> 06:54.270
That really put me on this journey

149
06:54.270 --> 06:56.310
of different smart home devices.

150
06:56.310 --> 07:00.270
And you know, with us now at Allegion or at Schlage

151
07:00.270 --> 07:02.910
with our smart lock products,

152
07:02.910 --> 07:06.900
one of the things that I think about with people

153
07:06.900 --> 07:09.514
using our products is they're really solving

154
07:09.514 --> 07:14.514
a need that they have with their home.

155
07:14.640 --> 07:17.520
You know, for us, with, you know, the products that we make

156
07:17.520 --> 07:20.850
that have Wi-Fi connectivity or other technologies,

157
07:20.850 --> 07:24.420
like Z-Wave, we bring in the ability for people

158
07:24.420 --> 07:27.750
to do very simple things like set up an access code

159
07:27.750 --> 07:30.930
for their children to use when they come home from school

160
07:30.930 --> 07:33.720
and not have to keep up with keys and things like that.

161
07:33.720 --> 07:36.450
So making life easier for people

162
07:36.450 --> 07:40.087
is really what I've seen help transform and grow the,

163
07:40.087 --> 07:42.990
you know, smart device industry.

164
07:42.990 --> 07:46.080
So people can use devices like our smart locks,

165
07:46.080 --> 07:49.140
or security systems, doorbells, things like that,

166
07:49.140 --> 07:53.310
all standalone get tremendous benefit from them.

167
07:53.310 --> 07:56.700
But then, you know, as we talk about later in this session,

168
07:56.700 --> 07:59.400
how we can then go a step beyond that

169
07:59.400 --> 08:01.620
and integrate devices with other things

170
08:01.620 --> 08:03.840
to create these even broader experiences.

171
08:03.840 --> 08:07.410
But starting out really with a base experience

172
08:07.410 --> 08:10.650
with just solving a particular need is where, you know,

173
08:10.650 --> 08:13.470
most people start their smart home journey.

174
08:13.470 --> 08:15.330
<v ->And so a lot of that really is focused</v>

175
08:15.330 --> 08:16.860
on a point solution, right?

176
08:16.860 --> 08:21.120
There's one thing it's doing versus an entire system

177
08:21.120 --> 08:24.150
that may be doing a number of different things.

178
08:24.150 --> 08:27.150
We do know that consumers, one of the top reasons

179
08:27.150 --> 08:29.640
why they're buying a home security system

180
08:29.640 --> 08:32.100
is to attach different devices to them

181
08:32.100 --> 08:36.000
and then have a central controller along with the app.

182
08:36.000 --> 08:38.820
So Keith, I wanna see if you can share a little bit

183
08:38.820 --> 08:42.570
from your perspective of how the market has shifted here

184
08:42.570 --> 08:46.350
over the past few years as we see more and more consumers

185
08:46.350 --> 08:49.380
looking to individual devices for security,

186
08:49.380 --> 08:52.623
but then also what's happening for the systems play.

187
08:53.670 --> 08:57.330
<v ->Yeah, you know, when I think about security to us,</v>

188
08:57.330 --> 09:00.240
we really wanted to provide software

189
09:00.240 --> 09:02.910
that could be deployed on existing systems.

190
09:02.910 --> 09:04.410
Originally that was the thinking,

191
09:04.410 --> 09:07.530
how could we make an existing system smarter

192
09:07.530 --> 09:09.210
with our software and then use

193
09:09.210 --> 09:13.080
our artificial intelligence engine to create real-time,

194
09:13.080 --> 09:16.083
high caliber inferences like what's happening in the home.

195
09:17.430 --> 09:19.590
That still to me feels like

196
09:19.590 --> 09:21.150
a really interesting opportunity.

197
09:21.150 --> 09:26.150
I think the market has shifted from heavy hardware plays

198
09:27.000 --> 09:29.400
to things that can give homeowners.

199
09:29.400 --> 09:33.600
At the end of the day, the value is voice of the customer.

200
09:33.600 --> 09:34.890
What does the customer want?

201
09:34.890 --> 09:36.570
Like I think they think less about,

202
09:36.570 --> 09:37.950
does this need to be a big system?

203
09:37.950 --> 09:39.330
Does this need to be a device?

204
09:39.330 --> 09:43.020
It's more like, is this solving a problem I have, you know?

205
09:43.020 --> 09:45.930
And so from a hardware standpoint, we like being able

206
09:45.930 --> 09:50.930
to empower and unlock value from existing hardware plays.

207
09:51.510 --> 09:56.510
I would also argue that or posit that home security

208
09:57.210 --> 10:00.750
and like the smart home are on this,

209
10:00.750 --> 10:04.590
if they haven't collided, they are going to collide soon.

210
10:04.590 --> 10:09.300
You know, we've been working in adjacent markets

211
10:09.300 --> 10:11.580
that are opening up the market for us

212
10:11.580 --> 10:13.980
in such an extraordinary way.

213
10:13.980 --> 10:16.200
We've been working with a strategic partner

214
10:16.200 --> 10:20.190
called Evolution Digital that provides hardware equipment

215
10:20.190 --> 10:23.640
to mix signal operators and ISPs.

216
10:23.640 --> 10:28.080
And I think that we'll start to see awareness, security,

217
10:28.080 --> 10:30.330
and value creation for the homeowner

218
10:30.330 --> 10:33.480
come together in a really nice, seamless way.

219
10:33.480 --> 10:34.710
<v ->Yeah, really interesting comments,</v>

220
10:34.710 --> 10:38.670
especially about layers of value as a result of software

221
10:38.670 --> 10:41.520
enabling hardware to do different things.

222
10:41.520 --> 10:44.700
Leah and Abe, let's get some of your perspective

223
10:44.700 --> 10:48.930
as a traditional professional monitored security providers.

224
10:48.930 --> 10:50.400
And Leah, we'll start with you.

225
10:50.400 --> 10:54.150
How is ADT keeping up with all of the change,

226
10:54.150 --> 10:58.353
and now potentially competing against a single device?

227
10:59.340 --> 11:00.900
<v ->Yeah, I think that, you know,</v>

228
11:00.900 --> 11:04.980
there's always still very much room for demand inside

229
11:04.980 --> 11:08.400
of the security industry for professionally installed

230
11:08.400 --> 11:10.290
and professionally monitored solutions.

231
11:10.290 --> 11:12.720
At ADT, we have a portfolio of solutions that are available

232
11:12.720 --> 11:16.320
for professional install as well as for self-install,

233
11:16.320 --> 11:18.240
which has, you know, been a major trend

234
11:18.240 --> 11:20.370
in the last couple of years.

235
11:20.370 --> 11:23.160
You know, we are seeing not only the systems

236
11:23.160 --> 11:26.070
and all of the devices that hook onto it,

237
11:26.070 --> 11:27.990
I think you said it best, Keith when you said, you know,

238
11:27.990 --> 11:29.490
this collision that's really happened

239
11:29.490 --> 11:32.010
between smart home and security.

240
11:32.010 --> 11:34.440
And so we continue to think about the types of devices

241
11:34.440 --> 11:36.900
that we wanna bring onto the system, the value,

242
11:36.900 --> 11:39.810
the experiences that these devices are bringing,

243
11:39.810 --> 11:42.300
as well as, you know, how they can help to enhance like,

244
11:42.300 --> 11:43.350
security in the home.

245
11:43.350 --> 11:46.050
So, you know, we're seeing a big collision

246
11:46.050 --> 11:48.090
obviously in the last few years between video.

247
11:48.090 --> 11:49.530
So we, you know, have video cameras,

248
11:49.530 --> 11:50.790
as well as video doorbells,

249
11:50.790 --> 11:52.467
and in the home and outside of the home,

250
11:52.467 --> 11:54.180
and the different types of streams

251
11:54.180 --> 11:56.280
and experiences that can bring

252
11:56.280 --> 11:57.720
lighting's another factor, right?

253
11:57.720 --> 11:59.220
So they're more of a smart home,

254
11:59.220 --> 12:01.830
traditionally a smart home solution that, you know,

255
12:01.830 --> 12:04.170
can have a lot of effect on security.

256
12:04.170 --> 12:06.420
So if someone comes up to your front door or your back door,

257
12:06.420 --> 12:07.650
and a light illuminates, you know,

258
12:07.650 --> 12:10.110
does that have a different effect on, you know,

259
12:10.110 --> 12:11.850
an intruder or somebody who shouldn't be in the home?

260
12:11.850 --> 12:14.400
And so, you know, certain use cases and things like that

261
12:14.400 --> 12:16.740
are certainly valuable.

262
12:16.740 --> 12:18.630
How we keep up though, you know, with the devices

263
12:18.630 --> 12:20.520
as far as being a system verse device,

264
12:20.520 --> 12:21.660
I think is just making sure

265
12:21.660 --> 12:24.180
that you're meeting the need of the marketplace.

266
12:24.180 --> 12:26.010
There'll still always be, you know,

267
12:26.010 --> 12:29.160
that the demand that we've seen, I think it was at 55%,

268
12:29.160 --> 12:32.520
Elizabeth, in the latest Parks's research

269
12:32.520 --> 12:35.160
where there's a huge demand and continues to be demand.

270
12:35.160 --> 12:38.700
But they'll, you know, as new devices come on board

271
12:38.700 --> 12:41.790
and new experiences, people will be, you know, invited into,

272
12:41.790 --> 12:44.430
so we'll actually be able to reach more consumers

273
12:44.430 --> 12:46.650
by having these devices as part of our ecosystems

274
12:46.650 --> 12:49.050
and part of the broader systems.

275
12:49.050 --> 12:51.510
So, you know, that's essentially what we're doing

276
12:51.510 --> 12:53.340
in thinking about this broader marketplace

277
12:53.340 --> 12:55.260
and how to bring people into it

278
12:55.260 --> 12:57.780
as we create new devices and experiences.

279
12:57.780 --> 13:00.600
<v Elizabeth>And so do, would you characterize</v>

280
13:00.600 --> 13:02.520
that we have a broader market,

281
13:02.520 --> 13:07.520
because of the introduction of standalone devices

282
13:07.530 --> 13:12.510
that also could be professional monitored services?

283
13:12.510 --> 13:14.580
<v ->Yeah, I certainly think that, you know,</v>

284
13:14.580 --> 13:18.390
it's reaching out to folks that maybe traditionally were,

285
13:18.390 --> 13:20.310
you know, didn't have as much interest

286
13:20.310 --> 13:21.630
in like a broader system, right?

287
13:21.630 --> 13:22.627
So it brings them in and says,

288
13:22.627 --> 13:23.523
"Hey, there's this piece of security,

289
13:23.523 --> 13:25.620
it's just one video camera I'm interested in.

290
13:25.620 --> 13:26.760
I really like the doorbell."

291
13:26.760 --> 13:29.790
Oh, a smart lock has a different appeal to me,

292
13:29.790 --> 13:32.580
but now it brings in that security use case

293
13:32.580 --> 13:35.730
and becomes more interesting, and that can be a little bit

294
13:35.730 --> 13:37.470
of a feeder into a broader system

295
13:37.470 --> 13:39.780
or it can be something that, you know,

296
13:39.780 --> 13:41.833
it's just a point solution that has, you know,

297
13:41.833 --> 13:44.100
a monitoring plan around it that can be really interesting

298
13:44.100 --> 13:45.870
for consumers.

299
13:45.870 --> 13:47.370
<v Elizabeth>Okay, and so then marketing</v>

300
13:47.370 --> 13:50.820
to the modern day consumer means perhaps

301
13:50.820 --> 13:54.300
highlighting different types of value that

302
13:54.300 --> 13:55.800
these systems can provide.
<v ->Yep.</v>

303
13:55.800 --> 13:58.050
<v ->So Abe, I wanna see if you can touch</v>

304
13:58.050 --> 14:01.590
on the Alarm.com perspective perhaps

305
14:01.590 --> 14:04.350
as a lifestyle service company

306
14:04.350 --> 14:08.730
versus just a professional monitored services.

307
14:08.730 --> 14:11.850
<v ->Sure. And the security story's still very strong</v>

308
14:11.850 --> 14:13.980
and at the center of our offering still,

309
14:13.980 --> 14:16.440
and it's been exciting to have the opportunity

310
14:16.440 --> 14:17.670
for things like video.

311
14:17.670 --> 14:20.280
I think I agree, it's grown the story

312
14:20.280 --> 14:23.040
where people have an awareness,

313
14:23.040 --> 14:24.750
and they get a bit of information,

314
14:24.750 --> 14:27.090
and they realize that may or may not

315
14:27.090 --> 14:28.890
answer all the questions they thought it would

316
14:28.890 --> 14:31.740
and they then go looking for other solutions.

317
14:31.740 --> 14:33.480
Yeah, they want a lock, they want a sensor,

318
14:33.480 --> 14:35.370
they want a siren, they want a light,

319
14:35.370 --> 14:38.820
something that really compliments that security story.

320
14:38.820 --> 14:42.780
So I think we continue to invest a lot

321
14:42.780 --> 14:47.070
and think about how we can scale our messaging

322
14:47.070 --> 14:49.620
in a number of dimensions.

323
14:49.620 --> 14:52.620
You know, whether you care about your front door,

324
14:52.620 --> 14:55.080
your children, a growing family, whatever it might be.

325
14:55.080 --> 14:57.270
We definitely have to think about

326
14:57.270 --> 15:00.603
how we approach our messaging to meet those different needs.

327
15:02.040 --> 15:03.870
And I think from the lifestyle side,

328
15:03.870 --> 15:07.260
it is, you know, Tim and I were just talking before,

329
15:07.260 --> 15:10.080
it's really great how the driver

330
15:10.080 --> 15:14.880
might initially be security, but you get the stickiness,

331
15:14.880 --> 15:17.721
the engagement really through the automation devices, right?

332
15:17.721 --> 15:20.400
You're not having to break into your house every day,

333
15:20.400 --> 15:23.340
but, you know, my kids couldn't even tell you

334
15:23.340 --> 15:26.880
where the keys to the house are, they have no idea.

335
15:26.880 --> 15:30.380
And I think if they, you know, when they grow up in 10,

336
15:30.380 --> 15:31.650
15 years, look to buy a house,

337
15:31.650 --> 15:34.410
if there's not a smart lock on the front door,

338
15:34.410 --> 15:37.530
they're gonna think this is not a smart house,

339
15:37.530 --> 15:38.610
this is a dumb house, right?

340
15:38.610 --> 15:42.120
So they're, I think it's getting easier and easier

341
15:42.120 --> 15:45.150
as the younger generations are becoming more embracing

342
15:45.150 --> 15:48.450
of technology to lean into those message of lifestyle

343
15:48.450 --> 15:51.360
and the value added points we get with our platform.

344
15:51.360 --> 15:53.340
<v ->Okay, and can you touch a little bit more</v>

345
15:53.340 --> 15:56.250
on this remote video monitoring?

346
15:56.250 --> 15:57.390
What does that mean?

347
15:57.390 --> 16:01.860
And where do you see that coming into play

348
16:01.860 --> 16:05.220
as far as the consumer perspective goes?

349
16:05.220 --> 16:06.930
<v ->Yeah, so remote video monitoring</v>

350
16:06.930 --> 16:09.180
is really just taking that security story

351
16:09.180 --> 16:13.027
and adding the professional monitoring component onto it.

352
16:13.027 --> 16:14.070
So I think we have, I think we're missing

353
16:14.070 --> 16:16.080
a little check mark in one of your things

354
16:16.080 --> 16:18.360
that we've started to add on just recently.

355
16:18.360 --> 16:19.980
So I think it's exactly that.

356
16:19.980 --> 16:22.290
It's one thing to have the awareness,

357
16:22.290 --> 16:23.970
but when you want help,

358
16:23.970 --> 16:26.970
you want someone to actually be addressing that problem,

359
16:26.970 --> 16:28.620
all the same things where we sold

360
16:28.620 --> 16:31.740
a professionally monitored traditional intrusion system.

361
16:31.740 --> 16:33.150
You know, if you're on a plane,

362
16:33.150 --> 16:36.480
and you get an alert who's solving that problem.

363
16:36.480 --> 16:38.370
Now you can start with that with video,

364
16:38.370 --> 16:41.340
and then again, grow from that video perspective

365
16:41.340 --> 16:44.220
to other things or be happy with video alone.

366
16:44.220 --> 16:47.550
And really I think that's growing the addressable market,

367
16:47.550 --> 16:50.310
not really so much stealing from the people

368
16:50.310 --> 16:53.910
that want a more robust intrusion system in their house.

369
16:53.910 --> 16:55.050
<v ->Sure, okay.</v>

370
16:55.050 --> 16:59.430
And I think 2025 might be the year of locks.

371
16:59.430 --> 17:02.790
There is a lot that is happening around locks

372
17:02.790 --> 17:05.460
and making them smart and this transition.

373
17:05.460 --> 17:09.660
And so Tim, tell us a little bit more about the marketing

374
17:09.660 --> 17:11.790
that goes along with this product,

375
17:11.790 --> 17:14.760
and how you're appealing to customers to get them

376
17:14.760 --> 17:17.760
to take something out of their door that's always worked

377
17:17.760 --> 17:20.370
to a certain way and convincing them

378
17:20.370 --> 17:22.680
that to go with something smart and connected.

379
17:22.680 --> 17:24.000
<v ->Sure, yeah.</v>

380
17:24.000 --> 17:26.070
We do think this year in particular

381
17:26.070 --> 17:27.990
is the year of the smart lock.

382
17:27.990 --> 17:31.380
We announced a couple of new products yesterday

383
17:31.380 --> 17:33.363
as an example, one that's bringing,

384
17:34.500 --> 17:38.280
or we'll bring later this year, a really fabulous experience

385
17:38.280 --> 17:42.480
where you don't have to have a smartphone or a watch,

386
17:42.480 --> 17:45.450
you just walk up to the door and it knows you,

387
17:45.450 --> 17:47.700
and it unlocks the door automatically,

388
17:47.700 --> 17:48.840
and seamlessly for you.

389
17:48.840 --> 17:53.430
And that's part of our real mantra at Schlage

390
17:53.430 --> 17:56.670
is to create these seamless access experiences.

391
17:56.670 --> 18:00.840
So part of our drive with smart lock products

392
18:00.840 --> 18:03.540
is to make the experience with consumers

393
18:03.540 --> 18:06.750
really connect with them and make access seamless for them,

394
18:06.750 --> 18:08.370
but also secure.

395
18:08.370 --> 18:10.320
That's one of the reasons why we think this year

396
18:10.320 --> 18:12.030
is gonna be the year of the smart lock.

397
18:12.030 --> 18:13.503
The second thing is,

398
18:15.210 --> 18:19.140
as we have continued to build some of our partnerships

399
18:19.140 --> 18:22.290
with different platforms like an Airbnb,

400
18:22.290 --> 18:25.620
bringing that smart lock experience to a whole new audience

401
18:25.620 --> 18:29.640
is one of the other things that we see is driving people

402
18:29.640 --> 18:32.770
to be interested in smart locks who may never have been

403
18:33.870 --> 18:35.280
exposed to a smart lock.

404
18:35.280 --> 18:36.990
So if you go to a property

405
18:36.990 --> 18:39.990
that has one of our smart locks on it,

406
18:39.990 --> 18:43.920
when you're staying at a vacation home somewhere

407
18:43.920 --> 18:46.410
and really have this fabulous experience

408
18:46.410 --> 18:48.930
of getting in seamlessly and easily,

409
18:48.930 --> 18:52.350
that's really helped bring awareness of smart locks

410
18:52.350 --> 18:54.051
to a broader audience.

411
18:54.051 --> 18:55.050
You know, you think about, you know,

412
18:55.050 --> 18:57.240
an average person that's,

413
18:57.240 --> 18:59.340
or an average vacation rental property

414
18:59.340 --> 19:02.700
has two to three guests a month, you multiply that

415
19:02.700 --> 19:05.400
by how many vacation rental homes there are

416
19:05.400 --> 19:07.680
that really exposes products like ours

417
19:07.680 --> 19:08.820
to a whole new audience,

418
19:08.820 --> 19:11.490
which we're really excited about as well.

419
19:11.490 --> 19:12.720
So those are a couple things

420
19:12.720 --> 19:15.660
that we see really driving this year of smart locks.

421
19:15.660 --> 19:19.200
And kind of the third element of that is bringing

422
19:19.200 --> 19:22.740
more integrated experiences with our products,

423
19:22.740 --> 19:24.960
so that we create more value for the customers

424
19:24.960 --> 19:28.200
that's integrating with partners like Alarm.com

425
19:28.200 --> 19:30.810
to bring new experiences to the homeowner.

426
19:30.810 --> 19:33.900
You know, integrations of access with alarm systems

427
19:33.900 --> 19:36.120
to arm and disarm as an example.

428
19:36.120 --> 19:39.750
Integrations with, you know, partners like Ring to,

429
19:39.750 --> 19:42.120
you know, look at a video feed from a doorbell,

430
19:42.120 --> 19:45.030
and unlock the door if you want to to, you know,

431
19:45.030 --> 19:47.490
simple integrations like turning on your lights

432
19:47.490 --> 19:49.380
when the door unlocks when you come home.

433
19:49.380 --> 19:51.690
That's one of my wife's favorites.

434
19:51.690 --> 19:52.740
Those are a few things.

435
19:52.740 --> 19:53.573
<v ->Okay, great.</v>

436
19:53.573 --> 19:55.650
And yeah, you know, we just published some research

437
19:55.650 --> 19:57.990
on single family rental homes,

438
19:57.990 --> 20:01.980
and we see this as a new segment of built homes

439
20:01.980 --> 20:05.610
where technology is really being incorporated everywhere,

440
20:05.610 --> 20:09.690
because there's so much value to be able to access

441
20:09.690 --> 20:13.770
and get into the home, or without a key to be able

442
20:13.770 --> 20:17.820
to send people and the convenience factor.

443
20:17.820 --> 20:21.690
Does anybody else wanna make any comments about locks, Leah?

444
20:21.690 --> 20:22.980
<v ->Yeah, I'll take a little bit.</v>

445
20:22.980 --> 20:26.670
So we, at ADT, we just launched a feature in the marketplace

446
20:26.670 --> 20:28.170
in Q4 called Trusted Neighbor,

447
20:28.170 --> 20:30.420
and essentially is a lot of the same,

448
20:30.420 --> 20:31.530
you know, principles that we're talking about.

449
20:31.530 --> 20:34.200
So it's, you know, this keyless entry

450
20:34.200 --> 20:36.060
where someone can walk up to the door,

451
20:36.060 --> 20:39.300
be recognized by the video doorbell, door unlock,

452
20:39.300 --> 20:42.333
system disarms, and you're allowed to go into the home.

453
20:43.440 --> 20:45.840
The homeowner in that case can do it,

454
20:45.840 --> 20:48.240
let's just say at an instant, like if something,

455
20:48.240 --> 20:50.280
an event was triggered and it happens then,

456
20:50.280 --> 20:51.420
or on a cadence, right?

457
20:51.420 --> 20:53.490
So I have a dog walker or somebody that needs to enter

458
20:53.490 --> 20:55.800
my home on a frequent basis.

459
20:55.800 --> 20:59.340
And so it's been interesting to sort of portray it

460
20:59.340 --> 21:02.490
as a use case in the marketing and things that we did in Q4.

461
21:02.490 --> 21:04.740
So, you know, big part of what we did

462
21:04.740 --> 21:07.530
was pushing that out there, things like, you know,

463
21:07.530 --> 21:10.950
huge billboard displays in Times Square and you know,

464
21:10.950 --> 21:13.080
all the way through what you're seeing on TV.

465
21:13.080 --> 21:16.230
But rather than talking about it as elements,

466
21:16.230 --> 21:18.360
like as point solutions, as a video doorbell,

467
21:18.360 --> 21:21.217
as a smart lock, tying it together and saying to consumers,

468
21:21.217 --> 21:24.060
"Hey, there's this use case for you to have

469
21:24.060 --> 21:27.240
that enables this abracadabra moment when someone walks up

470
21:27.240 --> 21:29.670
to your door is recognized, door opens,

471
21:29.670 --> 21:31.920
you know, the alarm is disarmed,

472
21:31.920 --> 21:33.330
they can enter for a period of time.

473
21:33.330 --> 21:35.970
And then of course after the exit, you know, is re-armed,

474
21:35.970 --> 21:38.550
and the home is back to its state."

475
21:38.550 --> 21:39.600
So that was exciting.

476
21:39.600 --> 21:41.460
And we took that as far as even going

477
21:41.460 --> 21:43.320
into non-security events.

478
21:43.320 --> 21:45.660
So things like water, which is, you know,

479
21:45.660 --> 21:48.150
something that's a huge use case for the home,

480
21:48.150 --> 21:49.200
but isn't necessarily,

481
21:49.200 --> 21:51.360
is I say peripheral maybe to security,

482
21:51.360 --> 21:52.830
but allows your neighbor to go in and say,

483
21:52.830 --> 21:54.500
turn off the water or do something, you know,

484
21:54.500 --> 21:56.310
in the case that there was actually a leak.

485
21:56.310 --> 21:57.660
So that was a big part

486
21:57.660 --> 22:00.870
of what we ran through Q4 and into this year,

487
22:00.870 --> 22:02.760
and it's been a really exciting promotion.

488
22:02.760 --> 22:06.510
We've seen a lot of consumers really take to the fact

489
22:06.510 --> 22:07.650
that it's use case based

490
22:07.650 --> 22:09.990
versus maybe just like point solution or, you know,

491
22:09.990 --> 22:12.180
talking about it as some device that's out there.

492
22:12.180 --> 22:14.497
It's a little less scary maybe to some to say,

493
22:14.497 --> 22:16.560
"Hey, I'm gonna replace my locks, you know,

494
22:16.560 --> 22:18.690
replace my doorbell, and do this, because now there's this

495
22:18.690 --> 22:21.030
ubiquitous use case that works for me."

496
22:21.030 --> 22:22.980
<v Elizabeth>And so all of these</v>

497
22:22.980 --> 22:27.120
what we're talking about has AI and artificial intelligence

498
22:27.120 --> 22:30.180
baked in pretty much everywhere.

499
22:30.180 --> 22:33.990
And so Keith, I wanna see if you can share a little bit more

500
22:33.990 --> 22:38.130
about what Ubiety is doing with the AI side

501
22:38.130 --> 22:42.570
of the experience for the consumer and why this matters

502
22:42.570 --> 22:46.080
so much when we're talking about security at home.

503
22:46.080 --> 22:51.080
<v ->Yeah, so Ubiety's taken a very purpose-built</v>

504
22:51.240 --> 22:54.450
novel approach to artificial intelligence.

505
22:54.450 --> 22:58.740
We're not relying on any LLMs or third-party models.

506
22:58.740 --> 23:03.000
We developed this entirely in-house.

507
23:03.000 --> 23:07.020
And the thesis is, our AI engines called Eckleburg.

508
23:07.020 --> 23:09.690
If you've read "Great Gatsby," that's fun.

509
23:09.690 --> 23:14.250
But the thesis is that we spent several years

510
23:14.250 --> 23:19.110
building a ground truth catalog, fingerprinting catalog

511
23:19.110 --> 23:21.840
of how all device types communicate

512
23:21.840 --> 23:24.060
unrelated to them being on the network, right?

513
23:24.060 --> 23:26.250
So why is that interesting?

514
23:26.250 --> 23:30.120
Our thesis is presence verification, right?

515
23:30.120 --> 23:33.750
So if someone, and I, by the way, am a big fan of cameras,

516
23:33.750 --> 23:37.440
so what I'm about to say is not something disparaging,

517
23:37.440 --> 23:41.040
but like if I have one camera on my front door,

518
23:41.040 --> 23:44.040
and I walk in through the front door,

519
23:44.040 --> 23:45.870
and the home says I'm home,

520
23:45.870 --> 23:47.880
but I walk out through my garage and I leave,

521
23:47.880 --> 23:49.110
am I still there?

522
23:49.110 --> 23:52.320
Like our job is to persistently provide

523
23:52.320 --> 23:53.970
presence verification.

524
23:53.970 --> 23:57.510
And so we did that through radio frequency signaling.

525
23:57.510 --> 24:01.290
We had this form of Faraday cages, which is a,

526
24:01.290 --> 24:05.460
these boxes that prevent signals from outside coming in.

527
24:05.460 --> 24:07.080
And we understood the ground truth

528
24:07.080 --> 24:09.510
of how every device type communicates

529
24:09.510 --> 24:11.670
in Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and cellular,

530
24:11.670 --> 24:14.460
and then we created inference engines

531
24:14.460 --> 24:18.630
when we see those signaling types in the wild.

532
24:18.630 --> 24:23.630
So the use cases are in a conventional monitoring solution,

533
24:28.020 --> 24:33.020
if an alarm is going off, we can tell the monitoring center

534
24:33.660 --> 24:36.420
within a second exactly who's there,

535
24:36.420 --> 24:40.500
so they dynamically change how they action the alarm event.

536
24:40.500 --> 24:43.290
They don't go through some rote process,

537
24:43.290 --> 24:45.120
they don't send a generic text out.

538
24:45.120 --> 24:48.360
They send exactly messages and communications

539
24:48.360 --> 24:50.010
to the people they know are there

540
24:50.010 --> 24:52.170
just left or just got there.

541
24:52.170 --> 24:54.450
Then in the anomalous version,

542
24:54.450 --> 24:58.710
it's like someone enters a home, like we have five children,

543
24:58.710 --> 25:01.620
and there's seven iPhones in our house.

544
25:01.620 --> 25:04.350
Anytime any device walks into my house

545
25:04.350 --> 25:08.010
that's not known to the home, I get an alert.

546
25:08.010 --> 25:10.320
So my 13-year-old daughter brings a friend at home

547
25:10.320 --> 25:13.170
who has a Google Pixel, I get an alert.

548
25:13.170 --> 25:14.220
And I can say, "Olivia.

549
25:14.220 --> 25:15.810
Oh, hey. Did you bring a friend home, right?"

550
25:15.810 --> 25:18.240
So it's like we're trying to provide context

551
25:18.240 --> 25:22.050
and situational awareness, and that also manifests in,

552
25:22.050 --> 25:25.710
I like what you said, Leah, about use cases.

553
25:25.710 --> 25:30.660
It's like we drive those in use cases or product features,

554
25:30.660 --> 25:31.530
party detection.

555
25:31.530 --> 25:33.630
We can tell you if there's more people in your home

556
25:33.630 --> 25:34.530
than should be.

557
25:34.530 --> 25:36.030
We can tell you if people are there

558
25:36.030 --> 25:38.250
that have never been seen before.

559
25:38.250 --> 25:42.180
And all that's driven around AI of the home,

560
25:42.180 --> 25:45.360
which is we know exactly the telemetry

561
25:45.360 --> 25:47.430
or behavioral analytics of a home.

562
25:47.430 --> 25:50.640
And so anytime something anomalous happens,

563
25:50.640 --> 25:53.400
we're able to serve that to the homeowner.

564
25:53.400 --> 25:55.470
<v ->Okay, you said a lot of really great things there,</v>

565
25:55.470 --> 25:57.120
but I think summing it up, you know,

566
25:57.120 --> 26:00.540
verification seems to be the key word,

567
26:00.540 --> 26:03.570
and we know that is critical of critical importance

568
26:03.570 --> 26:05.700
for the responders, right?

569
26:05.700 --> 26:09.300
When a monitored alarm goes off, there is somebody,

570
26:09.300 --> 26:13.410
there's a dispatch, there's emergency is being called.

571
26:13.410 --> 26:16.050
And so Abe, I wanna see maybe if you can talk

572
26:16.050 --> 26:21.050
a little bit more about AI and verification,

573
26:21.060 --> 26:23.730
and maybe you could touch on AVS-01,

574
26:23.730 --> 26:26.790
explain why some of these things are so important

575
26:26.790 --> 26:30.720
not just to us as individuals, but for local communities

576
26:30.720 --> 26:33.270
and for our first responders,

577
26:33.270 --> 26:35.130
who are the ones gonna be showing up at the door

578
26:35.130 --> 26:36.810
when alarms are going off.

579
26:36.810 --> 26:40.650
<v ->Sure, so I mean maybe AI should be actionable insights.</v>

580
26:40.650 --> 26:41.880
That's what we're trying to get.

581
26:41.880 --> 26:45.000
We're just trying to get trusted real information

582
26:45.000 --> 26:49.140
out of the home at a critical time sensitive moment, right?

583
26:49.140 --> 26:52.530
So whether that's AI, whether that's putting together

584
26:52.530 --> 26:55.470
information from three discreet sensors,

585
26:55.470 --> 26:57.000
you know, the customer's phone,

586
26:57.000 --> 26:59.040
and there are application and information,

587
26:59.040 --> 27:00.840
and inputs from other users.

588
27:00.840 --> 27:03.780
We're all trying to just give the best possible story,

589
27:03.780 --> 27:05.370
because there's kind of been,

590
27:05.370 --> 27:08.880
while we have a proliferation of systems, right?

591
27:08.880 --> 27:11.040
The most alarms are false, right?

592
27:11.040 --> 27:14.520
So I think we have a responsibility

593
27:14.520 --> 27:17.820
to keep raising the bar on the information

594
27:17.820 --> 27:19.440
that we're sharing upstream,

595
27:19.440 --> 27:23.460
so that better decisions can be made for the responsible use

596
27:23.460 --> 27:25.710
of resources to respond to those issues.

597
27:25.710 --> 27:29.100
So AI is a big part of that, right? Yeah.

598
27:29.100 --> 27:31.740
Discreet sensors used to go off, you could often look at it,

599
27:31.740 --> 27:35.340
and look at time, history, historical actions.

600
27:35.340 --> 27:38.880
There's a lot of insights around likelihood of events

601
27:38.880 --> 27:42.750
that we bring into our interface along with video.

602
27:42.750 --> 27:45.810
You know, is there an actual person that's been detected

603
27:45.810 --> 27:47.250
where we can bring other elements

604
27:47.250 --> 27:49.350
of sensing from other systems,

605
27:49.350 --> 27:51.240
we're always happy to add that in to create

606
27:51.240 --> 27:54.090
that stronger picture of activity.

607
27:54.090 --> 27:56.190
<v ->Okay, great, thank you for that.</v>

608
27:56.190 --> 28:00.570
And AVS-01 is a important initiative

609
28:00.570 --> 28:04.020
where there is a verification

610
28:04.020 --> 28:06.540
and then scoring of different alarms,

611
28:06.540 --> 28:09.300
and this is connecting to the ECCs

612
28:09.300 --> 28:12.420
who are the ones who are getting the calls in,

613
28:12.420 --> 28:15.780
and then making decisions about what to do

614
28:15.780 --> 28:17.820
based on the information at hand.

615
28:17.820 --> 28:19.710
And so all of this technology

616
28:19.710 --> 28:21.420
that's getting put into the home

617
28:21.420 --> 28:24.810
is built to give that group, you know,

618
28:24.810 --> 28:26.970
the important context they need to decide,

619
28:26.970 --> 28:29.580
do we dispatch the police, do we not?

620
28:29.580 --> 28:33.810
Is there fire, you know, people that are needed out there.

621
28:33.810 --> 28:37.470
It becomes critical, it's also our money, right?

622
28:37.470 --> 28:42.470
Our tax paying dollars are the ones funding the police

623
28:42.810 --> 28:44.880
and the people that are responding.

624
28:44.880 --> 28:49.290
And so the more that the technology companies can provide,

625
28:49.290 --> 28:51.750
the better off everybody is in the end

626
28:51.750 --> 28:54.720
as far as verified alarms go.

627
28:54.720 --> 28:57.150
I wanna switch gears and touch a little bit

628
28:57.150 --> 28:59.070
on interoperability and standards,

629
28:59.070 --> 29:01.530
because we now have these different systems

630
29:01.530 --> 29:05.940
and/or devices with other devices coming into play.

631
29:05.940 --> 29:09.300
And so Tim, maybe give us a little bit of a view

632
29:09.300 --> 29:13.740
on what matters for security in the world of locks

633
29:13.740 --> 29:18.120
as it relates to Z-Wave, Matter, Thread.

634
29:18.120 --> 29:21.360
Really whatever standards you wanna reference here.

635
29:21.360 --> 29:22.590
<v ->Thanks.</v>

636
29:22.590 --> 29:25.650
So first off, you know, from our perspective,

637
29:25.650 --> 29:26.940
we do like standards.

638
29:26.940 --> 29:29.478
We've been providing smart locks

639
29:29.478 --> 29:31.799
with different standards in them

640
29:31.799 --> 29:33.990
as those standards have evolved.

641
29:33.990 --> 29:37.350
We started out with Zigbee many years ago.

642
29:37.350 --> 29:40.020
We have also launched Z-Wave locks.

643
29:40.020 --> 29:43.620
That's gotten a lot of attraction with security systems,

644
29:43.620 --> 29:44.910
which has done really well.

645
29:44.910 --> 29:49.020
It really helps create a couple of things

646
29:49.020 --> 29:50.460
I think for the consumer.

647
29:50.460 --> 29:54.900
The setup experience is very much known

648
29:54.900 --> 29:57.840
and quantified for consumer when they're setting up

649
29:57.840 --> 30:00.690
a device or a system provider,

650
30:00.690 --> 30:03.210
or an installer is installing the lock,

651
30:03.210 --> 30:07.950
it's standards help create a homogeneous setup experience.

652
30:07.950 --> 30:12.150
So there's one thing, whether that's Zigbee, Matter, Z-Wave,

653
30:12.150 --> 30:15.150
the consistent experience in the setup process

654
30:15.150 --> 30:16.680
has been very helpful.

655
30:16.680 --> 30:19.050
The second thing that we like about standards

656
30:19.050 --> 30:23.070
is that it helps organize the information from devices

657
30:23.070 --> 30:25.140
like our locks into systems,

658
30:25.140 --> 30:29.220
so that it's easy to be leveraged and used by other systems,

659
30:29.220 --> 30:32.400
be that alarm system, or something else that's talking

660
30:32.400 --> 30:34.814
to a device like our locks.

661
30:34.814 --> 30:36.570
You know, as standards evolve,

662
30:36.570 --> 30:39.900
they tend to try and solve different things.

663
30:39.900 --> 30:41.430
You know, they learn from each other.

664
30:41.430 --> 30:44.640
So the Matter standard is really, you know,

665
30:44.640 --> 30:48.900
focused on the broad device types that are in the home,

666
30:48.900 --> 30:52.380
and we'll continue to come out with more device types

667
30:52.380 --> 30:53.880
as that standard evolves,

668
30:53.880 --> 30:55.560
but also creating that again,

669
30:55.560 --> 30:58.860
even better consumer experience that's secure.

670
30:58.860 --> 31:01.900
So I think those are the things that we see with standards

671
31:02.850 --> 31:05.940
at a device communications level.

672
31:05.940 --> 31:09.480
The other thing too is from a manufacturer standpoint,

673
31:09.480 --> 31:11.400
when we're building a product that's gonna work

674
31:11.400 --> 31:13.680
with a standard be that Z-Wave or Matter,

675
31:13.680 --> 31:16.920
or another is that, you know, we're not having

676
31:16.920 --> 31:20.400
to do integrations with this system and then this system,

677
31:20.400 --> 31:22.110
and then this system, which, you know,

678
31:22.110 --> 31:25.110
adds time to the development cycle and adds cost too.

679
31:25.110 --> 31:29.070
And so for us, standards are beneficial,

680
31:29.070 --> 31:31.530
but we still have the flexibilities of manufacturer

681
31:31.530 --> 31:34.680
to build our own value into our products.

682
31:34.680 --> 31:38.490
You know, we tend to be known for high reliability products,

683
31:38.490 --> 31:41.040
products that last years and years, and years.

684
31:41.040 --> 31:44.280
We also have a little bit of a flare for style

685
31:44.280 --> 31:45.690
and design with our products.

686
31:45.690 --> 31:48.643
So those are some of the things that we can still do

687
31:48.643 --> 31:51.990
with our products to differentiate themselves

688
31:51.990 --> 31:53.760
over other standard products.

689
31:53.760 --> 31:55.530
And the other things, standards aren't built

690
31:55.530 --> 31:56.790
to do everything.

691
31:56.790 --> 31:58.620
And so when we build our products,

692
31:58.620 --> 32:01.680
we also build in other communications flexibility,

693
32:01.680 --> 32:03.720
so that we can work with other systems

694
32:03.720 --> 32:06.250
that may not be covered by the standard.

695
32:06.250 --> 32:07.680
<v ->Okay, great.</v>

696
32:07.680 --> 32:11.550
So standards definitely matter, they're important.

697
32:11.550 --> 32:14.682
And Matter does matter,

698
32:14.682 --> 32:19.170
as one of those jokes of the year probably.

699
32:19.170 --> 32:22.770
Let's talk a little bit more about Wi-Fi sensing.

700
32:22.770 --> 32:26.220
This is another one of these hot topics

701
32:26.220 --> 32:28.770
driven by all the technology

702
32:28.770 --> 32:30.750
that's getting built into the hardware.

703
32:30.750 --> 32:33.720
Abe, is that something you wanna touch on?

704
32:33.720 --> 32:37.350
<v ->Sure, so it's just, you know, another exciting opportunity</v>

705
32:37.350 --> 32:41.460
to bring more information into our ecosystem,

706
32:41.460 --> 32:43.950
into the story of activity and presence in the home

707
32:43.950 --> 32:46.890
and you know, to leverage perhaps

708
32:46.890 --> 32:51.690
the customer's existing devices or to bring in affordable,

709
32:51.690 --> 32:53.880
you know, sensing devices where instead of having

710
32:53.880 --> 32:56.550
to go on a room by room basis with the PIR,

711
32:56.550 --> 32:58.410
you could put in one or two devices,

712
32:58.410 --> 33:00.600
and cover a floor or a house.

713
33:00.600 --> 33:03.450
So we see it as absolutely complimentary

714
33:03.450 --> 33:06.600
to the existing infrastructure that we deploy.

715
33:06.600 --> 33:10.230
And so I think the more we can start to bring that in,

716
33:10.230 --> 33:12.360
layer it into maybe even some existing devices

717
33:12.360 --> 33:14.640
already go in the home, it just gives us a richer picture

718
33:14.640 --> 33:19.140
of activity that again supports the story of better action,

719
33:19.140 --> 33:24.060
better insights, and better results from the system.

720
33:24.060 --> 33:25.770
<v Elizabeth>Can you share a little bit more about</v>

721
33:25.770 --> 33:30.210
what the customer gets back as far as information goes

722
33:30.210 --> 33:33.870
when Wi-Fi sensing is are there notifications

723
33:33.870 --> 33:34.890
that are popping up?

724
33:34.890 --> 33:37.200
<v ->I mean we treat it in our system a lot</v>

725
33:37.200 --> 33:40.110
like a PIR, a motion sensor.

726
33:40.110 --> 33:41.370
That's what we are getting.

727
33:41.370 --> 33:42.690
We are getting motion.

728
33:42.690 --> 33:47.100
It just might be over a broader scope,

729
33:47.100 --> 33:48.720
like I said, multiple rooms or a floor,

730
33:48.720 --> 33:50.490
and then it flows into our system,

731
33:50.490 --> 33:54.090
just like you can do anything to connect events together.

732
33:54.090 --> 33:57.120
So you could keep your lights on, turn your lights off,

733
33:57.120 --> 34:01.080
if there's inactivity, trigger alerts if you

734
34:01.080 --> 34:04.740
all of a sudden get a motion at an unexpected time.

735
34:04.740 --> 34:08.760
We don't yet typically pull that into the,

736
34:08.760 --> 34:11.400
you know, the alarm infrastructure.

737
34:11.400 --> 34:14.340
So it's notification awareness,

738
34:14.340 --> 34:16.350
but something we are happy to explore,

739
34:16.350 --> 34:19.470
kind of thinking about it as complimentary

740
34:19.470 --> 34:21.510
to video only, for example.

741
34:21.510 --> 34:24.540
There's an interesting sort of broader set of awareness

742
34:24.540 --> 34:26.730
with your perimeter being video,

743
34:26.730 --> 34:29.450
and then getting understanding about what's going on

744
34:29.450 --> 34:32.917
in your home at a general level without needing to,

745
34:32.917 --> 34:35.610
you know, deploy something from a privacy perspective

746
34:35.610 --> 34:38.610
that people are typically resistant to.

747
34:38.610 --> 34:40.560
<v ->Okay, yeah, if I can add a tail onto that one too.</v>

748
34:40.560 --> 34:42.900
I think, you know, just thinking about future use cases

749
34:42.900 --> 34:44.850
and how you would use it too, just the anomaly detection.

750
34:44.850 --> 34:47.010
So it's not only like the aggregation of that data,

751
34:47.010 --> 34:49.380
what it's telling you, if there's a combination of things

752
34:49.380 --> 34:50.820
that are happening, is that more powerful,

753
34:50.820 --> 34:52.470
or tell you more about the event that's happening.

754
34:52.470 --> 34:54.540
But then if the same event happens every day

755
34:54.540 --> 34:56.490
and it doesn't happen this day, what does that mean?

756
34:56.490 --> 34:58.320
And so I think there's sort of the reverse

757
34:58.320 --> 34:59.370
that anomaly detection,

758
34:59.370 --> 35:00.960
which actually adds in a flavor of AI

759
35:00.960 --> 35:03.480
like we were talking about before to understand,

760
35:03.480 --> 35:05.910
you know, if something is supposed to happen and didn't,

761
35:05.910 --> 35:08.850
you know, what does that mean as well for consumers.

762
35:08.850 --> 35:09.683
<v ->Okay, great.</v>

763
35:09.683 --> 35:14.683
Any other comments on Wi-Fi sensing, anything? No.

764
35:14.820 --> 35:16.770
Okay, let's talk about where's the next set

765
35:16.770 --> 35:18.330
of revenue coming from?

766
35:18.330 --> 35:22.800
There is the recurring fees that can be charged

767
35:22.800 --> 35:24.780
for the professional monitor alarm,

768
35:24.780 --> 35:29.010
but what else are traditional companies

769
35:29.010 --> 35:34.010
able to charge for now beyond what they have in the past?

770
35:35.070 --> 35:37.503
Leah, would you like to answer that question?

771
35:38.520 --> 35:39.690
<v ->The money question.</v>

772
35:39.690 --> 35:40.620
<v ->Money question.</v>

773
35:40.620 --> 35:43.500
<v ->So you know, I think that we have a very traditional model</v>

774
35:43.500 --> 35:46.170
at ADT that revolves around residential security,

775
35:46.170 --> 35:47.460
and it's one that, you know,

776
35:47.460 --> 35:49.530
we're understanding that consumers want choice.

777
35:49.530 --> 35:51.180
They want choice in the types of devices

778
35:51.180 --> 35:52.013
that they have in the home.

779
35:52.013 --> 35:54.030
They want choices on the type of monitoring,

780
35:54.030 --> 35:56.370
whether it's pro-monitor, self-monitor.

781
35:56.370 --> 35:58.200
And by the way, there's flavors in between that, right?

782
35:58.200 --> 36:01.860
So I might want just fire or I might want just supervisory

783
36:01.860 --> 36:02.910
like water and other things,

784
36:02.910 --> 36:04.907
or I might also just want security.

785
36:04.907 --> 36:07.440
And so as we explore sort of the variety

786
36:07.440 --> 36:08.430
of what can be offered,

787
36:08.430 --> 36:10.950
there are many different types of business models,

788
36:10.950 --> 36:12.960
or recurring monthly revenues

789
36:12.960 --> 36:14.850
that can be associated to those.

790
36:14.850 --> 36:17.910
You can package it, you certainly can have different types

791
36:17.910 --> 36:21.120
of hardware that are associated to packages to create,

792
36:21.120 --> 36:23.970
you know, new recurring models there.

793
36:23.970 --> 36:25.203
So that's been exciting.

794
36:26.040 --> 36:28.560
One other thing that we have also looked into is, you know,

795
36:28.560 --> 36:32.190
how we can work and protect customers outside of the home.

796
36:32.190 --> 36:34.620
And so we work with companies on the,

797
36:34.620 --> 36:37.590
like in the gig economy, like Uber and Lyft, and DoorDash,

798
36:37.590 --> 36:39.990
and others, and there's revenue streams involved

799
36:39.990 --> 36:42.120
with embedding our monitoring services

800
36:42.120 --> 36:43.920
and our monitoring agent services inside

801
36:43.920 --> 36:45.240
of their experiences as well.

802
36:45.240 --> 36:48.270
And so I think that there are a lot of potential ways

803
36:48.270 --> 36:50.250
when we think about sort of the core of the business

804
36:50.250 --> 36:51.960
and, you know, monitoring as a service

805
36:51.960 --> 36:54.960
and what we might do there to, you know,

806
36:54.960 --> 36:58.320
create now new revenue models for our business.

807
36:58.320 --> 36:59.700
<v Elizabeth>Okay.</v>

808
36:59.700 --> 37:01.920
Keith, have any ideas where the next set

809
37:01.920 --> 37:03.300
of revenue's coming from?

810
37:03.300 --> 37:08.250
<v ->Yeah, I think, I mean candidly we use Parks's research</v>

811
37:08.250 --> 37:12.720
as to understand the motivators for what is actioning,

812
37:12.720 --> 37:16.230
someone to make a decision to buy security.

813
37:16.230 --> 37:17.700
The research is phenomenal.

814
37:17.700 --> 37:22.700
And the majority of it is around use cases

815
37:22.800 --> 37:27.660
that serve a homeowner, something they find valuable, right?

816
37:27.660 --> 37:31.980
You know, I would argue that the fundamental value promise

817
37:31.980 --> 37:36.060
of a security company to a homeowner is that

818
37:36.060 --> 37:38.970
in the event of an alarm, you will intervene

819
37:38.970 --> 37:42.960
with some sort of action, law enforcement or otherwise.

820
37:42.960 --> 37:46.230
So that's value promise one.

821
37:46.230 --> 37:48.720
But if that value promise one isn't met,

822
37:48.720 --> 37:52.470
it's really hard to stack things on top of it.

823
37:52.470 --> 37:57.420
And so our view is from work with partners,

824
37:57.420 --> 38:00.390
large security dealers is engagement

825
38:00.390 --> 38:04.620
is what will drive folks to use a system more.

826
38:04.620 --> 38:07.920
So how do you get a homeowner to find value

827
38:07.920 --> 38:12.150
in between the alarms, or to borrow Abe's thing,

828
38:12.150 --> 38:13.980
in between the false alarms, right?

829
38:13.980 --> 38:16.263
Like it is you really want to create something

830
38:16.263 --> 38:18.930
that they say, "I wanna log into this app,

831
38:18.930 --> 38:20.640
use it multiple times a day,

832
38:20.640 --> 38:23.010
because it's serving me something valuable

833
38:23.010 --> 38:24.360
to me and my family."

834
38:24.360 --> 38:25.200
That's it.

835
38:25.200 --> 38:28.860
And so when you can achieve that, you've done a thing.

836
38:28.860 --> 38:32.790
And I think, you know, I will just be candid,

837
38:32.790 --> 38:37.290
our work has been so technical for a long time.

838
38:37.290 --> 38:39.960
The best decision we've made in the company

839
38:39.960 --> 38:44.960
is hiring an obsessed product leader who cares,

840
38:45.390 --> 38:48.960
she's intense about the voice of the customer.

841
38:48.960 --> 38:50.460
She's like, "I don't wanna hear about technology,

842
38:50.460 --> 38:51.293
that's cool.

843
38:51.293 --> 38:52.920
I wanna see how we're gonna deliver

844
38:52.920 --> 38:54.870
for the pain point to the customer."

845
38:54.870 --> 38:58.410
And so I think the customer's gonna answer that question,

846
38:58.410 --> 38:59.910
did I get value outta this thing?

847
38:59.910 --> 39:02.100
And if so, I will pay for that.

848
39:02.100 --> 39:03.682
<v ->Yeah, I think that's really good points.</v>

849
39:03.682 --> 39:08.682
And we also, in our research work, see security moving

850
39:08.730 --> 39:10.860
not just for the home environment,

851
39:10.860 --> 39:12.810
but actually to the person.

852
39:12.810 --> 39:15.810
So this idea of personal safety

853
39:15.810 --> 39:19.635
and extending services beyond the home.

854
39:19.635 --> 39:22.170
It could be the car, the vehicle,

855
39:22.170 --> 39:23.820
lots going on with vehicle safety,

856
39:23.820 --> 39:28.080
but it could just be somebody who's walking down

857
39:28.080 --> 39:32.970
in urban area and wants to ensure that they feel safe

858
39:32.970 --> 39:36.810
and are safe with the ability to have a response there.

859
39:36.810 --> 39:41.130
So the hardware is shifting

860
39:41.130 --> 39:43.860
to be able to really go anywhere, right?

861
39:43.860 --> 39:46.350
And that is a big difference in change

862
39:46.350 --> 39:49.050
that I think we're seeing over the past many years

863
39:49.050 --> 39:52.350
is the capabilities of technology,

864
39:52.350 --> 39:55.143
and how much more that they can do.

865
39:56.490 --> 39:58.800
Abe, I wanna go over to you here,

866
39:58.800 --> 40:02.130
and just ask another question on the revenue side,

867
40:02.130 --> 40:05.460
and understanding how you're moving customers

868
40:05.460 --> 40:09.450
from one tier of service to another,

869
40:09.450 --> 40:12.630
and being able to show that value to them

870
40:12.630 --> 40:15.783
to capture that next stream of revenue.

871
40:16.740 --> 40:19.020
<v ->Yeah, I think the most of the credit of that goes</v>

872
40:19.020 --> 40:20.880
to our service providers for, you know,

873
40:20.880 --> 40:23.550
moving their partners up the value chain.

874
40:23.550 --> 40:26.250
So it's our responsibility and we are often just thinking

875
40:26.250 --> 40:30.690
about how can we make a flexible, scalable security platform

876
40:30.690 --> 40:34.110
that then can meet whatever that new need might be.

877
40:34.110 --> 40:38.010
So make sure that we have consistent user experiences,

878
40:38.010 --> 40:40.140
consistent installer experiences.

879
40:40.140 --> 40:44.010
So it's easy for some new combination

880
40:44.010 --> 40:47.280
or permutation of security, whatever that might be.

881
40:47.280 --> 40:52.280
Personal security, video security, fire and water security.

882
40:52.560 --> 40:55.680
You know, just have all those options and then create,

883
40:55.680 --> 40:57.360
you know, appropriate solutions

884
40:57.360 --> 40:59.250
that are matched on the value,

885
40:59.250 --> 41:04.250
and easy for service providers to deploy to new customers.

886
41:05.250 --> 41:06.083
<v Elizabeth>Yeah.</v>

887
41:06.083 --> 41:08.547
I think it's so true that people do pay for what they value.

888
41:08.547 --> 41:11.820
And I know many people probably have an iPhone, right?

889
41:11.820 --> 41:14.550
And spent $1,500 on their phone,

890
41:14.550 --> 41:16.590
and might've thought five or 10 years ago,

891
41:16.590 --> 41:19.800
I never would spend $1,500 on a mobile device.

892
41:19.800 --> 41:22.740
And now everybody's doing that all the time.

893
41:22.740 --> 41:27.240
So it's not necessarily about money, right?

894
41:27.240 --> 41:29.820
It's about what's important to people,

895
41:29.820 --> 41:33.330
and safety and security really being at the heart of it.

896
41:33.330 --> 41:38.330
So I wanna end our discussion here with a final question,

897
41:38.580 --> 41:41.010
and if you could keep your comments brief,

898
41:41.010 --> 41:43.590
what is the adjacent area that you think

899
41:43.590 --> 41:47.040
is gonna grow the most in 2025?

900
41:47.040 --> 41:50.460
And it isn't professional monitored security

901
41:50.460 --> 41:52.083
as something besides that?

902
41:52.920 --> 41:57.210
And so Leah, we'll start with you, and go down the line.

903
41:57.210 --> 41:59.490
<v ->Yeah, I think I'd like to wrap it</v>

904
41:59.490 --> 42:02.010
with what we talked about in a little bit earlier,

905
42:02.010 --> 42:05.580
you know, devices and smart locks being a big part of that.

906
42:05.580 --> 42:07.380
You know, I think that as we continue

907
42:07.380 --> 42:10.050
to bring experiences into the marketplace,

908
42:10.050 --> 42:12.570
that that's what's going to really incent people

909
42:12.570 --> 42:14.580
to have new devices, more devices,

910
42:14.580 --> 42:15.780
and that stickiness factor.

911
42:15.780 --> 42:17.190
I think Abe, it was you who mentioned, you know,

912
42:17.190 --> 42:20.760
earlier that when you have more devices that are on a system

913
42:20.760 --> 42:23.190
for a consumer at home, that's more likely

914
42:23.190 --> 42:25.080
that they are to sort of stay with you.

915
42:25.080 --> 42:26.787
And so that's a big principle that we think about.

916
42:26.787 --> 42:29.220
And so when we think about enabling experiences,

917
42:29.220 --> 42:31.440
creating more devices that go with it and the stickiness,

918
42:31.440 --> 42:32.640
I think that's an important part.

919
42:32.640 --> 42:34.620
And that starts with things like video cameras,

920
42:34.620 --> 42:36.063
video doorbells, and locks.

921
42:38.400 --> 42:40.230
<v ->I might take a contrarian view here.</v>

922
42:40.230 --> 42:42.480
I believe the router is gonna emerge

923
42:42.480 --> 42:46.680
as the most powerful piece of equipment in the home

924
42:46.680 --> 42:50.790
that's gonna enable a lot of things including security

925
42:50.790 --> 42:52.263
or security light.

926
42:53.160 --> 42:58.160
I'm just seeing that market take actions

927
42:58.890 --> 43:03.890
in a way that suggests delivering value to homeowners.

928
43:05.520 --> 43:10.520
And I'm excited to be a contributor to that.

929
43:11.130 --> 43:14.160
I see that as a really interesting platform.

930
43:14.160 --> 43:15.210
<v ->Yeah, great comment there.</v>

931
43:15.210 --> 43:18.150
The network and the router are of critical importance.

932
43:18.150 --> 43:19.170
Very good point.

933
43:19.170 --> 43:21.270
<v ->And I think I can kind of agree with everybody,</v>

934
43:21.270 --> 43:23.790
and think about maybe scaled security solutions

935
43:23.790 --> 43:28.740
that fit between maybe pro-install and DIY today

936
43:28.740 --> 43:29.573
as we define them.

937
43:29.573 --> 43:32.220
So something in the middle or a little orthogonal,

938
43:32.220 --> 43:34.710
and likely centered around I think video,

939
43:34.710 --> 43:37.200
certainly it's an easy sell

940
43:37.200 --> 43:38.760
and an easy thing to initially understand,

941
43:38.760 --> 43:41.020
but hopefully some more creative solutions

942
43:41.970 --> 43:44.490
that are in between the spaces we serve today.

943
43:44.490 --> 43:45.420
<v ->So a hybrid?</v>

944
43:45.420 --> 43:47.670
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Some kind of hybrid.</v>

945
43:47.670 --> 43:49.950
<v ->Yeah, I'm gonna take this in a little different direction.</v>

946
43:49.950 --> 43:51.319
When I think about adjacencies

947
43:51.319 --> 43:55.710
and as it relates to our business in terms of home access,

948
43:55.710 --> 43:58.300
one of the areas that we think is interesting

949
43:59.250 --> 44:01.380
in the new construction space

950
44:01.380 --> 44:04.020
is how do you make property touring interesting,

951
44:04.020 --> 44:06.060
or easier and more seamless?

952
44:06.060 --> 44:09.630
And so, you know, as we bring smart products into that,

953
44:09.630 --> 44:11.700
you know, new construction market,

954
44:11.700 --> 44:13.620
how can we make accessing those

955
44:13.620 --> 44:15.630
and touring those properties easier

956
44:15.630 --> 44:18.630
is one of those adjacencies that I think is interesting

957
44:18.630 --> 44:21.210
that we'll explore as a business.

958
44:21.210 --> 44:22.080
<v ->Okay, great.</v>

959
44:22.080 --> 44:23.100
That will be the last word.

960
44:23.100 --> 44:24.960
If you would please give a round of applause

961
44:24.960 --> 44:26.021
for our panelists.

962
44:26.021 --> 44:28.042
(audience applauding)

963
44:28.042 --> 44:30.625
(bright music)
