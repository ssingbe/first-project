00:01.090 --> 00:03.673
(upbeat music)

00:11.190 --> 00:12.570
<v ->Good afternoon, everyone.</v>

00:12.570 --> 00:14.130
Welcome to the future.

00:14.130 --> 00:18.000
This is the much anticipated, drum roll, right?

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Investment panel on AI investments

00:21.000 --> 00:22.920
and what is actually happening,

00:22.920 --> 00:24.570
what we actually wanna invest in.

00:24.570 --> 00:27.120
And we have an incredible panelists,

00:27.120 --> 00:29.880
a group of panelists, that we're going to invite up.

00:29.880 --> 00:34.260
And I think what's really important to recognize

00:34.260 --> 00:36.960
in this coming panel is that

00:36.960 --> 00:39.900
there are so many different angles

00:39.900 --> 00:43.203
that we're approaching this technology and its use.

00:44.520 --> 00:47.850
Well, I wanna first invite Warren Packard up.

00:47.850 --> 00:50.073
He is part of the AI Fund.

00:51.870 --> 00:53.428
Please welcome him.

00:53.428 --> 00:56.595
(audience applauding)

00:59.400 --> 01:03.115
We also have Tony Kim with BlackRock.

01:03.115 --> 01:06.282
(audience applauding)

01:15.390 --> 01:17.250
We should have music in our intros, right?

01:17.250 --> 01:19.410
It makes it a lot more exciting.

01:19.410 --> 01:23.603
We have Tien Wong with Opus8.

01:26.127 --> 01:29.294
(audience applauding)

01:30.480 --> 01:34.113
We have Alex Yeh with GMI.

01:35.365 --> 01:38.344
(audience applauding)

01:38.344 --> 01:40.427
Moyi Dang with Coinfeeds.

01:42.521 --> 01:45.688
(audience applauding)

01:46.530 --> 01:49.678
And myself, please join us.

01:49.678 --> 01:52.845
(audience applauding)

01:54.930 --> 01:58.050
So I'd like to go around the panel

01:58.050 --> 01:59.760
and just have a quick intro

01:59.760 --> 02:02.476
so that everybody here understands

02:02.476 --> 02:07.320
what exactly is the interest of the panelists in this group

02:07.320 --> 02:11.010
and what they prefer and look for.

02:11.010 --> 02:13.110
Warren, could you start this off, please?

02:13.110 --> 02:15.570
<v ->Sure, so I'm a partner at AI Fund.</v>

02:15.570 --> 02:19.230
This is Andrew Ng's venture studio.

02:19.230 --> 02:21.510
Probably many of you are familiar with Andrew

02:21.510 --> 02:25.500
who's been teaching AI and ML for decades,

02:25.500 --> 02:26.910
was the founder of Coursera

02:26.910 --> 02:30.840
and now has taught about 8 million computer scientists

02:30.840 --> 02:32.190
their trade in AI.

02:32.190 --> 02:35.970
As a venture studio, we co-found companies,

02:35.970 --> 02:40.350
so our focus is on bringing in ideas and concepts

02:40.350 --> 02:42.240
and typically we work with corporations

02:42.240 --> 02:44.940
and other venture funds and entrepreneurs

02:44.940 --> 02:48.030
to bring as a co-founder their ideas to life.

02:48.030 --> 02:51.660
So we've got resources as business founders,

02:51.660 --> 02:54.630
technology prototypers, recruiters,

02:54.630 --> 02:56.790
and of course we have investment dollars as well.

02:56.790 --> 03:00.000
So we don't invest in going concerns,

03:00.000 --> 03:02.850
we work with you to create your company

03:02.850 --> 03:06.900
and write the business plan and precede finance the company.

03:06.900 --> 03:09.750
But yeah, we're at the earliest stages.

03:09.750 --> 03:10.893
<v ->Awesome, thank you.</v>

03:12.780 --> 03:14.163
<v ->I'm Tony Kim.</v>

03:16.500 --> 03:21.500
I head up the technology investment sector at BlackRock.

03:24.660 --> 03:27.720
We're at the complete opposite end of the spectrum

03:27.720 --> 03:28.800
to Warren.

03:28.800 --> 03:33.800
So when companies get late stage before the IPO,

03:35.518 --> 03:38.790
all the way to the IPO, and then after the IPO,

03:38.790 --> 03:41.790
and then the big companies we know in the public market,

03:41.790 --> 03:43.800
that whole spectrum is where I get involved.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.270
After he builds the companies,

03:45.270 --> 03:47.073
then we vet them and say,

03:48.150 --> 03:50.820
are you worthy of investment?

03:50.820 --> 03:52.270
And that's kind of what I do.

03:53.340 --> 03:54.173
<v Denise>Thank you, Tony.</v>

03:54.173 --> 03:55.140
<v ->Great, Tien Wong.</v>

03:55.140 --> 03:57.180
And as an investor, I'm wearing two hats.

03:57.180 --> 04:00.180
One is as a direct investor in mostly post-seed,

04:00.180 --> 04:02.130
pre-A and A round companies.

04:02.130 --> 04:04.800
And I'm also a venture partner at Iron Gate Capital,

04:04.800 --> 04:08.970
which is a dual-use venture capital fund,

04:08.970 --> 04:10.830
which invest in a fund-to-fund basis.

04:10.830 --> 04:14.070
So half of our assets are deployed into fund managers

04:14.070 --> 04:15.993
and half are direct investments.

04:17.040 --> 04:20.700
And then my third hat that I wear is I assist fund managers

04:20.700 --> 04:22.440
and companies in raising capital,

04:22.440 --> 04:26.913
finding LPs and equity money for early-stage companies.

04:27.810 --> 04:28.800
<v Denise>Awesome.</v>

04:28.800 --> 04:29.850
Go ahead, Alex.
<v ->My name's Alex,</v>

04:29.850 --> 04:32.490
founder and CEO of GMI Cloud.

04:32.490 --> 04:35.460
GMI is a AI cloud company.

04:35.460 --> 04:38.430
So we enable and allow founders and enterprise

04:38.430 --> 04:40.350
to build AI instantly.

04:40.350 --> 04:43.080
So whether you have an idea

04:43.080 --> 04:45.840
and you wanna build a RAG or build a solution,

04:45.840 --> 04:47.100
we're here to help.

04:47.100 --> 04:51.070
Or enterprise, you want to enable your employees

04:52.110 --> 04:53.540
and you need to scale inferencing

04:53.540 --> 04:55.350
or you need to train internally,

04:55.350 --> 04:57.780
we're here to help to provide on-prem services

04:57.780 --> 04:59.643
or solutions for you.

05:00.656 --> 05:01.489
And so I guess,

05:01.489 --> 05:04.470
I'm on the opposite end of the investors here.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.840
You guys invest in money to the startups,

05:06.840 --> 05:10.710
and in turn startups gave their precious investment dollars

05:10.710 --> 05:12.090
to me,

05:12.090 --> 05:15.213
for me to enable them to build a really amazing product.

05:16.350 --> 05:17.183
<v ->Love that.</v>

05:17.183 --> 05:18.016
Go ahead, Moyi.

05:19.800 --> 05:21.720
<v ->Hi, so my name is Moyi.</v>

05:21.720 --> 05:24.600
I'm the founder of Coinfeeds AI.

05:24.600 --> 05:29.100
So we provide AI solutions to investment funds.

05:29.100 --> 05:32.550
So we help in investment funds, big and small,

05:32.550 --> 05:35.880
to build internal AI solutions,

05:35.880 --> 05:39.720
we connect with their own data,

05:39.720 --> 05:43.770
and we deploy securely to a virtual private cloud,

05:43.770 --> 05:46.803
we help manage permissions, et cetera.

05:48.870 --> 05:51.480
Now, the company was started in 2021

05:51.480 --> 05:54.480
where we applied AI to crypto.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.940
We were one of the first companies to do that

05:56.940 --> 06:01.710
and we sold social media analytics to investment funds.

06:01.710 --> 06:03.570
But in recent years,

06:03.570 --> 06:08.400
we focus more on providing AI solutions to investment funds.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.300
<v ->I love that.</v>

06:09.300 --> 06:12.870
So we obviously have so many different perspectives here

06:12.870 --> 06:15.510
and different angles when it comes to investing.

06:15.510 --> 06:17.733
I would love to start with you, Tony,

06:19.020 --> 06:20.670
given your background.

06:20.670 --> 06:23.850
And would love to ask more about

06:23.850 --> 06:25.830
what key factors do you consider

06:25.830 --> 06:28.530
when assessing the market potential of companies

06:28.530 --> 06:30.810
integrating AI technologies,

06:30.810 --> 06:33.510
whether in verticals like fintech, health,

06:33.510 --> 06:35.970
or broader applications.

06:35.970 --> 06:38.693
I think your perspective could be very valuable in there.

06:41.130 --> 06:46.130
<v ->So AI is a horizontal technology,</v>

06:47.853 --> 06:51.510
and yet we're an investor, right?

06:51.510 --> 06:52.380
So we're investing.

06:52.380 --> 06:56.010
And so it doesn't, per se, matter.

06:56.010 --> 06:57.570
There are principles,

06:57.570 --> 07:00.030
foundational principles for investment.

07:00.030 --> 07:02.850
I mean, it probably extends from the early stage

07:02.850 --> 07:06.090
all the way to the public market.

07:06.090 --> 07:10.530
And so there are certain, these principles of,

07:10.530 --> 07:13.083
is the market big enough?

07:14.250 --> 07:17.940
What is the competitive dynamic in the company?

07:17.940 --> 07:20.490
What is the business model,

07:20.490 --> 07:22.443
the financial profile of the company?

07:23.610 --> 07:25.050
Is there differentiation?

07:25.050 --> 07:27.150
Is there competitive edge?

07:27.150 --> 07:28.740
Is there uniqueness?

07:28.740 --> 07:30.510
What's your moat?

07:30.510 --> 07:32.040
You know, all of these,

07:32.040 --> 07:35.163
let's just call it business principles.

07:36.750 --> 07:40.860
And then you apply that prism to AI.

07:40.860 --> 07:44.580
And so it's no different to the prior cycles

07:44.580 --> 07:49.580
we've had of social media or e-commerce or SaaS,

07:49.620 --> 07:52.497
or fintech or crypto.

07:52.497 --> 07:54.510
It kind of doesn't matter.

07:54.510 --> 07:55.683
Now that said,

07:57.000 --> 07:58.413
so you take that framework,

07:59.663 --> 08:02.400
it's a universal framework of what I call,

08:02.400 --> 08:04.650
and I believe fervently,

08:04.650 --> 08:06.663
and what I believe in power laws.

08:07.770 --> 08:09.240
Every sector,

08:09.240 --> 08:12.250
every company, category

08:13.560 --> 08:16.440
follows power laws of winners and losers.

08:16.440 --> 08:20.310
And generally there are very few winners and lots of losers

08:20.310 --> 08:22.017
or mediocre companies.

08:22.017 --> 08:24.759
And so through that lens,

08:24.759 --> 08:29.400
I invest across whatever category.

08:29.400 --> 08:34.380
And so then AI is a horizontal technology

08:34.380 --> 08:36.420
and it touches many, many things,

08:36.420 --> 08:38.070
many, many industries,

08:38.070 --> 08:42.210
and then up and down what I call a stack technology.

08:42.210 --> 08:44.250
And then you apply these power law principles

08:44.250 --> 08:46.140
to every layer of the stack in AI.

08:46.140 --> 08:49.590
And that applies to then every industry vertical

08:49.590 --> 08:50.880
that AI will touch.

08:50.880 --> 08:52.200
So you follow those principles

08:52.200 --> 08:53.370
and then that gives you a lens

08:53.370 --> 08:57.953
of how we approach investing in companies in AI.

08:59.850 --> 09:00.900
<v ->That makes sense.</v>

09:00.900 --> 09:03.240
I think data is a big part of this, right?

09:03.240 --> 09:06.450
When you're going through the due diligence piece.

09:06.450 --> 09:08.250
And with that said, Moyi,

09:08.250 --> 09:11.760
you know, with Coinfeeds and the data part of you,

09:11.760 --> 09:15.420
I would love to know more about how can AI-powered analytics

09:15.420 --> 09:18.150
uncover hidden trends and patterns

09:18.150 --> 09:20.970
in financial and market data

09:20.970 --> 09:24.240
to identify promising investment opportunities,

09:24.240 --> 09:25.503
from your perspective?

09:26.910 --> 09:29.250
<v ->Yeah, so one way to think of this is</v>

09:29.250 --> 09:33.480
that AI lets us scalably do something

09:33.480 --> 09:36.183
that would take a human a very long time to do.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.943
So, for example,

09:40.680 --> 09:42.000
within our AI platforms,

09:42.000 --> 09:44.190
we have a tool that allows investors

09:44.190 --> 09:49.190
to ask the same question to a lot of different documents,

09:49.590 --> 09:52.470
such as earnings calls, for example.

09:52.470 --> 09:55.530
So you can imagine asking something like,

09:55.530 --> 09:59.190
what is this company's outlook on inflation

09:59.190 --> 10:02.730
or how does the next administration affect this company?

10:02.730 --> 10:05.070
And for the AI to summarize that

10:05.070 --> 10:07.560
across hundreds and thousands of companies

10:07.560 --> 10:11.373
and look for trends across different sectors.

10:12.810 --> 10:14.970
<v ->And is this something that you have seen</v>

10:14.970 --> 10:16.770
offers a lot of value

10:16.770 --> 10:19.410
and can summarize it pretty accurately?

10:19.410 --> 10:20.340
<v ->Yes, absolutely.</v>

10:20.340 --> 10:24.513
So you can ask the AI to condense its findings into say,

10:25.560 --> 10:28.410
something numerical so that then you can aggregate

10:28.410 --> 10:31.020
across industries for example.

10:31.020 --> 10:33.100
We're actually going to release

10:34.860 --> 10:36.753
a case study on this very soon.

10:37.650 --> 10:38.700
<v ->Love that.</v>

10:38.700 --> 10:42.840
So, Warren, since you take a different approach

10:42.840 --> 10:44.490
to investing,

10:44.490 --> 10:47.523
I'd like to hear more about, you know, just,

10:48.480 --> 10:52.050
I mean you have over 30 exits, that's pretty impressive.

10:52.050 --> 10:54.780
Don't mean to, you know, make a big deal outta that,

10:54.780 --> 10:56.823
but it is a big deal personally.

10:58.290 --> 11:00.300
I would love to hear at what stage

11:00.300 --> 11:02.970
are you investing in right now from your perspective?

11:02.970 --> 11:05.970
And I think this question also goes to Tien who's, you know,

11:05.970 --> 11:08.043
an investor as well separately.

11:09.930 --> 11:12.240
At what stage are you investing right now

11:12.240 --> 11:14.970
and what are you looking for in the investment opportunities

11:14.970 --> 11:17.040
that you ultimately close?

11:17.040 --> 11:19.260
<v ->So echoing Tony's point,</v>

11:19.260 --> 11:20.700
AI is a vertical technology.

11:20.700 --> 11:24.240
So AI in and of itself is gonna be pervasive.

11:24.240 --> 11:26.310
It's the new electricity.

11:26.310 --> 11:28.500
And so we're looking for applications

11:28.500 --> 11:30.450
that are fitting a real need

11:30.450 --> 11:32.160
in each of these different verticals.

11:32.160 --> 11:34.500
Again, what Tony was talking about.

11:34.500 --> 11:39.030
So we very deliberately look for subject matter experts

11:39.030 --> 11:40.920
in all of these different sectors,

11:40.920 --> 11:44.610
whether that's an expert in a specific domain in healthcare

11:44.610 --> 11:46.530
or in sales, automation,

11:46.530 --> 11:49.650
or marketing automation or whatever.

11:49.650 --> 11:51.510
I mean, every single vertical out there,

11:51.510 --> 11:53.400
and there's an abundance of opportunities.

11:53.400 --> 11:56.610
And we look at ourselves and say we do only two things well.

11:56.610 --> 11:57.810
Number one, we start companies,

11:57.810 --> 12:01.710
and number two, we understand the AI technology landscape

12:01.710 --> 12:03.390
and we have an opinion or a point of view

12:03.390 --> 12:04.590
on where it's going.

12:04.590 --> 12:08.370
So if you combine our expertise, if you will,

12:08.370 --> 12:09.900
in the horizontal layer

12:09.900 --> 12:12.990
with the vertical market expertise of the corporations

12:12.990 --> 12:16.050
or venture capital funds or entrepreneurs with whom we work,

12:16.050 --> 12:19.950
that's a really great recipe for creating

12:19.950 --> 12:23.070
typically B2B SaaS applications.

12:23.070 --> 12:25.990
And now SaaS is service as software

12:26.880 --> 12:31.020
where you can really implement services

12:31.020 --> 12:33.990
that can execute all the way end to end.

12:33.990 --> 12:36.840
And kind of expanding on Moyi's point there,

12:36.840 --> 12:38.790
just as an example,

12:38.790 --> 12:40.830
with the GenTech technology coming about

12:40.830 --> 12:43.020
and becoming much more pervasive,

12:43.020 --> 12:44.730
what you can do with agents

12:44.730 --> 12:48.000
when you're trying to analyze marketplaces,

12:48.000 --> 12:50.130
competition, landscapes, et cetera,

12:50.130 --> 12:52.680
you can have each of these agents

12:52.680 --> 12:54.930
debate with amongst themselves

12:54.930 --> 12:57.180
and come up with a much more optimal answer

12:57.180 --> 13:00.120
than you could have six months ago let's say.

13:00.120 --> 13:01.920
If you just, for instance,

13:01.920 --> 13:04.470
were just training on a single data set

13:04.470 --> 13:06.960
and having a single LLM generate a summary.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.090
Now you can have all these different perspectives

13:09.090 --> 13:10.380
from all these different agents.

13:10.380 --> 13:12.480
So it could be that somebody comes to us

13:12.480 --> 13:15.120
with an expertise in a certain area,

13:15.120 --> 13:18.600
we apply the latest in agentic technology

13:18.600 --> 13:21.990
or multimodal or local LLMs or whatever.

13:21.990 --> 13:25.080
And we're able to prototype that extremely quickly,

13:25.080 --> 13:27.780
hire the CEO, board member,

13:27.780 --> 13:29.970
the first five employees, finance the company,

13:29.970 --> 13:32.400
and get the company up and running extremely rapidly

13:32.400 --> 13:35.460
'cause speed and time into market is absolutely crucial.

13:35.460 --> 13:38.160
And hopefully we build something that has staying power,

13:38.160 --> 13:40.140
and Tony looks at it and says,

13:40.140 --> 13:42.570
yeah, this is something I want to get into.

13:42.570 --> 13:45.030
<v ->That's why I sat you guys together, just saying.</v>

13:45.030 --> 13:45.863
I'm kidding.

13:45.863 --> 13:48.720
Tien, I would love to hear your feedback on that as well.

13:48.720 --> 13:51.690
<v ->Yeah, I mean it's just like Tony had mentioned,</v>

13:51.690 --> 13:53.430
this is a horizontal technology,

13:53.430 --> 13:54.660
it's an enabling technology.

13:54.660 --> 13:57.180
I think the most recent example

13:57.180 --> 13:59.850
might be to follow what happened with cloud computing

13:59.850 --> 14:01.440
and application migration.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.770
And as far as our investment, you know,

14:04.770 --> 14:08.430
we're not investing in pure play horizontal technologies

14:08.430 --> 14:09.263
and AI,

14:09.263 --> 14:12.180
we're investing in companies that are, like Warren said,

14:12.180 --> 14:14.730
in specific verticals with specific management teams

14:14.730 --> 14:17.790
that have core expertise that can move very quickly

14:17.790 --> 14:18.810
and have the agility

14:18.810 --> 14:22.050
to sort of deal with the competitive dynamics

14:22.050 --> 14:23.280
in the marketplace.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.990
I think to your first question,

14:24.990 --> 14:29.550
I did want to bring up two points in looking at factors

14:29.550 --> 14:31.800
and they are regulatory and ethical,

14:31.800 --> 14:33.840
which we don't really hear too much about,

14:33.840 --> 14:36.600
but as an investor, you know, you wanna look at risk factors

14:36.600 --> 14:38.490
that can take down your whole company.

14:38.490 --> 14:41.490
And companies can be taken down by regulatory

14:41.490 --> 14:44.520
and ethical missteps for a variety of different reasons.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.380
So very, very hard diligence.

14:46.380 --> 14:48.300
I don't know if there's an AI tool

14:48.300 --> 14:51.750
that you can develop that might be able to diligence that,

14:51.750 --> 14:54.750
but certainly those are two very big sort of clouds.

14:54.750 --> 14:56.730
And as a dual-use investor works,

14:56.730 --> 15:00.180
very, very sensitive to regulatory risk

15:00.180 --> 15:03.903
and ethical considerations in the deployment of AI.

15:05.160 --> 15:07.500
<v ->I just wanna elaborate on some of the comments</v>

15:07.500 --> 15:08.333
just made here.

15:08.333 --> 15:13.333
So both generally venture-early investors,

15:13.620 --> 15:17.070
I'm later private and public investor,

15:17.070 --> 15:22.070
and focusing on vertical AI for industries, two things,

15:25.452 --> 15:30.452
these big horizontal layers at the bottom of the stack,

15:31.200 --> 15:35.550
the infrastructure, the silicon, the cloud,

15:35.550 --> 15:37.410
even the model,

15:37.410 --> 15:40.480
this is tens to hundreds of billions of dollars

15:41.490 --> 15:42.423
to play the game.

15:43.350 --> 15:45.930
So this, in many ways,

15:45.930 --> 15:47.850
there are few very big,

15:47.850 --> 15:50.430
very few companies and each one of these

15:50.430 --> 15:52.593
that can play that game.

15:53.430 --> 15:56.040
Warren is at the very top,

15:56.040 --> 15:58.140
and you could see,

15:58.140 --> 16:00.810
they're picking off at the application layer

16:00.810 --> 16:05.370
and, I think, in a very prescient comment about services.

16:05.370 --> 16:09.330
So in the last era it was all about SaaS,

16:09.330 --> 16:10.650
which is the application layer,

16:10.650 --> 16:14.673
which is software running on CPU and a small database.

16:15.540 --> 16:18.660
And now, you have AI that will basically take,

16:18.660 --> 16:21.420
and agents will take over SaaS, I think.

16:21.420 --> 16:24.720
And not only that, it will start eating into

16:24.720 --> 16:26.880
the human service layer.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.790
So now you're gonna have new kinds of companies

16:29.790 --> 16:32.430
that are vertically specifically focused.

16:32.430 --> 16:34.050
And they're not necessarily competing

16:34.050 --> 16:36.738
at this foundational horizontal layer.

16:36.738 --> 16:39.120
They're competing here

16:39.120 --> 16:41.430
and they're picking off very specific applications

16:41.430 --> 16:46.263
like call centers or, you know,

16:47.372 --> 16:49.560
medical services or whatever.

16:49.560 --> 16:52.080
And there's gonna be lots of new companies

16:52.080 --> 16:53.730
being built at that layer,

16:53.730 --> 16:57.270
and they're gonna eat into labor,

16:57.270 --> 16:59.310
and they're gonna eat into software

16:59.310 --> 17:01.080
and it's gonna be software and services

17:01.080 --> 17:04.200
combined into some kind of new kind of thing.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.090
And then you're gonna have,

17:06.090 --> 17:08.070
hopefully you're gonna have lots of new companies

17:08.070 --> 17:11.340
that are attacking the incumbent verticals

17:11.340 --> 17:12.447
at that layer of the stack.

17:12.447 --> 17:13.800
And so that's where the,

17:13.800 --> 17:15.720
I think the venture community are gonna create

17:15.720 --> 17:17.640
lots of new companies at that layer of the stack.

17:17.640 --> 17:20.340
At the bottom of the stack, you know,

17:20.340 --> 17:23.760
it's the giants that need a hundred billion dollars or more

17:23.760 --> 17:24.693
to play that game.

17:25.819 --> 17:26.700
And so you're not gonna have,

17:26.700 --> 17:29.980
it's gonna be very, very difficult to have new companies

17:30.840 --> 17:33.570
interject themselves at that layer of the stack.

17:33.570 --> 17:34.560
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

17:34.560 --> 17:38.520
So I think that's a perfect time to have Alex jump in

17:38.520 --> 17:40.470
with his expertise.

17:40.470 --> 17:43.320
Alex, you know, regarding risk mitigation

17:43.320 --> 17:45.270
when it comes to AI ventures,

17:45.270 --> 17:48.213
what unique risks do you encounter

17:48.213 --> 17:50.370
when investing or dealing with companies,

17:50.370 --> 17:53.130
with the AI-driven startups and infrastructure projects

17:53.130 --> 17:54.780
and how do you mitigate those risks

17:54.780 --> 17:58.080
to ensure sustainability and returns?

17:58.080 --> 18:00.780
<v ->What Tony said it was exactly right,</v>

18:00.780 --> 18:04.170
to play in the infrastructure game, in the LLM game,

18:04.170 --> 18:06.540
you need a hundred million to start,

18:06.540 --> 18:09.180
that's the minimum ticket size that you need.

18:09.180 --> 18:12.360
And I think the stages are already set.

18:12.360 --> 18:15.630
People who are on the poker table, it's already set.

18:15.630 --> 18:17.400
And I think in the next few years

18:17.400 --> 18:20.220
there will be a washout wave in M&amp;A

18:20.220 --> 18:22.950
across the infrastructure space, right?

18:22.950 --> 18:24.900
And then across that, right,

18:24.900 --> 18:28.650
there will be a lot of different called software stack

18:28.650 --> 18:30.758
sitting on top of infrastructure.

18:30.758 --> 18:31.950
'Cause we're kind of the natural,

18:31.950 --> 18:34.470
I would say vertical solution company, right?

18:34.470 --> 18:39.470
So we buy a lot of NVIDIA's silicon GPUs,

18:39.990 --> 18:42.180
and we also have to build a lot of software solutions

18:42.180 --> 18:43.620
on top, right?

18:43.620 --> 18:46.863
Memory optimization that allows LM to train faster,

18:47.790 --> 18:50.550
token cost to be lower on the inferencing side,

18:50.550 --> 18:52.470
providing different kinds of LMs,

18:52.470 --> 18:56.820
all the latest open-source LLMs like DeepSeek V3 whatnot,

18:56.820 --> 18:59.550
like we have to integrate that onto our platform, right?

18:59.550 --> 19:00.600
That allows, you know,

19:00.600 --> 19:04.920
our customers to use it more efficiently.

19:04.920 --> 19:06.170
So that's why I see that,

19:07.170 --> 19:11.040
there are some like inference-specific companies

19:11.040 --> 19:13.110
that I think will consolidate,

19:13.110 --> 19:15.480
and it'll be a natural buyer from the,

19:15.480 --> 19:17.340
I would say the hyperscalers,

19:17.340 --> 19:20.090
because they have a lot of, I would say customer group.

19:20.940 --> 19:24.240
In terms of risk, I think there will be two things.

19:24.240 --> 19:25.410
I would like to break that down into,

19:25.410 --> 19:28.560
one is enterprise and startup, right?

19:28.560 --> 19:32.070
So on the enterprise side, number one thing,

19:32.070 --> 19:33.840
number one risk I would say is security

19:33.840 --> 19:35.340
and security and security.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.420
Nothing else matter, right?

19:36.420 --> 19:39.000
Cost, I think is a relative term.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.800
You can choose a neo cloud that will,

19:40.800 --> 19:44.070
I think will be able to significantly lower that cost,

19:44.070 --> 19:47.700
compute costs relative to hyperscalers.

19:47.700 --> 19:52.700
Security is because for manufacturing or for chip design

19:52.980 --> 19:54.783
or data-sensitive companies,

19:56.010 --> 19:58.443
most of our data are on-prem still, right?

19:59.370 --> 20:00.990
And it's really,

20:00.990 --> 20:03.060
they're sitting on, I would say a gold mine.

20:03.060 --> 20:06.930
And AI is just, you know, a fancy word,

20:06.930 --> 20:09.090
but it's just data, right?

20:09.090 --> 20:12.573
Extracting valuable information from that.

20:14.266 --> 20:15.099
And so,

20:15.990 --> 20:18.780
the cool thing about this wave, I mean,

20:18.780 --> 20:22.110
to make this data insightful

20:22.110 --> 20:24.300
is you have to break down all the walls, right?

20:24.300 --> 20:26.310
Think about a large enterprise.

20:26.310 --> 20:29.190
A large enterprise, you have different data silo, right?

20:29.190 --> 20:33.720
HR have their own tool, solutions, right, data silo.

20:33.720 --> 20:35.370
Sales have their own figures.

20:35.370 --> 20:37.560
Finance obviously have theirs, right?

20:37.560 --> 20:39.930
So, it's probably stored different, elsewhere.

20:39.930 --> 20:44.550
One maybe in Oracle, one in AWS, one in GCP, right?

20:44.550 --> 20:46.380
But in order to extract insights,

20:46.380 --> 20:49.020
you have to break down all the walls, right?

20:49.020 --> 20:50.820
So I think that becomes an issue.

20:50.820 --> 20:52.680
And here it comes to the next point

20:52.680 --> 20:54.210
I wanna make on the enterprise side,

20:54.210 --> 20:57.420
which is IAM, user access management, right?

20:57.420 --> 21:01.560
So for example, if a sales person next to you

21:01.560 --> 21:04.650
ask the LM and say, hey, who's the sales figure?

21:04.650 --> 21:06.400
What's this bonus from last quarter

21:07.350 --> 21:08.910
asking for another sales, right?

21:08.910 --> 21:09.870
You can't have that, right?

21:09.870 --> 21:14.870
So there will be I would say vertical cut, right,

21:16.080 --> 21:18.600
and horizontal cuts based on kind of the levels.

21:18.600 --> 21:20.130
And each company is built different.

21:20.130 --> 21:22.170
All the data is different.

21:22.170 --> 21:25.650
So I think that's an issue for a large enterprise

21:25.650 --> 21:26.850
when they want to deploy AI.

21:26.850 --> 21:30.090
Because agentic AI is one of the easiest,

21:30.090 --> 21:31.830
I would say no-brainer,

21:31.830 --> 21:34.530
for any enterprise to adopt like right now, right?

21:34.530 --> 21:37.260
It just increased productivity for all their employees.

21:37.260 --> 21:39.210
Instead of asking for HR

21:39.210 --> 21:41.340
and they'll get back to you in a day, right,

21:41.340 --> 21:45.510
you can ask the AI instantly and get a feedback.

21:45.510 --> 21:49.350
But having a robust IAM system will be very important.

21:49.350 --> 21:53.020
And how you store that data cost-effectively

21:53.940 --> 21:55.890
also will be in our problem.

21:55.890 --> 21:58.740
And once you say, figure it out,

21:58.740 --> 22:00.630
fine train and fine tune,

22:00.630 --> 22:02.430
then will be starting to inference.

22:02.430 --> 22:05.280
And initially,

22:05.280 --> 22:07.980
company enterprise will probably start internally,

22:07.980 --> 22:10.367
so it will be hit, you know,

22:10.367 --> 22:13.080
a thousand or 10,000 times or QPS, right,

22:13.080 --> 22:14.400
queries per second.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.530
And if it's stored on-prem,

22:16.530 --> 22:17.850
then it will start a lot of issues

22:17.850 --> 22:20.490
because now the server can't handle, right?

22:20.490 --> 22:24.210
And you're too afraid to go to open that to public

22:24.210 --> 22:26.850
because you're dealing with sensitive data.

22:26.850 --> 22:29.760
So to scaling that is also infrastructure issues.

22:29.760 --> 22:32.190
And so we're helping enterprise

22:32.190 --> 22:33.660
to think through all that problem.

22:33.660 --> 22:37.830
So I would say we're almost like a consultation,

22:37.830 --> 22:40.410
consultant for them to solve that problem,

22:40.410 --> 22:43.440
so that's like, I see on the enterprise side.

22:43.440 --> 22:44.520
In terms of startup,

22:44.520 --> 22:47.610
it's speed,

22:47.610 --> 22:50.790
scale and ease of use, right?

22:50.790 --> 22:52.950
They don't wanna wait six months.

22:52.950 --> 22:54.663
They want it now, right?

22:57.180 --> 22:58.200
And also cost,

22:58.200 --> 23:00.270
because all other,

23:00.270 --> 23:05.270
I mean, not intend to kind of talk it OpenAI,

23:05.400 --> 23:08.730
but when Sora came out,

23:08.730 --> 23:11.100
it was so beautiful, six months ago, right?

23:11.100 --> 23:11.973
But now,

23:13.260 --> 23:14.460
six months later,

23:14.460 --> 23:19.460
it's okay compared to other video generative companies.

23:19.470 --> 23:22.320
So speed matters a lot to startups, right?

23:22.320 --> 23:27.320
So I think providing scaled GPU usage to startups

23:27.510 --> 23:29.430
will be very important.

23:29.430 --> 23:32.550
And also second point is ease of use, right?

23:32.550 --> 23:33.783
Ease of use is,

23:35.190 --> 23:37.140
it's hard to deploy bare-metal, right?

23:37.140 --> 23:40.740
It's much easier to use API keys,

23:40.740 --> 23:43.380
to deploy whatever model they want.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.270
And they don't wanna spend time

23:45.270 --> 23:48.210
on dealing with infrastructure either, right?

23:48.210 --> 23:50.370
Imagine like you're just spinning up a website

23:50.370 --> 23:52.320
and you have to think about whether your server

23:52.320 --> 23:53.460
will go up or down,

23:53.460 --> 23:58.440
and what's the variables that you have to tune,

23:58.440 --> 24:00.510
that's too much work.

24:00.510 --> 24:03.090
So you wanna rely that on to infrastructure.

24:03.090 --> 24:06.160
So I guess that would be opportunities and risks that I see

24:07.530 --> 24:10.260
in terms of enterprise and startups.

24:10.260 --> 24:11.940
<v ->Thank you for that.</v>

24:11.940 --> 24:13.620
I think another aspect to this

24:13.620 --> 24:15.360
is the cost savings piece, right?

24:15.360 --> 24:16.860
When you're using AI models

24:16.860 --> 24:20.370
to analyze potential investments.

24:20.370 --> 24:22.350
Tony, I would really like to hear your feedback

24:22.350 --> 24:24.690
on that as well as Warren and Tien,

24:24.690 --> 24:26.310
from an investor perspective,

24:26.310 --> 24:27.570
when you're looking through that,

24:27.570 --> 24:29.100
you know, from the cost savings.

24:29.100 --> 24:30.930
<v ->Let's just talk cost.</v>

24:30.930 --> 24:34.050
Well, AI, I see really two vectors,

24:34.050 --> 24:37.410
there's efficiency, which is cost,

24:37.410 --> 24:41.070
and then there are breakthroughs,

24:41.070 --> 24:43.140
beyond cost, okay?

24:43.140 --> 24:44.640
So yeah, of course,

24:44.640 --> 24:48.173
in enterprise, which is, you know, the big,

24:48.173 --> 24:52.290
there's a hundred trillion dollar GDP, right?

24:52.290 --> 24:53.890
It's a hundred trillion dollars.

24:54.900 --> 24:59.900
IT spending is, you know, small percentage of that GDP.

25:00.090 --> 25:03.330
You know the biggest single-dollar item

25:03.330 --> 25:06.033
in that hundred trillion dollars is labor.

25:06.990 --> 25:09.180
So labor is two-thirds,

25:09.180 --> 25:12.693
70, 60, 70% of an enterprise's spend.

25:13.590 --> 25:18.590
So agents, AI, productivity, co-pilots,

25:18.990 --> 25:21.690
on and on and on and on, they attack,

25:21.690 --> 25:22.560
at the end of the day,

25:22.560 --> 25:27.390
they're gonna attack the central biggest line item of cost,

25:27.390 --> 25:28.800
that is labor.

25:28.800 --> 25:32.610
And so Warren brought up, he's building vertical apps

25:32.610 --> 25:36.060
that have this kind of service element to it

25:36.060 --> 25:37.740
with AI software.

25:37.740 --> 25:40.830
So to me, that is the biggest single biggest opportunity.

25:40.830 --> 25:42.420
And you're seeing it,

25:42.420 --> 25:45.960
you're seeing it, people are even saying it's digital labor,

25:45.960 --> 25:47.370
digital workers,

25:47.370 --> 25:51.780
and if you can reduce cost efficiency, et cetera,

25:51.780 --> 25:52.613
that's number one.

25:52.613 --> 25:54.960
So this is going to be a narrative vein

25:54.960 --> 25:58.140
that will extend for the next, you know, five years

25:58.140 --> 26:02.310
as agents become more, more widespread.

26:02.310 --> 26:07.080
So that's efficiency cost in my opinion.

26:07.080 --> 26:08.550
That's what's gonna happen.

26:08.550 --> 26:12.240
Because IT budgets are not growing to the sky,

26:12.240 --> 26:14.100
they're growing GDP plus.

26:14.100 --> 26:16.500
So where are you gonna buy all this compute?

26:16.500 --> 26:18.630
You're gonna bring all this new stuff in?

26:18.630 --> 26:19.980
Where's the budget coming from?

26:19.980 --> 26:21.450
Well, you gotta take it out,

26:21.450 --> 26:23.820
you've gotta take the dollar out of something

26:23.820 --> 26:25.560
to fund all of this spend.

26:25.560 --> 26:29.010
To me, the single biggest thing is the labor.

26:29.010 --> 26:32.730
So that's, I think that's gonna be a big push.

26:32.730 --> 26:36.630
Then there's AI that has nothing to do with that.

26:36.630 --> 26:41.010
And you saw that at Jensen's keynote on Monday.

26:41.010 --> 26:45.333
It is AI for breakthroughs, scientific breakthroughs,

26:46.470 --> 26:51.060
that unlock things that potentially,

26:51.060 --> 26:53.640
that has nothing to do with cost savings and efficiencies.

26:53.640 --> 26:57.900
Can we achieve breakthroughs in biology and materials

26:57.900 --> 27:00.925
and chemistry and autonomy?

27:00.925 --> 27:04.110
And that brings a different kind of dynamic

27:04.110 --> 27:07.680
that is what I call a net additive to the market

27:07.680 --> 27:09.600
than just cost efficiency.

27:09.600 --> 27:13.323
So both of these things are gonna probably parallelize.

27:14.220 --> 27:16.443
So that's what I think on cost.

27:18.180 --> 27:20.430
<v ->Yeah, well, it's a great answer.</v>

27:20.430 --> 27:25.230
And, you know, our companies at the very earliest stages,

27:25.230 --> 27:28.710
you know, many of them are focused on doing the same job,

27:28.710 --> 27:30.780
just significantly lower cost,

27:30.780 --> 27:33.153
so, you know, scenario number one.

27:34.290 --> 27:35.760
A few of our companies

27:35.760 --> 27:38.670
are working on the absolute breakthrough technologies.

27:38.670 --> 27:41.070
And I mean, I'm gonna be very candid.

27:41.070 --> 27:45.120
Like I would love to spend 95% of my time on the innovations

27:45.120 --> 27:49.115
that are gonna completely disrupt industries and like,

27:49.115 --> 27:49.948
you know, healthcare,

27:49.948 --> 27:53.280
you know, we're gonna truly have personalized medicine,

27:53.280 --> 27:55.230
we're gonna know each of our personal genomes

27:55.230 --> 27:58.620
and we're gonna be able to prescribe molecules that,

27:58.620 --> 28:02.040
you know, cure our cold and we're over it,

28:02.040 --> 28:05.130
and, you know, it's like those old Star Trek episodes.

28:05.130 --> 28:06.360
You know, somebody has kidney failure

28:06.360 --> 28:09.270
and Bones gives them a shot and, you know,

28:09.270 --> 28:10.830
you're done with your kidney failure.

28:10.830 --> 28:11.760
That's what I wanna work on.

28:11.760 --> 28:14.310
But the reality, I believe,

28:14.310 --> 28:16.710
and it's gonna, it's gonna get closer and closer

28:16.710 --> 28:18.450
to where we can play in that.

28:18.450 --> 28:20.340
But that's still,

28:20.340 --> 28:25.340
at fundamentally larger capital expenditure,

28:26.580 --> 28:29.220
especially if you're talking about like healthcare.

28:29.220 --> 28:32.340
I know that Tony's involved with a quantum computer company,

28:32.340 --> 28:34.260
these are things that we can't get involved with.

28:34.260 --> 28:35.520
But all that being said,

28:35.520 --> 28:37.050
there's a lot of low-hanging fruit

28:37.050 --> 28:39.210
where there's a significant amount

28:39.210 --> 28:41.760
and percentage of cost savings that can accrue

28:41.760 --> 28:43.260
into these vertical markets.

28:43.260 --> 28:45.870
And because those can be funded with,

28:45.870 --> 28:48.180
our pre-seed check is a million dollars.

28:48.180 --> 28:52.500
And Tony doesn't wake up for, you know, 10 million bucks.

28:52.500 --> 28:54.930
I don't wanna speak for him but,

28:54.930 --> 28:56.490
lose change in his couch, you know.

28:56.490 --> 28:58.440
<v ->But, you know, just think about it,</v>

28:58.440 --> 29:00.920
1% savings on a hundred trillion dollars

29:00.920 --> 29:02.020
is a trillion dollars.

29:02.910 --> 29:04.410
Okay and then the market,

29:04.410 --> 29:07.173
S&amp;P's trading at, I don't know, 20 times?

29:08.130 --> 29:12.150
You could capitalize $20 trillion of market value

29:12.150 --> 29:14.550
with 1% savings.

29:14.550 --> 29:16.170
<v Denise>Exactly.</v>

29:16.170 --> 29:17.010
<v ->That's on cost.</v>

29:17.010 --> 29:19.560
But imagine if you create new creation.

29:19.560 --> 29:21.270
<v Denise>Yeah.</v>
<v ->Of breakthroughs</v>

29:21.270 --> 29:23.250
and then that's on top of just, you know,

29:23.250 --> 29:25.470
AI is on one hand,

29:25.470 --> 29:27.690
yeah, we're gonna be hyper fixated

29:27.690 --> 29:30.570
in the tactical near term about cost, cost, cost,

29:30.570 --> 29:32.760
efficiency, efficiency, efficiency.

29:32.760 --> 29:33.593
But like Warren said,

29:33.593 --> 29:35.930
it's more fun to be betting on the breakthroughs.

29:38.713 --> 29:39.690
But to fund, you know,

29:39.690 --> 29:43.110
these multi-trillion dollar AI CapEx investments

29:43.110 --> 29:44.940
that's coming in the next decade,

29:44.940 --> 29:46.260
how are you gonna pay for that?

29:46.260 --> 29:48.540
You know, you gotta come out of something.

29:48.540 --> 29:49.980
<v ->Exactly.</v>

29:49.980 --> 29:52.050
So from a practical standpoint,

29:52.050 --> 29:56.970
what do you feel is right now the common trend, Moyi,

29:56.970 --> 30:00.510
when it comes to what typical startups

30:00.510 --> 30:02.580
from a data perspective

30:02.580 --> 30:06.240
tend to be the go-to startups to try to fund

30:06.240 --> 30:09.720
or, you know, that are getting a lot of traction right now

30:09.720 --> 30:11.070
from a data perspective?

30:11.070 --> 30:13.863
And I would love to hear your opinion too, Tien.

30:17.940 --> 30:19.980
<v ->Okay, well so,</v>

30:19.980 --> 30:21.720
well, I'm not an investor,

30:21.720 --> 30:22.863
so I don't really,

30:24.990 --> 30:27.030
I'm not sure this is what you're looking for.

30:27.030 --> 30:27.900
<v Denise>No, no, no.</v>

30:27.900 --> 30:29.350
What I meant is from like a data perspective.

30:29.350 --> 30:30.570
<v ->Okay.</v>
<v Denise>When you see</v>

30:30.570 --> 30:33.780
what the companies that you are evaluating right now,

30:33.780 --> 30:35.400
what do they tend to be?

30:35.400 --> 30:37.920
What verticals do they tend to be in?

30:37.920 --> 30:42.150
<v ->Well, one trend that I see is,</v>

30:42.150 --> 30:43.720
I would argue that

30:45.960 --> 30:48.490
companies in almost every industry

30:49.590 --> 30:51.843
needs an internal AI platform,

30:52.860 --> 30:55.890
which is an evolution of a machine learning platform,

30:55.890 --> 30:59.673
which used to be found only in the big tech companies.

31:01.290 --> 31:04.470
And the reason for this is that

31:04.470 --> 31:07.263
AI is a truly transformational technology,

31:08.100 --> 31:10.743
as others have alluded to here.

31:13.302 --> 31:17.250
AI agents can increase productivity

31:17.250 --> 31:22.250
for many different teams across many verticals of a company.

31:23.970 --> 31:25.413
And at the same time,

31:26.400 --> 31:28.980
AI is a full stack problem.

31:28.980 --> 31:32.040
It isn't really just, you know,

31:32.040 --> 31:33.930
machine learning or data science.

31:33.930 --> 31:37.050
It goes back to the data,

31:37.050 --> 31:38.500
the quality of the data

31:40.440 --> 31:41.910
and how that data,

31:41.910 --> 31:43.323
where that data is stored,

31:44.820 --> 31:48.030
the model risks, the model deployment.

31:48.030 --> 31:52.320
So all of those best practices can be applied

31:52.320 --> 31:56.850
and used across different divisions in the company.

31:56.850 --> 31:57.683
<v ->That makes sense.</v>

31:57.683 --> 31:59.380
Tien, would you like to add a few comments?

31:59.380 --> 32:02.163
<v ->Yeah, I mean, we're looking at mostly digital health,</v>

32:03.720 --> 32:06.180
health technology as well as biotechnology

32:06.180 --> 32:08.280
and drug development for AI,

32:08.280 --> 32:11.490
specifically application-wise and also CRM.

32:11.490 --> 32:13.413
So I come from a CRM background.

32:15.300 --> 32:19.140
We are already seeing 80% reduction of labor costs

32:19.140 --> 32:21.570
for lower to middle.

32:21.570 --> 32:26.570
I'd like to know what the $70 trillion worth of labor.

32:26.790 --> 32:28.170
How much of that is lower or middle,

32:28.170 --> 32:30.810
because there's gonna be some major disruption.

32:30.810 --> 32:33.000
But the fun part about,

32:33.000 --> 32:35.370
let's say the CRM, let's take that for an example,

32:35.370 --> 32:39.030
you're gonna see personalized customer service,

32:39.030 --> 32:40.050
customer experience,

32:40.050 --> 32:41.520
and, you know, companies,

32:41.520 --> 32:44.700
the big brands are looking at trying to enhance LTV

32:44.700 --> 32:49.700
and purchase amounts and longevity of the relationship

32:50.640 --> 32:51.473
by doing that.

32:51.473 --> 32:53.250
So that's kind of the cool part of the AI.

32:53.250 --> 32:54.900
And on the CRM labor side,

32:54.900 --> 32:57.510
yeah, you're seeing at least in 80% reduction,

32:57.510 --> 32:59.220
in some cases more.

32:59.220 --> 33:00.117
But yeah,

33:00.117 --> 33:04.380
and we are looking at a lot of technology in that space.

33:04.380 --> 33:06.900
It's all agent-driven for the most part.

33:06.900 --> 33:08.700
And it's pretty low-hanging fruit, I think.

33:08.700 --> 33:10.110
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

33:10.110 --> 33:12.480
So I'm gonna jump a little bit to a different topic

33:12.480 --> 33:14.370
that I think since we have limited time

33:14.370 --> 33:18.570
is very important to address is the diversity factor, right?

33:18.570 --> 33:20.370
As we're gathering data,

33:20.370 --> 33:22.680
other panels have talked about

33:22.680 --> 33:26.460
making sure that the data that's being fed into these models

33:26.460 --> 33:28.950
come from very diverse backgrounds that are practical

33:28.950 --> 33:33.090
and that apply to the use case within that vertical.

33:33.090 --> 33:35.040
So Warren, would you like to share a little bit

33:35.040 --> 33:35.873
about that too?

33:35.873 --> 33:38.110
And then Alex, I'd love for you to follow that.

33:39.180 --> 33:40.013
<v ->Yeah, I mean,</v>

33:40.013 --> 33:43.170
clearly if you're gonna be catering to a global economy,

33:43.170 --> 33:45.030
you need data that represents

33:45.030 --> 33:48.725
the global perspective, et cetera.

33:48.725 --> 33:50.190
I mean, you think about healthcare immediately

33:50.190 --> 33:51.060
where there's been,

33:51.060 --> 33:53.610
and hopefully this is getting at the answer to the question,

33:53.610 --> 33:54.750
but like in healthcare,

33:54.750 --> 33:56.880
there's been lots and lots of studies

33:56.880 --> 33:59.460
on white middle-aged males,

33:59.460 --> 34:02.160
and yet the diversity of our population in the US

34:02.160 --> 34:03.120
and of course globally,

34:03.120 --> 34:04.680
doesn't represent that whatsoever.

34:04.680 --> 34:07.350
You're not gonna be able to advance healthcare

34:07.350 --> 34:09.570
if you're not looking at a diverse data set

34:09.570 --> 34:11.970
that represents everybody across the board.

34:11.970 --> 34:13.140
If you're looking at consumers

34:13.140 --> 34:14.640
and you're trying to do market research

34:14.640 --> 34:17.340
and you're looking to sell to a diverse customer base,

34:17.340 --> 34:20.430
you need data that represents your diverse customer base.

34:20.430 --> 34:24.900
So ultimately, we have an obligation,

34:24.900 --> 34:25.733
it's not even,

34:25.733 --> 34:27.870
there's an economic motive

34:27.870 --> 34:31.290
there have diversity across our data sets,

34:31.290 --> 34:33.870
to have diversity in our workforces,

34:33.870 --> 34:37.020
and to be able to serve a truly global population.

34:37.020 --> 34:39.540
There is no company in our portfolio

34:39.540 --> 34:44.040
that is not going after ultimately the global marketplace.

34:44.040 --> 34:46.590
And that is as diverse as it gets.

34:46.590 --> 34:49.240
And that's what you need your data to be represented.

34:50.996 --> 34:52.268
<v ->Yeah, I think that is,</v>

34:52.268 --> 34:53.820
that is a very interesting insight.

34:53.820 --> 34:55.590
So I would like to talk about

34:55.590 --> 34:57.690
in terms of like sovereign AI side, right?

34:58.560 --> 35:01.830
So people have said, you know, AI is racist, whatnot, right?

35:01.830 --> 35:03.270
But it's actually just a data problem,

35:03.270 --> 35:05.280
because just on the dataset it's trained to train

35:05.280 --> 35:06.990
on all the publicly available data

35:06.990 --> 35:09.660
is skewed towards a certain groups, right?

35:09.660 --> 35:10.710
Just the way it is.

35:10.710 --> 35:13.560
That's why each nation state or company

35:13.560 --> 35:15.450
will develop their own AI, right?

35:15.450 --> 35:17.430
For example, if you ask OpenAI,

35:17.430 --> 35:20.700
say, hey, what is the best udon place in Kyoto?

35:20.700 --> 35:21.750
They probably won't know,

35:21.750 --> 35:24.510
because it does not have that data, right?

35:24.510 --> 35:26.100
It's the way it is.

35:26.100 --> 35:28.080
And so that's why it's very important

35:28.080 --> 35:33.080
to have a local language LLM in areas, right?

35:33.390 --> 35:35.253
And maybe create some sort of MOE,

35:36.450 --> 35:37.620
mixture of experts, right,

35:37.620 --> 35:39.660
so when you're asking a question,

35:39.660 --> 35:41.340
it would just automatically,

35:41.340 --> 35:45.270
so you go through a first layer of LLM that sorts

35:45.270 --> 35:49.830
which agent or which LLM to ask a question to

35:49.830 --> 35:52.770
and use that LLM specifically for that data.

35:52.770 --> 35:56.310
I think that's your answer towards kind of diversity,

35:56.310 --> 35:59.430
which is, you know, you create different domain-specific

35:59.430 --> 36:04.260
or area-specific or geolocation-specific LLM model

36:04.260 --> 36:05.610
that have different insights.

36:05.610 --> 36:07.260
And when you ask that question,

36:07.260 --> 36:10.110
then you'll be able to have a more much accurate answer.

36:10.110 --> 36:11.520
<v Denise>That's great, thanks.</v>

36:11.520 --> 36:13.530
<v ->I would just add on the data thing.</v>

36:13.530 --> 36:16.060
I think there's a lot of these questions are about

36:17.730 --> 36:21.750
this diversity question is around human data,

36:21.750 --> 36:22.950
human-created data,

36:22.950 --> 36:26.463
but it's already all been consumed.

36:27.510 --> 36:30.303
The vast majority of human-created data is already,

36:32.103 --> 36:33.330
is at least the publicly available data

36:33.330 --> 36:35.520
for the most part is already been pre-trained.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.290
It's already done in the pre-training.

36:37.290 --> 36:39.450
And so, you know,

36:39.450 --> 36:42.570
you hear that you're running out of pre-training data

36:42.570 --> 36:44.230
for human side.

36:44.230 --> 36:47.790
And then you have this other kinds of scaling laws,

36:47.790 --> 36:50.430
which is extending now to what they call it inference time

36:50.430 --> 36:53.610
or test time compute, which is a different kind of thing.

36:53.610 --> 36:56.730
And it is not about just pre-training on,

36:56.730 --> 36:58.860
oh, let's get this data set in the Middle East

36:58.860 --> 37:00.063
and the Asian people.

37:00.960 --> 37:04.080
For the most part, that's already been done, okay?

37:04.080 --> 37:08.190
So this test time or inference compute

37:08.190 --> 37:09.720
is gonna be this reasoning models.

37:09.720 --> 37:12.753
and then a lot of this is synthetic data.

37:14.640 --> 37:17.430
And this is like for maybe,

37:17.430 --> 37:20.580
it might be 90% synthetic data,

37:20.580 --> 37:23.010
five, 10% human data.

37:23.010 --> 37:25.890
And so especially as you enter these other domains

37:25.890 --> 37:27.630
like the physical world,

37:27.630 --> 37:30.750
robotics, autonomous driving,

37:30.750 --> 37:32.040
et cetera, et cetera,

37:32.040 --> 37:33.540
what they call world model,

37:33.540 --> 37:36.150
not a language model, but a world model,

37:36.150 --> 37:38.940
a lot of that's gonna be synthetic data generated.

37:38.940 --> 37:42.060
And so this idea of like we're fixated on,

37:42.060 --> 37:43.560
we gotta get the human data right,

37:43.560 --> 37:45.330
well, it's already been all consumed.

37:45.330 --> 37:47.610
<v ->And as far as like the founders though, Tony,</v>

37:47.610 --> 37:50.190
and also Warren and Tien,

37:50.190 --> 37:52.350
how do you feel, is it important,

37:52.350 --> 37:57.120
is that part of the ethos to have diversity in the founders?

37:57.120 --> 37:59.730
I mean, do you see a value add there

37:59.730 --> 38:03.197
or is that something that's a component that may or may not?

38:03.197 --> 38:04.439
<v ->I mean, I'm just, you know,</v>

38:04.439 --> 38:05.310
yeah, sure, yes.

38:05.310 --> 38:06.990
But you want great people,

38:06.990 --> 38:09.210
you want great leaders, great people,

38:09.210 --> 38:11.513
and they can come from everywhere in the world.

38:12.570 --> 38:13.530
<v ->Yeah, I would concur.</v>

38:13.530 --> 38:14.363
I think,

38:15.540 --> 38:17.610
the founders will find us.

38:17.610 --> 38:20.310
And so we select from the founders who do find us,

38:20.310 --> 38:22.710
and we're very proud of the diversity

38:22.710 --> 38:24.210
within our founder portfolio.

38:24.210 --> 38:28.320
But the thing we can control is the diversity of the team,

38:28.320 --> 38:31.470
the executive team, the management team,

38:31.470 --> 38:34.470
with the recruiting capabilities that we bring to bear

38:34.470 --> 38:35.970
and kind of get started.

38:35.970 --> 38:37.500
You start with a diverse group,

38:37.500 --> 38:39.330
you have a diversity of opinions.

38:39.330 --> 38:40.800
If you don't have a diversity of opinions,

38:40.800 --> 38:42.630
you automatically have group think

38:42.630 --> 38:44.070
that's not good for business.

38:44.070 --> 38:47.460
So you wanna start off on the right direction

38:47.460 --> 38:48.660
with respect to diversity.

38:48.660 --> 38:49.493
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

38:49.493 --> 38:52.560
So thank you, thank you to our amazing panelists

38:52.560 --> 38:53.610
for their perspective

38:53.610 --> 38:56.760
and for your energy in this room as well.

38:56.760 --> 38:58.019
Thank you.

38:58.019 --> 39:00.031
(audience applauding)

39:00.031 --> 39:02.614
(upbeat music)
