00:00.139 --> 00:02.722
(upbeat music)

00:10.590 --> 00:11.550
 My name is Chris Cook.

00:11.550 --> 00:14.010
I'm the president of the Mobile Electronics Association,

00:14.010 --> 00:16.883
and strangely enough, the founder of Connect2Car

00:16.883 --> 00:18.600
some 25 years ago,

00:18.600 --> 00:20.640
and I'd like to welcome all of you as attendees

00:20.640 --> 00:23.070
of CES to Las Vegas and to the first session

00:23.070 --> 00:25.860
of CES in the automotive space.

00:25.860 --> 00:30.860
This is Connect2Car, started some 25 years ago

00:30.900 --> 00:34.770
to bridge the aftermarket and the OEM.

00:34.770 --> 00:38.250
Well, OEM is really taking over CES

00:38.250 --> 00:40.410
and aftermarkets at different shows,

00:40.410 --> 00:43.770
but still serving the same purpose of connecting people

00:43.770 --> 00:48.770
to ideas and ideologies that drive the future of mobility.

00:49.050 --> 00:50.010
So this year,

00:50.010 --> 00:53.130
a lot of our speakers are gonna be looking out to 2050.

00:53.130 --> 00:54.900
We looked out to 2030 last year.

00:54.900 --> 00:56.160
We're going a little further out

00:56.160 --> 00:58.803
to get an understanding of where things are going.

01:00.308 --> 01:04.080
So this year, you'll see that this partnership, which again,

01:04.080 --> 01:07.500
has gone on for 25 years, starting with MEA,

01:07.500 --> 01:09.903
starting when I was working for CES.

01:10.830 --> 01:13.290
We have SAE, COVESA, MEMA,

01:13.290 --> 01:15.330
and AECOM all involved,

01:15.330 --> 01:16.980
and the first speaker you'll see here

01:16.980 --> 01:21.660
has joined our group, which I'll introduce in just a moment.

01:21.660 --> 01:24.660
So the whole idea of this partnership was

01:24.660 --> 01:27.540
to demonstrate collaboration among different associations

01:27.540 --> 01:29.490
and different groups

01:29.490 --> 01:31.860
in order for you to kind of see a broader view

01:31.860 --> 01:34.470
of vehicle technology in these sessions.

01:34.470 --> 01:35.670
So what you'll see starting

01:35.670 --> 01:38.280
with the mobility intel report

01:38.280 --> 01:41.100
is Steve giving a position on where we are

01:41.100 --> 01:43.650
as an industry and where we're going.

01:43.650 --> 01:46.050
Then you'll hear next level innovation,

01:46.050 --> 01:49.440
creating the ultimate vehicle experience, vehicle payments,

01:49.440 --> 01:53.310
very key one, the road ahead, vehicle safety,

01:53.310 --> 01:56.580
reducing roadway risk and saving lives.

01:56.580 --> 01:59.700
And then we'll finish it with mobility innovations.

01:59.700 --> 02:01.410
That'll be the only one besides this one

02:01.410 --> 02:03.630
that actually has PowerPoint presentations.

02:03.630 --> 02:06.750
And each one of the speakers there will be presenting

02:06.750 --> 02:09.990
their ideas that are already into automotive,

02:09.990 --> 02:12.930
but you'll see kind of a startup.

02:12.930 --> 02:16.159
That one will also have an interesting one starting off

02:16.159 --> 02:17.340
with a little campfire chat.

02:17.340 --> 02:19.170
We won't actually start a fire.

02:19.170 --> 02:22.770
Campfire chat with the leader of Volvo

02:22.770 --> 02:25.260
talking about the Camp X program

02:25.260 --> 02:28.740
and how to foster innovation as an automaker.

02:28.740 --> 02:31.500
And you see the speakers represent a pretty broad range

02:31.500 --> 02:33.900
in the vehicle technology area.

02:33.900 --> 02:36.363
So without further ado,

02:37.470 --> 02:40.260
I would like to introduce Mr. Steve Greenfield,

02:40.260 --> 02:42.780
general partner of automotive ventures

02:42.780 --> 02:46.380
and early stage automotive technology.

02:46.380 --> 02:48.180
I like to say incubator.

02:48.180 --> 02:50.580
You find the innovation, you fund the innovation,

02:50.580 --> 02:53.880
and you make the innovation happen, and an avid car guy.

02:53.880 --> 02:55.170
So we get along just great.

02:55.170 --> 02:58.950
Steve, come on up. Thank you so much for joining us.

02:58.950 --> 02:59.783
<v ->Appreciate it.</v>

03:00.750 --> 03:04.230
I'll take that from you. All right, cool.

03:04.230 --> 03:07.110
Well thanks everyone for joining me on the first day of CES,

03:07.110 --> 03:10.380
and we have a bunch of content to cover.

03:10.380 --> 03:11.970
If anyone knows me at all,

03:11.970 --> 03:13.590
I'm usually too ambitious with trying

03:13.590 --> 03:15.210
to cram a lot of content in.

03:15.210 --> 03:17.100
So we'll glance over the top of this.

03:17.100 --> 03:18.813
A couple of housekeeping things.

03:19.800 --> 03:20.970
Good, repeat it up here.

03:20.970 --> 03:23.310
Is that I'll make the presentation available

03:23.310 --> 03:24.780
to anyone who wants it.

03:24.780 --> 03:28.110
Chris will upload it to the Connected Car site,

03:28.110 --> 03:31.050
so you'll have the presentation and these videos as well.

03:31.050 --> 03:34.110
So we are recording video in the back,

03:34.110 --> 03:36.360
but if you'd like the presentation sooner,

03:36.360 --> 03:40.080
just email me at steve@automotiveventures.com,

03:40.080 --> 03:41.700
steve@automotiveventures.com,

03:41.700 --> 03:44.070
which I'll show on the very last slide today as well.

03:44.070 --> 03:47.610
And I'm happy to sit here and send it to you immediately.

03:47.610 --> 03:50.100
And if it sparks any thoughts or conversations

03:50.100 --> 03:53.790
with you or your team, happy to get on a follow-up call

03:53.790 --> 03:55.650
and have those conversations.

03:55.650 --> 03:59.580
So when Chris and I talked about extending mobility

03:59.580 --> 04:02.670
and providing a perspective into 2050, one,

04:02.670 --> 04:05.370
I think it fits very well with all of us leaving this room

04:05.370 --> 04:07.230
and going down onto the show floor.

04:07.230 --> 04:10.020
But it's pretty ambitious as you can see here,

04:10.020 --> 04:11.910
as I've divided up the agenda today.

04:11.910 --> 04:14.280
So we're only gonna have a small amount of time

04:14.280 --> 04:16.140
for each of these topics,

04:16.140 --> 04:18.930
but hopefully the content that I have here

04:18.930 --> 04:20.580
provokes thoughts.

04:20.580 --> 04:21.630
You may not agree with everything

04:21.630 --> 04:24.120
that I show you to you today, which is great as well.

04:24.120 --> 04:25.140
But like I said,

04:25.140 --> 04:27.896
you at least get the presentation afterwards

04:27.896 --> 04:29.730
and have a chance to really digest this content.

04:29.730 --> 04:32.010
So as an investor, as Chris said,

04:32.010 --> 04:34.410
we really look at the definition of mobility

04:34.410 --> 04:36.510
in terms of how we move either humans

04:36.510 --> 04:40.470
or cargo across the modalities of land, sea,

04:40.470 --> 04:42.120
air, or space.

04:42.120 --> 04:44.340
So I'm gonna take you through that journey today

04:44.340 --> 04:46.530
and we're gonna touch on all of these things.

04:46.530 --> 04:48.360
But let's start maybe most importantly

04:48.360 --> 04:50.370
with ground transportation.

04:50.370 --> 04:55.053
So if we look back to 1975 and index horsepower,

04:56.160 --> 05:00.450
CO2 emissions, and weight, and fuel efficiency,

05:00.450 --> 05:02.520
we see that cars, interestingly enough,

05:02.520 --> 05:05.550
haven't gained a lot of weight net,

05:05.550 --> 05:06.780
that they are getting fatter

05:06.780 --> 05:08.610
in the last couple of years here.

05:08.610 --> 05:12.570
But miles per gallon has doubled, horsepower has doubled,

05:12.570 --> 05:15.540
yet the emissions are about half, right?

05:15.540 --> 05:18.540
So all of these are trending in the right direction

05:18.540 --> 05:21.090
except for the fact The Economist came out six months ago

05:21.090 --> 05:24.540
with some research showing that the weight

05:24.540 --> 05:27.540
of the cars is creating killer autos,

05:27.540 --> 05:29.640
killer vehicles on American roads.

05:29.640 --> 05:33.510
So the gray line is the probability

05:33.510 --> 05:37.770
of you having a fatality in an automobile accident

05:37.770 --> 05:39.360
for your vehicle weight.

05:39.360 --> 05:42.120
So you can see obviously the heavier your car,

05:42.120 --> 05:43.617
the less likely you you are

05:43.617 --> 05:45.750
and the occupants to die.

05:45.750 --> 05:48.660
But as the other car's weight increases,

05:48.660 --> 05:52.530
there's a seven times increase for the fatality rate

05:52.530 --> 05:54.390
for vehicles based on the other car.

05:54.390 --> 05:56.670
So we're sort of in this prisoner's dilemma now, right?

05:56.670 --> 05:59.250
So if you have a 16-year-old kid,

05:59.250 --> 06:02.130
you wanna put them in a an SUV or a pickup truck

06:02.130 --> 06:04.500
because there's this escalation of weight

06:04.500 --> 06:06.420
and size on American roads.

06:06.420 --> 06:07.253
And I don't know,

06:07.253 --> 06:09.540
now that the Pandora's box has been opened,

06:09.540 --> 06:12.570
I don't know how we ever go backwards in the US.

06:12.570 --> 06:14.130
The automakers,

06:14.130 --> 06:16.740
largely in response to pressures from the Chinese

06:16.740 --> 06:18.030
that we'll get into today,

06:18.030 --> 06:20.970
have really felt the pressure over this last year.

06:20.970 --> 06:23.040
I was talking to Daniel from Bernstein

06:23.040 --> 06:24.960
and he expects it to be an exciting year

06:24.960 --> 06:29.670
as he covers the automobile stocks over the next year.

06:29.670 --> 06:31.557
But there's tremendous pressure, right?

06:31.557 --> 06:33.780
And I think you'll sense that on the show floor

06:33.780 --> 06:36.810
as you go down there and walk the OEM's booths,

06:36.810 --> 06:40.170
the OEMs that have elected to exhibit this year.

06:40.170 --> 06:42.930
But interestingly now, if you contrast that at least

06:42.930 --> 06:45.810
to the health of the franchise dealers in the US,

06:45.810 --> 06:48.870
and there's a lot of information on the slide,

06:48.870 --> 06:50.850
this is going back 50 years.

06:50.850 --> 06:54.060
The thing to pay attention to is that blue line,

06:54.060 --> 06:56.970
which is the average franchise dealer in the US,

06:56.970 --> 06:59.790
they're in net profit pre-tax,

06:59.790 --> 07:02.550
and that's eerily hovered at 2%.

07:02.550 --> 07:04.290
There's never been a year in 50 years

07:04.290 --> 07:05.610
where it's been negative,

07:05.610 --> 07:08.340
even in the worst of years with recessions

07:08.340 --> 07:11.010
and new carbon inventories being down, et cetera.

07:11.010 --> 07:14.280
Yet up until Covid, this is a pre Covid snapshot,

07:14.280 --> 07:15.480
we've never had really a year

07:15.480 --> 07:19.140
that's been over 3% except in the last couple of years

07:19.140 --> 07:22.080
during Covid where there was this artificial restriction

07:22.080 --> 07:24.090
in supply of new and used vehicles.

07:24.090 --> 07:27.840
So very durable, defensible business model.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.220
But having said that,

07:29.220 --> 07:32.760
I liken this to squeezing a water-filled balloon in terms

07:32.760 --> 07:34.410
of the defensibility and the durability

07:34.410 --> 07:37.020
of the franchise dealership model in the US,

07:37.020 --> 07:39.360
which is really the fact that you've got up

07:39.360 --> 07:42.630
to eight different interconnected and interdependent profit

07:42.630 --> 07:45.570
and loss centers within a franchise dealership.

07:45.570 --> 07:47.160
So on any given year,

07:47.160 --> 07:50.790
if any of these sort of eight cylinders are under pressure,

07:50.790 --> 07:53.670
then the owner can reallocate resources

07:53.670 --> 07:56.640
to more healthy cylinders.

07:56.640 --> 07:58.860
If we're gonna use the automotive metaphor.

07:58.860 --> 07:59.940
And over time,

07:59.940 --> 08:03.600
we've seen a lot of innovation in the business model itself.

08:03.600 --> 08:05.940
And as a result, it's been a very durable

08:05.940 --> 08:07.410
and defensible business model

08:07.410 --> 08:09.750
from a profitability standpoint.

08:09.750 --> 08:13.360
What we have witnessed since Covid is really the death

08:14.263 --> 08:15.096
of the agency model, right?

08:15.096 --> 08:18.630
During Covid, we heard a lot of OEMs,

08:18.630 --> 08:21.690
particularly overseas, but not exclusively overseas,

08:21.690 --> 08:24.090
talking about selling directly to the consumer,

08:24.090 --> 08:27.000
resting back more control, the consumer experience,

08:27.000 --> 08:30.480
taking on the responsibility for advertising and inventory,

08:30.480 --> 08:33.570
and that largely is dead now,

08:33.570 --> 08:36.630
we aren't hearing anyone talk about an agency model.

08:36.630 --> 08:39.030
And it's mostly because inventories have mounted

08:40.162 --> 08:42.480
in in a supply constraint environment

08:42.480 --> 08:45.060
where there's more demand than supply,

08:45.060 --> 08:49.080
and gross margins for every vehicle sold are very high,

08:49.080 --> 08:52.380
of course it makes sense for an automaker to entertain

08:52.380 --> 08:54.930
owning the inventory and controlling the inventory,

08:54.930 --> 08:57.570
but that we're back for almost every single brand

08:57.570 --> 09:01.350
to oversupply in the market and discounting and incentives,

09:01.350 --> 09:03.960
it's not so attractive in this type of environment

09:03.960 --> 09:06.900
for the automaker to be taking the inventory risk.

09:06.900 --> 09:09.480
And therefore we aren't really hearing anything about

09:09.480 --> 09:13.020
dealers being disintermediated by an agency model.

09:13.020 --> 09:16.329
Let me shift to EVs while we're on ground transport.

09:16.329 --> 09:19.500
EV sales globally are increasing.

09:19.500 --> 09:23.370
So if there are 93 million new passenger vehicles

09:23.370 --> 09:26.040
sold per year globally, in 2024,

09:26.040 --> 09:28.110
we hit about 16 and a half million.

09:28.110 --> 09:29.700
And that's estimated to be somewhere near

09:29.700 --> 09:30.990
18 million for this year.

09:30.990 --> 09:32.370
So it is still increasing,

09:32.370 --> 09:37.370
but the rate of growth year over year is decelerating

09:37.650 --> 09:40.350
very, very quickly, as you can see here,

09:40.350 --> 09:44.340
almost down to a 0% growth year over year globally

09:44.340 --> 09:46.080
in terms of EVs.

09:46.080 --> 09:48.510
This is not spread evenly over countries

09:48.510 --> 09:50.730
as we hear about countries like China,

09:50.730 --> 09:51.690
countries like Norway,

09:51.690 --> 09:55.140
specifically with massive EV adoption,

09:55.140 --> 09:56.880
but definitely has decelerated

09:56.880 --> 09:59.430
in many of the more Western countries,

09:59.430 --> 10:04.430
yet if we sat last year at about 12% penetration in 2024,

10:05.033 --> 10:07.830
this is Bloomberg's estimates,

10:07.830 --> 10:09.720
at some point here we'll have sort of

10:09.720 --> 10:11.220
a massive tipping point.

10:11.220 --> 10:13.890
And I believe this passionately as well,

10:13.890 --> 10:17.400
when the battery chemistry becomes much better in terms

10:17.400 --> 10:18.690
of the amount of charge,

10:18.690 --> 10:20.730
the distance we can get out of one charge

10:20.730 --> 10:23.610
and the charging speed, forget charger availability

10:23.610 --> 10:27.300
because we'll talk about inductive charging

10:27.300 --> 10:28.800
in a few slides here,

10:28.800 --> 10:30.360
but I do believe at some point,

10:30.360 --> 10:31.560
we will have a tipping point

10:31.560 --> 10:33.750
where the average consumer will say

10:33.750 --> 10:35.880
it's just far better and more efficient

10:35.880 --> 10:39.090
for me to buy an EV than an ICE vehicle,

10:39.090 --> 10:40.620
internal combustion engine vehicle.

10:40.620 --> 10:42.033
But for the time being,

10:42.915 --> 10:45.120
that mentality is not the case in the US

10:45.120 --> 10:46.290
and many of the western countries.

10:46.290 --> 10:48.390
And there's been a lot of resistance.

10:48.390 --> 10:51.554
Let me talk about China because I don't think

10:51.554 --> 10:53.970
that right now probably if I am encouraging anyone

10:53.970 --> 10:55.980
in the industry to be paying attention to,

10:55.980 --> 11:00.150
China is the emerging force within automotive

11:00.150 --> 11:03.030
that cannot be ignored.

11:03.030 --> 11:06.150
So if we look back to the last 20 years,

11:06.150 --> 11:10.650
China car production has gone from 1% to 39%.

11:10.650 --> 11:12.660
And we'll talk about sort of the capacity

11:12.660 --> 11:14.640
they've built, the over capacity,

11:14.640 --> 11:16.740
and thus the pressure on exporting.

11:16.740 --> 11:19.620
But it's just an amazing chart to look at

11:19.620 --> 11:21.570
and then the pressure as a result

11:21.570 --> 11:23.910
for everybody else in the world responding to this,

11:23.910 --> 11:26.010
especially in international markets.

11:26.010 --> 11:28.500
And we'll talk a little bit about the tariffs that the US,

11:28.500 --> 11:32.460
Canada, and Europe have erected as a result.

11:32.460 --> 11:35.670
But you look at maybe most notably we talk about the threat

11:35.670 --> 11:40.050
in the US, but look at Japan's leading sort of share

11:40.050 --> 11:42.960
of the passenger car production back in 1998,

11:42.960 --> 11:44.940
and here we are 25 years later

11:44.940 --> 11:47.820
and they're a pale number two and feeling a lot of pressure.

11:47.820 --> 11:49.530
And this is manifesting

11:49.530 --> 11:51.930
in a lot of activity within the Japanese OEMs,

11:51.930 --> 11:54.000
not the least of which we heard the announcement recently

11:54.000 --> 11:56.700
about Honda and Nissan merging,

11:56.700 --> 11:59.400
but you're gonna see more reaction from the Japanese

11:59.400 --> 12:02.430
trying to figure out where they sit vis-a-vis

12:02.430 --> 12:04.350
the Japanese or the Chinese,

12:04.350 --> 12:06.930
and the pressure's gonna continue to mount.

12:06.930 --> 12:09.120
So I talked about production capacity.

12:09.120 --> 12:10.920
So if we look at the sales,

12:10.920 --> 12:12.960
this is China's production car capacity

12:12.960 --> 12:14.820
versus domestic car sales,

12:14.820 --> 12:17.297
domestic car sales there north of 20,

12:17.297 --> 12:20.370
but 24 million new vehicles sold per year.

12:20.370 --> 12:23.070
So by far the largest new car market in the world,

12:23.070 --> 12:26.580
but production capacity is up there north of 40 million.

12:26.580 --> 12:30.995
So there are about 250 OEMs within China right now.

12:30.995 --> 12:34.800
Most of them are not profitable whatsoever,

12:34.800 --> 12:37.890
and they're slitting each, sorry for the graphic metaphor,

12:37.890 --> 12:40.290
but they're slitting each other's throats to compete.

12:40.290 --> 12:41.580
And as a result,

12:41.580 --> 12:46.140
this extra capacity is largely being pushed internationally.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.840
So despite the fact that they may be facing tariffs,

12:48.840 --> 12:51.750
et cetera in other countries,

12:51.750 --> 12:55.110
a unit sold internationally can be far more profitable

12:55.110 --> 12:57.960
than a unit at home when they're losing money

12:57.960 --> 12:59.580
on every single unit sold.

12:59.580 --> 13:03.150
And there isn't any slowing this down at this point

13:03.150 --> 13:06.060
until there's some sort of reconciliation

13:06.060 --> 13:07.590
around the 250 OEMs,

13:07.590 --> 13:10.080
which is inevitable with this kind of dynamic.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.660
But in the meantime, there is intense pressure

13:12.660 --> 13:14.823
to export these vehicles out of China.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.513
Largely because of the excess capacity,

13:19.532 --> 13:21.570
the production costs are dramatically lower.

13:21.570 --> 13:26.130
This compares a BYD seal versus a Volkswagen ID3

13:26.130 --> 13:27.600
that's made in Europe

13:27.600 --> 13:32.490
and it's demonstrably cheaper in terms of vis-a-vis

13:32.490 --> 13:33.780
the legacy automakers, right?

13:33.780 --> 13:36.090
So the legacy automakers are looking at this and thinking,

13:36.090 --> 13:39.270
how do we respond to this other than erecting tariffs

13:39.270 --> 13:41.460
to protect our home countries?

13:41.460 --> 13:43.470
But as you can imagine, in any environment

13:43.470 --> 13:45.540
where you've got severe overcapacity,

13:45.540 --> 13:47.700
the Chinese automakers are feeling it in terms

13:47.700 --> 13:50.730
of pressure on margins as well as the dealers

13:50.730 --> 13:53.973
because there isn't margin to feed the dealers.

13:53.973 --> 13:56.760
So we've had about 4,000 Chinese franchise dealers

13:56.760 --> 14:01.440
close in 2024, and that will continue as well.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.210
So I don't need to get into economics

14:03.210 --> 14:04.890
because I'm not an economist up here,

14:04.890 --> 14:07.020
but I try to read as much as I can.

14:07.020 --> 14:09.870
And Joseph Schumpeter was an economist

14:09.870 --> 14:12.810
that coined the term creative destruction,

14:12.810 --> 14:15.540
and he saw innovation happening in waves.

14:15.540 --> 14:16.980
And if you track back to the beginning

14:16.980 --> 14:18.780
of the industrial revolution,

14:18.780 --> 14:22.110
you had the British Empire sort of dominated here

14:22.110 --> 14:24.120
these first two waves with iron,

14:24.120 --> 14:26.313
water power, steam power, et cetera.

14:27.323 --> 14:30.810
Then the US, largely on the back of petroleum products,

14:30.810 --> 14:32.550
really dominated in terms

14:32.550 --> 14:34.740
of the next three waves of innovation, right?

14:34.740 --> 14:36.300
Electricity and cheap steel all the way

14:36.300 --> 14:38.343
through IT out of Silicon Valley.

14:39.242 --> 14:40.075
The question is,

14:40.075 --> 14:42.030
if the next wave is largely gonna be powered by two things,

14:42.030 --> 14:45.499
renewable energy and also AI,

14:45.499 --> 14:49.083
who is going to emerge as the dominant superpower?

14:49.923 --> 14:52.440
And many indications are, it'll be China,

14:52.440 --> 14:54.270
at least in terms of renewables,

14:54.270 --> 14:55.680
there's no doubt at this point

14:55.680 --> 14:57.600
with some of the slides I'm about to show you,

14:57.600 --> 15:00.240
but AI is still to be determined, right?

15:00.240 --> 15:03.570
We're seeing these massive fundraisers

15:03.570 --> 15:06.420
and valuations for these companies out of Silicon Valley,

15:06.420 --> 15:08.880
but China at the same time is innovating

15:08.880 --> 15:11.850
likely at just at the same pace.

15:11.850 --> 15:14.133
What China did do 20 years ago as we saw,

15:15.178 --> 15:16.011
they preemptively,

15:16.011 --> 15:18.630
because they wanted independence from oil, which was,

15:18.630 --> 15:20.820
they're a net importer of oil,

15:20.820 --> 15:22.740
get independence around the power plant, right?

15:22.740 --> 15:26.370
So in terms of mining, processing, component production,

15:26.370 --> 15:29.130
battery production, and vehicle assembly for EVs,

15:29.130 --> 15:31.080
those yellow bars are the percentage

15:31.080 --> 15:34.350
that China owns of each of those channels.

15:34.350 --> 15:38.850
And it's daunting when you're an automaker in Western Europe

15:38.850 --> 15:41.370
or in the US looking at,

15:41.370 --> 15:42.780
you're effectively beholden

15:42.780 --> 15:45.150
to this Chinese economic engine

15:45.150 --> 15:47.430
in terms of the supply chain for EVs,

15:47.430 --> 15:49.470
whether you're trying to get the raw ingredients

15:49.470 --> 15:50.640
that go into batteries

15:50.640 --> 15:53.283
or the batteries in the EV components themselves.

15:54.390 --> 15:56.790
Elon Musk, who has had no shortage

15:56.790 --> 15:58.190
of press over the last year,

15:59.067 --> 16:00.360
I could spend 40 minutes talking about Elon,

16:00.360 --> 16:04.470
but said the Chinese EV firms will demolish

16:04.470 --> 16:08.100
the domestic automakers if we don't erect tariffs.

16:08.100 --> 16:12.120
And now he's got a strong mouth piece into Trump's ear.

16:12.120 --> 16:15.330
As a result, Biden erected 100% tariffs

16:15.330 --> 16:16.890
against the Chinese.

16:16.890 --> 16:18.930
And what I would say,

16:18.930 --> 16:20.850
tariffs are great in the short term,

16:20.850 --> 16:22.500
there're a short term bandaid,

16:22.500 --> 16:24.000
but what we have to be aware of

16:24.000 --> 16:25.740
is there's gotta be some way

16:25.740 --> 16:27.870
we innovate out of this whole, right?

16:27.870 --> 16:29.580
If you do believe, and you may not,

16:29.580 --> 16:32.400
you may not agree with me that the dominant power plant

16:32.400 --> 16:34.710
will be electric in the future.

16:34.710 --> 16:35.970
If you believe that thesis,

16:35.970 --> 16:37.440
then you need to have a strategy to say,

16:37.440 --> 16:41.130
great, these tariffs are buying us a short amount of time,

16:41.130 --> 16:43.830
let's make sure we use that time to innovate

16:43.830 --> 16:46.170
and try to leapfrog the Chinese.

16:46.170 --> 16:48.090
But we'll see how this all plays out.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.260
I don't know how this would all play out,

16:49.260 --> 16:52.200
but it's an exciting time in automotive to say the least.

16:52.200 --> 16:54.720
We heard a year ago that Ford and GM

16:54.720 --> 16:57.180
were open to partnerships in terms

16:57.180 --> 16:58.560
of collaborating on the backend.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.240
Well, a few things have happened since.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.580
One is we saw this news just a couple of weeks ago,

17:02.580 --> 17:05.490
probably about a month ago in terms of Honda and Nissan.

17:05.490 --> 17:08.700
This won't be the last, I mean the next couple of years,

17:08.700 --> 17:11.220
we'll see more at least collaboration

17:11.220 --> 17:14.400
if not discussions around mergers on the backend,

17:14.400 --> 17:17.190
partially to take out costs and get economies of scale.

17:17.190 --> 17:20.580
But a lot of this is in response to the existential threat

17:20.580 --> 17:23.220
that the Chinese have on these legacy automakers.

17:23.220 --> 17:25.320
And there'll be a whole bunch of implications

17:25.320 --> 17:27.990
on the tier one suppliers as well.

17:27.990 --> 17:29.940
Let's talk about repair and service of vehicles.

17:29.940 --> 17:32.430
So the cars are getting more complex, right?

17:32.430 --> 17:35.585
A lot of the stuff you're gonna see in the West Hall

17:35.585 --> 17:36.418
are new technologies,

17:36.418 --> 17:38.370
either software or hardware technologies

17:38.370 --> 17:39.930
that are going into the vehicles

17:39.930 --> 17:42.990
either in an immediate generation or future generation.

17:42.990 --> 17:44.190
And this is gonna have

17:44.190 --> 17:46.500
a lot of impacts on repairability

17:46.500 --> 17:48.570
and the cost to ensure these vehicles

17:48.570 --> 17:50.490
as they get more complex.

17:50.490 --> 17:53.790
The average franchise dealer in the US usually loses

17:53.790 --> 17:56.850
about 70% of the service opportunities

17:56.850 --> 17:58.170
at the end of the warranty period,

17:58.170 --> 18:00.630
which has historically been about a three year period.

18:00.630 --> 18:01.890
So I'm a franchise dealer,

18:01.890 --> 18:03.450
usually for the first three years,

18:03.450 --> 18:05.310
I have high loyalty from customers

18:05.310 --> 18:06.900
that get my Honda or Toyota

18:06.900 --> 18:10.740
or General Motors vehicle service at the franchise dealer.

18:10.740 --> 18:12.810
But after that three year period,

18:12.810 --> 18:14.460
the loyalty goes out the window

18:14.460 --> 18:16.110
and the consumer typically searches

18:16.110 --> 18:19.320
for a cheaper servicing mechanism,

18:19.320 --> 18:21.720
which has spawned this huge amount

18:21.720 --> 18:23.583
of aftermarket in the US.

18:24.940 --> 18:27.120
I believe, and not everyone agrees with me,

18:27.120 --> 18:30.060
we're gonna see a dramatically flattening out of this line.

18:30.060 --> 18:32.820
Meaning that consumers are gonna be much more loyal

18:32.820 --> 18:35.430
to going back and servicing their vehicles

18:35.430 --> 18:38.310
at franchise dealers even after the warranty period,

18:38.310 --> 18:41.190
which has big implications on the aftermarket overall.

18:41.190 --> 18:44.040
So we're already seeing articles like this,

18:44.040 --> 18:46.630
and then the pendulum sling swings from

18:47.586 --> 18:51.060
a lobbying standpoint around national right to repair acts

18:51.060 --> 18:54.120
to allow the independent repair shop to get access

18:54.120 --> 18:56.670
to the telematics data off the vehicles as well

18:56.670 --> 18:57.540
as the blueprints

18:57.540 --> 18:59.820
and just being able to repair these vehicles.

18:59.820 --> 19:00.930
But despite this,

19:00.930 --> 19:03.150
I think that the countervailing force is gonna be

19:03.150 --> 19:05.730
the cars are getting so complex

19:05.730 --> 19:08.370
and the technician skill so high

19:08.370 --> 19:11.370
and the specialized tools needed to work on the vehicles

19:11.370 --> 19:13.860
so sophisticated that despite the fact

19:13.860 --> 19:15.090
that the average repair shop,

19:15.090 --> 19:18.210
the average oil chain shop is perhaps gonna have access

19:18.210 --> 19:20.070
to be able to repair the vehicles,

19:20.070 --> 19:22.470
are they gonna have the technician sophistication

19:22.470 --> 19:24.540
and the specialized tools they need?

19:24.540 --> 19:27.960
So we can all take a page out of Apple's book in terms

19:27.960 --> 19:30.720
of the closed walled garden that they've built

19:30.720 --> 19:32.070
around that ecosystem.

19:32.070 --> 19:34.800
And it's awfully hard to work on an Apple product

19:34.800 --> 19:36.510
if you're an independent repair shop,

19:36.510 --> 19:38.343
and they make it hard on purpose.

19:39.360 --> 19:41.820
Repair inflation has been a real challenge in the US.

19:41.820 --> 19:44.850
I think that some argue that Biden lost the election

19:44.850 --> 19:48.270
to Trump primarily because of inflation in the US

19:48.270 --> 19:49.920
and the average consumer feeling this

19:49.920 --> 19:51.510
and voting against Biden.

19:51.510 --> 19:53.280
If you look at inflation for the last,

19:53.280 --> 19:56.370
sort of the beginning of Covid over the last four years,

19:56.370 --> 19:59.790
it's up about 20% the average CPI,

19:59.790 --> 20:02.040
but the repair of vehicles,

20:02.040 --> 20:03.690
the inflation for repair costs

20:03.690 --> 20:05.520
is up more than twice that, right?

20:05.520 --> 20:07.590
So consumers are really feeling pressure

20:07.590 --> 20:12.150
out of their pocketbooks for vehicle repair.

20:12.150 --> 20:13.890
And electric vehicles much more so

20:13.890 --> 20:16.080
than internal combustion engine vehicles.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.520
Think about the dynamic here.

20:17.520 --> 20:20.370
A lot of these electric vehicles are first generation,

20:20.370 --> 20:23.280
so there are more problems with recalls, et cetera.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.800
There is not the technician skill yet

20:25.800 --> 20:27.180
to work on these things,

20:27.180 --> 20:29.100
and there may not be the specialized tools

20:29.100 --> 20:31.140
out there in every repair shop.

20:31.140 --> 20:34.140
So consumers are waiting longer to get their EVs repaired

20:34.140 --> 20:36.858
and paying more to get those repairs done.

20:36.858 --> 20:38.880
And then we see things like this, right?

20:38.880 --> 20:42.150
So this was a minor fender bender by any account

20:42.150 --> 20:43.740
of a Rivian truck,

20:43.740 --> 20:46.110
and it was nine months to get the truck back,

20:46.110 --> 20:49.602
and the repair cost was $42,000.

20:49.602 --> 20:51.030
You're gonna see more of this,

20:51.030 --> 20:52.350
and let me just unpack a little bit

20:52.350 --> 20:53.760
why we're gonna see more of this.

20:53.760 --> 20:56.280
What I have a hard time juxtaposing or figure out,

20:56.280 --> 20:58.020
I've never worked for an automaker,

20:58.020 --> 20:59.760
but how automakers are thinking about

20:59.760 --> 21:02.400
what I'm about to show you in terms of vehicle design

21:02.400 --> 21:04.980
and the sophistication of that and the complexity of that,

21:04.980 --> 21:07.320
and then how the average consumer is gonna be able

21:07.320 --> 21:09.780
to own these vehicles and insure them

21:09.780 --> 21:13.530
because it won't take a lot of cases like this, for example,

21:13.530 --> 21:15.060
where the insurance companies are saying

21:15.060 --> 21:17.040
we're not gonna insure some of these models

21:17.040 --> 21:18.810
because they're gonna be so expensive to fix.

21:18.810 --> 21:21.420
So let me walk you through a couple of slides here.

21:21.420 --> 21:25.470
So on the left, you've got two Model 3s, Tesla Model 3s.

21:25.470 --> 21:27.000
On the left was a previous generation

21:27.000 --> 21:30.870
where the frame had a 150 different components.

21:30.870 --> 21:33.187
Now with mega casting or giga casting,

21:33.187 --> 21:36.960
that same vehicle has three components in the frame.

21:36.960 --> 21:39.540
And I remember when I worked in the wholesale auctions

21:39.540 --> 21:40.950
that you'd see these guys

21:40.950 --> 21:43.380
and they'd rip off a quarter panel of a vehicle

21:43.380 --> 21:46.530
and repair it and then put the car back into the fleet.

21:46.530 --> 21:48.510
Well no longer is that the case, right?

21:48.510 --> 21:51.060
You get a small tear or bend in the frame now

21:51.060 --> 21:53.190
and there aren't parts to replace.

21:53.190 --> 21:56.250
And that theme is continuing across other components

21:56.250 --> 21:57.660
of the vehicle as well.

21:57.660 --> 21:59.460
This may not be a great example,

21:59.460 --> 22:01.620
but look at that suspension component

22:01.620 --> 22:03.600
on the right hand side for this hypercar.

22:03.600 --> 22:07.020
This technology will eventually trickle down

22:07.020 --> 22:08.340
to the average vehicle,

22:08.340 --> 22:11.520
but when AI is designing car parts

22:11.520 --> 22:14.397
to remove weight and build rigidity,

22:14.397 --> 22:16.620
parts are gonna start to look like this.

22:16.620 --> 22:19.410
And I have no idea what that part would cost to replace,

22:19.410 --> 22:21.990
but I'm guessing that you can't go into your Pep Boys

22:21.990 --> 22:23.583
and buy that off the shelf.

22:24.810 --> 22:26.370
I'll get you to laugh at one of them anyway.

22:26.370 --> 22:30.120
So in the same vein, so these are Tesla parts, right?

22:30.120 --> 22:33.000
And again, I don't know a lot about vehicle manufacturing,

22:33.000 --> 22:34.620
but just common sense would dictate you look

22:34.620 --> 22:36.870
at that air conditioning manifold

22:36.870 --> 22:38.490
in the lower right hand corner,

22:38.490 --> 22:43.470
that's all one piece of solid cast aluminum.

22:43.470 --> 22:45.660
And for a domestic automaker,

22:45.660 --> 22:47.220
you'd look at that and you'd be like,

22:47.220 --> 22:50.550
there's probably 20 or 30 different individual parts

22:50.550 --> 22:53.400
that we can go into O'Reilly's or Pep Boys or Advance

22:53.400 --> 22:56.730
and buy a $20 part and swap it out and replace it.

22:56.730 --> 22:59.460
If for some reason that part gets damaged

22:59.460 --> 23:02.580
through accident or otherwise, a small tear or whatever,

23:02.580 --> 23:05.520
and you have to replace that solid piece of aluminum,

23:05.520 --> 23:08.400
that's gotta be a six or $7,000 part.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.740
So again, think about reconciling this thing, right?

23:10.740 --> 23:14.070
Cars used to be really straightforward and easy to repair.

23:14.070 --> 23:15.150
In the spirit of trying

23:15.150 --> 23:18.630
to drive down production costs in the production line,

23:18.630 --> 23:22.590
we've come up with sophisticated manufacturing processes,

23:22.590 --> 23:24.570
but those sophisticated manufacturing processes

23:24.570 --> 23:26.970
aren't doing anything for the repairability of the vehicles.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.770
And then imagine all of this

23:28.770 --> 23:30.810
will manifest in higher insurance costs,

23:30.810 --> 23:31.830
which we get to here,

23:31.830 --> 23:34.740
and vehicle insurance premiums have surged

23:34.740 --> 23:37.050
since 2004 significantly.

23:37.050 --> 23:39.990
And I don't think that this is gonna slow down at all

23:39.990 --> 23:41.580
because there is going to continue

23:41.580 --> 23:44.790
to be intense pressure from the OEMs to remove costs

23:44.790 --> 23:46.800
and their production facilities.

23:46.800 --> 23:49.560
And all of that adds to more complexity on the car.

23:49.560 --> 23:51.780
And at some point, we're gonna have to reconcile,

23:51.780 --> 23:53.910
are these cars repairable at all?

23:53.910 --> 23:55.740
Are they simply gonna be disposable?

23:55.740 --> 23:57.810
And how is a consumer gonna be able

23:57.810 --> 24:00.450
to buy the sophisticated piece of equipment

24:00.450 --> 24:03.603
and be able to afford the insurance premiums on them?

24:04.667 --> 24:06.990
All right, cool. So that was a lot on ground transport.

24:06.990 --> 24:08.910
I'm gonna fly over most of these other categories.

24:08.910 --> 24:10.080
So micromobility.

24:10.080 --> 24:12.750
So interestingly enough, when you define micromobility,

24:12.750 --> 24:14.490
and this is a chart from McKinsey here

24:14.490 --> 24:16.290
in terms of penetration,

24:16.290 --> 24:18.390
but really the three things is to pay attention to.

24:18.390 --> 24:21.330
For the first two markets, China and Asia,

24:21.330 --> 24:23.970
really we're talking about dramatic penetration

24:23.970 --> 24:25.230
of scooters,

24:25.230 --> 24:29.310
light motorcycles more in Latin America and Africa.

24:29.310 --> 24:31.410
And the US is the only market really

24:31.410 --> 24:33.960
that the dominant two-wheeler

24:33.960 --> 24:35.970
is the heavy motorcycle overall.

24:35.970 --> 24:38.040
So it's easy to generalize

24:38.040 --> 24:39.930
about what quote unquote micromobility is.

24:39.930 --> 24:41.940
And we don't even have electric scooters on here

24:41.940 --> 24:43.440
like bird and lime,

24:43.440 --> 24:47.490
but we are grouping together a complex ecosystem

24:47.490 --> 24:49.530
of different types of vehicles,

24:49.530 --> 24:52.110
but what we are seeing is an emergence

24:52.110 --> 24:53.430
of the e-bike, right?

24:53.430 --> 24:56.070
Unlike EVs for passenger vehicles,

24:56.070 --> 24:58.230
it's almost a no brainer with the cost now

24:58.230 --> 24:59.970
in these vehicles,

24:59.970 --> 25:03.570
and that is greatly reducing emissions,

25:03.570 --> 25:06.480
tailpipe emissions, and we're seeing innovations,

25:06.480 --> 25:09.870
Gogoro is the best example potentially internationally,

25:09.870 --> 25:12.870
but not the only by any means of battery swap, right?

25:12.870 --> 25:16.110
So battery swap has been attempted a few different times

25:16.110 --> 25:18.900
over the last two decades for vehicles,

25:18.900 --> 25:20.700
I wouldn't say unsuccessfully at this point

25:20.700 --> 25:23.070
because there are VC-backed startups

25:23.070 --> 25:25.740
now like Ample that continue the fight.

25:25.740 --> 25:30.740
But for small electric vehicles, two wheelers,

25:31.260 --> 25:32.370
it makes a lot of sense, right?

25:32.370 --> 25:35.400
We can just pop up to a station, swap up the battery,

25:35.400 --> 25:37.170
two minutes later you're back in action.

25:37.170 --> 25:40.530
And as long as the consumer doesn't want to own that battery

25:40.530 --> 25:42.960
and is willing to subscribe to it on a monthly basis,

25:42.960 --> 25:44.670
I think we're gonna see more of this

25:44.670 --> 25:46.920
and we'll see more of this in the US.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.393
Aviation and space is fun.

25:49.260 --> 25:52.200
One thing I'm sure of is 20, 30 years from now,

25:52.200 --> 25:54.120
we will continue to see this footage.

25:54.120 --> 25:57.750
So this is like an iconic moment in the history of space,

25:57.750 --> 26:00.600
and it just happened in our lifetime this last year.

26:00.600 --> 26:03.030
So it was an interesting and exciting year,

26:03.030 --> 26:05.880
and we'll see more progress in terms

26:05.880 --> 26:08.500
of what SpaceX is accomplishing.

26:08.500 --> 26:13.500
TNMT is Lufthansa's innovation arm.

26:13.800 --> 26:16.200
And and they believe that in terms

26:16.200 --> 26:19.200
of the trough of disillusionment,

26:19.200 --> 26:22.140
autonomous flight and sustainable aviation fuels

26:22.140 --> 26:24.690
are past the worst of it.

26:24.690 --> 26:26.670
They believe that air ships,

26:26.670 --> 26:29.310
big like sort of zeppelins and supersonic flight

26:29.310 --> 26:31.440
may not ever make it out of the trough.

26:31.440 --> 26:32.880
And then we still have to test

26:32.880 --> 26:37.880
hydrogen electric space travel and VTOLs are at this point

26:38.070 --> 26:40.140
being tested right now.

26:40.140 --> 26:42.630
We've seen some notable bankruptcies recently

26:42.630 --> 26:45.360
and big funding frankly too for the ones

26:45.360 --> 26:47.460
that are out ahead.

26:47.460 --> 26:52.460
In terms of implications here at CES, keep an eye out,

26:53.310 --> 26:55.530
last year we saw all kinds of VTOLs, right?

26:55.530 --> 26:58.440
There was amazing from Hyundai and Honda, et cetera.

26:58.440 --> 27:00.810
Keep an eye out for the Japanese

27:00.810 --> 27:03.630
and the Korean automakers in terms of what they are

27:03.630 --> 27:06.780
or aren't interestingly exhibiting this year.

27:06.780 --> 27:11.780
And then we might be overdue for these aluminum tubes

27:11.790 --> 27:15.240
that we all got here in terms of aircraft travel

27:15.240 --> 27:16.890
because that innovation really,

27:16.890 --> 27:19.440
we haven't seen any innovation for about 50 years.

27:19.440 --> 27:22.590
So in terms of both speed of aircraft,

27:22.590 --> 27:25.170
if anything it's slower now with all of the

27:25.170 --> 27:27.180
sort of TSA regulations that we go through

27:27.180 --> 27:29.280
getting onto the plane to begin with.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.900
But the flight times haven't really changed.

27:30.900 --> 27:34.800
So we are seeing at least proposed innovations in terms

27:34.800 --> 27:37.710
of carrying more people at faster speeds

27:37.710 --> 27:39.630
and more conveniently.

27:39.630 --> 27:43.518
Hydrogen as we'll talk about in a few minutes here

27:43.518 --> 27:46.470
in terms of new technologies is being tested with aviation.

27:46.470 --> 27:49.350
But there are still challenges as there are electricity

27:49.350 --> 27:52.530
as well in terms of weight and the energy density.

27:52.530 --> 27:54.060
We're talking about potentially going

27:54.060 --> 27:56.250
to one pilot in commercial flights

27:56.250 --> 28:00.060
and enhancing the autonomy of aircraft.

28:00.060 --> 28:01.290
With aircraft and marine,

28:01.290 --> 28:03.780
it's easier because there are more tolerances

28:03.780 --> 28:06.270
believe it or not in terms of AV.

28:06.270 --> 28:08.340
You don't have vehicles driving

28:08.340 --> 28:10.710
six inches from each other on a freeway.

28:10.710 --> 28:13.680
But I think that consumers are gonna have to get comfortable

28:13.680 --> 28:16.920
with more autonomous functionality

28:16.920 --> 28:20.100
in the commercial airlines that we all fly on.

28:20.100 --> 28:22.350
And then there's talk about supersonic.

28:22.350 --> 28:24.450
So American Airlines agreed to buy 20

28:24.450 --> 28:26.610
of these supersonic airplanes if

28:26.610 --> 28:28.140
and when they ever get produced,

28:28.140 --> 28:30.540
but there will be supersonic aircraft,

28:30.540 --> 28:31.560
and then there'll be aircraft

28:31.560 --> 28:34.350
that supposedly breach the atmosphere.

28:34.350 --> 28:36.570
So you can literally land anywhere on the face

28:36.570 --> 28:38.310
of the earth within one hour

28:38.310 --> 28:40.470
because you kind of go into orbit and come back down.

28:40.470 --> 28:43.620
So it'll be interesting to see can any of us,

28:43.620 --> 28:45.720
well some in the room perhaps, maybe not me,

28:45.720 --> 28:49.200
but can you justify $30,000 a ticket

28:49.200 --> 28:50.670
or whatever it's going to be?

28:50.670 --> 28:52.410
I mean for some business travelers,

28:52.410 --> 28:55.200
if you can get a Tokyo from here in one hour,

28:55.200 --> 28:56.640
people will justify that, right?

28:56.640 --> 28:59.940
So even if these aircraft don't seat a lot of people,

28:59.940 --> 29:01.920
they may be economically viable,

29:01.920 --> 29:03.990
nothing that I'm investing in early stage

29:03.990 --> 29:06.120
because I think there'll be a lot of burnouts,

29:06.120 --> 29:07.200
but at the same time it's exciting

29:07.200 --> 29:10.620
to see if we can make pretty radical transformations

29:10.620 --> 29:12.960
in terms of the efficiency of aircraft.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.040
And then obviously,

29:14.040 --> 29:17.070
no conversation about mobility would be complete

29:17.070 --> 29:18.510
without talking about drones.

29:18.510 --> 29:20.520
And I think that if you're like me,

29:20.520 --> 29:22.650
and I expect most of you are

29:22.650 --> 29:26.940
because at least most Americans are members of Amazon Prime

29:26.940 --> 29:30.390
and we're all conditioned now to get products the same day.

29:30.390 --> 29:33.600
Now we're talking about getting products within 10 minutes

29:33.600 --> 29:35.040
for anything that's light enough

29:35.040 --> 29:37.960
and durable enough to be dropped 30 feet onto your lawn

29:39.420 --> 29:41.643
and then blown away by the current overall.

29:42.763 --> 29:46.350
All right, so marine is very interesting as well.

29:46.350 --> 29:51.350
So a lot of parallels as you'll see other than wind power

29:51.557 --> 29:53.100
and wind power coming back for some of these ships at sea

29:53.100 --> 29:56.122
to try to increase sort of like fuel efficiency.

29:56.122 --> 29:58.650
There may be like sort of the equivalent of HOV

29:58.650 --> 30:02.010
or high occupancy vehicle lanes on the seas as well.

30:02.010 --> 30:06.570
So ships that have lower CO2 emissions

30:06.570 --> 30:09.600
may get preferential treatment in terms of the channels

30:09.600 --> 30:12.120
as an incentive, kind of a carrot and stick.

30:12.120 --> 30:14.760
and then we're seeing ammonia, hydrogen,

30:14.760 --> 30:17.490
and electricity all being tested.

30:17.490 --> 30:19.500
Very early stages right now,

30:19.500 --> 30:21.450
but there is a lot of venture capital money

30:21.450 --> 30:24.600
chasing these ideas to see iF these alternative

30:24.600 --> 30:26.700
drivetrains are gonna work on the water.

30:26.700 --> 30:29.190
But as you can imagine, all of them have challenges,

30:29.190 --> 30:30.720
and then autonomous as well, right?

30:30.720 --> 30:35.010
So for some of these shipping routes that are long haul,

30:35.010 --> 30:37.980
as you can imagine, he trickle down effect of

30:37.980 --> 30:41.880
the AV technology that we see at CES in vehicles will

30:41.880 --> 30:45.663
and is trickling down to ships overall on the high seas.

30:47.610 --> 30:49.530
And then we'll transition to autonomy.

30:49.530 --> 30:50.760
So it's been an interesting year.

30:50.760 --> 30:52.920
We've seen Waymo make a lot of progress,

30:52.920 --> 30:55.650
including recently announcing that they're coming

30:55.650 --> 30:58.920
into Japan in a few years, which is very interesting too.

30:58.920 --> 31:01.320
I mean it still has been a bottomless pit

31:01.320 --> 31:04.110
of money absorption, right?

31:04.110 --> 31:07.890
And as we saw withGM GM finally said enough's enough,

31:07.890 --> 31:10.770
we're not gonna continue to pour money into this thing.

31:10.770 --> 31:13.230
They didn't kill their AV initiative,

31:13.230 --> 31:15.660
they're just gonna focus on more ADAS

31:15.660 --> 31:18.150
as opposed to robo taxis.

31:18.150 --> 31:20.160
But it was sad to see

31:20.160 --> 31:22.590
because this innovation is exciting.

31:22.590 --> 31:25.140
If you have had a chance to test it out,

31:25.140 --> 31:28.025
it's very exciting if you get a chance to.

31:28.025 --> 31:30.348
And then there will be mixed feelings

31:30.348 --> 31:32.370
and mixed reactions around Elon's announcement

31:32.370 --> 31:34.020
around the Cybercab.

31:34.020 --> 31:35.280
We'll see if he can ever actually

31:35.280 --> 31:36.480
get this thing into production,

31:36.480 --> 31:39.990
but it can't hurt to have Trump's ear to be able

31:39.990 --> 31:41.460
to sort of like potentially

31:41.460 --> 31:43.440
reduce some of the regulations

31:43.440 --> 31:46.680
against testing these things in the wild.

31:46.680 --> 31:49.770
And then we had another billion dollar investment

31:49.770 --> 31:53.100
this last year out of the UK into wave as well,

31:53.100 --> 31:55.830
which is more focused on the technology

31:55.830 --> 31:57.180
than actually putting the vehicles

31:57.180 --> 31:58.530
themselves into production.

31:59.439 --> 32:01.620
So it's always nice to dig out slides

32:01.620 --> 32:03.180
from 10 or 15 years ago.

32:03.180 --> 32:06.090
This is a slide from Morgan Stanley back in 2012,

32:06.090 --> 32:09.240
and they were extrapolating out the timeline

32:09.240 --> 32:11.130
for full autonomous on roads.

32:11.130 --> 32:12.750
And you can see here by about this time,

32:12.750 --> 32:15.150
we were expected to have 100% penetration.

32:15.150 --> 32:16.830
All the passenger vehicles on the roads

32:16.830 --> 32:18.180
were gonna be fully autonomous

32:18.180 --> 32:20.640
and it was gonna cause all these disruptive effects.

32:20.640 --> 32:22.500
I'm gonna pull out another slide in a minute

32:22.500 --> 32:25.005
to show because now that we're actually starting

32:25.005 --> 32:28.290
to see here, 10, 15 years down the road,

32:28.290 --> 32:32.160
some traction around autonomous vehicles finally,

32:32.160 --> 32:35.070
these implications that we talked about 10 or 15 years ago

32:35.070 --> 32:37.680
may ultimately start to manifest themselves.

32:37.680 --> 32:38.820
Interestingly enough,

32:38.820 --> 32:41.670
a slide from Q4 last year from Goldman Sachs

32:41.670 --> 32:46.670
looked at projected penetration by country,

32:47.040 --> 32:48.870
by country in terms of AV.

32:48.870 --> 32:50.250
Now it's a bit of a cop up

32:50.250 --> 32:53.400
because they include levels three, four, and five,

32:53.400 --> 32:55.020
not just levels four and five,

32:55.020 --> 32:57.390
but they're projecting by 2040

32:57.390 --> 33:01.290
that China will be at 90% penetration

33:01.290 --> 33:04.800
for new vehicles in terms of fully autonomous.

33:04.800 --> 33:08.100
Europe, not too far behind, the US is 65%.

33:08.100 --> 33:09.900
India much further down,

33:09.900 --> 33:11.820
but still making some traction as well.

33:11.820 --> 33:14.220
So we'll talk a little bit about the puts

33:14.220 --> 33:16.140
and takes that have to happen here.

33:16.140 --> 33:18.510
But it's interesting for them to go out,

33:18.510 --> 33:20.250
especially juxtapose against that last slide

33:20.250 --> 33:21.420
by Morgan Stanley.

33:21.420 --> 33:23.580
They're reaching out to 2040

33:23.580 --> 33:26.523
to predict really high adoption rates for AV.

33:27.390 --> 33:30.240
Our friends at Roland Berger, a couple slides from them,

33:30.240 --> 33:32.640
there are challenges for autonomous vehicles, right?

33:32.640 --> 33:36.690
There's the technology itself, there's the economic case,

33:36.690 --> 33:38.370
because right now as I'm about to show you

33:38.370 --> 33:40.200
with the slide from McKinsey,

33:40.200 --> 33:45.200
it's much more expensive per mile to deliver a Waymo mile

33:45.450 --> 33:47.250
than it is just in a regular Uber.

33:47.250 --> 33:48.660
There's customer acceptance overall.

33:48.660 --> 33:50.730
Will customers feel safe in these things

33:50.730 --> 33:52.050
because a lot of people don't yet.

33:52.050 --> 33:54.180
There's regulatory complexity

33:54.180 --> 33:56.160
and then there's the capital to fund these things

33:56.160 --> 33:58.650
because it's clearly not a cheap endeavor.

33:58.650 --> 34:01.590
And if you draw your attention just down to the lower right,

34:01.590 --> 34:04.500
I mean, Roland Berger by 2040 believes

34:04.500 --> 34:07.890
that we'll get strong progress towards consumers

34:07.890 --> 34:09.180
trusting these things.

34:09.180 --> 34:12.093
Remember this is now 15 years from now,

34:13.000 --> 34:14.820
and the legal implications as well,

34:14.820 --> 34:16.800
the legal hurdles that are gonna be out there,

34:16.800 --> 34:18.120
but they're not as confident

34:18.120 --> 34:20.160
around these other areas of autonomy.

34:20.160 --> 34:21.750
So we've got, at least in the US

34:21.750 --> 34:24.200
from a western standpoint, we've got a bit to go.

34:25.140 --> 34:27.900
But there's no doubt that autonomy

34:27.900 --> 34:30.210
should theoretically save lives.

34:30.210 --> 34:34.140
In the US, we had 42,000 deaths for the last couple

34:34.140 --> 34:37.440
of years in the US from traffic fatalities.

34:37.440 --> 34:42.440
Globally, that number is 1.2, 1.3 million deaths globally.

34:42.540 --> 34:44.520
And I don't think there's any arguing

34:44.520 --> 34:47.490
that if we binary flipped over to fully autonomous,

34:47.490 --> 34:48.480
there'd be fewer deaths.

34:48.480 --> 34:50.010
We'd have all kinds of other issues,

34:50.010 --> 34:54.090
but there'd be fewer deaths from human error in fatalities.

34:54.090 --> 34:58.110
Whether that's from people not paying attention,

34:58.110 --> 35:00.960
being distracted, alcohol, what have you.

35:00.960 --> 35:03.030
So the thesis is strong.

35:03.030 --> 35:06.030
How we get there on this journey is not so clear.

35:06.030 --> 35:07.230
But I would just encourage us

35:07.230 --> 35:09.630
to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

35:09.630 --> 35:12.120
We need to continue to fund these initiatives

35:12.120 --> 35:15.510
and push forward through a lot of these resistors

35:15.510 --> 35:17.970
because I think that the savings,

35:17.970 --> 35:21.150
net savings of human life will make it all worthwhile.

35:21.150 --> 35:24.480
I believe Uber's whole business model to begin with.

35:24.480 --> 35:27.240
Again, remember back to that 2012 slide

35:27.240 --> 35:29.790
from Morgan Stanley was that we were on the precipice

35:29.790 --> 35:32.700
of having full autonomy which would dramatically drive down

35:32.700 --> 35:37.700
the cost per mile for human delivery, these vehicles.

35:38.280 --> 35:41.650
Uber burned a collective 31 and a half billion dollars

35:42.630 --> 35:46.260
into 2023, 10 years later.

35:46.260 --> 35:50.340
But they've made profitable quarters the last four quarters,

35:50.340 --> 35:51.810
and this will flip dramatically

35:51.810 --> 35:53.970
if they are able to co-opt Waymo

35:53.970 --> 35:55.710
and start to provide rides

35:55.710 --> 35:59.010
that don't have the human drag of costs.

35:59.010 --> 36:01.320
And as I said earlier, McKinsey recently,

36:01.320 --> 36:04.200
this is in the last month, quantified the current cost

36:04.200 --> 36:08.730
per mile for an autonomous mile driven is $8 US.

36:08.730 --> 36:10.320
But they believe that at scale,

36:10.320 --> 36:13.080
pretty massive scale as you unpack this, but at scale,

36:13.080 --> 36:17.940
that should reduce down to $1.32 per mile by 2035.

36:17.940 --> 36:21.690
So this dramatic uptake

36:21.690 --> 36:25.320
or reduction in cost per mile could flip the economics

36:25.320 --> 36:26.790
of a whole bunch of different business models,

36:26.790 --> 36:28.320
including Uber.

36:28.320 --> 36:31.290
And then a slide also I pulled out from about 10 years ago,

36:31.290 --> 36:33.090
which is downstream,

36:33.090 --> 36:36.060
which industries will be impacted the most

36:36.060 --> 36:38.220
if we do go get to a full autonomy future,

36:38.220 --> 36:39.960
the ones I'll draw your attention to

36:39.960 --> 36:42.630
in the upper right hand corner is auto insurance

36:42.630 --> 36:45.570
because the cars are safe and no longer have accidents.

36:45.570 --> 36:48.870
The health car system, at 42,000 fewer deaths a year,

36:48.870 --> 36:51.120
there'll be a definite impact on the healthcare system

36:51.120 --> 36:53.070
and then parking overall as well.

36:53.070 --> 36:54.840
We won't need to park if we can just

36:54.840 --> 36:57.774
summon these vehicles and they're fully autonomous.

36:57.774 --> 36:59.250
So I'm gonna need to move ahead here

36:59.250 --> 37:00.780
because I've got only a couple minutes left.

37:00.780 --> 37:05.130
So let me move to industrial tech.

37:05.130 --> 37:06.600
So it's great to go down

37:06.600 --> 37:08.370
and see these big earth mover machines

37:08.370 --> 37:10.860
on the show floor, which is really cool.

37:10.860 --> 37:13.530
Just like aviation and marine,

37:13.530 --> 37:15.150
there are fewer restrictions, right?

37:15.150 --> 37:18.360
You've got mining agriculture on fixed routes

37:18.360 --> 37:20.460
where you don't have humans walking around.

37:20.460 --> 37:22.770
So autonomous and electrification

37:22.770 --> 37:24.210
can be much more prevalent.

37:24.210 --> 37:26.220
So keep an eye out for this on the show floor.

37:26.220 --> 37:27.620
We're seeing this in farming

37:28.530 --> 37:30.495
with self-driving tractors and electrification,

37:30.495 --> 37:32.250
which is very interesting as well.

37:32.250 --> 37:35.490
New technologies, I think we've talked about most of this.

37:35.490 --> 37:36.690
The growth,

37:36.690 --> 37:39.870
the expected growth in lithium ion batteries is growing

37:39.870 --> 37:43.710
sort of exponentially, largely dominated by the Chinese,

37:43.710 --> 37:46.890
not exclusively, but the Asian manufacturers

37:46.890 --> 37:50.310
including Korea and Japan dominate battery production

37:50.310 --> 37:53.670
and the cost luckily is coming down pretty dramatically.

37:53.670 --> 37:57.030
Yet, if you look at sort of the density versus cost

37:57.030 --> 37:58.410
as we talked about earlier,

37:58.410 --> 38:00.540
aviation kerosene and gasoline

38:00.540 --> 38:02.610
just provides a lot more power per unit

38:02.610 --> 38:05.850
of weight than batteries on the bottom here.

38:05.850 --> 38:10.230
And until we get more energy per unit of weight,

38:10.230 --> 38:13.740
we're not realistically gonna be having airplanes powered

38:13.740 --> 38:15.450
by batteries anytime soon.

38:15.450 --> 38:18.963
And there are big implications on ships as well.

38:19.920 --> 38:21.840
There's a lot of talk, buzz,

38:21.840 --> 38:24.450
and you'll see here about solid state batteries overall.

38:24.450 --> 38:26.440
The challenge with solid state is that

38:27.360 --> 38:30.240
there are higher costs of production,

38:30.240 --> 38:33.690
there is dendrite formation as well,

38:33.690 --> 38:35.880
and then there's higher dependence on lithium,

38:35.880 --> 38:37.710
which is one thing we'd like to get away from

38:37.710 --> 38:38.910
as much as possible.

38:38.910 --> 38:42.030
And then I talked about inductive charging as well,

38:42.030 --> 38:43.980
be it over a parking spot

38:43.980 --> 38:46.260
when the car is stationary or in motion.

38:46.260 --> 38:48.960
I think that our grandchildren will look back

38:48.960 --> 38:51.780
at the fact that we had to plug a wire into the side

38:51.780 --> 38:54.060
of an electric vehicle as being similar

38:54.060 --> 38:55.770
to a rotary phone, right?

38:55.770 --> 38:56.970
It just won't compute, it'll be like,

38:56.970 --> 38:58.440
why did you have to do that?

38:58.440 --> 39:01.248
Because there will be inductive charging that's ubiquitous.

39:01.248 --> 39:04.470
This will take the edge off of a lot

39:04.470 --> 39:06.840
of the resistance towards EVs.

39:06.840 --> 39:09.270
So circling back to the beginning,

39:09.270 --> 39:11.610
how does the US position themselves to win?

39:11.610 --> 39:13.920
A lot of folks are speculating to dominate

39:13.920 --> 39:17.430
around solid state batteries if that's the future.

39:17.430 --> 39:19.770
Luckily enough, we've had some really big discoveries

39:19.770 --> 39:22.200
both in Nevada and down in Arkansas recently

39:22.200 --> 39:23.340
in terms of lithium

39:23.340 --> 39:26.550
to get energy independence in terms of the supply chain.

39:26.550 --> 39:28.380
And then there's recycling as well.

39:28.380 --> 39:31.470
So there's been a lot of VC money focused on recycling.

39:31.470 --> 39:34.020
But once there's enough EVs in population,

39:34.020 --> 39:35.850
if we're really efficient with extracting

39:35.850 --> 39:39.360
at the end of life these raw components out of the vehicles,

39:39.360 --> 39:42.600
then you can imagine this circular sort of economy

39:42.600 --> 39:46.110
of making sure that we are fairly energy independent.

39:46.110 --> 39:46.943
So I didn't have a chance

39:46.943 --> 39:48.300
to talk a lot about hydrogen today.

39:48.300 --> 39:50.460
Hydrogen has its own issues, right?

39:50.460 --> 39:54.060
The nice thing is it's abundant, but at the same time,

39:54.060 --> 39:57.810
it allows fast refueling unlike charging right now,

39:57.810 --> 40:01.129
the challenge is that it takes a lot of electricity, right?

40:01.129 --> 40:05.280
So to produce hydrogen, you really need to have abundant

40:05.280 --> 40:08.774
and cheap electricity, which renewables should provide,

40:08.774 --> 40:10.320
but you still have to worry

40:10.320 --> 40:12.780
about the infrastructure overall.

40:12.780 --> 40:15.660
Getting the hydrogen to the vehicles

40:15.660 --> 40:17.433
that need the hydrogen overall.

40:19.380 --> 40:21.180
All right, cool, so let me go through here

40:21.180 --> 40:23.370
because I am at time and Chris is gonna ask me off here.

40:23.370 --> 40:28.370
Let's wrap this up by looking at one, the supply chain.

40:29.220 --> 40:31.260
Amazon is talking very aggressively

40:31.260 --> 40:35.403
around replacing humans in their warehouses with robotics.

40:36.690 --> 40:39.990
Kathy Wood from ARK Invest says that

40:39.990 --> 40:44.130
Amazon's robots could outnumber humans within seven years.

40:44.130 --> 40:45.990
And then we're seeing evidence of this,

40:45.990 --> 40:48.060
just recently Denso said that they're going

40:48.060 --> 40:53.060
to build a worker less factory for Toyota overall.

40:53.430 --> 40:55.770
And then one of the most interesting things

40:55.770 --> 40:57.600
that we've seen over the last couple of years

40:57.600 --> 41:00.870
with both the Israeli conflict as well as Ukraine

41:00.870 --> 41:05.870
is really the rise of AI and drones within warfare overall.

41:06.780 --> 41:09.210
So this was an article of the Atlantic recently

41:09.210 --> 41:11.640
that said the waves of innovation

41:11.640 --> 41:15.450
for warfare have been, one gunpowder, two, nuclear weapons,

41:15.450 --> 41:17.370
and the next is AI.

41:17.370 --> 41:20.130
And there will be a lot of ethical issues that we all have

41:20.130 --> 41:22.440
to face with how much we're gonna allow

41:22.440 --> 41:24.813
automated machines to kill humans.

41:26.490 --> 41:30.270
This is gonna happen at the police department level overall.

41:30.270 --> 41:34.320
Drones are being very effectively used in Ukraine right now

41:34.320 --> 41:36.600
to neutralize Russian tanks,

41:36.600 --> 41:38.970
and Boston Dynamics did come out

41:38.970 --> 41:42.450
and say our robot dogs will not be armed,

41:42.450 --> 41:47.370
yet not every military vendor has the same sort of locus.

41:47.370 --> 41:51.030
And we've seen robot dogs being equipped

41:51.030 --> 41:55.315
to protect borders, to go into battlefields, et cetera.

41:55.315 --> 42:00.315
Autonomous tank-like vehicles going into battle as well.

42:00.510 --> 42:04.080
We're talking about autonomous boats for the US Navy,

42:04.080 --> 42:07.200
and then there'll be drones both underwater

42:07.200 --> 42:08.880
to attack subs potentially

42:08.880 --> 42:11.550
and boats in the military as well

42:11.550 --> 42:14.670
as the US Navy is experimenting with drones,

42:14.670 --> 42:18.810
non-human guided drones off of aircraft carriers

42:18.810 --> 42:20.730
that can go run sorties and then come back

42:20.730 --> 42:22.050
and land on aircraft carriers.

42:22.050 --> 42:25.110
And the US military, this may change under Trump,

42:25.110 --> 42:26.910
has proclaimed that by 2050,

42:26.910 --> 42:28.770
they want to be net zero and go electric,

42:28.770 --> 42:30.720
which has a lot of implications for

42:30.720 --> 42:32.910
how we're gonna be able to deploy vehicles

42:32.910 --> 42:35.640
into the field of battle that are electric.

42:35.640 --> 42:37.470
So let me wrap with climate overall.

42:37.470 --> 42:39.000
So maybe I should have started here,

42:39.000 --> 42:40.650
but maybe to dull the edge,

42:40.650 --> 42:42.270
we can talk about the implications

42:42.270 --> 42:45.060
for connecting mobility to climate overall.

42:45.060 --> 42:48.330
So there will be folks

42:48.330 --> 42:49.830
that have different perspectives here,

42:49.830 --> 42:51.120
I'll leave it as that.

42:51.120 --> 42:54.180
But from the time that we are able to measure,

42:54.180 --> 42:56.790
CO2 levels in the atmosphere are dramatically higher

42:56.790 --> 42:58.110
than they've ever been.

42:58.110 --> 43:02.730
We are facing warming climates around the world as well,

43:02.730 --> 43:04.560
which are escalating and accelerating.

43:04.560 --> 43:07.290
This trend is not a good trend, to state the obvious.

43:07.290 --> 43:10.260
And mobility plays a very large role in this, right?

43:10.260 --> 43:14.673
So we look at aircraft, how most of us got here,

43:15.600 --> 43:16.890
as well as passenger vehicles

43:16.890 --> 43:21.303
that have single occupancy if they're emitting petroleum,

43:22.380 --> 43:25.290
and there are levers to decarbonize aviation

43:25.290 --> 43:27.510
that are being pushed on at this point.

43:27.510 --> 43:29.100
The good thing this is McKinsey

43:29.100 --> 43:30.660
and company as well looking at,

43:30.660 --> 43:34.740
we may have or are experiencing peak emissions now,

43:34.740 --> 43:36.870
and so we should be able to start

43:36.870 --> 43:39.450
to heal the damage that's been done overall,

43:39.450 --> 43:40.890
but not through,

43:40.890 --> 43:43.650
we need to continue to push on these things.

43:43.650 --> 43:45.240
And then the good thing in terms

43:45.240 --> 43:48.170
of maybe a couple of feel good slides is 45%

43:48.170 --> 43:50.520
of all energy now globally

43:50.520 --> 43:52.530
is being produced through renewables.

43:52.530 --> 43:55.650
And if you look at the breaking that down,

43:55.650 --> 43:59.820
we're seeing a real acceleration in solar recently

43:59.820 --> 44:01.140
as well as wind.

44:01.140 --> 44:02.550
And if you look at solar now,

44:02.550 --> 44:04.890
this is the International Energy Agency

44:04.890 --> 44:07.350
that believes by 26, 27,

44:07.350 --> 44:11.370
solar will be generating more energy globally

44:11.370 --> 44:14.763
than anything else, including coal and natural gas.

44:15.750 --> 44:19.800
And then there are some more radical technologies

44:19.800 --> 44:23.520
that are being tested right now to increase cloud cover

44:23.520 --> 44:26.970
to protect the earth from the sun penetrating,

44:26.970 --> 44:29.940
including aerosol injection into the clouds,

44:29.940 --> 44:32.340
cloud brightening from the marine standpoint

44:32.340 --> 44:34.350
that we've seen on the west coast,

44:34.350 --> 44:39.120
and then adding alkalinity to the seas as well

44:39.120 --> 44:42.570
to neutralize and bring down the pH.

44:42.570 --> 44:44.010
And there's carbon capture as well.

44:44.010 --> 44:46.620
So let me wrap here, so we are investors,

44:46.620 --> 44:49.020
we're looking at the lens of all of these changes

44:49.020 --> 44:51.330
and then trying to deploy 10 year funds

44:51.330 --> 44:55.290
against these changes and find really talented entrepreneurs

44:55.290 --> 44:57.930
who are innovating in these spaces overall.

44:57.930 --> 45:00.120
And our investment thesis,

45:00.120 --> 45:01.650
that was the one slide where the font

45:01.650 --> 45:04.290
got corrupted a little bit, I can share this with you,

45:04.290 --> 45:05.520
happy to have these conversations about

45:05.520 --> 45:07.710
where we're seeing innovation, et cetera.

45:07.710 --> 45:09.840
One of the reasons I'm here is to walk the floor

45:09.840 --> 45:11.640
and see if there are entrepreneurs

45:11.640 --> 45:14.400
that are investible out there.

45:14.400 --> 45:16.200
The last slide that I'll leave you on here,

45:16.200 --> 45:18.960
this slide came up in the last month.

45:18.960 --> 45:20.133
This is Oliver Wyman.

45:21.150 --> 45:22.170
A lot of information on here,

45:22.170 --> 45:24.810
but these are these different areas of mobility

45:24.810 --> 45:26.790
and where they expect the quote unquote

45:26.790 --> 45:30.188
profit pools or revenue's gonna come from

45:30.188 --> 45:32.520
between now and 2035.

45:32.520 --> 45:35.640
So the green colored bars are

45:35.640 --> 45:39.210
expected 2035 revenue from these areas.

45:39.210 --> 45:40.223
And if you kind of squint at it,

45:40.223 --> 45:43.170
you see the big areas are, in the upper right hand corner,

45:43.170 --> 45:45.813
air taxis, just below that, micromobility.

45:46.800 --> 45:50.280
In the middle at the bottom, you see ADAS systems overall,

45:50.280 --> 45:52.020
with all that's going on in autonomy,

45:52.020 --> 45:54.090
autonomy's time seems to have come.

45:54.090 --> 45:56.670
In-vehicle digital services and unlocking that

45:56.670 --> 45:58.050
and having consumers pay.

45:58.050 --> 45:59.160
And then on the left hand side,

45:59.160 --> 46:01.053
you got car rental and ride hailing.

46:02.130 --> 46:04.290
So with that, Chris, I guess one shout out

46:04.290 --> 46:06.990
for one of our companies that's on the floor,

46:06.990 --> 46:11.990
if you haven't seen Kinetic do a robotic ADAS calibration,

46:13.470 --> 46:15.663
they're actually down on the floor.

46:15.663 --> 46:18.510
So you can see them in the West Hall, drop by and see them.

46:18.510 --> 46:20.610
I'll be hanging out with them quite a bit at a time.

46:20.610 --> 46:22.590
And with that we'll stop, and Chris,

46:22.590 --> 46:23.423
I don't know if we have time

46:23.423 --> 46:24.980
for questions or we have to break.

46:25.890 --> 46:27.060
I'm getting this.

46:27.060 --> 46:28.980
All right, good. If you have questions, come by and see me.

46:28.980 --> 46:31.773
But thank you very much and have a great show.

46:33.267 --> 46:35.850
(upbeat music)
