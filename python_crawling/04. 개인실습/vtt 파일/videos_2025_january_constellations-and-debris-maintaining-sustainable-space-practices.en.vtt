1
00:00.475 --> 00:03.142
(upbeat music)

2
00:11.160 --> 00:12.600
<v ->So thank you very much, everyone,</v>

3
00:12.600 --> 00:14.010
for coming just after lunch.

4
00:14.010 --> 00:17.248
This is the first session of the space track,

5
00:17.248 --> 00:19.500
presented by Novaspace,

6
00:19.500 --> 00:21.960
premier space and satellite industry consulting firm.

7
00:21.960 --> 00:24.570
It's our second year doing this, so thank you to the folks

8
00:24.570 --> 00:28.440
at CES for liking us enough last year to invite us back.

9
00:28.440 --> 00:32.550
So, the first session today, of four sessions,

10
00:32.550 --> 00:35.760
so the first one is constellations and debris,

11
00:35.760 --> 00:38.640
maintaining sustainable space practices,

12
00:38.640 --> 00:40.650
and we have three excellent practitioners up here

13
00:40.650 --> 00:41.483
that are going to talk

14
00:41.483 --> 00:44.493
all about their sustainable space practices.

15
00:45.420 --> 00:46.530
In the interest of time,

16
00:46.530 --> 00:48.240
I won't even really do introductions.

17
00:48.240 --> 00:49.680
I'll just ask a first question

18
00:49.680 --> 00:53.160
of how do you define sustainable space practices,

19
00:53.160 --> 00:56.610
and what is your company doing to help, you know,

20
00:56.610 --> 00:58.380
make those practices more sustainable?

21
00:58.380 --> 00:59.760
What are you doing to help, you know,

22
00:59.760 --> 01:01.020
keep space sustainable?

23
01:01.020 --> 01:02.160
And if you wanna give a short intro

24
01:02.160 --> 01:04.233
of your name and company, also welcome.

25
01:05.700 --> 01:06.960
<v ->Hi, thank you for having me.</v>

26
01:06.960 --> 01:08.190
I'm Melissa Quinn.

27
01:08.190 --> 01:09.720
I'm from Slingshot Aerospace.

28
01:09.720 --> 01:13.500
We're a data and analytics company based out of Colorado,

29
01:13.500 --> 01:15.300
but also offices over in the UK

30
01:15.300 --> 01:17.370
and further afield later this year.

31
01:17.370 --> 01:19.500
So, sustainability, look,

32
01:19.500 --> 01:21.450
I just walked around some of the halls out there,

33
01:21.450 --> 01:25.080
and I asked everyone from the agritech companies

34
01:25.080 --> 01:28.560
to the healthcare companies to the autonomous vehicle,

35
01:28.560 --> 01:31.470
and I said, you know, "Does space enable what you do?"

36
01:31.470 --> 01:34.080
And pretty much every single one of 'em said, "Absolutely."

37
01:34.080 --> 01:36.570
Their satellites or space enable what they do.

38
01:36.570 --> 01:39.510
So this whole show, I would say, is powered by space.

39
01:39.510 --> 01:42.900
Now what if, one day, something happened,

40
01:42.900 --> 01:46.080
like similar to something like CrowdStrike but worse,

41
01:46.080 --> 01:48.720
in space, a collision, for instance,

42
01:48.720 --> 01:52.770
or an anti-satellite testing activity.

43
01:52.770 --> 01:55.170
You know, a lot of what's downstairs and in the halls

44
01:55.170 --> 01:58.260
across the city right now would cease to be able to function

45
01:58.260 --> 02:00.180
and our daily lives, emergency services,

46
02:00.180 --> 02:02.610
would cease to function, and that is really scary,

47
02:02.610 --> 02:05.280
but yet so many people don't even realize

48
02:05.280 --> 02:07.200
that that is a threat.

49
02:07.200 --> 02:11.070
So for us at Slingshot, it's about maintaining safety

50
02:11.070 --> 02:14.850
and security in space that then provides the sustainability

51
02:14.850 --> 02:17.880
for future generations to use it, and for me,

52
02:17.880 --> 02:19.920
it's something I'm personally very passionate about

53
02:19.920 --> 02:21.870
because I love space, I love what it does for us

54
02:21.870 --> 02:25.770
back down here on Earth, what enables us to do to provide,

55
02:25.770 --> 02:28.110
you know, better lifestyles for people here on Earth,

56
02:28.110 --> 02:30.030
and at any point, that could come to an end

57
02:30.030 --> 02:31.710
if we're not careful about it, and, unfortunately,

58
02:31.710 --> 02:34.560
humans don't have a great track record with, (chuckles)

59
02:34.560 --> 02:37.080
you know, things like sustainable practices

60
02:37.080 --> 02:38.100
in the seas, for instance.

61
02:38.100 --> 02:40.740
So, for us at Slingshot, providing the capabilities

62
02:40.740 --> 02:44.520
and technologies to keep space more sustainable

63
02:44.520 --> 02:46.590
for everybody to benefit from in the future,

64
02:46.590 --> 02:48.270
including all these wonderful companies

65
02:48.270 --> 02:49.473
that are here at CES.

66
02:51.810 --> 02:52.880
<v ->Yeah, thank you.</v>

67
02:52.880 --> 02:54.030
How to follow on from that?

68
02:54.030 --> 02:56.370
So, my name's Clare Martin.

69
02:56.370 --> 02:58.593
I work for a company called Astroscale,

70
02:59.460 --> 03:00.660
out of their US office.

71
03:00.660 --> 03:03.691
You can just ignore the accent, that's fine.

72
03:03.691 --> 03:08.580
(chuckles) The Astroscale was a company founded,

73
03:08.580 --> 03:11.040
it's a global company, and it was founded in 2013

74
03:11.040 --> 03:15.570
with a very clear vision, and that is to develop space

75
03:15.570 --> 03:17.850
in a safe and sustainable manner for the benefit

76
03:17.850 --> 03:21.780
of future generations, and it's for exactly the reasons

77
03:21.780 --> 03:23.275
that Melissa said.

78
03:23.275 --> 03:25.904
Our global economy actually depends on it.

79
03:25.904 --> 03:30.630
A lot of my career has been spent trying to educate

80
03:30.630 --> 03:33.720
and make people more aware of actually how dependent we are

81
03:33.720 --> 03:37.620
on space services in order to live our daily lives.

82
03:37.620 --> 03:40.500
And as we move forward into this new era,

83
03:40.500 --> 03:42.450
as space is used more and more and more,

84
03:42.450 --> 03:43.890
the subject of sustainability

85
03:43.890 --> 03:45.810
is becoming more and more important.

86
03:45.810 --> 03:49.110
And at Astroscale, we are dedicated,

87
03:49.110 --> 03:51.120
through what we call on-orbit servicing,

88
03:51.120 --> 03:54.120
so essentially putting the logistics into orbit,

89
03:54.120 --> 03:58.470
to aid that sustainable practice through on-orbit services

90
03:58.470 --> 04:01.620
to be able to remove or replace or repair objects

91
04:01.620 --> 04:03.413
as they come to the end of their life.

92
04:04.793 --> 04:05.670
What would you answer?

93
04:05.670 --> 04:07.743
<v ->Thanks, hard act to follow.</v>

94
04:10.530 --> 04:13.923
It's not about space, it's about the economy.

95
04:14.760 --> 04:17.490
It's not about tracking debris,

96
04:17.490 --> 04:20.580
it's about developing applications.

97
04:20.580 --> 04:23.010
It's not about generating data,

98
04:23.010 --> 04:25.530
it's about creating opportunity.

99
04:25.530 --> 04:29.880
And in space right now, we're facing a big threat.

100
04:29.880 --> 04:33.150
And my mantra throughout my business career

101
04:33.150 --> 04:36.210
has been, "In every threat, there is opportunity."

102
04:36.210 --> 04:39.650
So there's about 8,000-plus operating satellites in space.

103
04:39.650 --> 04:42.660
There's 130-plus million pieces of objects,

104
04:42.660 --> 04:44.580
anywhere from the size of a piece of dust

105
04:44.580 --> 04:46.080
up to the size of a city bus,

106
04:46.080 --> 04:49.560
moving between eight and 16 kilometers a second,

107
04:49.560 --> 04:52.530
uncontrollably through space, and we have no idea, really,

108
04:52.530 --> 04:54.630
with a lot of accuracy, where they are.

109
04:54.630 --> 04:56.760
So, that's a big threat.

110
04:56.760 --> 04:59.190
So, there's an even bigger opportunity,

111
04:59.190 --> 05:02.100
and I'm very conscious of the fact that we're here at CES,

112
05:02.100 --> 05:03.810
it's consumer electronics,

113
05:03.810 --> 05:06.270
and you don't wanna hear about probabilities of collision.

114
05:06.270 --> 05:07.980
You wanna hear about where's the opportunity,

115
05:07.980 --> 05:11.583
and the opportunity is in generating large amounts of data,

116
05:12.540 --> 05:16.710
whether ground-based or space-based, or anywhere in between.

117
05:16.710 --> 05:20.520
And then using AI and leveraging artificial intelligence

118
05:20.520 --> 05:24.060
to generate either applications or solutions

119
05:24.060 --> 05:25.860
or visualization techniques

120
05:25.860 --> 05:28.710
so that we have a sustainable economy.

121
05:28.710 --> 05:30.660
You don't want just sustainability in space,

122
05:30.660 --> 05:32.220
you want sustainability everywhere.

123
05:32.220 --> 05:34.830
So it's the idea of a circular economy

124
05:34.830 --> 05:37.470
is what this is all about and how we participate in that.

125
05:37.470 --> 05:39.870
For NorthStar's part, we participate

126
05:39.870 --> 05:42.840
with space-based, space situational awareness.

127
05:42.840 --> 05:44.940
We're the first company to commercialize that,

128
05:44.940 --> 05:46.500
and hopefully not the last.

129
05:46.500 --> 05:49.380
So, the idea is creating a community,

130
05:49.380 --> 05:52.023
and the folks that are on stage with me here,

131
05:52.023 --> 05:56.400
we've been working with all of them, in one form or another,

132
05:56.400 --> 05:58.500
to generate a community.

133
05:58.500 --> 06:00.840
And I think the most important thing I would like

134
06:00.840 --> 06:05.430
out of this show is to open up the opportunity

135
06:05.430 --> 06:09.600
beyond the space community to the general community

136
06:09.600 --> 06:13.140
because we are, as my colleagues have very clearly stated,

137
06:13.140 --> 06:15.540
we're all dependent on satellites.

138
06:15.540 --> 06:17.760
And so it's a fundamental part of our interest.

139
06:17.760 --> 06:20.100
And I think, for those of you that are interested

140
06:20.100 --> 06:23.040
in artificial intelligence, using artificial intelligence

141
06:23.040 --> 06:26.760
and using that to create a sustainable

142
06:26.760 --> 06:29.550
or a lot of opportunity in space,

143
06:29.550 --> 06:31.140
then this is the place to do it.

144
06:31.140 --> 06:34.650
So thanks for the invitation, it's a pleasure to be here.

145
06:34.650 --> 06:36.480
<v ->Sure thing, so we're gonna try to keep this</v>

146
06:36.480 --> 06:37.830
a little bit more interactive,

147
06:37.830 --> 06:39.870
so if any of the audience members

148
06:39.870 --> 06:42.120
have some burning questions, start thinking about them now.

149
06:42.120 --> 06:44.670
We'll come back to you in just a couple of minutes.

150
06:45.810 --> 06:50.100
So, on the topic of opportunity and on the topic of,

151
06:50.100 --> 06:51.810
you know, not just having data

152
06:51.810 --> 06:53.400
but really creating opportunities

153
06:53.400 --> 06:54.600
and, you know, about the economy,

154
06:54.600 --> 06:58.560
this kind of commercialization

155
06:58.560 --> 07:00.690
of sustainable space practices,

156
07:00.690 --> 07:02.700
like how does that process really work

157
07:02.700 --> 07:05.880
because you could imagine having some regulations

158
07:05.880 --> 07:08.910
that say a satellite operator needs to, you know,

159
07:08.910 --> 07:10.590
have their satellite BD orbited

160
07:10.590 --> 07:12.360
or be sent to graveyard orbit or, you know,

161
07:12.360 --> 07:17.100
you could regulate it, but is there, are you seeing,

162
07:17.100 --> 07:20.160
on the kind of, on the more consumer push side,

163
07:20.160 --> 07:21.780
are there companies or are there entities

164
07:21.780 --> 07:25.890
that are proactively trying to be sustainable in space,

165
07:25.890 --> 07:27.330
and is that creating a business for you?

166
07:27.330 --> 07:29.820
Is that, how does the...

167
07:29.820 --> 07:31.710
<v ->Yeah, sure, I'll take start of that.</v>

168
07:31.710 --> 07:33.963
So, the short answer is yes.

169
07:35.430 --> 07:38.610
So, I'll take a little bit of a step back

170
07:38.610 --> 07:40.443
to the start of your question there.

171
07:41.460 --> 07:44.550
In order to truly achieve a sustainable space,

172
07:44.550 --> 07:47.610
and by that, I mean environmentally and economically,

173
07:47.610 --> 07:50.137
and bring in much more of a circular economy in space,

174
07:50.137 --> 07:53.073
there are really three challenges that need to be solved.

175
07:54.060 --> 07:57.780
The policy and regulatory is one, the technology is another,

176
07:57.780 --> 07:59.820
and the economics is the third

177
07:59.820 --> 08:02.880
of actually how to make this business sustainable

178
08:02.880 --> 08:03.873
in and of itself.

179
08:04.800 --> 08:08.160
So, what we are seeing, and I think it's important

180
08:08.160 --> 08:12.120
to keep seeing, are advances in all three areas, okay?

181
08:12.120 --> 08:14.610
Policy cannot get ahead of the technology

182
08:14.610 --> 08:16.590
'cause that will suppress the industry.

183
08:16.590 --> 08:18.930
If technology gets too far ahead of the policy,

184
08:18.930 --> 08:21.480
it gets frustrating for those of us that do design

185
08:21.480 --> 08:23.250
and develop the technology.

186
08:23.250 --> 08:25.800
And in terms of the economics, we are,

187
08:25.800 --> 08:28.080
in all of our conversations with both government

188
08:28.080 --> 08:31.980
and commercial operators, seeing an increasing awareness

189
08:31.980 --> 08:33.930
of the challenge and an increasing interest

190
08:33.930 --> 08:35.850
in wanting to lean forward, to step forward,

191
08:35.850 --> 08:39.390
to do something in the various stages of their missions,

192
08:39.390 --> 08:40.680
whether that's through design,

193
08:40.680 --> 08:43.920
whether it's through engaging the services of like Slingshot

194
08:43.920 --> 08:46.230
and NorthStar to understand the environment

195
08:46.230 --> 08:47.280
in which they're operating

196
08:47.280 --> 08:49.260
and help them plan their operations.

197
08:49.260 --> 08:52.380
So it's all ends of this mission lifecycle

198
08:52.380 --> 08:54.513
that we're starting to see some changes.

199
08:55.770 --> 08:59.190
<v ->Yeah, I think, to add, from a commercial perspective,</v>

200
08:59.190 --> 09:02.550
is opportunity around more efficient operations.

201
09:02.550 --> 09:05.283
So, working with commercial providers,

202
09:06.600 --> 09:10.080
operators of spacecraft, to ensure that their missions

203
09:10.080 --> 09:11.490
are as efficient as possible.

204
09:11.490 --> 09:13.740
It costs money to move (chuckles) their spacecraft

205
09:13.740 --> 09:15.570
to avoid collisions.

206
09:15.570 --> 09:19.653
So, one of our platforms that we have, one of our products,

207
09:20.490 --> 09:24.390
has commercial operators using it to just communicate

208
09:24.390 --> 09:27.780
to one another, which sounds, you know, a bit silly,

209
09:27.780 --> 09:29.640
but that's the real thing.

210
09:29.640 --> 09:32.100
Are you moving, or should we move,

211
09:32.100 --> 09:33.630
and what is the cost of that,

212
09:33.630 --> 09:35.490
and what's the most efficient way to do this?

213
09:35.490 --> 09:38.730
So, you know, providing those efficiencies in space

214
09:38.730 --> 09:41.040
to some of these operators is so important.

215
09:41.040 --> 09:44.340
And I think, going back to what Clare was just saying,

216
09:44.340 --> 09:46.080
I struggle with the regulation piece.

217
09:46.080 --> 09:48.835
I sit on a lot of regulatory boards

218
09:48.835 --> 09:50.790
who are talking about this endlessly,

219
09:50.790 --> 09:51.930
and they are talking about it,

220
09:51.930 --> 09:54.300
and they are talking about it, and it's been talked about,

221
09:54.300 --> 09:57.570
and even King Charles, you know, back home in the UK,

222
09:57.570 --> 09:59.550
has started something called the Astra Carta,

223
09:59.550 --> 10:01.560
which is about, you know, more sustainable practices

224
10:01.560 --> 10:03.960
in space, but what tends to be missing

225
10:03.960 --> 10:07.140
from these conversations is those owner operators.

226
10:07.140 --> 10:09.390
And I think bringing in them into that conversation

227
10:09.390 --> 10:12.390
is gonna be really important because we can sit here

228
10:12.390 --> 10:15.360
and talk about regulation until the cows come home,

229
10:15.360 --> 10:17.730
but if the operator's not in the room,

230
10:17.730 --> 10:19.350
signing up for these things,

231
10:19.350 --> 10:21.180
which they probably won't, so, (chuckles)

232
10:21.180 --> 10:24.780
thinking about how we have more creative solutions

233
10:24.780 --> 10:26.850
around regulations and legislation

234
10:26.850 --> 10:28.890
is gonna be really important for us going forward,

235
10:28.890 --> 10:32.070
and it might be more of a carrot versus a stick.

236
10:32.070 --> 10:34.260
We are talking about not just nation states here

237
10:34.260 --> 10:36.270
that are launching these spacecraft

238
10:36.270 --> 10:37.410
and operating these spacecraft,

239
10:37.410 --> 10:39.600
we're talking about individuals and private companies,

240
10:39.600 --> 10:41.250
and that's a lot trickier to regulate,

241
10:41.250 --> 10:43.380
so bringing them in on the conversation,

242
10:43.380 --> 10:46.290
as well as supporting their operations, to be more efficient

243
10:46.290 --> 10:47.810
and more sustainable and safe as well

244
10:47.810 --> 10:50.673
is something that we're really proud of at Slingshot.

245
10:51.540 --> 10:53.880
<v ->So, space is already commercialized.</v>

246
10:53.880 --> 10:58.880
I mean, Starlink, the number of satellites

247
10:59.013 --> 11:02.283
that are operating in space are more commercial

248
11:02.283 --> 11:05.566
than government-owned, and the challenges,

249
11:05.566 --> 11:09.150
Clare pointed it out, the three legs of the stool,

250
11:09.150 --> 11:11.580
business, technology, and a legal framework,

251
11:11.580 --> 11:14.400
or a regulatory framework, all part of a framework

252
11:14.400 --> 11:18.900
in any industry, in any industry at all,

253
11:18.900 --> 11:23.700
the entertainment industry, the meat packing industry.

254
11:23.700 --> 11:27.150
If you don't have business technology and legal aspects,

255
11:27.150 --> 11:29.670
you don't know what your reference points are.

256
11:29.670 --> 11:32.760
And there's, as Melissa was pointing out,

257
11:32.760 --> 11:37.323
there's a bit of an atrophy on the legal side to catch up,

258
11:38.730 --> 11:42.233
and there needs to be a cooperation between those three.

259
11:42.233 --> 11:46.590
And it's a great opportunity for commercial enterprise

260
11:46.590 --> 11:51.300
to work within this framework because commercial enterprise

261
11:51.300 --> 11:53.730
is the only thing that can move as fast

262
11:53.730 --> 11:55.257
as the industry is moving.

263
11:55.257 --> 11:57.753
The satellites are moving quickly in space,

264
11:58.620 --> 12:01.320
between eight and 16 kilometers a second,

265
12:01.320 --> 12:06.320
and the changing environment in space is changing rapidly,

266
12:07.260 --> 12:10.620
and governments don't keep up with that, period.

267
12:10.620 --> 12:12.900
Only commercial enterprise can keep up with that,

268
12:12.900 --> 12:15.600
which, back to my opening statement,

269
12:15.600 --> 12:20.259
creates a great opportunity for entrepreneurs, innovators,

270
12:20.259 --> 12:22.680
artificial intelligence, machine learning

271
12:22.680 --> 12:26.490
to combine with algorithm software and large amounts of data

272
12:26.490 --> 12:29.520
to create a whole lot of applications

273
12:29.520 --> 12:32.430
that create economic benefit.

274
12:32.430 --> 12:35.643
And that economic benefit is the promise of space.

275
12:37.524 --> 12:40.980
<v ->We'll pause for audience questions or comments,</v>

276
12:40.980 --> 12:43.413
if anybody wants to take a stab at it.

277
12:44.280 --> 12:49.170
Going once, going twice, all right-

278
12:49.170 --> 12:50.610
<v Audience Member>I have a question.</v>

279
12:50.610 --> 12:52.110
<v ->Okay, please.</v>

280
12:52.110 --> 12:53.710
You can either talk loudly or...

281
12:57.390 --> 12:58.223
<v Audience Member>Thank you.</v>

282
12:58.223 --> 12:59.083
<v Blaine>Sure.</v>

283
12:59.083 --> 12:59.916
<v Audience Member>I was wondering</v>

284
12:59.916 --> 13:04.916
how we could potentially set up a, let's say,

285
13:05.430 --> 13:08.220
board or consortium, whatever phrase you wanna use,

286
13:08.220 --> 13:11.400
where private industry can debate and deliberate

287
13:11.400 --> 13:13.320
against each other for ways

288
13:13.320 --> 13:16.650
that regulation could potentially be passed,

289
13:16.650 --> 13:20.520
as I believe in having multiple companies

290
13:20.520 --> 13:22.230
that would debate each other,

291
13:22.230 --> 13:25.410
acting as sort of a weighing balance upon each other,

292
13:25.410 --> 13:28.020
where, obviously, they wouldn't want the other person going

293
13:28.020 --> 13:30.450
and blowing up their satellite, causing problems

294
13:30.450 --> 13:33.690
for everyone else, while also suggesting ways

295
13:33.690 --> 13:36.453
that it could be done economically for, sorry,

296
13:38.340 --> 13:42.060
ways that satellites could be managed economically,

297
13:42.060 --> 13:43.440
so that way we don't have people

298
13:43.440 --> 13:45.300
having to burn all of their fuel

299
13:45.300 --> 13:47.730
in order to comply with some government regulation

300
13:47.730 --> 13:48.690
that's written somewhere,

301
13:48.690 --> 13:51.840
as I believe it would maximize all the possible faucets

302
13:51.840 --> 13:56.133
of satellite management in orbit.

303
13:59.280 --> 14:03.240
<v ->Yep, so I'll, there are a couple of different types</v>

304
14:03.240 --> 14:05.290
of consortium that exist within the US

305
14:06.150 --> 14:08.430
that are specifically looking

306
14:08.430 --> 14:12.393
at the on-orbit servicing aspects of the logistics in space.

307
14:13.380 --> 14:17.520
One of those is COSMIC, and that actually brings industry

308
14:17.520 --> 14:20.280
and the government and academia into the room

309
14:20.280 --> 14:22.200
to do exactly what you're talking about, right,

310
14:22.200 --> 14:23.130
to debate the points,

311
14:23.130 --> 14:25.440
bring the different perspectives forward,

312
14:25.440 --> 14:28.680
look at everything from education

313
14:28.680 --> 14:30.030
and the workforce coming in

314
14:30.030 --> 14:32.370
through to how we do test and demonstration platforms

315
14:32.370 --> 14:35.940
on orbit, and the policy and regulation aspects.

316
14:35.940 --> 14:38.910
Internationally, there's one called CONFERS,

317
14:38.910 --> 14:41.609
and I always forget the acronym, so I'm not going to try.

318
14:41.609 --> 14:43.590
(chuckles) If one of my colleagues here remembers,

319
14:43.590 --> 14:47.880
they can jump in, but that does a very similar thing.

320
14:47.880 --> 14:50.580
It was started by DARPA,

321
14:50.580 --> 14:53.820
and it's since gone independently on its own,

322
14:53.820 --> 14:57.090
and CONFERS also tries to bring the different voices

323
14:57.090 --> 14:58.290
to the table.

324
14:58.290 --> 14:59.370
The difference with CONFERS

325
14:59.370 --> 15:03.750
is it actually has created a couple of draft standards,

326
15:03.750 --> 15:06.390
and then they get passed off to another organization,

327
15:06.390 --> 15:10.470
so, there are many different little forum.

328
15:10.470 --> 15:11.760
I think probably what we're missing

329
15:11.760 --> 15:14.730
is a bit of an overarching ownership

330
15:14.730 --> 15:17.013
of who owns the problem to try to solve it.

331
15:18.000 --> 15:21.180
It is, I believe, clearer in the UK, under that framework,

332
15:21.180 --> 15:22.500
than it is in the US.

333
15:22.500 --> 15:26.100
In the US, because of the length and duration

334
15:26.100 --> 15:27.660
of the space industry today,

335
15:27.660 --> 15:31.560
there are many different organizations that are responsible

336
15:31.560 --> 15:33.480
for different elements of the industry.

337
15:33.480 --> 15:36.693
And that is causing some more challenges on the US side.

338
15:39.240 --> 15:41.280
<v ->There are, to complement that,</v>

339
15:41.280 --> 15:42.870
I think you've already answered the question,

340
15:42.870 --> 15:47.870
so, to complement that, there are many organizations

341
15:48.780 --> 15:50.493
that are finding their way,

342
15:51.330 --> 15:53.730
because this is all very new and moving very quickly,

343
15:53.730 --> 15:56.550
including the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs,

344
15:56.550 --> 16:00.420
including COPUS, which is a committee

345
16:00.420 --> 16:03.780
with inside the United Nations, including the ITU,

346
16:03.780 --> 16:05.880
International Telecommunications Union,

347
16:05.880 --> 16:10.860
and including SpaceOps, which has a major working group

348
16:10.860 --> 16:13.350
that does, again, in parallel with other things,

349
16:13.350 --> 16:14.823
exactly what you talk about.

350
16:15.690 --> 16:18.270
The big challenge that we're facing,

351
16:18.270 --> 16:19.860
and so we don't have all the answers,

352
16:19.860 --> 16:21.780
we just know what the problems are right now

353
16:21.780 --> 16:23.070
and working through them,

354
16:23.070 --> 16:27.150
is who is going to curate the data,

355
16:27.150 --> 16:29.100
'cause it's gonna be a global system.

356
16:29.100 --> 16:32.850
Who would curate that data and say it's been validated

357
16:32.850 --> 16:34.080
and verified?

358
16:34.080 --> 16:38.937
And so, earlier, well, I'm sorry, late last year,

359
16:38.937 --> 16:41.880
in New York at the United Nations,

360
16:41.880 --> 16:43.410
there was a meeting I attended,

361
16:43.410 --> 16:47.520
and the big question was who would be in charge of all that?

362
16:47.520 --> 16:50.880
My vote would be that it's something like the United Nations

363
16:50.880 --> 16:53.400
that would want to be a neutral body.

364
16:53.400 --> 16:56.730
Whether or not they can fill that role is another question.

365
16:56.730 --> 16:58.860
So the part that I wanna bring clear to you

366
16:58.860 --> 17:00.390
is where's the challenges?

367
17:00.390 --> 17:03.870
It's in validating and verifying the data source,

368
17:03.870 --> 17:07.020
and that gets even more complicated

369
17:07.020 --> 17:09.240
when you add in artificial intelligence

370
17:09.240 --> 17:12.540
because then, who's actually responsible for the information

371
17:12.540 --> 17:14.490
that's being delivered when you've added AI

372
17:14.490 --> 17:17.550
into the process, but you need to do all that.

373
17:17.550 --> 17:18.870
And so if you're starting to think,

374
17:18.870 --> 17:20.400
like I'm painting a picture,

375
17:20.400 --> 17:22.740
it brings you back to we better get moving quickly

376
17:22.740 --> 17:24.360
on the points that Melissa and Clare brought up

377
17:24.360 --> 17:27.660
about we better get moving on legal and regulatory framework

378
17:27.660 --> 17:30.240
so that we can move as quickly on the technology part,

379
17:30.240 --> 17:32.310
so it doesn't get too far left behind.

380
17:32.310 --> 17:36.210
So you've tapped into this circular exercise

381
17:36.210 --> 17:38.550
that we're trying to bring together as a community,

382
17:38.550 --> 17:40.290
and it's very challenging

383
17:40.290 --> 17:43.230
because it needs to be done very quickly.

384
17:43.230 --> 17:45.960
It's not something we can wait for

385
17:45.960 --> 17:48.657
because what we wanna do is facilitate more use of space

386
17:48.657 --> 17:50.730
and more effective use of space.

387
17:50.730 --> 17:52.200
And one of the biggest things that's preventing that

388
17:52.200 --> 17:55.143
is our ability to close that loop.

389
17:57.150 --> 17:58.050
<v ->Anything to add?</v>

390
17:59.790 --> 18:02.010
<v ->Yeah, I was just gonna say it's,</v>

391
18:02.010 --> 18:04.713
that closing of the value chain of the data

392
18:04.713 --> 18:07.413
is really challenging because, you know,

393
18:08.580 --> 18:10.007
this time almost last year,

394
18:10.007 --> 18:12.960
there was a lot of conversation around interoperability

395
18:12.960 --> 18:15.240
and bringing these communities together,

396
18:15.240 --> 18:19.620
between legal and academia and industry and government.

397
18:19.620 --> 18:22.650
And then, suddenly, I would say in the last few months,

398
18:22.650 --> 18:25.920
the shift globally has been,

399
18:25.920 --> 18:28.230
we want our own sovereign capability.

400
18:28.230 --> 18:30.990
We want to be able to see, use our own sovereign data

401
18:30.990 --> 18:34.290
from our own sovereign hardware to see what we need to see

402
18:34.290 --> 18:35.730
at the exact time we need to see it.

403
18:35.730 --> 18:39.750
So, I've noticed quite a shift internationally,

404
18:39.750 --> 18:42.060
almost away from where I hope we were heading,

405
18:42.060 --> 18:45.570
which was almost an interoperability and that data sharing

406
18:45.570 --> 18:50.100
and almost a single truth of, a source of truth for space,

407
18:50.100 --> 18:52.860
you know, where are spacecraft, who's doing what?

408
18:52.860 --> 18:54.630
And you're starting to now see this shift,

409
18:54.630 --> 18:57.960
and that is concerning if we're not careful,

410
18:57.960 --> 19:00.120
where we all stand up our own, you know,

411
19:00.120 --> 19:04.080
separate types of data sources.

412
19:04.080 --> 19:07.080
So it is a challenge, it's a massive challenge.

413
19:07.080 --> 19:09.600
And I go to these great round tables and workshops

414
19:09.600 --> 19:12.330
with the United Nations, and we had one recently,

415
19:12.330 --> 19:14.730
it was like, write all the challenges there are,

416
19:14.730 --> 19:16.619
and there's like hundreds of them, and then it's like,

417
19:16.619 --> 19:17.452
okay, where are all the solutions?

418
19:17.452 --> 19:20.310
And there was like five notes up on the wall.

419
19:20.310 --> 19:21.598
It is really tricky,

420
19:21.598 --> 19:23.637
but you have some really powerful minds on it.

421
19:23.637 --> 19:26.220
And I think the best thing about what we're doing

422
19:26.220 --> 19:28.710
is that we all need it to work.

423
19:28.710 --> 19:31.530
So there's a motivation there for all countries

424
19:31.530 --> 19:35.970
to keep space sustainable because if we mess it up,

425
19:35.970 --> 19:37.080
nobody can use it.

426
19:37.080 --> 19:40.260
So there is that motivation there, but yeah, I think,

427
19:40.260 --> 19:42.240
you know, you're onto a good thing.

428
19:42.240 --> 19:44.793
There's just some more challenges stuck in there.

429
19:47.070 --> 19:48.870
<v ->Yeah, well, we're all set up here.</v>

430
19:48.870 --> 19:50.583
We got a full house of mics.

431
19:51.750 --> 19:52.583
Any-

432
19:52.583 --> 19:53.416
<v Stewart>I was hiding the other mic, (indistinct).</v>

433
19:53.416 --> 19:54.249
<v ->Thank you very much.</v>

434
19:54.249 --> 19:56.520
Any other questions from the audience for now?

435
19:56.520 --> 19:59.940
Otherwise, we can come back in a few minutes.

436
19:59.940 --> 20:00.773
Okay.

437
20:03.990 --> 20:06.090
So challenges, you've talked about the challenges

438
20:06.090 --> 20:08.010
on the more kind of like regulatory side

439
20:08.010 --> 20:09.990
and the more just trying to get everyone's ducks in a row

440
20:09.990 --> 20:11.140
and that kind of thing.

441
20:12.240 --> 20:14.310
What about on the technology side challenges,

442
20:14.310 --> 20:17.040
what are some of the, if you could snap your fingers

443
20:17.040 --> 20:20.070
and have one big tech challenge disappear tomorrow,

444
20:20.070 --> 20:23.400
what would that challenge be, or just maybe more broadly,

445
20:23.400 --> 20:26.640
what are some of the, you know, the big tech challenges

446
20:26.640 --> 20:29.433
that you're facing in trying to do what you're doing?

447
20:32.160 --> 20:36.750
<v ->I think a lot of the technology challenges have been</v>

448
20:36.750 --> 20:38.430
or are being addressed right now

449
20:38.430 --> 20:43.430
from a on-orbit servicing perspective, from what, you know,

450
20:46.200 --> 20:49.503
we're doing there and what we're doing with SSA,

451
20:50.760 --> 20:55.760
but we need to make it more accessible.

452
20:57.450 --> 21:01.980
That's a tech challenge, and that's what's, again,

453
21:01.980 --> 21:06.980
interesting about having a opportunity to speak at this show

454
21:07.380 --> 21:09.780
in that we want artificial intelligence,

455
21:09.780 --> 21:10.830
we want machine learning,

456
21:10.830 --> 21:14.760
we wanna leverage a more general approach

457
21:14.760 --> 21:19.760
so that this becomes much more normalized,

458
21:19.860 --> 21:22.560
from a technical perspective, not a science project.

459
21:22.560 --> 21:23.940
The biggest challenge technically

460
21:23.940 --> 21:27.390
is to get it out of the lab and get it into production.

461
21:27.390 --> 21:30.573
And I think, if I could snap my fingers and have that,

462
21:31.500 --> 21:34.350
for me, that would be a very good position

463
21:34.350 --> 21:37.230
for us all to be in, so we really want to turn the corner

464
21:37.230 --> 21:42.230
on adopting general practices and getting more participation

465
21:43.986 --> 21:48.060
from non-space entities into a community

466
21:48.060 --> 21:52.350
that makes it more robust, and in that sense,

467
21:52.350 --> 21:53.200
more sustainable.

468
21:56.790 --> 21:57.623
<v ->Okay.</v>

469
21:59.920 --> 22:01.410
From Astroscale's perspective,

470
22:01.410 --> 22:03.090
our focus is in on-orbit assets,

471
22:03.090 --> 22:05.370
so we actually build satellites

472
22:05.370 --> 22:07.353
that become on-orbit service vehicles.

473
22:08.850 --> 22:13.850
The technology to start this process is there.

474
22:14.070 --> 22:17.190
We have launched two missions into orbit.

475
22:17.190 --> 22:21.180
We can do the rendezvous and the proximity operations.

476
22:21.180 --> 22:23.370
We can dock with another object.

477
22:23.370 --> 22:27.060
There are elements that I would love to see in the future.

478
22:27.060 --> 22:29.710
So I would love to bring in more autonomy

479
22:31.140 --> 22:33.600
into the way that we do our rendezvous

480
22:33.600 --> 22:35.310
and proximity operations.

481
22:35.310 --> 22:37.680
And it's actually driven exactly to what you were saying,

482
22:37.680 --> 22:40.890
it's the accessibility of it, it's the safety,

483
22:40.890 --> 22:45.240
it's the repeatability, and the assurance to the customer

484
22:45.240 --> 22:48.900
that when they ask for a service, the service will be there.

485
22:48.900 --> 22:52.893
Space, traditionally, is a very conservative industry.

486
22:54.000 --> 22:57.900
It is one that likes to always be second.

487
22:57.900 --> 22:59.610
So, someone else has done it first,

488
22:59.610 --> 23:02.730
and then they'll move down the chain afterwards.

489
23:02.730 --> 23:05.280
If I could snap my fingers and change one thing

490
23:05.280 --> 23:08.973
about the technology challenge, it will be to not be second.

491
23:10.560 --> 23:12.090
<v ->Yeah, and I think, just building on that,</v>

492
23:12.090 --> 23:16.680
the technology is, the challenge is getting the investment,

493
23:16.680 --> 23:21.150
really, is getting it out of R&amp;D and into productization

494
23:21.150 --> 23:26.150
and out to the customer, so, you know,

495
23:26.220 --> 23:29.760
I think awareness that Stewart was talking about

496
23:29.760 --> 23:33.480
with outside of the space community is so important.

497
23:33.480 --> 23:36.960
Understanding the need for these technologies to exist

498
23:36.960 --> 23:40.710
to protect all these other amazing ones is something else.

499
23:40.710 --> 23:43.230
I think, from a Slingshot perspective,

500
23:43.230 --> 23:46.920
we have 180 optical sensors around the world.

501
23:46.920 --> 23:49.740
We are pulling in, just as of last week now,

502
23:49.740 --> 23:52.860
two billion observations a day.

503
23:52.860 --> 23:55.230
We see all the way from low Earth orbit

504
23:55.230 --> 23:57.660
all the way out to cislunar, day and night,

505
23:57.660 --> 24:00.990
that has a ton of data.

506
24:00.990 --> 24:04.080
So, for us, the challenge of, you know, fusing that data

507
24:04.080 --> 24:06.720
with other sources like, you know, like NorthStar's,

508
24:06.720 --> 24:11.720
for instance, who are on-orbit, to radar data,

509
24:11.730 --> 24:14.280
fusing, you know, that's incredible amount of data.

510
24:14.280 --> 24:16.590
So I think for us, the technology challenge

511
24:16.590 --> 24:20.190
is, obviously, pulling the right insights out of that data,

512
24:20.190 --> 24:23.190
which we are doing now is with our new AI product,

513
24:23.190 --> 24:24.720
but also, you know, I think,

514
24:24.720 --> 24:26.250
from a sustainability perspective,

515
24:26.250 --> 24:27.930
it's the storage of that data.

516
24:27.930 --> 24:32.760
It's, you know, how that, always see that balance

517
24:32.760 --> 24:36.270
between getting something that's more sustainable

518
24:36.270 --> 24:38.430
but causing another problem down the line as well.

519
24:38.430 --> 24:40.410
So I think, looking at the whole value chain

520
24:40.410 --> 24:43.800
of sustainability and the technologies that we're creating

521
24:43.800 --> 24:47.400
with AI, but also that has a cost to that.

522
24:47.400 --> 24:50.610
So I think there's a great challenge there, again, for space

523
24:50.610 --> 24:54.430
is how we take that data, maybe do more of it in orbit

524
24:55.380 --> 24:56.997
rather than down here on Earth

525
24:56.997 --> 24:59.403
and add to some of the problems we already have.

526
25:00.360 --> 25:02.730
<v ->Two billion observations per day.</v>

527
25:02.730 --> 25:07.730
Two billion, man, and how does that whole process work?

528
25:07.980 --> 25:09.540
I mean, you're collecting all this data,

529
25:09.540 --> 25:11.850
and it's gotta get stored somewhere, and it's gotta be,

530
25:11.850 --> 25:13.170
it's being sent through, I guess,

531
25:13.170 --> 25:16.230
all these various cloud servers, but I mean, is that,

532
25:16.230 --> 25:18.390
do you have any secret sauce or any info

533
25:18.390 --> 25:21.810
on how you guys collect two billion data points per day?

534
25:21.810 --> 25:25.140
<v ->Yeah, so we have our own patented sensors.</v>

535
25:25.140 --> 25:29.640
We have our own TCPED, so that obviously takes the data

536
25:29.640 --> 25:32.430
and puts it into more of usable, then we fuse all that.

537
25:32.430 --> 25:34.740
We have multiple software products that we do,

538
25:34.740 --> 25:36.480
depending on the customer's needs at the end,

539
25:36.480 --> 25:41.220
but the product I just talked about, RAI, machine learning,

540
25:41.220 --> 25:44.220
it's called Agatha, we just did with DARPA actually.

541
25:44.220 --> 25:47.520
And that is taking a lot of this data from constellations

542
25:47.520 --> 25:50.250
and looking at very minute differences

543
25:50.250 --> 25:53.520
for nefarious activities hidden among constellations.

544
25:53.520 --> 25:55.770
So, one of the things that we're doing

545
25:55.770 --> 26:00.770
is taking those tens of thousands, millions of pieces

546
26:00.810 --> 26:03.960
of data and identifying where the nefarious activity

547
26:03.960 --> 26:06.720
is happening, which the human eye will just never be able

548
26:06.720 --> 26:07.553
to pick up.

549
26:07.553 --> 26:10.740
So one spacecraft hidden amongst a constellation

550
26:10.740 --> 26:13.440
that might just slightly be turned a different way,

551
26:13.440 --> 26:14.430
for instance.

552
26:14.430 --> 26:17.550
So AI, 100%, is the way that we need to move forward.

553
26:17.550 --> 26:22.170
We have all the data that we need at the moment,

554
26:22.170 --> 26:24.870
but now it's just making that usable for the customer.

555
26:26.520 --> 26:28.470
<v ->So if I can summarize, I mean,</v>

556
26:28.470 --> 26:30.330
it sounds like it's a little bit more

557
26:30.330 --> 26:34.110
of a software/user interface kind of,

558
26:34.110 --> 26:36.660
it's not a hardware problem per se as much.

559
26:36.660 --> 26:40.080
It's more of a getting the data, analyzing it,

560
26:40.080 --> 26:43.050
making it usable for the customers, et cetera.

561
26:43.050 --> 26:46.410
Is that a fair characterization that...

562
26:46.410 --> 26:48.300
<v ->I think, to be simple with it,</v>

563
26:48.300 --> 26:50.430
it's improving the user experience.

564
26:50.430 --> 26:52.290
So what you wanna do is make it easier for the user

565
26:52.290 --> 26:53.640
to understand what's happening.

566
26:53.640 --> 26:57.240
Even if you have a background in engineering or astrophysics

567
26:57.240 --> 26:59.760
or orbital dynamics, you still want to be able to look at it

568
26:59.760 --> 27:01.530
and go, "Okay, I get what's happening."

569
27:01.530 --> 27:05.760
And that can be very much facilitated by non-space,

570
27:05.760 --> 27:09.510
traditionally non-space technologies, AI, machine learning,

571
27:09.510 --> 27:12.240
other types of graphic developments

572
27:12.240 --> 27:13.260
that are already out there,

573
27:13.260 --> 27:15.543
so that's where you have to go with it next.

574
27:16.740 --> 27:19.590
<v ->Yeah, that user interface is so important.</v>

575
27:19.590 --> 27:21.696
The visualization of the data,

576
27:21.696 --> 27:22.950
it all comes down to it, doesn't it?

577
27:22.950 --> 27:24.330
<v ->Oh, I can't imagine, 'cause otherwise,</v>

578
27:24.330 --> 27:27.210
you just have all these, you know, little specs in space

579
27:27.210 --> 27:28.770
that are moving at some velocity

580
27:28.770 --> 27:30.000
and that are moving in some direction,

581
27:30.000 --> 27:33.690
and it doesn't immediately become apparent

582
27:33.690 --> 27:36.330
what you're trying to say, unless you have it visualized.

583
27:36.330 --> 27:37.470
<v ->Yeah, check out our website.</v>

584
27:37.470 --> 27:41.703
You can see an example of how we do it, anyways.

585
27:43.200 --> 27:46.260
<v ->Yeah, 'cause it's not a 2D problem.</v>

586
27:46.260 --> 27:49.860
The ocean is a good example as an analogy to space.

587
27:49.860 --> 27:51.720
It's a 3D problem, there's depth.

588
27:51.720 --> 27:53.160
So what you wanna do is figure out,

589
27:53.160 --> 27:55.320
in a three-dimensional way, where everything is,

590
27:55.320 --> 27:57.390
and if things start to collide with each other,

591
27:57.390 --> 27:58.680
they change each other's trajectory

592
27:58.680 --> 28:00.540
like balls on a pool table.

593
28:00.540 --> 28:03.180
So you're really wanting to know what you can expect

594
28:03.180 --> 28:07.380
and what's that gonna look like, 96 hours, 192 hours,

595
28:07.380 --> 28:09.480
20 days from now.

596
28:09.480 --> 28:12.510
You wanna know what is the possible,

597
28:12.510 --> 28:15.690
how does that affect my day in a month from now,

598
28:15.690 --> 28:17.370
'cause if I'm planning a space mission,

599
28:17.370 --> 28:22.200
or if I'm planning to launch a new capability in space,

600
28:22.200 --> 28:25.890
I wanna know if I'm launching myself into a debris mess,

601
28:25.890 --> 28:28.590
or a debris mess that hasn't been developed yet,

602
28:28.590 --> 28:30.390
and how do we avoid that?

603
28:30.390 --> 28:31.920
So that's really what it comes down to.

604
28:31.920 --> 28:35.310
It's predictability and prediction of situations

605
28:35.310 --> 28:36.660
so that we can accommodate.

606
28:37.965 --> 28:40.650
<v ->Very good, any audience questions?</v>

607
28:40.650 --> 28:43.140
We're down to about 10 minutes.

608
28:43.140 --> 28:48.140
Going once, twice, yes, I see a hand in the back.

609
28:48.660 --> 28:51.510
You can either yell from there, or...

610
28:51.510 --> 28:52.620
<v Audience Member>I'll just try to yell.</v>

611
28:52.620 --> 28:53.453
<v ->We hear ya.</v>

612
28:55.710 --> 28:57.058
<v Audience Member>Two questions</v>

613
28:57.058 --> 29:00.423
that I think are kind of related.

614
29:00.423 --> 29:04.560
One is just this broad question that, in general,

615
29:04.560 --> 29:05.910
it seems like (indistinct).

616
29:08.160 --> 29:10.950
It seems like oftentimes, there's,

617
29:10.950 --> 29:13.500
like, in the current day and age,

618
29:13.500 --> 29:15.750
kind of to the points that were discussed,

619
29:15.750 --> 29:18.570
it's kind of overlooked or perhaps underappreciated,

620
29:18.570 --> 29:21.090
the important role that space plays

621
29:21.090 --> 29:24.660
in all these different other realms of the economy,

622
29:24.660 --> 29:29.160
kind of very much so underpinning a lot of it,

623
29:29.160 --> 29:31.533
but what I'm wondering is, if you think,

624
29:32.814 --> 29:36.159
perhaps, to the conversation (indistinct)

625
29:36.159 --> 29:39.480
the regulatory piece, in many ways, kind of lagging behind,

626
29:39.480 --> 29:44.130
there needs to be maybe some like, unfortunate event

627
29:44.130 --> 29:46.530
that happens that will then create

628
29:46.530 --> 29:48.990
this kind of reactionary posture

629
29:48.990 --> 29:53.430
to then be more of a catalyst for policymaking

630
29:53.430 --> 29:56.199
that actually addresses some of the issues,

631
29:56.199 --> 29:59.670
or if perhaps there could be some other kind of like,

632
29:59.670 --> 30:01.710
inspiring cultural moment,

633
30:01.710 --> 30:05.820
almost similar to how like the Apollo moon landing

634
30:05.820 --> 30:09.150
captured the imagination of so many people

635
30:09.150 --> 30:12.060
around the country, policymakers included,

636
30:12.060 --> 30:14.910
that could hopefully kind of take the place

637
30:14.910 --> 30:18.243
of whatever that potential kind of negative reactionary.

638
30:19.620 --> 30:22.263
<v ->You've just, this is my passion.</v>

639
30:23.160 --> 30:26.610
So space has a PR problem, I would say.

640
30:26.610 --> 30:30.240
Space, we go to, you know, we see each other on the circuit,

641
30:30.240 --> 30:32.010
we're all at the same space conferences.

642
30:32.010 --> 30:34.860
That's why it's brilliant to be at a non-space conference.

643
30:34.860 --> 30:38.160
And we're so good at telling each other how amazing we are

644
30:38.160 --> 30:40.560
and how space is like gonna save everybody,

645
30:40.560 --> 30:41.970
and isn't that awesome?

646
30:41.970 --> 30:45.060
And we're absolutely shockingly bad at communicating that

647
30:45.060 --> 30:47.553
to a wider audience, like really bad.

648
30:49.380 --> 30:52.410
We need better storytellers for space, 100%.

649
30:52.410 --> 30:53.580
We need people to connect.

650
30:53.580 --> 30:56.550
I think most people just have such a disconnect

651
30:56.550 --> 30:58.920
from what we look at every night

652
30:58.920 --> 31:01.530
and how it enables our everyday lives.

653
31:01.530 --> 31:04.980
I spent 10 years doing launch, and that's an easy thing.

654
31:04.980 --> 31:08.340
Launch is quite easy to, people can see it, they get excited

655
31:08.340 --> 31:10.770
by it, they can feel it, they can smell it,

656
31:10.770 --> 31:12.900
but with a lot of the technologies that we're doing,

657
31:12.900 --> 31:15.000
people can't, they don't get it.

658
31:15.000 --> 31:19.320
So, yeah, I agree, and I'm trying to, you know, been trying

659
31:19.320 --> 31:23.760
to do a much better job of getting out into wider audiences.

660
31:23.760 --> 31:24.930
I think the main thing

661
31:24.930 --> 31:27.690
is space thinks it's its own industry.

662
31:27.690 --> 31:30.330
We're not, we cross every other industry,

663
31:30.330 --> 31:32.910
and I think, coming to conferences like this,

664
31:32.910 --> 31:36.570
speaking outside of our normal kind of space,

665
31:36.570 --> 31:38.550
I go and speak at sustainability conferences,

666
31:38.550 --> 31:40.860
I go and put myself in front of Extinction Rebellion,

667
31:40.860 --> 31:43.530
I go and try and get the message out into different areas

668
31:43.530 --> 31:46.230
because that awareness piece is so critical,

669
31:46.230 --> 31:48.720
because like CrowdStrike, if something were to happen

670
31:48.720 --> 31:51.750
to space, and I unfortunately do think

671
31:51.750 --> 31:55.920
it will take something to happen to wake everybody up to it.

672
31:55.920 --> 31:59.343
I hope it doesn't, but it probably, knowing, again, humans,

673
32:00.240 --> 32:03.900
it might, and so, you know, you're speaking,

674
32:03.900 --> 32:05.760
you know, my language on this,

675
32:05.760 --> 32:08.520
so we definitely need some better communicators

676
32:08.520 --> 32:12.270
and storytellers, and we need to bring more artists,

677
32:12.270 --> 32:14.850
I would say, into space to help.

678
32:14.850 --> 32:16.440
You know, when William Shatner came back down

679
32:16.440 --> 32:18.720
off of Blue Origin, you know, say what you will about him,

680
32:18.720 --> 32:21.390
but he communicated the power of space,

681
32:21.390 --> 32:24.780
like I've never met a space industry person be,

682
32:24.780 --> 32:27.450
or an astronaut do it in a way that he was able to just say

683
32:27.450 --> 32:30.330
like, communicate as an actor, as an artist,

684
32:30.330 --> 32:31.980
and I think we need more of that.

685
32:32.850 --> 32:34.000
<v ->Can I just say ditto?</v>

686
32:35.070 --> 32:36.798
Your premise is not wrong,

687
32:36.798 --> 32:39.003
from the way you phrased it just then.

688
32:41.850 --> 32:46.320
It's very important to raise awareness

689
32:46.320 --> 32:48.093
and educate more broadly.

690
32:49.950 --> 32:53.580
I think one of the challenges we've had is space,

691
32:53.580 --> 32:55.800
we do consider ourselves a little bit of our own industry.

692
32:55.800 --> 32:57.300
We are very insular.

693
32:57.300 --> 33:00.420
It is very important for us to come out of our comfort zone

694
33:00.420 --> 33:03.120
and come to shows like CES, which is, by far,

695
33:03.120 --> 33:05.700
the largest show I have ever been to,

696
33:05.700 --> 33:09.510
and talk and share what it is that we do

697
33:09.510 --> 33:12.060
and what some of the challenges are that we have.

698
33:12.060 --> 33:16.560
At the moment, space is a piece of many other industries.

699
33:16.560 --> 33:17.393
And so, therefore,

700
33:17.393 --> 33:19.050
I think that's where you've got a little bit of a dichotomy.

701
33:19.050 --> 33:21.510
We see ourselves as an industry, but actually,

702
33:21.510 --> 33:24.930
we are part of everybody else's solutions,

703
33:24.930 --> 33:27.910
and we need to, as you say, tell that story better

704
33:27.910 --> 33:32.130
and be bold about it, be very, you know, very confident

705
33:32.130 --> 33:34.443
in what it is that space can do for people.

706
33:35.550 --> 33:38.700
As to whether it will take a catastrophic event,

707
33:38.700 --> 33:42.720
I first started studying the challenge of space debris

708
33:42.720 --> 33:45.090
when I completed my doctorate,

709
33:45.090 --> 33:46.650
so, I'm not gonna tell you how many years

710
33:46.650 --> 33:50.850
'cause it's just depressing, but, at the time,

711
33:50.850 --> 33:52.140
we too were talking then.

712
33:52.140 --> 33:54.540
It's like, "Well, if we had an on-orbit collision,

713
33:54.540 --> 33:56.970
would that help us create the policy

714
33:56.970 --> 33:58.920
and regulatory environment we need

715
33:58.920 --> 34:02.340
in order to help create a sustainable environment?"

716
34:02.340 --> 34:05.430
We have had events on-orbit.

717
34:05.430 --> 34:06.690
They have occurred.

718
34:06.690 --> 34:08.463
Satellites have been destroyed.

719
34:09.360 --> 34:13.230
They have not, as yet, been of a magnitude

720
34:13.230 --> 34:15.930
to cause more than a slight ripple within the industry

721
34:15.930 --> 34:18.580
or company that was directly affected, unfortunately.

722
34:20.520 --> 34:22.263
<v ->Fear is a good motivator.</v>

723
34:24.210 --> 34:26.253
So you've touched on the fear factor.

724
34:28.890 --> 34:31.380
If it happens, it may be too late.

725
34:31.380 --> 34:34.620
So do you want to be an evangelist

726
34:34.620 --> 34:37.230
telling people, "The end is nigh,"

727
34:37.230 --> 34:39.960
or do you wanna say, "What's past is prologue,"

728
34:39.960 --> 34:43.290
as Shakespeare might say, or do you wanna say,

729
34:43.290 --> 34:46.410
from Marcus Aurelius, "What we do in this life echoes

730
34:46.410 --> 34:49.770
in eternity," and where does it echo more than in space

731
34:49.770 --> 34:52.530
because a piece of debris in space is gonna stay in space

732
34:52.530 --> 34:57.530
for maybe decades, if not longer, because it won't deorbit.

733
34:58.110 --> 35:02.340
And so, you can get very depressed very quickly,

734
35:02.340 --> 35:04.410
thinking about how bad it is.

735
35:04.410 --> 35:08.100
You can get very motivated by remembering,

736
35:08.100 --> 35:11.550
if you're a responsible individual, how much,

737
35:11.550 --> 35:14.103
as you pointed out, we rely on space every day.

738
35:15.300 --> 35:19.350
There is no backward compatibility for space.

739
35:19.350 --> 35:24.350
There is no GPS backup in ground-based systems.

740
35:25.920 --> 35:29.340
So you'll lose Uber Eats, you'll lose your ride,

741
35:29.340 --> 35:31.920
you'll lose the ability to meet with your friends

742
35:31.920 --> 35:36.920
and track your girlfriend on the internet because it's gone.

743
35:37.110 --> 35:39.450
And then there's no more telecommunications,

744
35:39.450 --> 35:42.480
there's no more interconnectivity, there's nothing.

745
35:42.480 --> 35:44.130
You're going back to the Dark Ages,

746
35:44.130 --> 35:46.980
and we're not gonna hook up the WAN network

747
35:46.980 --> 35:49.590
and the LAN network and say we can replace it all with that

748
35:49.590 --> 35:52.650
because we haven't kept it up for the last 25 years.

749
35:52.650 --> 35:54.963
So, as we say in Scotland, you're screwed.

750
35:55.860 --> 35:58.980
And so, that's the problem.

751
35:58.980 --> 36:03.210
So, redefining and reiterating the problem

752
36:03.210 --> 36:06.180
over and over again is not gonna solve the problem.

753
36:06.180 --> 36:08.520
We all talk about will it take one event?

754
36:08.520 --> 36:10.650
Well, we had an event, you know, Iridium collided

755
36:10.650 --> 36:14.400
with a Russian Cosmos satellite, so what?

756
36:14.400 --> 36:17.400
We've had ASAT tests where satellites

757
36:17.400 --> 36:18.840
have been deliberately shot out of space

758
36:18.840 --> 36:21.780
and created thousands of pieces of debris, so what?

759
36:21.780 --> 36:23.940
So, it's not the motivator.

760
36:23.940 --> 36:26.340
The motivator is the opportunity.

761
36:26.340 --> 36:30.310
The motivator is the fact that you can make a lot of money

762
36:31.230 --> 36:34.140
generating products, generating capability

763
36:34.140 --> 36:37.470
that will help keep space clean and keep space safe

764
36:37.470 --> 36:39.270
and create more opportunity.

765
36:39.270 --> 36:41.490
So, the commercial component of this

766
36:41.490 --> 36:43.680
is the most important component.

767
36:43.680 --> 36:48.680
Space used to be a government-run club for decades,

768
36:49.050 --> 36:50.310
and who cared?

769
36:50.310 --> 36:51.840
Only the people in the club.

770
36:51.840 --> 36:54.660
Getting this many people, which isn't a ton,

771
36:54.660 --> 36:58.230
out to a conference about space back in the day would,

772
36:58.230 --> 36:59.550
other than the folks in the community,

773
36:59.550 --> 37:01.050
would've been impossible.

774
37:01.050 --> 37:02.220
Nobody cares.

775
37:02.220 --> 37:04.770
The fact that people are, that we're at this conference

776
37:04.770 --> 37:06.570
and people are listening to this talk

777
37:06.570 --> 37:08.430
means that we're making progress.

778
37:08.430 --> 37:10.980
The only way to get over this wave

779
37:10.980 --> 37:12.870
is to get a bigger surfboard

780
37:12.870 --> 37:15.900
and start riding the wave of capability and technology

781
37:15.900 --> 37:18.720
and innovation, and bring the answer to the table

782
37:18.720 --> 37:20.160
before the event

783
37:20.160 --> 37:22.440
because nobody wants to be disciplined here,

784
37:22.440 --> 37:25.230
and we don't wanna point at somebody and say, "I told ya,"

785
37:25.230 --> 37:27.000
'cause by then, it's too late.

786
37:27.000 --> 37:29.490
So let's just put that in the back of our mind

787
37:29.490 --> 37:30.660
and be motivated by the fact

788
37:30.660 --> 37:33.810
that there's a big economic opportunity in space.

789
37:33.810 --> 37:36.030
Focus on the promise of space,

790
37:36.030 --> 37:39.510
focus on how much new innovation, artificial intelligence,

791
37:39.510 --> 37:42.270
machine learning, combination with billions of pieces

792
37:42.270 --> 37:44.730
of data points or trillions of pieces of data points

793
37:44.730 --> 37:47.973
every day can transform your wallet,

794
37:48.960 --> 37:51.488
'cause that's what people care about.

795
37:51.488 --> 37:53.490
They care about what they can do with this economically.

796
37:53.490 --> 37:56.430
It's an economic problem, so solve it.

797
37:56.430 --> 37:59.340
I have no problem living in a tent in the Everglades.

798
37:59.340 --> 38:01.110
I really don't, I don't give a crap.

799
38:01.110 --> 38:03.750
I can go back and make my tomatoes grow in my garden,

800
38:03.750 --> 38:06.690
but everybody who relies on space,

801
38:06.690 --> 38:09.360
be aware that there's an opportunity here.

802
38:09.360 --> 38:13.297
So I think we must get around this corner by saying,

803
38:13.297 --> 38:15.750
"Get a bigger surfboard, ride the wave,

804
38:15.750 --> 38:17.730
make something important, and make it happen."

805
38:17.730 --> 38:19.230
Get out in front of the problem.

806
38:19.230 --> 38:21.330
Use this wave of disaster

807
38:21.330 --> 38:24.150
as something that you can put your surfboard on and ride.

808
38:24.150 --> 38:26.600
So that's really the way to get out of this mess.

809
38:27.840 --> 38:29.820
<v ->Well, they say there's a first time for everything,</v>

810
38:29.820 --> 38:31.650
and I've moderated quite a few panels,

811
38:31.650 --> 38:34.110
but Marcus Aurelius, I had never heard him quoted

812
38:34.110 --> 38:37.560
on a panel before, so that was pretty good, I'll take that.

813
38:37.560 --> 38:39.360
Just a couple minutes left.

814
38:39.360 --> 38:41.157
Last question from me.

815
38:41.157 --> 38:43.110
So, it's the CES, they like to say

816
38:43.110 --> 38:46.200
it's the most powerful tech event in the world,

817
38:46.200 --> 38:47.733
and they're probably right.

818
38:49.530 --> 38:54.530
What's the one technology that is most exciting to you

819
38:55.260 --> 38:58.170
that you see here at this event this week,

820
38:58.170 --> 39:01.140
or last year if you came to the event last year?

821
39:01.140 --> 39:04.803
What's the general technology that's most exciting for you?

822
39:06.720 --> 39:09.520
<v ->I've said it a hundred times, artificial intelligence.</v>

823
39:11.250 --> 39:16.250
It was created by Virginia Apgar in the 1950s,

824
39:17.130 --> 39:18.750
and you're all the beneficiaries of it.

825
39:18.750 --> 39:21.360
Some of you are walking this planet because of it.

826
39:21.360 --> 39:23.400
It was the Apgar test that was done

827
39:23.400 --> 39:25.560
when a child was brought into this world,

828
39:25.560 --> 39:28.440
and there was five tests that they did on the child

829
39:28.440 --> 39:30.330
to see what the child's health was,

830
39:30.330 --> 39:33.600
whether it was reflexes, color, temperature,

831
39:33.600 --> 39:34.860
heart rate, et cetera.

832
39:34.860 --> 39:36.750
And they took those five pieces of data,

833
39:36.750 --> 39:39.757
and the guy walks in with his pipe and says,

834
39:39.757 --> 39:41.580
"Mm, score looks good."

835
39:41.580 --> 39:43.050
Two weeks later, the child's dead.

836
39:43.050 --> 39:45.150
So Virginia Apgar decided to take all of the data

837
39:45.150 --> 39:46.920
from all around the world and from all of her colleagues,

838
39:46.920 --> 39:49.500
put it into a program and generate

839
39:49.500 --> 39:52.267
the first artificial intelligence decision-maker that said,

840
39:52.267 --> 39:54.450
"This child's in difficulty,"

841
39:54.450 --> 39:58.890
and you all have had an Apgar test, artificial intelligence.

842
39:58.890 --> 40:02.340
So that's the wave of artificial intelligence.

843
40:02.340 --> 40:06.000
Artificial intelligence used for that type of purpose

844
40:06.000 --> 40:08.730
is immensely powerful and infinitely capable,

845
40:08.730 --> 40:11.680
and that's what we need to get out in front of the problem.

846
40:13.830 --> 40:17.040
<v ->I was just watching another panel downstairs,</v>

847
40:17.040 --> 40:20.040
and it was some of the top kind of tech media

848
40:20.040 --> 40:23.643
and journalists, and they asked them the same question,

849
40:24.720 --> 40:27.810
and one of them said, you know, "What I'm seeing this year

850
40:27.810 --> 40:30.150
is really kind of this movement for tech for good,

851
40:30.150 --> 40:35.150
so using technology for healthcare, emergency services

852
40:35.730 --> 40:37.380
and highlighted some amazing things

853
40:37.380 --> 40:40.050
that I just couldn't believe existed."

854
40:40.050 --> 40:44.190
And then, she went on to mention satellite applications,

855
40:44.190 --> 40:47.700
enabling them, and one of the ones she was talking about

856
40:47.700 --> 40:50.430
was for emergency services for,

857
40:50.430 --> 40:53.070
there's a firetruck down there that's using it really

858
40:53.070 --> 40:54.810
in an amazing way, but also wildfire,

859
40:54.810 --> 40:58.590
it's my family's background, in being Canadian,

860
40:58.590 --> 41:00.780
but wildfire and the, you know, obviously,

861
41:00.780 --> 41:04.470
the outcome of our climate at the moment

862
41:04.470 --> 41:06.720
and managing the impact of that

863
41:06.720 --> 41:09.600
until we come up with the riding of the wave,

864
41:09.600 --> 41:12.900
solution and opportunity, we're gonna need to manage that.

865
41:12.900 --> 41:15.870
So using space to help enable technology on the ground

866
41:15.870 --> 41:17.520
for emergency services, you know,

867
41:17.520 --> 41:19.500
some of the stuff downstairs is absolutely incredible,

868
41:19.500 --> 41:22.263
and it does give me a lot of hope for us here on Earth.

869
41:23.400 --> 41:24.800
<v ->Very cool.</v>

870
41:24.800 --> 41:26.193
Clare, any last remarks?

871
41:28.029 --> 41:29.700
<v ->I would echo that in some way.</v>

872
41:29.700 --> 41:34.700
So, one of my main motivators for joining Astroscale

873
41:35.310 --> 41:38.790
as a company was that it wasn't a technology company.

874
41:38.790 --> 41:42.270
It's a technology, it does great tech,

875
41:42.270 --> 41:44.850
but it's also determined to work to help solve policy

876
41:44.850 --> 41:47.700
and regulatory and to make the economics case work.

877
41:47.700 --> 41:51.953
So, taking all of the great ideas in technology,

878
41:51.953 --> 41:53.880
whether it's artificial intelligence

879
41:53.880 --> 41:56.490
or the actual processing capability that we need in orbit

880
41:56.490 --> 41:59.850
to be able to use said intelligence,

881
41:59.850 --> 42:01.350
and bringing those together

882
42:01.350 --> 42:05.370
to actually solve the space sustainability challenge,

883
42:05.370 --> 42:08.340
from our perspective and many other environmental challenges

884
42:08.340 --> 42:09.510
as you just referred to,

885
42:09.510 --> 42:11.190
that to me is the most exciting thing,

886
42:11.190 --> 42:13.353
to make technology a part of the solution.

887
42:14.790 --> 42:15.623
<v ->Very good.</v>

888
42:15.623 --> 42:17.250
Well, with that, we have reached time,

889
42:17.250 --> 42:18.840
so if we could have a round of applause

890
42:18.840 --> 42:20.610
for our outstanding panelists,

891
42:20.610 --> 42:23.007
and thank you all for your kind attention.

892
42:23.007 --> 42:23.840
(audience applauding)

893
42:23.840 --> 42:26.507
(upbeat music)
