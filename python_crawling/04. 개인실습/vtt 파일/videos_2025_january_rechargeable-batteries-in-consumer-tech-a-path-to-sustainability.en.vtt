00:00.221 --> 00:02.721
(light music)

00:10.710 --> 00:13.320
<v ->Okay, let's go ahead and get started.</v>

00:13.320 --> 00:15.090
It's nine o'clock.

00:15.090 --> 00:16.170
Good morning, everybody.

00:16.170 --> 00:17.400
I know this is early.

00:17.400 --> 00:20.493
For many of us, this is the first session of the day.

00:21.540 --> 00:23.010
Welcome to this panel session.

00:23.010 --> 00:25.260
We're gonna have, I think, a good conversation.

00:25.260 --> 00:27.000
We have an excellent panel here.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.380
My name's Walter Alcorn.

00:28.380 --> 00:32.550
I am CTA's vice president of environmental affairs

00:32.550 --> 00:33.900
and industry sustainability.

00:33.900 --> 00:36.660
We're gonna be talking today about batteries,

00:36.660 --> 00:38.790
embedded batteries in particular,

00:38.790 --> 00:40.530
both current situations,

00:40.530 --> 00:43.470
some of the issues that we're seeing,

00:43.470 --> 00:45.480
and talking about some near-term solutions,

00:45.480 --> 00:47.850
and then some longer term solutions.

00:47.850 --> 00:52.710
So what I'd like to do is introduce the panelists,

00:52.710 --> 00:54.813
actually have them introduce themselves.

00:55.680 --> 00:58.260
If there's time, just so everybody's ready,

00:58.260 --> 01:00.870
at the end, we will take an audience question or two,

01:00.870 --> 01:02.820
so be thinking about that.

01:02.820 --> 01:05.910
But let's just dive right into it.

01:05.910 --> 01:09.573
So our first panelist, Judy Jeevarajan.

01:10.410 --> 01:12.690
Judy, please introduce yourself and welcome.

01:12.690 --> 01:13.523
<v ->Thank you, Walter.</v>

01:13.523 --> 01:14.790
I am Judy Jeevarajan.

01:14.790 --> 01:17.460
I lead the Electrochemical Safety Research Institute

01:17.460 --> 01:22.460
at UL Research Institutes as the VP and executive director.

01:23.310 --> 01:27.240
My experience with batteries goes back about 30 years,

01:27.240 --> 01:29.610
almost at the beginning of lithium ion,

01:29.610 --> 01:32.370
but I've also worked with many different chemistries

01:32.370 --> 01:35.880
or batteries with a big focus on safety.

01:35.880 --> 01:37.830
And in the past two years, we've also been looking

01:37.830 --> 01:41.640
at new materials and novel energy forms in our institute.

01:41.640 --> 01:45.000
<v ->Great, Giovanni Fili, please introduce yourself.</v>

01:45.000 --> 01:46.140
Thank you for being here.

01:46.140 --> 01:47.280
<v ->Thank you for inviting me.</v>

01:47.280 --> 01:48.113
It's a pleasure.

01:48.113 --> 01:50.910
CES is always fantastic experience.

01:50.910 --> 01:51.743
So I'm Giovanni.

01:51.743 --> 01:54.930
I'm the CEO and founder of a Swedish company called Exeger.

01:54.930 --> 01:58.260
We have developed a new solar cell,

01:58.260 --> 02:01.890
which work under indoor and outdoor conditions.

02:01.890 --> 02:03.840
I'll tell you more about that later.

02:03.840 --> 02:07.860
And we work very closely with the battery companies.

02:07.860 --> 02:09.390
As we see, there's a need in the future

02:09.390 --> 02:13.110
for a lot of good, safe, stable batteries,

02:13.110 --> 02:15.330
especially together with our flexible source,

02:15.330 --> 02:16.920
which I will talk about later.

02:16.920 --> 02:18.240
<v ->Great, I love it you have a prop.</v>

02:18.240 --> 02:20.580
That's makes the panel.

02:20.580 --> 02:22.290
Andrea Murphy from Panasonic, please.

02:22.290 --> 02:24.510
<v ->Yeah, thank you, Walter, and good morning everyone.</v>

02:24.510 --> 02:26.850
As Walter said, my name is Andrea Murphy,

02:26.850 --> 02:28.020
and I am the Director

02:28.020 --> 02:30.780
of Environmental Affairs for Panasonic.

02:30.780 --> 02:33.870
My team covers a wide range of topics

02:33.870 --> 02:37.050
with environmental compliance and sustainability.

02:37.050 --> 02:38.970
So for environmental compliance,

02:38.970 --> 02:42.270
we deal with things like end of life of our products,

02:42.270 --> 02:43.980
which we'll talk about here,

02:43.980 --> 02:46.350
removing hazardous chemicals from our products.

02:46.350 --> 02:48.630
So that fits into battery sustainability,

02:48.630 --> 02:50.790
'cause we want the batteries to have

02:50.790 --> 02:53.853
less hazardous chemicals and be easier to recycle.

02:54.930 --> 02:57.000
Topics such as packaging.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.890
And then on the sustainability front,

02:58.890 --> 03:00.990
in addition to anything that's regulated,

03:00.990 --> 03:05.310
we work on a variety of programs and projects

03:05.310 --> 03:07.290
to increase the sustainability

03:07.290 --> 03:10.350
of our products that we make in our factories.

03:10.350 --> 03:11.490
And I cover that.

03:11.490 --> 03:14.100
My team covers that for all of North America.

03:14.100 --> 03:16.710
So that includes the federal and state regulations

03:16.710 --> 03:19.173
and the provincial regulations in Canada.

03:20.040 --> 03:21.270
For those of you who don't know,

03:21.270 --> 03:25.200
Panasonic is over 100-year-old company.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.510
We are an electronics manufacturer.

03:27.510 --> 03:30.930
We have a rich history of making batteries.

03:30.930 --> 03:33.510
We manufacture all kinds of batteries,

03:33.510 --> 03:37.710
from primary batteries, rechargeable batteries,

03:37.710 --> 03:40.020
small batteries that would fit in your watch

03:40.020 --> 03:44.730
to the large solar batteries, the charging batteries.

03:44.730 --> 03:46.440
So when you have a solar power system

03:46.440 --> 03:49.200
attached to your house, you can collect the solar

03:49.200 --> 03:51.330
and use it after the sun goes down.

03:51.330 --> 03:53.880
And then we're also an electronics manufacturer.

03:53.880 --> 03:57.330
We manufacture a large range of products

03:57.330 --> 03:59.430
from the entertainment industry

03:59.430 --> 04:01.740
that have batteries like your earbuds,

04:01.740 --> 04:04.530
your headphones to personal care products.

04:04.530 --> 04:05.850
So when you think about everything

04:05.850 --> 04:09.150
that you use in your house, or even you have on you here,

04:09.150 --> 04:10.923
it probably has a battery in it.

04:11.820 --> 04:13.860
<v Walter>Awesome, and great keynote yesterday.</v>

04:13.860 --> 04:15.510
<v ->Thank you, yeah, so proud.</v>

04:15.510 --> 04:17.040
If you haven't seen it,

04:17.040 --> 04:19.800
we are the sustainability superheroes,

04:19.800 --> 04:22.140
so please take a look and watch it.

04:22.140 --> 04:22.973
<v ->Wonderful.</v>

04:22.973 --> 04:24.570
Leo, take it away.

04:24.570 --> 04:25.403
<v ->Thanks, Walter.</v>

04:25.403 --> 04:26.400
I'm Leo Raudys.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.713
I'm the CEO of Call2Recycle.

04:27.713 --> 04:31.470
We're a 30-year-old nonprofit that is the largest collector

04:31.470 --> 04:33.900
of batteries for recycling in the United States.

04:33.900 --> 04:35.850
We were actually founded

04:35.850 --> 04:39.360
because of a great idea that Panasonic had back in the day

04:39.360 --> 04:41.310
to actually create an organization like us.

04:41.310 --> 04:43.020
We've been around for quite some time.

04:43.020 --> 04:45.060
Panasonic continues to sit on our board.

04:45.060 --> 04:47.970
We collect batteries at about 11,000

04:47.970 --> 04:49.680
public-facing collection sites,

04:49.680 --> 04:51.870
places like municipalities, Home Depot,

04:51.870 --> 04:54.090
Lowe's, Staples, Best Buy, et cetera.

04:54.090 --> 04:56.250
And about 20,000 other smaller sites

04:56.250 --> 04:57.810
across the United States.

04:57.810 --> 04:59.400
The way I explain us to my mother

04:59.400 --> 05:00.840
is if you're recycling a battery

05:00.840 --> 05:03.750
somewhere in the United States, it's probably us.

05:03.750 --> 05:05.670
So we're intensely interested in this topic

05:05.670 --> 05:07.740
because it's very, very important for us

05:07.740 --> 05:09.750
to be able to move all these batteries safely

05:09.750 --> 05:12.780
to a recycler or a repurposer.

05:12.780 --> 05:15.090
And innovation's pretty key to that.

05:15.090 --> 05:15.930
So thanks, Walter.

05:15.930 --> 05:16.860
<v ->All right, wonderful.</v>

05:16.860 --> 05:18.060
Well, let's do this.

05:18.060 --> 05:19.140
Let's set the stage.

05:19.140 --> 05:22.440
What are the issues with rechargeable batteries,

05:22.440 --> 05:25.110
particularly rechargeable battery fires,

05:25.110 --> 05:26.430
which I know there's been some discussion.

05:26.430 --> 05:27.810
So Judy, you wanna start?

05:27.810 --> 05:29.730
<v ->Sure, so I mean, I've been working</v>

05:29.730 --> 05:31.560
with lithium ion since its inception,

05:31.560 --> 05:34.590
and we are really concerned about its safety.

05:34.590 --> 05:37.290
It's because it's very unpredictable, the safety,

05:37.290 --> 05:39.570
and it going into a thermal runaway,

05:39.570 --> 05:40.740
what we call a thermal runaway,

05:40.740 --> 05:42.573
which is a really high temperature,

05:43.650 --> 05:46.950
or accompanied by smoke and fire can be unpredictable.

05:46.950 --> 05:50.520
And that's because if you don't use it correctly,

05:50.520 --> 05:53.460
manufacture it correctly, charge it correctly,

05:53.460 --> 05:56.010
as well as if you don't recycle it correctly

05:56.010 --> 05:57.270
or dispose of it correctly,

05:57.270 --> 06:00.303
you are going to have a fire in the end.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.930
And what's associated with it is high temperatures.

06:03.930 --> 06:06.060
The fire can propagate very quickly.

06:06.060 --> 06:08.790
We can have toxic gases that come out of it.

06:08.790 --> 06:11.130
Particulate emissions are actually toxic.

06:11.130 --> 06:13.770
And so it is really concerning

06:13.770 --> 06:16.920
that if people are not doing things correctly,

06:16.920 --> 06:21.330
that you can have an unexpected fire

06:21.330 --> 06:23.070
and a lot of high temperatures.

06:23.070 --> 06:25.530
<v Walter>Yeah, the term thermal event</v>

06:25.530 --> 06:27.870
is such a interesting word

06:27.870 --> 06:31.020
that gets used in the public space.

06:31.020 --> 06:32.820
Anyone wanna add anything to that, Leo?

06:32.820 --> 06:34.890
<v ->Yeah, I mean, it's a huge issue,</v>

06:34.890 --> 06:36.600
and I don't think people really appreciate

06:36.600 --> 06:38.190
just how big of an issue it's become.

06:38.190 --> 06:39.240
So if you think about us,

06:39.240 --> 06:42.630
we collect last year about nine million pounds of batteries.

06:42.630 --> 06:43.980
Previous year was eight million pounds.

06:43.980 --> 06:46.440
So recycling has gone quite a bit.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.940
But we still only capture a fraction

06:47.940 --> 06:50.010
of what actually moves through the system.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.410
So anytime a battery ends up in a waste facility,

06:52.410 --> 06:55.860
it's at risk of actually being damaged and catching fire.

06:55.860 --> 06:57.690
There are a lot of fires of waste facilities

06:57.690 --> 06:59.670
and recycling facilities.

06:59.670 --> 07:01.590
You talk to the folks that run these facilities,

07:01.590 --> 07:02.850
they have a fire about a day.

07:02.850 --> 07:04.080
They're not sure if they're all batteries,

07:04.080 --> 07:06.540
but in terms of major fires, according to Fire Rover,

07:06.540 --> 07:10.410
which is an organization that does fire safety work,

07:10.410 --> 07:14.850
they've seen over 453, I think, major fires

07:14.850 --> 07:16.980
at waste and recycling facilities last year.

07:16.980 --> 07:19.920
So it's a very, very big issue.

07:19.920 --> 07:22.890
Our concern is that anytime

07:22.890 --> 07:25.020
you have the risk of fire going up,

07:25.020 --> 07:27.690
it puts the entire recycling ecosystem at risk.

07:27.690 --> 07:29.400
And when that happens,

07:29.400 --> 07:31.980
it's less likely people are going to recycle.

07:31.980 --> 07:33.000
It's less likely we're gonna be able

07:33.000 --> 07:34.770
to get these materials back into commerce.

07:34.770 --> 07:37.050
These are very critical materials.

07:37.050 --> 07:39.510
So anything we can do to get those fires down

07:39.510 --> 07:42.510
is vitally important, especially because recycling

07:42.510 --> 07:45.390
is just becoming a bigger, bigger thing.

07:45.390 --> 07:46.290
<v ->Okay, thank you.</v>

07:46.290 --> 07:50.160
So let's talk a little bit about near-term solutions.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.200
What can be done to reduce fires

07:52.200 --> 07:54.750
or maybe the severity of the fires?

07:54.750 --> 07:56.940
What are some of the things that,

07:56.940 --> 07:57.773
Judy, go ahead and start again.

07:57.773 --> 07:59.850
<v ->So one of the things that I would recommend</v>

07:59.850 --> 08:01.980
is making sure that consumers,

08:01.980 --> 08:05.340
and there are different factors for different sectors.

08:05.340 --> 08:08.520
So when you look at consumers, it's always better

08:08.520 --> 08:11.010
to buy batteries that are certified,

08:11.010 --> 08:16.010
certified by a good certifying organization,

08:16.380 --> 08:17.670
follow standards.

08:17.670 --> 08:19.050
So it should be done.

08:19.050 --> 08:21.330
And then also buy the relevant chargers.

08:21.330 --> 08:23.220
Don't buy universal chargers.

08:23.220 --> 08:25.260
Use the batteries with the relevant chargers.

08:25.260 --> 08:28.350
And also, don't try to replace your batteries on your own.

08:28.350 --> 08:30.480
You'll notice that several top tier

08:30.480 --> 08:31.950
device manufacturers today

08:31.950 --> 08:34.320
make it difficult for you to replace batteries.

08:34.320 --> 08:35.700
So just send it back to them

08:35.700 --> 08:37.110
and have them replace it for you

08:37.110 --> 08:40.290
if you want it done that way.

08:40.290 --> 08:42.450
When we go to manufacturer's side,

08:42.450 --> 08:45.840
we should always look for certified cells

08:45.840 --> 08:48.120
that go into certified batteries

08:48.120 --> 08:52.050
and then so the battery manufacturer should go

08:52.050 --> 08:54.840
and look for good manufacturers of cells

08:54.840 --> 08:56.460
that are actually certified.

08:56.460 --> 08:58.530
And again, the whole cycle of making sure

08:58.530 --> 09:01.410
everything is certified to the end product

09:01.410 --> 09:02.730
should be completed.

09:02.730 --> 09:07.530
And then lastly, also with respect to what Eric,

09:07.530 --> 09:09.783
Leo was talking about, sorry,

09:10.890 --> 09:13.500
we have to make sure that you recycle

09:13.500 --> 09:15.060
your batteries in the right manner,

09:15.060 --> 09:18.030
and there are call to recycle as an excellent site

09:18.030 --> 09:22.830
where you can look for sites or locations in your area

09:22.830 --> 09:25.890
where you can take back batteries and recycle them safely.

09:25.890 --> 09:30.300
So it's always good to follow what needs to be followed

09:30.300 --> 09:32.970
so you can reduce the risk that is associated

09:32.970 --> 09:35.340
with different battery chemistries.

09:35.340 --> 09:37.950
<v ->Great, Andrea?</v>
<v ->Yeah, I really appreciate</v>

09:37.950 --> 09:39.270
that you brought up the consumer,

09:39.270 --> 09:41.640
'cause a couple of days ago, Walter,

09:41.640 --> 09:44.550
you mentioned to me how popular the sustainability track

09:44.550 --> 09:46.590
has become here at CES,

09:46.590 --> 09:50.250
and I thought that this conversation is the perfect start

09:50.250 --> 09:53.070
to the solutions we're gonna come up with.

09:53.070 --> 09:56.640
And you might think like sustainability, why are we at CES?

09:56.640 --> 09:58.200
But you mentioned consumers, right?

09:58.200 --> 09:59.910
What the consumer practice is

09:59.910 --> 10:02.220
and what's gonna be easy for a consumer to do,

10:02.220 --> 10:06.750
so what a better place than the consumer electronic show.

10:06.750 --> 10:07.950
But everything we do right,

10:07.950 --> 10:10.680
it's gonna have to be focused on, can the consumer do it?

10:10.680 --> 10:12.720
Can we get that knowledge and education out,

10:12.720 --> 10:14.220
which is something Call2Recycle.

10:14.220 --> 10:15.600
It does really well.

10:15.600 --> 10:19.830
And then with that, I think we need to work on

10:19.830 --> 10:23.310
the environmental justice and level the playing fields.

10:23.310 --> 10:26.970
I also really appreciate that you mentioned certifications,

10:26.970 --> 10:28.410
'cause I'm sure if you go out there

10:28.410 --> 10:30.000
and look at the batteries for purchase,

10:30.000 --> 10:31.980
you're gonna see a big price difference.

10:31.980 --> 10:34.320
And are you gonna spend 4.99 on a battery

10:34.320 --> 10:36.180
or are you gonna spend 9.99?

10:36.180 --> 10:38.490
Or if it's a bigger battery, much more.

10:38.490 --> 10:40.590
And you have to think about those certifications

10:40.590 --> 10:42.270
and what the manufacturers go through

10:42.270 --> 10:44.130
to get them certified.

10:44.130 --> 10:46.590
So if we can get that education out there

10:46.590 --> 10:48.017
and it starts in a panel like this,

10:48.017 --> 10:50.760
'cause we need to have the manufacturers,

10:50.760 --> 10:54.330
we need to have industry involved, the consumers.

10:54.330 --> 10:55.680
We also need to have government,

10:55.680 --> 10:57.120
'cause there should be more mandates.

10:57.120 --> 11:00.570
We're actually pro having a federal mandate on this

11:00.570 --> 11:04.440
because that's the only way to level out the playing field

11:04.440 --> 11:06.750
and also have the recyclers involved

11:06.750 --> 11:08.280
and make sure that we're seeing this

11:08.280 --> 11:10.233
from a multi-stakeholder point of view.

11:11.070 --> 11:14.010
<v ->Leo, could you address maybe collection or something else?</v>

11:14.010 --> 11:15.990
That's such an important piece to this.

11:15.990 --> 11:18.150
<v ->Yeah, yeah, thanks for asking.</v>

11:18.150 --> 11:19.260
I would say by and large,

11:19.260 --> 11:21.330
that we were able to move batteries safely

11:21.330 --> 11:25.260
to their end destination recyclers fairly safely.

11:25.260 --> 11:26.730
The thing that keeps me up at night

11:26.730 --> 11:30.060
is how defective batteries are handled in the United States.

11:30.060 --> 11:32.130
And this is an area where we can do a lot better,

11:32.130 --> 11:34.410
both on the policy side from the government,

11:34.410 --> 11:36.210
but also manufacturers stepping up

11:36.210 --> 11:37.380
and doing things responsibly.

11:37.380 --> 11:40.320
Panasonic's a great example of how you do it right.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.060
There are a lot of companies that don't do it right.

11:42.060 --> 11:43.260
And what I mean by that is,

11:43.260 --> 11:46.110
if you've got a defective battery that's in the market,

11:46.110 --> 11:47.640
there's always gonna be a chance that a battery

11:47.640 --> 11:48.960
is manufactured improperly.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.163
Just happens, right?

11:51.900 --> 11:53.820
The right way to do it is a manufacturer

11:53.820 --> 11:55.770
should take responsibility for the battery

11:55.770 --> 11:58.447
and get the packaging to the customer and say,

11:58.447 --> 11:59.490
"Hey, get it back to us.

11:59.490 --> 12:00.930
We'll take it out of the system.

12:00.930 --> 12:02.310
Let's manage it safely."

12:02.310 --> 12:05.100
Unfortunately, that doesn't happen a lot.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.930
A lot of times, you just basically

12:06.930 --> 12:09.607
have manufacturers kicking the can down the road and saying,

12:09.607 --> 12:11.310
"Dispose it to your local facility."

12:11.310 --> 12:13.590
They're not equipped to deal with this.

12:13.590 --> 12:15.840
It's a big and growing issue just because

12:15.840 --> 12:17.550
more and more batteries are going into commerce.

12:17.550 --> 12:19.530
To give you some numbers, last year,

12:19.530 --> 12:23.970
the CPSC issued about two dozen recalls.

12:23.970 --> 12:25.830
Three and a half million units

12:25.830 --> 12:28.620
of batteries were recalled last year.

12:28.620 --> 12:29.910
Only a small percentage of those

12:29.910 --> 12:32.430
were handled right way, quite frankly.

12:32.430 --> 12:35.070
In the last two months of the year,

12:35.070 --> 12:38.520
they issued recalls covering almost a million units.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.230
So if you think about it,

12:40.230 --> 12:43.860
you're a person in your home, you've got a power bank,

12:43.860 --> 12:45.780
you get the message, "Hey, I need to get rid of this.

12:45.780 --> 12:47.100
I should need to get out of my house."

12:47.100 --> 12:49.260
It's a risk, absolutely.

12:49.260 --> 12:52.440
But the last thing you wanna do is have 100 households

12:52.440 --> 12:54.810
take all those batteries, take them to the facility,

12:54.810 --> 12:55.950
you magnify the risk,

12:55.950 --> 12:58.590
you put workers at risk, things like that.

12:58.590 --> 12:59.910
So I think we can do a lot better

12:59.910 --> 13:01.747
in terms of messaging from the government saying,

13:01.747 --> 13:03.240
"Hey, this is the appropriate way to do it."

13:03.240 --> 13:06.240
But also, manufacturers need to do the right thing.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.610
Again, Panasonic's a fantastic example.

13:08.610 --> 13:09.690
A lot of other companies

13:09.690 --> 13:10.523
do it the right way.
<v ->I didn't pay him</v>

13:10.523 --> 13:13.050
by the way. (laughs)
<v ->Oh, yeah, no.</v>

13:13.050 --> 13:14.970
And because this is what we do every day all day long,

13:14.970 --> 13:17.220
and it's an issue for us.

13:17.220 --> 13:19.020
So I think it's an area we can do better.

13:19.020 --> 13:21.900
So we're hopeful that it will get better.

13:21.900 --> 13:24.060
I raised this issue last year on this stage

13:24.060 --> 13:26.580
and not as much progress has been made as I'd like,

13:26.580 --> 13:28.560
but I think we'll get there.

13:28.560 --> 13:31.140
<v ->Well, so this is CES,</v>

13:31.140 --> 13:34.230
and really, CES is about the future

13:34.230 --> 13:36.990
and about technology and innovation.

13:36.990 --> 13:39.753
So Giovanni, this one's for you.

13:41.190 --> 13:42.376
What are some of the solutions?

13:42.376 --> 13:45.450
What's the future look like in terms of batteries?

13:45.450 --> 13:46.500
What do you think?

13:46.500 --> 13:47.450
Where should we go?

13:48.630 --> 13:53.630
<v ->Well, I think the future in terms of batteries</v>

13:53.640 --> 13:58.020
is diminishing in some ways.

13:58.020 --> 14:00.180
And with that, I mean that,

14:00.180 --> 14:01.323
I mean, what we do,

14:02.970 --> 14:06.930
okay, every year, the consumer electronic business

14:06.930 --> 14:10.323
uses around 10 billion disposable batteries, give or take.

14:11.730 --> 14:14.700
And these are not recycled in the proper way.

14:14.700 --> 14:16.590
Fortunately enough, a lot of them end up in landfill

14:16.590 --> 14:18.570
et cetera, polluting land and water and so on.

14:18.570 --> 14:19.473
That's bad.

14:20.580 --> 14:21.413
I love batteries.

14:21.413 --> 14:23.850
We need batteries 'cause they enable the smartness,

14:23.850 --> 14:26.670
the functionality, freedom, all the stuff.

14:26.670 --> 14:29.040
But we need to find a good balance

14:29.040 --> 14:32.610
between disposable batteries, preferably not so many,

14:32.610 --> 14:35.280
and rechargeable batteries that we can use more.

14:35.280 --> 14:37.620
But how are you gonna power these rechargeable batteries?

14:37.620 --> 14:38.453
That's what we do.

14:38.453 --> 14:40.590
So we have developed this flexible film.

14:40.590 --> 14:43.020
This is a silicon-free solar cell.

14:43.020 --> 14:45.210
We've developed this over the last 15 years in Sweden

14:45.210 --> 14:48.600
in two factories, completely run on renewable energy,

14:48.600 --> 14:50.160
zero emissions to air and water,

14:50.160 --> 14:53.400
zero emissions at all actually from the factories.

14:53.400 --> 14:57.090
This is the lowest LCA in the world, solar cell.

14:57.090 --> 14:59.490
It's the highest power fishes in the world for indoor.

14:59.490 --> 15:01.170
So this works indoor and outdoor.

15:01.170 --> 15:02.220
So what we do with this

15:02.220 --> 15:04.143
is that we integrate it into products.

15:04.980 --> 15:07.007
This is a product we have developed together with 3M,

15:07.007 --> 15:08.910
one of the best companies in the U.S.

15:08.910 --> 15:10.083
We love them very much.

15:11.130 --> 15:12.840
We have a global exclusivity deal with them.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.190
They can only work with us.

15:14.190 --> 15:16.470
Here is our solar cell.

15:16.470 --> 15:20.520
This one previously was run on disposable batteries.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.200
So every second week, you would need to buy

15:22.200 --> 15:24.480
two new batteries and put inside to have it to work.

15:24.480 --> 15:26.400
This is a smart hearing protector

15:26.400 --> 15:29.280
that protects your ears and allows you to communicate

15:29.280 --> 15:32.490
in different situations such as airports, mines,

15:32.490 --> 15:35.340
construction sites, oiling platforms, et cetera.

15:35.340 --> 15:39.120
Very critical moments where you need to know

15:39.120 --> 15:41.100
you can communicate for yourself to safety.

15:41.100 --> 15:43.833
Also, this is used in military purposes, et cetera.

15:44.880 --> 15:49.350
Now, so over three years, you would buy 150 batteries.

15:49.350 --> 15:53.610
Now, this has a really small one rechargeable battery

15:53.610 --> 15:55.500
that we power by utilizing the light

15:55.500 --> 15:57.750
that surrounds you when you use it.

15:57.750 --> 16:00.210
That means we have eliminated 149

16:00.210 --> 16:02.043
batteries from the ecosystem.

16:03.780 --> 16:06.480
And this is the future where you will see

16:06.480 --> 16:09.723
more and more of these products become self-powered,

16:11.499 --> 16:13.830
self-powered, energy independent,

16:13.830 --> 16:15.840
energy autonomy, call it what you want.

16:15.840 --> 16:18.540
The freedom to utilize the products

16:18.540 --> 16:20.220
in the way that we're supposed to.

16:20.220 --> 16:22.590
You don't have to think, "Oh, I can't really put on

16:22.590 --> 16:24.600
noise cancellation now 'cause it'll drain the battery."

16:24.600 --> 16:26.250
No.

16:26.250 --> 16:27.930
Utilize all the great innovations

16:27.930 --> 16:31.380
that you companies come with all the time.

16:31.380 --> 16:33.600
Utilize the product as it was supposed to,

16:33.600 --> 16:36.240
without having the fear or battery anxiety

16:36.240 --> 16:37.950
or range anxiety, all this stuff.

16:37.950 --> 16:39.210
<v Walter>So let me just ask,</v>

16:39.210 --> 16:41.370
so it doesn't have to be sunny to work, right?

16:41.370 --> 16:42.203
<v ->No.</v>
<v ->Okay.</v>

16:42.203 --> 16:45.000
So-
<v ->Indoor, light,</v>

16:45.000 --> 16:47.100
shade, just light.

16:47.100 --> 16:47.970
This is a light cell.

16:47.970 --> 16:49.560
It's not a solar cell, to be honest.

16:49.560 --> 16:52.290
<v Walter>And I know you're from Sweden, and so sometimes,</v>

16:52.290 --> 16:54.990
not a lot of sunlight during winter solstice time, but-

16:54.990 --> 16:55.823
<v ->That's correct.</v>

16:55.823 --> 16:57.300
<v ->It's still fine.</v>
<v ->It's still fine.</v>

16:57.300 --> 17:00.210
And people are using this in Sweden all the time.

17:00.210 --> 17:03.180
It's on the market since May last year.

17:03.180 --> 17:06.090
And they use it as seven, eight hours per day.

17:06.090 --> 17:07.410
They never need to charge them.

17:07.410 --> 17:09.990
Even in Sweden, November where we had this three hours

17:09.990 --> 17:11.880
of sunshine in one month.

17:11.880 --> 17:13.530
<v Walter>It's a wonderful country, by the way.</v>

17:13.530 --> 17:16.350
I was just vacationing, so knockout, Sweden.

17:16.350 --> 17:17.640
<v ->And with the factory,</v>

17:17.640 --> 17:20.790
we're building our second factory called Stockholm II.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.620
When that's fully ramped, we'll be able to replace

17:22.620 --> 17:25.300
one billion disposable batteries per year

17:26.310 --> 17:27.603
from that single factory.

17:28.530 --> 17:31.650
We do remote controls, the no battery inside,

17:31.650 --> 17:33.150
we do electronic shelf labels

17:33.150 --> 17:35.280
to power the connected stores and retail.

17:35.280 --> 17:36.600
We have the largest customer in the world

17:36.600 --> 17:38.550
signed up a big, yeah.

17:38.550 --> 17:40.350
So this is the future.

17:40.350 --> 17:42.510
We will need good batteries,

17:42.510 --> 17:45.870
safe, environmentally-friendly batteries that are reliable

17:45.870 --> 17:49.953
and predictable and stable, and we will charge them.

17:51.509 --> 17:53.020
That's the future.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

17:53.020 --> 17:54.030
Yeah, excellent.

17:54.030 --> 17:56.820
Well, we're gonna come back I think to you, Judy.

17:56.820 --> 17:57.840
What do you think?
<v ->Yeah, I just wanted</v>

17:57.840 --> 17:59.023
to add about batteries.
<v ->What the future?</v>

17:59.023 --> 18:00.300
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->There are different</v>

18:00.300 --> 18:02.610
chemistries that are being worked.

18:02.610 --> 18:05.670
As you mentioned, environmentally friendly sodium ion,

18:05.670 --> 18:08.700
magnesium ion, those battery chemistries

18:08.700 --> 18:09.810
that we're working on.

18:09.810 --> 18:13.200
But there are some sodium ion cells in the market today,

18:13.200 --> 18:15.060
but they're almost like lithium ion.

18:15.060 --> 18:16.980
They have the same fire

18:16.980 --> 18:19.080
because they're using similar electrolytes.

18:19.080 --> 18:22.920
But we are looking at newer starting materials

18:22.920 --> 18:26.190
and both the sodium ion and magnesium ion.

18:26.190 --> 18:30.690
So we might get to more environmentally friendly, cheaper,

18:30.690 --> 18:32.730
where you really don't have to,

18:32.730 --> 18:34.560
sodium is in plenty in the world.

18:34.560 --> 18:38.610
So I think those are areas that we can provide

18:38.610 --> 18:42.840
to make more sustainable and energy-efficient batteries.

18:42.840 --> 18:43.673
<v ->Yes.</v>

18:43.673 --> 18:44.850
<v ->I totally agree.</v>

18:44.850 --> 18:46.360
Can I say-
<v ->Sure, please.</v>

18:48.630 --> 18:50.070
<v ->I completely agree.</v>

18:50.070 --> 18:53.790
And what we do, we work very closely to battery companies

18:53.790 --> 18:56.100
because there are new very, very cool things

18:56.100 --> 18:57.330
coming in the pipeline.

18:57.330 --> 18:58.800
And you have many,

18:58.800 --> 19:00.600
you have a four year,

19:00.600 --> 19:03.000
yeah, you have year-long programs, right?

19:03.000 --> 19:07.650
So what we can do, we can take our one millimeter thin

19:07.650 --> 19:10.740
plastic film and we can glue it together

19:10.740 --> 19:14.820
with a one millimeter thin flexible battery

19:14.820 --> 19:18.330
that does not suffer from, if you can cut that,

19:18.330 --> 19:20.790
you can strike a hammer on it, nothing happens.

19:20.790 --> 19:24.360
And when we glue those together, we have a self-recharging,

19:24.360 --> 19:27.000
completely safe, flexible battery

19:27.000 --> 19:29.430
that does not explode or turn into fire or anything.

19:29.430 --> 19:32.250
Alone, that battery is not good enough.

19:32.250 --> 19:33.690
This is a little bit on the expensive side

19:33.690 --> 19:35.970
and the energy (indistinct) is not that good.

19:35.970 --> 19:39.243
But when you combine it with, for example, our technology,

19:40.170 --> 19:45.170
why should that not be the backside of your laptop, right?

19:46.500 --> 19:47.790
This is what's gonna happen.

19:47.790 --> 19:50.130
You're gonna see the devices,

19:50.130 --> 19:52.620
the surfaces turn into something else.

19:52.620 --> 19:54.390
Like we used to have papers, we read papers,

19:54.390 --> 19:55.500
now we have digital papers,

19:55.500 --> 19:58.080
we have functional papers that do many things.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.850
And this is gonna happen as well in the battery

19:59.850 --> 20:02.700
and the energy harvesting area.

20:02.700 --> 20:03.930
<v Walter>Fantastic, Andrea?</v>

20:03.930 --> 20:05.520
<v ->Yeah, I would say just adding on to that,</v>

20:05.520 --> 20:08.100
we have to change the way we think about batteries, right?

20:08.100 --> 20:10.350
Just as you're saying, what chemistries they're made of,

20:10.350 --> 20:11.730
what we attach them to.

20:11.730 --> 20:14.730
And of course, match that with what the consumer wants.

20:14.730 --> 20:17.190
No consumer wants to be tied to an outlet.

20:17.190 --> 20:19.440
You go into a room or you get into the airport, right?

20:19.440 --> 20:21.690
And you're fighting for that charger.

20:21.690 --> 20:24.000
So we really have to rethink as an industry

20:24.000 --> 20:26.130
how we're gonna put batteries into our products,

20:26.130 --> 20:28.050
how we're gonna make them safe,

20:28.050 --> 20:30.060
how we're gonna make them durable as you say.

20:30.060 --> 20:34.170
And not only prevent fires but prevent from water damage.

20:34.170 --> 20:36.060
Right now, you want all your electronics

20:36.060 --> 20:37.740
to be able to be used out in the rain.

20:37.740 --> 20:39.097
You used to have to hide it, and now you're like,

20:39.097 --> 20:41.250
"Oh, my iPhone is waterproof.

20:41.250 --> 20:42.450
This is great."

20:42.450 --> 20:44.580
But you think about what that does to the battery

20:44.580 --> 20:47.010
and how you have to secure the battery for that

20:47.010 --> 20:50.100
and then that how it makes that harder to remove the battery

20:50.100 --> 20:52.190
and then how to recycle that battery.

20:52.190 --> 20:54.300
So that's really a complex issue.

20:54.300 --> 20:55.133
<v ->Fantastic.</v>

20:55.133 --> 20:57.030
Well, we're gonna open it up for questions

20:57.030 --> 20:58.110
here in just a couple minutes,

20:58.110 --> 20:59.970
but Giovanni, I wanted to go back to you,

20:59.970 --> 21:02.970
and many times with our innovations

21:02.970 --> 21:04.950
and the consumer technology industry,

21:04.950 --> 21:08.400
we have to think about what the new impacts are gonna be.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.380
What's the material profile look like

21:10.380 --> 21:13.410
for your technology that you're putting out?

21:13.410 --> 21:14.760
What's it made out of?

21:14.760 --> 21:17.760
<v ->Well, so we have over 300 granted patents.</v>

21:17.760 --> 21:18.960
Over 21 families.

21:18.960 --> 21:22.020
It's 15 years of research.

21:22.020 --> 21:23.220
I'm not gonna give you all of that.

21:23.220 --> 21:24.210
<v ->That's okay.</v>

21:24.210 --> 21:27.750
<v ->But I can say the main component is titanium dioxide,</v>

21:27.750 --> 21:30.300
which is the white pigment in wall paint,

21:30.300 --> 21:32.430
in toothpaste, in sunscreen.

21:32.430 --> 21:35.670
So it's a very environmentally friendly composition,

21:35.670 --> 21:38.220
no rare earth metal, no toxic materials, nothing,

21:38.220 --> 21:40.740
REACH, RoHS, and Prop 65, all of that.

21:40.740 --> 21:42.210
And we do that on purpose.

21:42.210 --> 21:45.750
We can do solar cells with much higher efficiency,

21:45.750 --> 21:48.810
but that would mean that we would need to mix in

21:48.810 --> 21:52.230
toxic stuff or things that are not compliant

21:52.230 --> 21:53.087
with how we see this,

21:53.087 --> 21:55.050
'cause this is something that we wear.

21:55.050 --> 21:57.180
I wear this on me, right?

21:57.180 --> 21:58.290
I carry this, my kids,

21:58.290 --> 22:01.680
we have a lot of consumer products as well.

22:01.680 --> 22:03.870
My kids, they wear the headphones,

22:03.870 --> 22:06.412
they wear the stuff, they carry it.

22:06.412 --> 22:08.160
It has to be completely safe.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.600
<v ->Yeah, fantastic.</v>

22:09.600 --> 22:11.370
Well, very good, thank you very much.

22:11.370 --> 22:13.380
So if folks have questions,

22:13.380 --> 22:14.850
we actually have two microphones.

22:14.850 --> 22:17.820
Anybody have a question at this point?

22:17.820 --> 22:21.420
Alright, come on up and ask a question.

22:21.420 --> 22:24.213
I think both of these microphones should be working.

22:25.080 --> 22:26.550
And if anybody else has a question,

22:26.550 --> 22:29.220
feel free to go ahead and stand up by one of the mics.

22:29.220 --> 22:30.053
Go ahead.

22:31.080 --> 22:31.913
<v Matt>My name is Matt,</v>

22:31.913 --> 22:35.670
and I work in innovative product design,

22:35.670 --> 22:36.810
but I actually had a question

22:36.810 --> 22:40.263
around the waterproofedness of batteries.

22:41.220 --> 22:43.140
Of course there's battery regulations

22:43.140 --> 22:45.270
that are coming out in the U.S. and in Europe

22:45.270 --> 22:48.330
around the need to have them be removable

22:48.330 --> 22:50.790
so that they can be readily recycled.

22:50.790 --> 22:52.650
Currently, I believe there's an exemption

22:52.650 --> 22:55.920
for things that are highly integrated or waterproofed.

22:55.920 --> 22:58.290
Is there an interest and passion

22:58.290 --> 23:00.870
from the industry to look at solutions

23:00.870 --> 23:02.970
to innovate around that,

23:02.970 --> 23:06.603
to make things that can be both waterproofed and removable?

23:08.010 --> 23:10.050
<v ->Yeah, Andrea?</v>
<v ->Yeah, so I could take that.</v>

23:10.050 --> 23:11.550
That's really an excellent question,

23:11.550 --> 23:13.980
and it's something that our design engineers

23:13.980 --> 23:16.950
have been focused on for quite a long time.

23:16.950 --> 23:18.540
And actually, just before,

23:18.540 --> 23:20.730
I was sharing with the panel a story.

23:20.730 --> 23:22.560
So we launched a couple years ago

23:22.560 --> 23:24.210
a product called the MultiShape,

23:24.210 --> 23:27.510
and it's five different personal care devices in one

23:27.510 --> 23:31.350
and it's made to replace your razor, your toothbrush,

23:31.350 --> 23:32.610
your nose hair trimmer,

23:32.610 --> 23:34.800
and I'll get to the point but it's all in one.

23:34.800 --> 23:37.830
And the sales team actually came to me and said,

23:37.830 --> 23:40.530
if we have consumers disposing

23:40.530 --> 23:42.600
of five different products to buy this,

23:42.600 --> 23:44.520
that's gonna create a lot of waste.

23:44.520 --> 23:47.070
So we started calling our recycling partners

23:47.070 --> 23:49.110
and saying how are we going to,

23:49.110 --> 23:50.070
what are we gonna do?

23:50.070 --> 23:52.380
And we created a program

23:52.380 --> 23:53.910
where if you buy the MultiShape,

23:53.910 --> 23:57.210
you can return and we'll recycle for you for free

23:57.210 --> 23:59.430
for the consumer your old product.

23:59.430 --> 24:01.950
So we went to the electronics manufacturer

24:01.950 --> 24:05.340
and we bought a big box of personal care products,

24:05.340 --> 24:07.323
different brands, many Panasonic.

24:08.220 --> 24:10.080
And we saw, and if you've never been

24:10.080 --> 24:12.480
to recycling manufacturer electronics,

24:12.480 --> 24:15.330
it's a huge warehouse and it's all automated

24:15.330 --> 24:17.250
because that's how you're gonna do this at scale

24:17.250 --> 24:19.200
is you're gonna have automation.

24:19.200 --> 24:23.010
And we followed these as it went through the whole warehouse

24:23.010 --> 24:25.680
and they went to sorting and it went to an area

24:25.680 --> 24:27.810
and the ones with lithium ion batteries,

24:27.810 --> 24:29.550
because they catch on fire,

24:29.550 --> 24:31.410
went to a special section in the back

24:31.410 --> 24:33.540
where they had all the fire control, right?

24:33.540 --> 24:36.750
So it took us time to go through there,

24:36.750 --> 24:41.133
and it was a manual process to get rid of the battery,

24:42.300 --> 24:45.600
because it was an electric razor you can use in the shower.

24:45.600 --> 24:49.320
And it took one person about 12 minutes

24:49.320 --> 24:50.910
to get that battery out.

24:50.910 --> 24:53.400
And we are talking about different ways

24:53.400 --> 24:55.890
he had to go get like a special screwdriver

24:55.890 --> 25:00.090
and he had to like safely separate the battery area from it.

25:00.090 --> 25:01.200
And that was hard to do

25:01.200 --> 25:04.020
because like the battery wasn't at the end,

25:04.020 --> 25:06.870
where you think easily removable, it's gonna be at the end,

25:06.870 --> 25:07.830
but it was in the middle

25:07.830 --> 25:10.560
and it was encased in so much plastic.

25:10.560 --> 25:13.050
And they said, "This is gonna cost you a lot of money."

25:13.050 --> 25:15.090
And we said, we said, "Okay, well, we need to do it

25:15.090 --> 25:18.090
but we need to find a way to make it better."

25:18.090 --> 25:19.770
So I put together a proposal.

25:19.770 --> 25:22.350
I'm thinking this is an easy solution, right?

25:22.350 --> 25:24.150
And I put together a proposal,

25:24.150 --> 25:27.510
this is the standard screw that needs to be used.

25:27.510 --> 25:30.540
I got all the specs, and it needs to be

25:30.540 --> 25:31.980
closer to the end of the unit

25:31.980 --> 25:35.430
so it could be chopped off first and then manually removed.

25:35.430 --> 25:38.490
And I bring it back to the design team in Japan.

25:38.490 --> 25:40.710
They review it and they come back to me

25:40.710 --> 25:42.450
and say that that's impossible.

25:42.450 --> 25:46.080
I can't make you that waterproof product

25:46.080 --> 25:48.360
with the specifications you're giving me.

25:48.360 --> 25:49.860
So they are working on it.

25:49.860 --> 25:52.710
I would say with each model, we get a little better,

25:52.710 --> 25:55.290
but we haven't really perfected that solution

25:55.290 --> 25:57.420
where it's gonna be a pop out battery

25:57.420 --> 25:59.130
that can have all the functionality

25:59.130 --> 26:00.663
and the safety that we need.

26:01.830 --> 26:03.600
<v ->If I could add to that, I mean, this is a critically</v>

26:03.600 --> 26:05.640
important issue for the recycling system,

26:05.640 --> 26:07.980
because as Andrea pointed out,

26:07.980 --> 26:09.390
it's a lot of time, time is money.

26:09.390 --> 26:12.180
So we've done some time studies on what it takes

26:12.180 --> 26:14.970
to actually get a battery ready for processing

26:14.970 --> 26:17.430
if it's in a product versus loose.

26:17.430 --> 26:19.265
And as Andrea pointed out,

26:19.265 --> 26:21.900
when you're dealing with loose batteries,

26:21.900 --> 26:23.400
it's increasingly robotic.

26:23.400 --> 26:25.410
It's like it's Star Trek level, sort of.

26:25.410 --> 26:26.640
And then you've got these rooms

26:26.640 --> 26:28.020
where it's basically the stone age.

26:28.020 --> 26:30.810
You've got people with hammers, beating things to death.

26:30.810 --> 26:32.640
And it's very expensive.

26:32.640 --> 26:34.080
It's very time consuming.

26:34.080 --> 26:38.340
Costs us about $82 a pound to be able to process

26:38.340 --> 26:39.930
lithium ion batteries that are loose batteries.

26:39.930 --> 26:42.270
If they're in a product, you add $2 to that.

26:42.270 --> 26:44.100
So it's about $4 a pound.

26:44.100 --> 26:45.540
It's very expensive.

26:45.540 --> 26:46.680
And the more expensive it is,

26:46.680 --> 26:49.020
the less incentive it is to do.

26:49.020 --> 26:50.340
So it's definitely an issue.

26:50.340 --> 26:52.380
And they're introduced all sorts of safety issues.

26:52.380 --> 26:54.150
And since you're in design, you know this.

26:54.150 --> 26:57.720
I mean, there's just a a ton of compelling sort of reasons

26:57.720 --> 27:00.030
to do this, that, and the other on the design side.

27:00.030 --> 27:01.830
This is just one of them.

27:01.830 --> 27:03.990
From our perspective, the more that manufacturers

27:03.990 --> 27:05.430
are thinking with the end in mind,

27:05.430 --> 27:07.530
the better off it's going to be.

27:07.530 --> 27:09.540
So actually, when we were talking earlier off stage

27:09.540 --> 27:11.700
about the headset, my first question, Giovanni,

27:11.700 --> 27:14.340
was can you remove the battery without a tool?

27:14.340 --> 27:18.300
'Cause anytime you gotta use a tool, it's a step, right?

27:18.300 --> 27:21.913
We need to be thinking in that direction.

27:21.913 --> 27:24.780
<v ->I just wanted to add that we have a DOE project</v>

27:24.780 --> 27:26.730
where we are looking at safe recycling

27:26.730 --> 27:28.920
or process for safe recycling.

27:28.920 --> 27:32.190
So we are looking at not only batteries but also devices.

27:32.190 --> 27:35.370
Right now, it's consumer level devices up to power tools

27:35.370 --> 27:38.490
where we are trying to see if we can simultaneously remove

27:38.490 --> 27:41.100
the electrolyte while we are shredding.

27:41.100 --> 27:43.530
So that will make the process,

27:43.530 --> 27:45.000
it's not connected to your question,

27:45.000 --> 27:47.760
but just saying that we can make the process

27:47.760 --> 27:50.910
more safer if we try to do something like that.

27:50.910 --> 27:52.380
<v Speaker>Is that for lithium ion batteries?</v>

27:52.380 --> 27:54.570
<v ->Yes, lithium ion batteries.</v>

27:54.570 --> 27:56.185
<v ->Okay, alright, good.</v>
<v ->Thank you very much.</v>

27:56.185 --> 27:58.320
<v Walter>All right, thank you for your question.</v>

27:58.320 --> 27:59.670
If there are no other questions right now,

27:59.670 --> 28:01.260
Giovanni, I wanted to ask,

28:01.260 --> 28:03.183
oh yes, please go on, go on up.

28:04.110 --> 28:06.780
And then if there's time, I'll ask you the follow up.

28:06.780 --> 28:07.680
<v Audience Member>Hi, everyone.</v>

28:07.680 --> 28:09.380
I'll just try to keep this simple.

28:10.740 --> 28:13.020
I worked 11 years in sustainability

28:13.020 --> 28:16.170
for electronic recyclers down in Southern California.

28:16.170 --> 28:19.170
And as we know, a lot of things are getting

28:19.170 --> 28:24.170
more and more expensive for a lot of the people in general.

28:24.210 --> 28:27.870
And yesterday, I was listening to the speaker,

28:27.870 --> 28:30.450
the CEO for Twitter and she was mentioning how

28:30.450 --> 28:35.450
generation Z is the up and coming.

28:36.210 --> 28:38.070
So what I'm just wondering is,

28:38.070 --> 28:40.410
I guess the question that I wanna ask is,

28:40.410 --> 28:43.770
throughout my years of working in Los Angeles and Seattle,

28:43.770 --> 28:48.770
total reclaim, EWA center, and corporate EWA solutions,

28:50.430 --> 28:52.710
and at one point, I was even trying to chase after

28:52.710 --> 28:56.943
some of the accounts here in Las Vegas like the Venetian.

28:58.050 --> 29:00.690
What I'm just wondering is for Panasonic

29:00.690 --> 29:03.720
or for some of you else on the panel,

29:03.720 --> 29:05.940
do you guys know if the manufacturers

29:05.940 --> 29:09.240
are offering like some type of incentive?

29:09.240 --> 29:11.760
Like for example, like for my shoes,

29:11.760 --> 29:14.700
they're from a company in Spain called Camper.

29:14.700 --> 29:17.970
So whenever my shoes are like older shoes,

29:17.970 --> 29:22.530
if I wanna buy a new pair of shoes, they kind of subsidize

29:22.530 --> 29:25.560
and you bring in the old one and then you can get

29:25.560 --> 29:27.900
like a little percentage off of a new one.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.520
So when I'm wondering is,

29:29.520 --> 29:31.020
in southern California, it's so hard

29:31.020 --> 29:33.117
'cause we're so spread out,

29:33.117 --> 29:35.520
and the only effective thing that I've seen

29:35.520 --> 29:36.360
throughout the years,

29:36.360 --> 29:38.010
you can do all these collection events

29:38.010 --> 29:41.430
with all these Ralphs and Albertsons and CVS,

29:41.430 --> 29:43.680
but what I'm wondering is like the most effective

29:43.680 --> 29:45.720
that I've seen in Orange County

29:45.720 --> 29:49.590
is where the city actually has Monday through Friday

29:49.590 --> 29:52.260
where people can drive their cars

29:52.260 --> 29:55.470
and just basically offload throughout the whole day.

29:55.470 --> 29:58.320
So maybe you guys can give some two cents

29:58.320 --> 30:00.930
on like some of the big major retailers

30:00.930 --> 30:04.050
like Ikea or Home Depot,

30:04.050 --> 30:05.850
'cause I know that they do try to collect

30:05.850 --> 30:07.590
some of the e-waste back,

30:07.590 --> 30:11.520
but I thought I'd just ask if you at Panasonic,

30:11.520 --> 30:14.880
like what do you guys do to cover all that?

30:14.880 --> 30:17.010
<v ->Yeah, I'm sure, and I know both Leo and I</v>

30:17.010 --> 30:19.950
can speak to this, but there's what's called

30:19.950 --> 30:22.980
extended producer responsibility, EPR.

30:22.980 --> 30:24.090
And when you think about it,

30:24.090 --> 30:27.810
there are many EPRs for all kinds of products.

30:27.810 --> 30:29.370
Your sneakers is an interesting one.

30:29.370 --> 30:31.830
I think that's a great new use case,

30:31.830 --> 30:33.300
'cause it's probably even more important

30:33.300 --> 30:36.000
how many sneakers does everyone go through

30:36.000 --> 30:37.920
in even a year or their lifetime.

30:37.920 --> 30:39.780
But that's very common.

30:39.780 --> 30:44.160
And there's EPR for many electronics, not all electronics,

30:44.160 --> 30:48.810
but primarily TVs, laptop computers, desktop computers,

30:48.810 --> 30:51.780
printers, batteries as well have their own

30:51.780 --> 30:54.360
extended producer responsibility laws.

30:54.360 --> 30:56.310
So as a producer of something,

30:56.310 --> 30:58.020
and actually those laws are extending now

30:58.020 --> 31:01.350
to packaging too as well for the products.

31:01.350 --> 31:05.070
We are responsible for that product at the end of its life.

31:05.070 --> 31:08.610
So we do partner with many recyclers across the country,

31:08.610 --> 31:12.300
and we have a recycling management company

31:12.300 --> 31:14.280
called MRM Recycling.

31:14.280 --> 31:17.010
So if you go onto their website,

31:17.010 --> 31:19.560
very similar to the Call2Recycle website.

31:19.560 --> 31:21.570
You just plug in your zip code

31:21.570 --> 31:23.940
and you can see where you can bring

31:23.940 --> 31:26.940
your electronics to recycle.

31:26.940 --> 31:29.130
And there are collection report points,

31:29.130 --> 31:31.080
I believe Best Buy, Staples

31:31.080 --> 31:33.780
will have collection and then local municipalities

31:33.780 --> 31:37.800
and those are funded by us, by the manufacturers.

31:37.800 --> 31:40.410
But you're right, we have to increase that.

31:40.410 --> 31:43.950
As much as we try, and specifically for batteries,

31:43.950 --> 31:47.730
we are not collecting as many batteries as we're making.

31:47.730 --> 31:51.240
And there are laws in, do you know how many states?

31:51.240 --> 31:52.626
And then in Canada?

31:52.626 --> 31:54.030
<v Leo>Oh, it's about a half a dozen right now</v>

31:54.030 --> 31:56.820
and it's gonna be double that soon.

31:56.820 --> 31:57.660
<v ->There are many laws,</v>

31:57.660 --> 31:59.880
and we are struggling to get those rates.

31:59.880 --> 32:03.330
So it's more about the education to the consumer,

32:03.330 --> 32:05.190
because it's pretty easy to get a battery.

32:05.190 --> 32:08.760
I bring my batteries some to the office when I'm lazy,

32:08.760 --> 32:11.010
because we have the call to recycle box.

32:11.010 --> 32:14.430
My husband usually takes batteries to Home Depot.

32:14.430 --> 32:18.720
And if you see the call to recycle symbol on the battery,

32:18.720 --> 32:20.460
you know you could bring it to Home Depot

32:20.460 --> 32:22.140
and we fund that program.

32:22.140 --> 32:24.750
But it's getting that, you know,

32:24.750 --> 32:27.960
just getting that mentality, I'd say, for consumers to know,

32:27.960 --> 32:30.510
hey, every time I go shopping,

32:30.510 --> 32:31.343
I don't know where you live,

32:31.343 --> 32:36.000
in New Jersey, we have a plastic bag ban.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.400
So every time we have plastic bags,

32:38.400 --> 32:42.420
we do our at Target, I bring my bags to Target

32:42.420 --> 32:44.670
to recycle through there.

32:44.670 --> 32:46.560
We have to get people to do that with batteries

32:46.560 --> 32:48.450
and people to do that electronics.

32:48.450 --> 32:50.610
You have to just get it into your daily routine

32:50.610 --> 32:53.610
that you're gonna be bringing back with you to recycling.

32:53.610 --> 32:55.440
But there are a lot of programs out there.

32:55.440 --> 32:56.910
And as long as we expand it,

32:56.910 --> 32:58.470
I think we're on the right track.

32:58.470 --> 32:59.640
<v Walter>Yeah, Leo, could you address,</v>

32:59.640 --> 33:01.440
who are your retail partners?

33:01.440 --> 33:04.650
<v ->Oh, well, the major ones are Home Depot, Lowe's,</v>

33:04.650 --> 33:05.880
Staples, Best Buy,

33:05.880 --> 33:08.400
and then True Value, ACE Hardware, et cetera.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.110
And on the incentive side,

33:10.110 --> 33:12.990
Staples is actually a really good example of how last year,

33:12.990 --> 33:14.640
we partnered with them and with the RI

33:14.640 --> 33:17.700
to basically do an all battery collection program,

33:17.700 --> 33:19.260
'cause most of what we do across the United States

33:19.260 --> 33:20.790
is rechargeable batteries.

33:20.790 --> 33:24.990
We do single use batteries depending on the situation.

33:24.990 --> 33:28.080
And they saw a dramatic increase in traffic.

33:28.080 --> 33:30.600
So it's a good sort of value proposition

33:30.600 --> 33:31.770
for their customers also.

33:31.770 --> 33:33.030
It's good for their business.

33:33.030 --> 33:34.770
That was an experience I had back at Best Buy

33:34.770 --> 33:37.200
where I cut my teeth in E-waste

33:37.200 --> 33:39.690
and standing up that e-waste recycling program,

33:39.690 --> 33:42.240
it was really all about the customer value proposition.

33:42.240 --> 33:43.073
But Andrea is right.

33:43.073 --> 33:44.040
EPR is what's driving this.

33:44.040 --> 33:49.040
So today, we service about a million residents

33:49.170 --> 33:53.040
in regulated EPR states for all batteries.

33:53.040 --> 33:54.390
Within about three to four years,

33:54.390 --> 33:57.030
that's gonna be about 65 million people.

33:57.030 --> 34:01.140
And when that happens is the regulations make us

34:01.140 --> 34:02.970
collect in a lot more places,

34:02.970 --> 34:05.700
have a much more muscular outreach and education approach.

34:05.700 --> 34:08.370
It's basically just making it more available and accessible.

34:08.370 --> 34:09.575
People are ready to do it.

34:09.575 --> 34:12.990
They just need access and some education.

34:12.990 --> 34:13.950
On the design side,

34:13.950 --> 34:16.200
since we had a question about design earlier,

34:16.200 --> 34:18.150
I think what's gonna drive that

34:18.150 --> 34:21.000
is the incentive there is gonna be more a little bit

34:21.000 --> 34:23.460
on the back end, which is it's just going

34:23.460 --> 34:25.170
to increasingly be more expensive

34:25.170 --> 34:27.060
to get recall batteries out of the market

34:27.060 --> 34:29.130
if you can't get them out of the product.

34:29.130 --> 34:31.860
We handle the recall for a manufacturer about a year ago,

34:31.860 --> 34:34.170
and it was an upgrade vacuum cleaner.

34:34.170 --> 34:36.600
It's about yay big, like the size of a small child.

34:36.600 --> 34:38.790
Battery was inside, could not get it out.

34:38.790 --> 34:39.810
The manufacturer needed

34:39.810 --> 34:42.240
to get the vacuum cleaner out of the market.

34:42.240 --> 34:46.530
It cost several hundred dollars per vacuum cleaner

34:46.530 --> 34:50.010
to safely legally transport that back to a recycler.

34:50.010 --> 34:52.477
So I'm a manufacturer, I'm thinking,

34:52.477 --> 34:54.300
"Okay, how do I avoid this next time?"

34:54.300 --> 34:55.380
Put a door.

34:55.380 --> 34:58.950
Get the battery out easily so you don't have to do that.

34:58.950 --> 35:00.390
I think those are the kinds of incentives

35:00.390 --> 35:01.440
that will maybe drive a little bit

35:01.440 --> 35:03.600
more change on the design side.

35:03.600 --> 35:06.480
<v ->Okay, any last questions from the audience?</v>

35:06.480 --> 35:07.563
Yeah, come on up.

35:09.180 --> 35:11.580
<v Audience Member>So we are at CES.</v>

35:11.580 --> 35:13.560
I'm wondering if you can say,

35:13.560 --> 35:16.620
if there is one thing you can get from technology side

35:16.620 --> 35:20.040
that can help recycling of lithium ion batteries better,

35:20.040 --> 35:22.770
what is that one thing going to be for you?

35:22.770 --> 35:25.290
How technology can help in improving recycling

35:25.290 --> 35:26.553
of lithium ion batteries?

35:27.900 --> 35:28.830
<v ->Good question.</v>

35:28.830 --> 35:31.620
Mostly, it's collection, but you might have some insights,

35:31.620 --> 35:32.820
one of you on the recycling.
<v ->Yeah, real quick,</v>

35:32.820 --> 35:35.040
just more automation on the processing side, I think.

35:35.040 --> 35:36.780
That's just gotta go faster,

35:36.780 --> 35:39.300
because we see indications at a pilot scale,

35:39.300 --> 35:42.480
that it has a lot of promise, but it's gotta go faster.

35:42.480 --> 35:45.480
<v ->And safety included in that.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

35:45.480 --> 35:47.490
<v ->Great, before we-</v>
<v ->I think if I just add-</v>

35:47.490 --> 35:49.110
<v ->Oh yeah, please.</v>
<v ->And collaboration</v>

35:49.110 --> 35:51.810
and new ideas, I think we need to combine

35:51.810 --> 35:55.620
partnerships with large companies and small startups, right?

35:55.620 --> 35:58.290
And work together to bring new technologies.

35:58.290 --> 36:00.930
I think Redwood's a great example of that.

36:00.930 --> 36:03.510
They started because they saw a problem,

36:03.510 --> 36:04.710
and they just worked to find

36:04.710 --> 36:06.720
the technologies for a solution.

36:06.720 --> 36:09.180
And if you read about Redwood materials,

36:09.180 --> 36:11.310
they're materials recycling company

36:11.310 --> 36:12.810
and you could bring them,

36:12.810 --> 36:13.987
I bring them ideas all the time.

36:13.987 --> 36:16.110
"I need you to find a way to recycle this," right?

36:16.110 --> 36:17.640
And they're gonna find a way to do it

36:17.640 --> 36:19.320
or they're working towards that, right?

36:19.320 --> 36:21.750
So we just have to work harder and come up with new ideas.

36:21.750 --> 36:22.583
<v ->Yeah, they're great.</v>

36:22.583 --> 36:23.640
They get about half of our weight today,

36:23.640 --> 36:25.500
so we like them a lot.

36:25.500 --> 36:26.333
<v ->Wonderful.</v>

36:26.333 --> 36:28.200
Well, before we wrap up, Giovanni,

36:28.200 --> 36:30.000
I wanna give you the last word.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.590
So we're talking about the future.

36:31.590 --> 36:32.970
You mentioned a couple of products

36:32.970 --> 36:35.040
and actually brought a couple of products

36:35.040 --> 36:36.330
that use your technology.

36:36.330 --> 36:39.420
What other products are being used for your technology,

36:39.420 --> 36:42.480
and where are some maybe future products?

36:42.480 --> 36:47.070
What looks like a good future market area for you as well?

36:47.070 --> 36:50.550
<v ->I think that in the immediate term,</v>

36:50.550 --> 36:53.583
the connected store, retail is gonna be very, very big.

36:55.290 --> 36:56.280
I actually brought,

36:56.280 --> 36:58.710
this is a small electronic shelf label.

36:58.710 --> 37:01.110
This is a price tag, right?

37:01.110 --> 37:02.340
<v ->That's a price tag.</v>

37:02.340 --> 37:05.070
<v ->This is a small screen that you see in the stores,</v>

37:05.070 --> 37:07.950
which will then show the price of a specific product.

37:07.950 --> 37:10.087
It can also, like this one for example says,

37:10.087 --> 37:13.743
"indoor charging with powerfoyle" by the 3M headphone.

37:14.580 --> 37:16.007
But this can display information, right?

37:16.007 --> 37:18.330
It can also gather information.

37:18.330 --> 37:21.210
And this is now deployed all over the U.S.

37:21.210 --> 37:22.830
Walmart announced a couple of weeks ago

37:22.830 --> 37:26.568
a $2 billion deal with our partner,

37:26.568 --> 37:27.570
The Vusion Group.

37:27.570 --> 37:29.700
We have an exclusive with them.

37:29.700 --> 37:32.070
These used to be battery-powered.

37:32.070 --> 37:34.410
Now, they're not battery powered anymore.

37:34.410 --> 37:37.140
These are now powered by the light in stores

37:37.140 --> 37:39.990
and the one battery to power many.

37:39.990 --> 37:42.150
And then we charge that battery.

37:42.150 --> 37:45.930
So this is enabling, unlocking the smartness of retail

37:45.930 --> 37:47.730
to gather more data, get more insights,

37:47.730 --> 37:50.790
and increase efficiency, enhance the shopping experience

37:50.790 --> 37:54.540
for the users and ultimately drive P&amp;L.

37:54.540 --> 37:56.730
So I think this is gonna be very, very, very big.

37:56.730 --> 37:57.900
I'm pretty sure of it.

37:57.900 --> 38:01.320
We see it being rolled out across the whole world now.

38:01.320 --> 38:04.533
You can change all the prices by your computer.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.920
I also think that the smart workplace,

38:07.920 --> 38:11.190
a smart worker will be really big in the future

38:11.190 --> 38:12.900
where you will have, I mean,

38:12.900 --> 38:16.230
you have 300 million construction helmets

38:16.230 --> 38:17.790
are sold every year.

38:17.790 --> 38:19.240
There's no smart within them.

38:20.100 --> 38:23.040
Integrated smartness, batteries and sensors.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.900
You'll be able to know who is where.

38:24.900 --> 38:27.903
Does she already have the right proper training?

38:29.070 --> 38:30.180
It's about compliance.

38:30.180 --> 38:33.660
It's about having a more safe work environment,

38:33.660 --> 38:35.880
health, digital health monitoring.

38:35.880 --> 38:37.470
There's so many things.

38:37.470 --> 38:39.210
<v ->Wow.</v>
<v ->It's gonna come.</v>

38:39.210 --> 38:42.240
But I think the key is that it has to be self-powered

38:42.240 --> 38:46.830
and just seamlessly integrated.

38:46.830 --> 38:48.660
And I think also what I wanted to comment

38:48.660 --> 38:51.960
on the battery things here is that another way

38:51.960 --> 38:53.640
to approach this is of course

38:53.640 --> 38:57.090
to prolong the lifetime of the batteries.

38:57.090 --> 38:58.650
And this can be done in many different ways.

38:58.650 --> 39:00.090
One way is, for example,

39:00.090 --> 39:02.973
that we electronically control the overcharge.

39:03.930 --> 39:07.170
So these ones, they never charge above 80%.

39:07.170 --> 39:09.810
So these are run for months

39:09.810 --> 39:12.330
without spending one charge cycle.

39:12.330 --> 39:15.843
They just go between 20 and 75% up and down,

39:16.920 --> 39:19.590
which greatly extend the lifetime of the products,

39:19.590 --> 39:21.660
which ultimately will lead to fewer batteries

39:21.660 --> 39:24.240
being used over time.

39:24.240 --> 39:27.150
So I think we need innovations,

39:27.150 --> 39:29.400
to your point there in the audience,

39:29.400 --> 39:33.150
and collaboration between big companies with global reach,

39:33.150 --> 39:36.240
smaller startup, scale ups.

39:36.240 --> 39:39.076
That's gonna be the key to the future.

39:39.076 --> 39:42.120
But in the end, the consumers or business to business,

39:42.120 --> 39:44.433
someone needs to want to buy the product.

39:45.300 --> 39:47.250
So the product features,

39:47.250 --> 39:49.770
I mean, technology will drive the change for sure.

39:49.770 --> 39:50.603
<v Walter>Yeah.</v>

39:50.603 --> 39:52.140
<v ->But it's our responsibility to make sure</v>

39:52.140 --> 39:55.560
that that change is environmentally sustainable

39:55.560 --> 39:58.020
and also business-wise sustainable.

39:58.020 --> 39:59.250
We can't come with solutions

39:59.250 --> 40:02.010
that are really great for the world, but it's too expensive

40:02.010 --> 40:04.530
or especially here in the U.S., sorry,

40:04.530 --> 40:07.080
but no one wants to pay for sustainability.

40:07.080 --> 40:08.100
In Europe, it's a little bit better.

40:08.100 --> 40:10.080
Sweden is quite good, actually.

40:10.080 --> 40:13.380
But here, you need to lead with lower cost of ownership.

40:13.380 --> 40:16.410
You need to lead with a higher increased P&amp;L,

40:16.410 --> 40:18.210
increased efficiency, lower OpEx,

40:18.210 --> 40:20.340
lower CapEx, whatever it is.

40:20.340 --> 40:22.080
And by the way, by implementing this,

40:22.080 --> 40:26.400
you're also contributing a little bit to a better world.

40:26.400 --> 40:27.296
<v ->Wow.</v>

40:27.296 --> 40:28.830
Well, thank you for wrapping up

40:28.830 --> 40:31.200
and just as a consumer, I look forward to the day

40:31.200 --> 40:32.820
when I don't have to put my fitness ring

40:32.820 --> 40:34.555
on the charger every few days.

40:34.555 --> 40:35.520
<v ->So there you go.</v>
<v ->So yeah,</v>

40:35.520 --> 40:37.440
so I'm looking forward to that.

40:37.440 --> 40:38.850
Well, listen, thank you all very much.

40:38.850 --> 40:41.533
Let's give a round of applause for the panel today.

40:41.533 --> 40:42.880
(audience applauding)

40:42.880 --> 40:45.463
