00:01.288 --> 00:03.871
(upbeat music)

2
00:10.740 --> 00:11.573
<v ->All right.</v>

3
00:11.573 --> 00:14.850
Hello everyone and thank you so much for joining us today

4
00:14.850 --> 00:17.610
and to our wonderful hosts at CES

5
00:17.610 --> 00:19.680
for bringing this session together.

6
00:19.680 --> 00:21.000
It is fantastic

7
00:21.000 --> 00:24.720
to see digital therapeutics have such a moment at CES

8
00:24.720 --> 00:27.000
and to be joined by some of the brightest

9
00:27.000 --> 00:30.450
and most influential brains in the digital therapeutics

10
00:30.450 --> 00:33.120
space as we delve deeper into this topic.

11
00:33.120 --> 00:34.260
My name's Gemma Jennings.

12
00:34.260 --> 00:35.760
I'm here from BBC studios

13
00:35.760 --> 00:37.590
and I know that our panel

14
00:37.590 --> 00:38.790
have a lot to contribute

15
00:38.790 --> 00:40.440
to today's discussion.

16
00:40.440 --> 00:43.440
And so I want to dive right in as we explore

17
00:43.440 --> 00:45.480
how technology driven treatments

18
00:45.480 --> 00:47.400
are transforming healthcare,

19
00:47.400 --> 00:49.320
improving patient outcomes,

20
00:49.320 --> 00:51.300
and redefining medicine.

21
00:51.300 --> 00:54.480
So without further ado, allow me to welcome

22
00:54.480 --> 00:56.700
each of our panelists.

23
00:56.700 --> 00:59.550
First on the end there we have Edward Cox.

67
02:52.830 --> 02:54.630
Sarah, the world needs more of that.

68
02:54.630 --> 02:56.220
Thank you for being here.

69
02:56.220 --> 02:57.123
<v ->Hello everyone.</v>

70
02:57.990 --> 03:01.560
<v ->Also joining us today is Dr. Patrick B. Thomas.</v>

71
03:01.560 --> 03:05.160
Patrick is an award-winning pediatric surgeon

72
03:05.160 --> 03:09.030
and CEO and founder of Surgeon Innovative Solutions,

73
03:09.030 --> 03:11.640
transforming healthcare with AI,

74
03:11.640 --> 03:16.110
robotics, extended reality and digital therapeutics.

75
03:16.110 --> 03:19.740
As medical director of innovation at Children's Nebraska,

76
03:19.740 --> 03:22.470
he spearheaded the state's first use

77
03:22.470 --> 03:26.070
of virtual reality in pediatric surgery

78
03:26.070 --> 03:29.670
and drives the development of virtual reality platforms,

79
03:29.670 --> 03:32.010
3D modeling and digital solutions.

80
03:32.010 --> 03:34.680
We are honored to have you with us, Patrick.

81
03:34.680 --> 03:36.600
<v ->Grateful to be here.</v>
<v ->Fantastic.</v>

82
03:36.600 --> 03:39.090
And I wanna start today from the very beginning,

83
03:39.090 --> 03:41.190
and Ed, I'm hoping you can help me.

84
03:41.190 --> 03:42.840
<v ->Sure.</v>

85
03:42.840 --> 03:44.790
<v ->Please explain for our audience,</v>

86
03:44.790 --> 03:46.800
what are digital therapeutics

87
03:46.800 --> 03:48.030
and how are they different

88
03:48.030 --> 03:51.720
from some of the more widely known digital health tools?

89
03:51.720 --> 03:53.882
<v ->Yeah, it's a great question.</v>

90
03:53.882 --> 03:55.920
I think the easiest way I've tried to explain this

91
03:55.920 --> 03:56.753
over the years

92
03:58.838 --> 03:59.671
is if you think

93
03:59.671 --> 04:01.800
of the digital health ecosystem

94
04:01.800 --> 04:03.720
almost like a galaxy

95
04:03.720 --> 04:06.330
with a lot of planetary bodies moving in and out of it,

96
04:06.330 --> 04:07.770
and there's a lot of overlap

97
04:07.770 --> 04:10.200
and things like telehealth, clearly digital health,

98
04:10.200 --> 04:11.970
things like virtual clinical trials,

99
04:11.970 --> 04:13.230
clearly digital health,

100
04:13.230 --> 04:15.180
things like healthcare IT,

101
04:15.180 --> 04:17.520
and all of those in some ways

102
04:17.520 --> 04:19.290
are the digitization of health.

103
04:19.290 --> 04:20.550
Taking manual processes

104
04:20.550 --> 04:23.149
and in some way making them more accessible digitally.

105
04:23.149 --> 04:24.930
I think as you get a little more tighter

106
04:24.930 --> 04:26.040
to digital medicine,

107
04:26.040 --> 04:29.370
it's the digital thing is having a medical effect.

108
04:29.370 --> 04:31.710
And then the most specific, it's digital therapeutics.

109
04:31.710 --> 04:34.290
The digital thing is having a therapeutic effect.

110
04:34.290 --> 04:36.685
And so I think, you know,

111
04:36.685 --> 04:37.950
and not to make a controversial statement,

112
04:37.950 --> 04:40.020
but I think most of us think

113
04:40.020 --> 04:41.874
of digital therapeutics from the idea

114
04:41.874 --> 04:44.730
that it is likely FDA regulated,

115
04:44.730 --> 04:46.860
normally as a software, as a medical device.

116
04:46.860 --> 04:50.460
It's likely through prescription or maybe prescription only,

117
04:50.460 --> 04:54.030
and it is making a specific medical claim.

118
04:54.030 --> 04:55.980
And that claim is in some way therapeutic.

119
04:55.980 --> 04:58.920
And so that to me is the easiest way to think about it.

120
04:58.920 --> 05:02.730
Not from an exclusatory standpoint, but just from a rubric.

121
05:02.730 --> 05:03.563
<v ->Super helpful.</v>

122
05:03.563 --> 05:04.853
Thank you for clearing that up.

123
05:04.853 --> 05:07.290
And now that we know about the distinction, Sarah,

124
05:07.290 --> 05:09.300
can you tell us what excites you

125
05:09.300 --> 05:12.510
most about the digital therapeutics landscape?

126
05:12.510 --> 05:14.610
<v ->Wearables, right?</v>

127
05:14.610 --> 05:17.340
How many of you all have smart watches on your wrist,

128
05:17.340 --> 05:21.780
Apple watch, Android watch, Samsung Galaxy Watch?

129
05:21.780 --> 05:23.583
How about EEG headbands?

130
05:24.420 --> 05:25.920
EEG meditation, headbands?

131
05:25.920 --> 05:27.750
Yeah, some hands in the audience.

132
05:27.750 --> 05:31.800
So what excites me is the ability to turn that data instead

133
05:31.800 --> 05:34.530
of just tracking it, like we've done for decades,

134
05:34.530 --> 05:36.690
is interacting with it.

135
05:36.690 --> 05:38.700
Developing a relationship with your data

136
05:38.700 --> 05:39.840
that you're not just,

137
05:39.840 --> 05:41.130
not just a flat number

138
05:41.130 --> 05:43.890
that's sequestered to your wrist anymore.

139
05:43.890 --> 05:47.310
That it's spatial, it's sentient,

140
05:47.310 --> 05:48.840
and it's set out into the world

141
05:48.840 --> 05:50.970
and it's something that you can actually see

142
05:50.970 --> 05:52.350
and learn to control.

143
05:52.350 --> 05:55.200
So I love all of these wearables

144
05:55.200 --> 05:56.760
that are coming out on the market

145
05:56.760 --> 06:00.480
and the ability to create content with that wearables

146
06:00.480 --> 06:03.840
that allows the user to learn to self-regulate

147
06:03.840 --> 06:06.840
all of that biometric data from their heart rate,

148
06:06.840 --> 06:10.260
to their brain patterns, to their blood pressure,

149
06:10.260 --> 06:11.610
anything that captures data.

150
06:11.610 --> 06:14.906
So very bullish on that as it relates

151
06:14.906 --> 06:16.170
to not only digital therapeutics,

152
06:16.170 --> 06:17.580
but also digiceuticals,

153
06:17.580 --> 06:21.060
which is, you know, one layer below

154
06:21.060 --> 06:22.650
digital therapeutics as it relates

155
06:22.650 --> 06:24.480
to the regulatory landscape.

156
06:24.480 --> 06:28.185
And I think, hand in hand, those digiceuticals

157
06:28.185 --> 06:31.680
have a relationship inside digital therapeutics

158
06:31.680 --> 06:33.720
as being that one step

159
06:33.720 --> 06:36.450
before you get to the full blown therapeutic.

160
06:36.450 --> 06:37.500
<v ->Right, absolutely.</v>

161
06:37.500 --> 06:39.810
Data coming out of our ears, but what are we doing with it?

162
06:39.810 --> 06:40.643
I love that.

163
06:40.643 --> 06:42.060
And Patrick, I'd love to come

164
06:42.060 --> 06:45.182
to the doctor in the room for your take from the front lines

165
06:45.182 --> 06:47.160
of healthcare delivery.

166
06:47.160 --> 06:50.790
How can digital therapeutics address unmet needs

167
06:50.790 --> 06:54.090
in healthcare and what can they mean for your patients?

168
06:54.090 --> 06:58.150
<v ->So I think when it comes to what are the unmet needs</v>

169
06:59.310 --> 07:02.190
when you go into a hospital environment,

170
07:02.190 --> 07:04.530
it can be a pretty scary place.

171
07:04.530 --> 07:06.090
As a surgeon,

172
07:06.090 --> 07:09.900
the work that I do pretty much prescriptive in the context

173
07:09.900 --> 07:12.930
that you need a procedure, it's performed.

174
07:12.930 --> 07:17.220
However, while that's the management of a surgical problem,

175
07:17.220 --> 07:18.750
the art of medicine is where

176
07:18.750 --> 07:22.920
the imagination needs to be released from my perspective.

177
07:22.920 --> 07:24.660
And when it comes to patients

178
07:24.660 --> 07:26.160
that are coming into the hospital, you know,

179
07:26.160 --> 07:28.470
how do you take that trepidation and that fear

180
07:28.470 --> 07:30.750
and how do you turn that into tranquility?

181
07:30.750 --> 07:33.450
So I think the opportunity to interact

182
07:33.450 --> 07:35.340
and use digital therapeutics is a way

183
07:35.340 --> 07:38.160
to reach into the emotional state of the patients

184
07:38.160 --> 07:40.660
and reach into the emotional state of the patients

185
07:41.837 --> 07:44.310
and address, you know, their concerns and their needs.

186
07:44.310 --> 07:48.987
So I think that when we look at digital therapeutics

187
07:48.987 --> 07:50.850
and the utility of digital therapeutics

188
07:50.850 --> 07:53.220
and the utility of them,

189
07:53.220 --> 07:55.260
it's how are we designing those experiences

190
07:55.260 --> 07:57.090
such that people can actually get the healthcare

191
07:57.090 --> 07:58.410
that they need,

192
07:58.410 --> 08:00.210
feel a sense of being seen,

193
08:00.210 --> 08:01.470
but also feeling better,

194
08:01.470 --> 08:03.360
and that they're healing better.

195
08:03.360 --> 08:04.193
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

196
08:04.193 --> 08:06.540
And that holds a lot of promise,

197
08:06.540 --> 08:09.480
but arguably digital health has held promise

198
08:09.480 --> 08:11.070
for the last 20 years.

199
08:11.070 --> 08:12.690
And Jeff, I wanna come to you

200
08:12.690 --> 08:15.990
to give us your take on why the time is now

201
08:15.990 --> 08:17.700
for digital therapeutics

202
08:17.700 --> 08:21.213
and what is accelerating that value proposition.

203
08:22.830 --> 08:23.663
<v ->Thanks, Gemma.</v>

204
08:26.447 --> 08:28.230
I've been coming to CES on and off for 20 years

205
08:28.230 --> 08:29.580
and this is a place

206
08:29.580 --> 08:32.790
of tremendous optimism as I walk around

207
08:32.790 --> 08:34.080
and I see all of these halls

208
08:34.080 --> 08:36.210
of people working on solving problems.

209
08:36.210 --> 08:38.310
And I think that's the why now.

210
08:38.310 --> 08:42.900
We have tremendous energy around solving healthcare,

211
08:42.900 --> 08:44.190
solving the problems of healthcare.

212
08:44.190 --> 08:47.850
I think people have better tools today with AI

213
08:47.850 --> 08:49.500
and a lot of the wearables

214
08:49.500 --> 08:50.940
and access to data that they've,

215
08:50.940 --> 08:52.650
better tools than they've ever had.

216
08:52.650 --> 08:54.760
I was talking to a CEO last night who

217
08:55.620 --> 08:57.660
of a digital therapeutics company

218
08:57.660 --> 09:02.400
who over the weekend used AI to create a video

219
09:02.400 --> 09:04.680
and do a campaign.

220
09:04.680 --> 09:09.150
And he said, I got 10 physicians to sign on.

221
09:09.150 --> 09:10.320
And he said, then I turned it over

222
09:10.320 --> 09:11.760
to my marketing department on Monday

223
09:11.760 --> 09:13.620
and told him to build a campaign.

224
09:13.620 --> 09:15.750
He could have never done that 10 years

225
09:15.750 --> 09:17.310
ago or five years ago.

226
09:17.310 --> 09:19.470
He's learning in real time.

227
09:19.470 --> 09:21.510
I think that's, I'm tremendously optimistic

228
09:21.510 --> 09:23.010
about the potential for that.

229
09:23.010 --> 09:25.950
The pandemic cracked the window in using digital

230
09:25.950 --> 09:28.502
on a daily basis for people.

231
09:28.502 --> 09:31.260
And I think there's also been some scarcity

232
09:31.260 --> 09:32.910
in the market for capital.

233
09:32.910 --> 09:34.000
I do investments

234
09:35.305 --> 09:36.720
and that scarcity, capital scarcity,

235
09:36.720 --> 09:39.180
has forced people to actually try business models

236
09:39.180 --> 09:41.700
that may have, that have potential.

237
09:41.700 --> 09:44.820
And so I've seen a lot of experimentation in this space.

238
09:44.820 --> 09:46.620
And people aren't generally just working

239
09:46.620 --> 09:47.910
on science projects right now.

240
09:47.910 --> 09:50.910
They're working on things that have a business model

241
09:50.910 --> 09:52.140
attached to them

242
09:52.140 --> 09:54.750
are ideally will be fundable and scalable.

243
09:54.750 --> 09:55.583
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

244
09:55.583 --> 09:56.416
And so many points there

245
09:56.416 --> 09:57.510
that I wanna come back to.

246
09:57.510 --> 09:59.400
But I wanna stay a a little bit on

247
09:59.400 --> 10:02.280
that financial incentives piece.

248
10:02.280 --> 10:03.630
You know, we've heard now

249
10:03.630 --> 10:06.900
what digital therapeutics are, why they're exciting,

250
10:06.900 --> 10:09.060
how they are impacting the healthcare space

251
10:09.060 --> 10:11.040
and why we're seeing an acceleration

252
10:11.040 --> 10:12.480
of the value proposition.

253
10:12.480 --> 10:14.760
So let's dive a a little bit more

254
10:14.760 --> 10:16.140
into that and Ed,

255
10:16.140 --> 10:18.360
perhaps you can tell us what is it

256
10:18.360 --> 10:21.060
that the industry is paying attention to in terms

257
10:21.060 --> 10:23.820
of regulatory financial changes?

258
10:23.820 --> 10:26.430
Something big happened 1st of January this year,

259
10:26.430 --> 10:28.800
so maybe you can say a little bit about that as well.

260
10:28.800 --> 10:30.360
<v ->Yeah, I think for those of us</v>

261
10:30.360 --> 10:31.950
that have been in this industry for a long time,

262
10:31.950 --> 10:34.800
I've been in digital therapeutics for about a decade now,

263
10:36.361 --> 10:38.130
2024 was,

264
10:38.130 --> 10:39.690
and going into 2025,

265
10:39.690 --> 10:41.940
will probably be the year that we look back on

266
10:41.940 --> 10:44.940
and say was the most transformational year within this.

267
10:44.940 --> 10:46.770
And it's not because of technology

268
10:46.770 --> 10:48.000
and it's not because of adoption

269
10:48.000 --> 10:51.780
and it's not because of mindset, it's because of statutes.

270
10:51.780 --> 10:52.613
Like, the thing is,

271
10:52.613 --> 10:55.140
is that those of us who are in health,

272
10:55.140 --> 10:58.950
the things that unlock things are statutory changes.

273
10:58.950 --> 11:01.440
A really good example is continuous glucose monitoring.

274
11:01.440 --> 11:02.940
No one ever doubted the science

275
11:02.940 --> 11:04.590
of continuous glucose monitoring

276
11:04.590 --> 11:06.810
or technologically how to do it.

277
11:06.810 --> 11:08.830
But it was not reimbursable until 2016

278
11:09.750 --> 11:11.820
and then it was put inside of a benefit category

279
11:11.820 --> 11:13.620
and then there was a way to get it to patients.

280
11:13.620 --> 11:15.420
So for those of you that don't know,

281
11:15.420 --> 11:17.910
prior to about a month and a half ago,

282
11:17.910 --> 11:19.710
digital therapeutics could not be

283
11:19.710 --> 11:21.630
reimbursed through CMS.

284
11:21.630 --> 11:22.980
There was no mechanism to do that,

285
11:22.980 --> 11:25.910
because software as a medical device fell outside

286
11:25.910 --> 11:27.330
of the benefit category.

287
11:27.330 --> 11:29.130
And then because of a lot of advocacy,

288
11:29.130 --> 11:31.560
and for those of you, if you're not already members of CTA,

289
11:31.560 --> 11:34.470
you should be, they were amazing advocates.

290
11:34.470 --> 11:36.579
They made a huge difference along with several other groups

291
11:36.579 --> 11:40.050
to advocate to congress, to advocate to CMS,

292
11:40.050 --> 11:43.560
to create what is now three new codes

293
11:43.560 --> 11:45.600
that are directly reimbursing

294
11:45.600 --> 11:47.610
digital mental health therapies

295
11:47.610 --> 11:49.770
and digital mental health treatments,

296
11:49.770 --> 11:51.320
which are digital therapeutics.

297
11:52.387 --> 11:54.120
And to me that's the unlock,

298
11:54.120 --> 11:56.220
because if the only way that we can build things

299
11:56.220 --> 11:59.310
is build things for people that have expendable capital,

300
11:59.310 --> 12:02.130
we're only gonna build things for people

301
12:02.130 --> 12:03.270
that have expendable capital.

302
12:03.270 --> 12:05.070
But that's not how health works.

303
12:05.070 --> 12:07.320
Health works, we see a huge problem

304
12:07.320 --> 12:09.549
and say, oh, let's go beat up that problem

305
12:09.549 --> 12:11.700
and let's get it to those people that deserve it.

306
12:11.700 --> 12:15.900
So the idea that this is the first step of permanent

307
12:15.900 --> 12:19.740
and ruggedized reimbursement of digital therapeutics,

308
12:19.740 --> 12:20.880
I think it's gonna change

309
12:20.880 --> 12:22.920
the indications we go in totally.

310
12:22.920 --> 12:25.560
And to me, I mean there was,

311
12:25.560 --> 12:27.000
it was not always gonna happen.

312
12:27.000 --> 12:28.470
It could have maybe never happened,

313
12:28.470 --> 12:30.118
but then hundreds of people over a decade

314
12:30.118 --> 12:34.080
pushed and pushed and pushed, and then it happened.

315
12:34.080 --> 12:36.180
And I think between that and PDOs,

316
12:36.180 --> 12:38.313
which we may come to in a later bit,

317
12:39.352 --> 12:40.800
I think this catalyzing moment

318
12:40.800 --> 12:42.960
that we're in is gonna be the year

319
12:42.960 --> 12:46.230
that we saw the unlock of how digital therapeutics

320
12:46.230 --> 12:48.060
actually get to patients.

321
12:48.060 --> 12:48.893
<v ->Fantastic.</v>

322
12:48.893 --> 12:50.490
And it is brilliant to see

323
12:50.490 --> 12:53.310
that we are starting to see real financial incentives.

324
12:53.310 --> 12:56.310
Jeff, I dunno if you wanna add more to that.

325
12:56.310 --> 12:58.263
Why do we need these incentives?

326
13:00.810 --> 13:01.980
<v ->I think there are a couple of reasons.</v>

327
13:01.980 --> 13:05.730
One, behavior change is difficult

328
13:05.730 --> 13:07.950
and adding financial incentives to the mix

329
13:07.950 --> 13:09.363
for health systems,

330
13:10.590 --> 13:14.010
potentially for patients and others are,

331
13:14.010 --> 13:15.310
they can be an important

332
13:16.260 --> 13:19.050
carrot in that behavior change.

333
13:19.050 --> 13:20.790
And in getting something,

334
13:20.790 --> 13:23.340
getting a digital therapeutic into an EMR

335
13:23.340 --> 13:26.378
where it's surfaced to a physician at the appropriate time

336
13:26.378 --> 13:28.293
for the appropriate patient.

337
13:30.450 --> 13:32.043
I think that there are,

338
13:33.210 --> 13:35.700
it's also very important from an investment standpoint

339
13:35.700 --> 13:39.450
in that these new regulations give us some little bit

340
13:39.450 --> 13:41.760
of predictability in revenue streams

341
13:41.760 --> 13:43.590
when we're looking at companies.

342
13:43.590 --> 13:46.203
And that's what investors are looking for.

343
13:47.760 --> 13:49.230
We absolutely look for that.

344
13:49.230 --> 13:52.810
We're also looking at not just being reliant

345
13:53.730 --> 13:55.920
on those particular CMS codes,

346
13:55.920 --> 13:58.950
but looking at direct to consumer models.

347
13:58.950 --> 14:00.450
We've launched three products at Otsuka

348
14:00.450 --> 14:01.950
in the last six months

349
14:01.950 --> 14:04.170
that are all essentially direct to consumer.

350
14:04.170 --> 14:06.330
One is prescription to or not.

351
14:06.330 --> 14:07.530
So we're testing those models.

352
14:07.530 --> 14:09.660
Our portfolio companies are testing those models

353
14:09.660 --> 14:12.513
as well as reimbursement models.

354
14:13.468 --> 14:14.700
But those financial incentives are a critical

355
14:14.700 --> 14:16.620
part of the behavior change.

356
14:16.620 --> 14:17.453
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

357
14:17.453 --> 14:20.944
And definitely of prominent importance.

358
14:20.944 --> 14:23.100
But let's not forget they're not the only pull factor.

359
14:23.100 --> 14:25.260
And you mentioned direct to consumer.

360
14:25.260 --> 14:27.870
I wanna come to the point of the consumer

361
14:27.870 --> 14:32.250
and Sarah for you to comment on that standpoint.

362
14:32.250 --> 14:33.803
Do these changes have an impact

363
14:33.803 --> 14:36.690
directly on consumer acceptance,

364
14:36.690 --> 14:38.610
which is another big piece of this

365
14:38.610 --> 14:42.030
and what are the trends that you are seeing emerging?

366
14:42.030 --> 14:42.900
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

367
14:42.900 --> 14:45.120
And certainly it does have an impact, right?

368
14:45.120 --> 14:48.360
When your insurance company reimburses for that product

369
14:48.360 --> 14:50.430
and is recommending that product.

370
14:50.430 --> 14:54.960
It adds legitimacy, it adds trust that you're using it

371
14:54.960 --> 14:58.020
and it also increases the likelihood that

372
14:58.020 --> 14:59.580
you'll use it in the first place.

373
14:59.580 --> 15:04.112
How many people do we have from Germany in the audience?

374
15:04.112 --> 15:05.310
A few.

375
15:05.310 --> 15:06.570
So it's really interesting

376
15:06.570 --> 15:07.590
to watch their model,

377
15:07.590 --> 15:09.870
not only what's happening in the US, but also, you know,

378
15:09.870 --> 15:11.940
around the world with the proliferation

379
15:11.940 --> 15:13.233
of these new codes.

380
15:14.517 --> 15:16.020
And, you know, digital therapeutics,

381
15:16.020 --> 15:19.050
you've always been able to reimburse for interventions

382
15:19.050 --> 15:21.780
that happen in the provider's office

383
15:21.780 --> 15:24.270
as a part of general therapy, right?

384
15:24.270 --> 15:27.070
So it'll be interesting to see with these new codes

385
15:29.100 --> 15:30.210
how much of an impact.

386
15:30.210 --> 15:31.410
We know it'll have an impact

387
15:31.410 --> 15:34.380
as it relates to the consumerism of healthcare

388
15:34.380 --> 15:35.940
and the likelihood they'll use it

389
15:35.940 --> 15:38.820
just from a cost, from a trust,

390
15:38.820 --> 15:41.610
and an efficacy perspective as well.

391
15:41.610 --> 15:42.443
<v ->Fantastic.</v>

392
15:42.443 --> 15:44.820
And of course we can't talk about the why now

393
15:44.820 --> 15:47.520
with considering the impact that the pandemic has had

394
15:47.520 --> 15:49.020
and it was touched on lightly.

395
15:50.151 --> 15:50.984
But Patrick, you know,

396
15:50.984 --> 15:54.390
seismic shifts across the healthcare model.

397
15:54.390 --> 15:57.720
Can you speak more to the impact of the pandemic

398
15:57.720 --> 16:02.370
and how it paves the way for digital therapeutics?

399
16:02.370 --> 16:03.780
<v ->So absolutely, absolutely.</v>

400
16:03.780 --> 16:05.880
One of the things that I think the pandemic did

401
16:05.880 --> 16:08.709
is it completely changed the relationship

402
16:08.709 --> 16:10.650
of the patient with their providers.

403
16:10.650 --> 16:15.480
All of a sudden you're in this environment where,

404
16:15.480 --> 16:17.310
you know, people's lives are being lost

405
16:17.310 --> 16:19.650
due to the unknown impact of this virus

406
16:19.650 --> 16:22.920
and we're trying to track the impacts in real time

407
16:22.920 --> 16:25.410
and that creates an accessibility issue.

408
16:25.410 --> 16:27.150
You're just not able to jump into your car

409
16:27.150 --> 16:28.530
and drive to your doctor's office.

410
16:28.530 --> 16:30.750
You know, is that waiting area safe?

411
16:30.750 --> 16:31.800
So I think one of the things

412
16:31.800 --> 16:36.300
that the pandemic did was ushered in new ways to interact

413
16:36.300 --> 16:40.440
with your clinicians and one was through Zoom

414
16:40.440 --> 16:43.140
or telehealth or FaceTime.

415
16:43.140 --> 16:45.480
I think we were really trying to figure out the best ways

416
16:45.480 --> 16:47.580
to still see our doctors,

417
16:47.580 --> 16:49.110
still get our prescriptions filled

418
16:49.110 --> 16:51.330
and stay healthy at the same time.

419
16:51.330 --> 16:55.110
So one of the benefits of digital, you know,

420
16:55.110 --> 16:58.410
therapeutics is that now if a patient needs

421
16:58.410 --> 16:59.820
to see their physician

422
16:59.820 --> 17:00.990
and you have a wearable

423
17:00.990 --> 17:03.420
that can sense your oxygen saturation

424
17:03.420 --> 17:06.120
or you have a smart watch that can detect whether

425
17:06.120 --> 17:07.920
or not you have an arrhythmia

426
17:07.920 --> 17:10.560
or you have the ability to correct, you know,

427
17:10.560 --> 17:12.480
other data that's needed by your physician.

428
17:12.480 --> 17:13.590
'cause let's think about it.

429
17:13.590 --> 17:15.510
When you go to your doctor, what does your doctor ask you?

430
17:15.510 --> 17:16.343
What's going on?

431
17:16.343 --> 17:17.700
What are your problems?

432
17:17.700 --> 17:20.400
And then he goes into the objective part of the examination,

433
17:20.400 --> 17:22.860
which is what are your vital signs?

434
17:22.860 --> 17:24.150
So now that we have technology

435
17:24.150 --> 17:27.870
that can reproduce those tech, you know, those vital signs

436
17:27.870 --> 17:30.900
in a medium that's digital and then using telehealth

437
17:30.900 --> 17:32.370
or using Zoom,

438
17:32.370 --> 17:34.410
then now we're able to still preserve

439
17:34.410 --> 17:36.630
that relationship with a physician being able to take care

440
17:36.630 --> 17:39.213
of their patient in a meaningful way.

441
17:40.301 --> 17:42.840
And while the pandemic disrupted community,

442
17:42.840 --> 17:44.460
and that sense of community, you know,

443
17:44.460 --> 17:46.110
these tools were enabling us

444
17:46.110 --> 17:49.500
now to create new community ecosystems

445
17:49.500 --> 17:52.890
where the doctor can not only still be a provider

446
17:52.890 --> 17:55.320
and provider services that they need to,

447
17:55.320 --> 17:57.210
but now they're using all these different digital tools

448
17:57.210 --> 17:59.520
that are creating tons of data.

449
17:59.520 --> 18:01.530
And now it's a matter of synthesizing that data to kind

450
18:01.530 --> 18:02.580
of come up with creative ways

451
18:02.580 --> 18:06.240
to treat diseases in a more meaningful way.

452
18:06.240 --> 18:08.640
You mentioned the glucose monitoring.

453
18:08.640 --> 18:09.630
So that's something

454
18:09.630 --> 18:11.790
that's super important that, you know, you have that data,

455
18:11.790 --> 18:14.730
but how is that data being presented to physicians?

456
18:14.730 --> 18:16.290
So it's causing physicians now

457
18:16.290 --> 18:19.500
and hospital teams to reimagine the ways

458
18:19.500 --> 18:21.012
that we can take that data,

459
18:21.012 --> 18:22.813
make it interpretable

460
18:22.813 --> 18:25.230
and make it available to the patients.

461
18:25.230 --> 18:27.390
<v ->Absolutely, I think the pandemic showed us</v>

462
18:27.390 --> 18:30.030
that we can overcome a lot of barriers,

463
18:30.030 --> 18:33.843
but there are still an awful lot of barriers to overcome.

464
18:34.740 --> 18:38.700
And you know, we've heard about why now

465
18:38.700 --> 18:41.220
is the time for digital therapeutics to scale.

466
18:41.220 --> 18:43.620
We've heard about the reimbursement conditions,

467
18:43.620 --> 18:46.080
but what are some of the challenges

468
18:46.080 --> 18:48.090
that still persist in terms

469
18:48.090 --> 18:50.490
of getting digital therapeutics covered

470
18:50.490 --> 18:52.200
and how can they be overcome?

471
18:52.200 --> 18:53.823
Jeff, perhaps you wanna comment?

472
18:55.200 --> 18:56.033
<v ->Yeah.</v>

473
18:57.810 --> 19:00.600
I think that the challenges,

474
19:00.600 --> 19:03.810
the challenges today are really probably not

475
19:03.810 --> 19:04.760
that much different

476
19:06.512 --> 19:08.393
than they were six or eight years ago.

477
19:11.100 --> 19:13.950
For a digital therapeutic to be adopted,

478
19:13.950 --> 19:18.580
you have to have data that shows clinical impact

479
19:20.370 --> 19:23.190
and you have to be able to show

480
19:23.190 --> 19:26.640
the person who's gonna pay for it that there's an ROI

481
19:26.640 --> 19:28.857
and that you can actually engage people

482
19:28.857 --> 19:32.703
and that they will stay engaged in this to a meaningful end.

483
19:35.589 --> 19:36.989
And I think that's a really,

484
19:37.860 --> 19:40.080
that's challenging and it's what makes,

485
19:40.080 --> 19:43.590
what makes the development of digital therapeutics

486
19:43.590 --> 19:48.590
still really a difficult proposition that get,

487
19:48.926 --> 19:51.510
you have to not only do the trial

488
19:51.510 --> 19:53.400
to show clinical efficacy

489
19:53.400 --> 19:56.610
and impact, which is, which may include going

490
19:56.610 --> 19:58.140
through the FDA process,

491
19:58.140 --> 20:00.390
but you also really need to gather enough data

492
20:00.390 --> 20:03.180
to be able to go to a payer or an employer

493
20:03.180 --> 20:05.730
and say that in a large population we were,

494
20:05.730 --> 20:09.210
we can give you a four to one ROI

495
20:09.210 --> 20:12.750
and that in a population of 10,000 people,

496
20:12.750 --> 20:14.523
a thousand will complete this.

497
20:15.798 --> 20:17.733
And you can see this kind of financial impact.

498
20:19.020 --> 20:20.073
That's expensive.

499
20:21.000 --> 20:23.520
The new coverage codes make it much,

500
20:23.520 --> 20:25.410
make it a little bit easier

501
20:25.410 --> 20:27.900
to project those as an investor.

502
20:27.900 --> 20:30.513
AI gives you some tools that we haven't had before.

503
20:31.620 --> 20:33.150
One of the things that we're dealing with right now

504
20:33.150 --> 20:35.130
with a couple of our portfolio companies

505
20:35.130 --> 20:38.970
and internally is that backend system

506
20:38.970 --> 20:40.480
that unites the

507
20:41.490 --> 20:45.300
potentially multiple digital therapeutics

508
20:45.300 --> 20:46.773
is an area of opportunity.

509
20:48.827 --> 20:50.915
So part of the reimbursement challenge

510
20:50.915 --> 20:52.215
is that a lot of employers

511
20:53.664 --> 20:56.670
and particularly employers, don't want a bunch of one-offs.

512
20:56.670 --> 20:58.740
They want something that treats,

513
20:58.740 --> 21:00.480
that deals with women's health issues

514
21:00.480 --> 21:02.040
or mental health issues.

515
21:02.040 --> 21:03.570
They don't want 20 solutions.

516
21:03.570 --> 21:05.670
They want one that maybe has all of those.

517
21:05.670 --> 21:07.440
So we're working with a bunch of our,

518
21:07.440 --> 21:08.700
with our portfolio companies

519
21:08.700 --> 21:10.170
and with some of our own products to try

520
21:10.170 --> 21:13.020
and centralize these on a platform where we can maybe go

521
21:13.020 --> 21:16.020
and say we have a women's health platform that can,

522
21:16.020 --> 21:17.103
that can help,

523
21:18.300 --> 21:19.563
help from the,

524
21:21.642 --> 21:22.920
the prenatal stage all the way through

525
21:22.920 --> 21:24.700
to perimenopause and menopause

526
21:26.220 --> 21:27.930
and doing the same in mental health.

527
21:27.930 --> 21:30.000
So I think that those platform approaches

528
21:30.000 --> 21:32.070
will help with reimbursement also.

529
21:32.070 --> 21:33.180
<v ->Fantastic, thank you.</v>

530
21:33.180 --> 21:35.460
And Ed coming from a company like Pfizer,

531
21:35.460 --> 21:36.780
does that resonate with you?

532
21:36.780 --> 21:39.030
Are you exploring similar models

533
21:39.030 --> 21:40.710
to overcome those sorts of challenges?

534
21:40.710 --> 21:42.850
<v ->I mean yeah, for sure. I do think though</v>

535
21:43.860 --> 21:45.053
and I can say this,

536
21:45.053 --> 21:46.560
'cause he and I have been friends for a long time.

537
21:46.560 --> 21:49.260
I'm a little bit probably more bullish.

538
21:49.260 --> 21:52.530
And the reason for that is I do think there were some

539
21:52.530 --> 21:56.790
permanent tectonic shifts that changed the board.

540
21:56.790 --> 21:58.800
Like it's, you think about electric cars,

541
21:58.800 --> 22:00.150
is like bunch of people tried in the seventies,

542
22:00.150 --> 22:00.983
they all went bankrupt,

543
22:00.983 --> 22:02.640
eighties been bankrupt, nineties went bankrupt.

544
22:02.640 --> 22:04.410
Now the most valuable company in the world, right?

545
22:04.410 --> 22:07.770
And so what happens is sometimes you're just too early

546
22:07.770 --> 22:10.710
and sometimes these macro factors that have

547
22:10.710 --> 22:12.723
to happen haven't happened yet.

548
22:14.277 --> 22:15.570
And tragically, I think when we look back,

549
22:15.570 --> 22:17.520
the thing that will have changed the board

550
22:17.520 --> 22:19.470
for digital therapeutics was the pandemic

551
22:19.470 --> 22:21.870
and the easiest stat in the world is percentage

552
22:21.870 --> 22:26.460
of grandparents that could use zoom in 2020 versus today.

553
22:26.460 --> 22:29.610
So that was like 0.07% to 70%.

554
22:29.610 --> 22:31.500
I don't know how many orders of magnitude that is,

555
22:31.500 --> 22:33.330
but that's a lot, right?

556
22:33.330 --> 22:35.357
And the idea of telehealth visits,

557
22:35.357 --> 22:37.620
like I'm not doing this over video,

558
22:37.620 --> 22:38.730
I wanna see my doctor,

559
22:38.730 --> 22:40.710
to I'm not going into a hospital.

560
22:40.710 --> 22:43.710
Can he do it on or can he or she do it on video?

561
22:43.710 --> 22:47.190
Like we're in a different world than we were in 2019

562
22:47.190 --> 22:50.160
and most of it was not of our doing, right?

563
22:50.160 --> 22:53.970
These were reactions to this meteor that struck the Earth

564
22:53.970 --> 22:56.221
and this fallout shifted everything,

565
22:56.221 --> 22:57.360
but technology adoption.

566
22:57.360 --> 23:00.300
I mean we've got 6 billion smartphones for 8 billion people

567
23:00.300 --> 23:02.370
and we're building smartphones at a much faster

568
23:02.370 --> 23:03.990
rate than we're building people.

569
23:03.990 --> 23:08.130
And so eventually we're gonna be able to get health

570
23:08.130 --> 23:09.813
to almost everyone.

571
23:11.111 --> 23:13.500
And that wasn't true even five years ago

572
23:13.500 --> 23:15.270
and it definitely wasn't true 10 years ago.

573
23:15.270 --> 23:17.070
And then the thing that we could influence,

574
23:17.070 --> 23:18.630
the thing that Catherine and Renee

575
23:18.630 --> 23:22.320
and members from CTA and DTA and AvMed and Otsuka

576
23:22.320 --> 23:24.570
and lots of different companies pushed on,

577
23:24.570 --> 23:28.740
is now there is a statutory way to do it.

578
23:28.740 --> 23:32.610
So I think, you know, having been a CEO in the previous era

579
23:32.610 --> 23:34.440
of digital therapeutics versus being a leader

580
23:34.440 --> 23:36.840
in the digital therapeutic era now,

581
23:36.840 --> 23:38.820
it is very much like,

582
23:38.820 --> 23:40.290
I think there's a new world,

583
23:40.290 --> 23:42.240
but we keep losing ships halfway

584
23:42.240 --> 23:44.490
across the ocean to holy smoke,

585
23:44.490 --> 23:45.840
'cause there's a new world.

586
23:47.107 --> 23:48.720
And and I think that's exciting,

587
23:48.720 --> 23:50.190
because we could have done this for another 20 years

588
23:50.190 --> 23:52.740
and never got here, but we're here now.

589
23:52.740 --> 23:56.640
And that to me is why it's an inspirational time

590
23:56.640 --> 23:59.220
to be in this because the opportunity

591
23:59.220 --> 24:03.540
for scale is almost like nothing else we've ever seen.

592
24:03.540 --> 24:04.373
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

593
24:04.373 --> 24:05.340
And that momentum has

594
24:05.340 --> 24:07.830
to continue across all areas.

595
24:07.830 --> 24:09.180
And I think we have a great panel here

596
24:09.180 --> 24:11.820
that is representative of a lot of those areas.

597
24:11.820 --> 24:15.600
And I would love to hear more about provider involvement.

598
24:15.600 --> 24:18.480
Patrick, are there challenges that are unique

599
24:18.480 --> 24:22.320
to digital therapeutics when it comes to provider adoption

600
24:22.320 --> 24:24.690
and in the same way that there are, you know,

601
24:24.690 --> 24:28.063
for things like remote patient monitoring products

602
24:28.063 --> 24:29.716
and what are some of those?

603
24:29.716 --> 24:30.819
<v ->Sure.</v>

604
24:30.819 --> 24:31.652
Well I'll approach that

605
24:31.652 --> 24:33.630
through three different lenses.

606
24:33.630 --> 24:35.220
One, at the enterprise level,

607
24:35.220 --> 24:37.350
the other at the provider level

608
24:37.350 --> 24:39.360
and the other at the the patient level.

609
24:39.360 --> 24:42.750
At the enterprise level, you have to have a hospital

610
24:42.750 --> 24:44.700
that's committed or an organization that's committed

611
24:44.700 --> 24:47.370
to innovation that is seeking different ways

612
24:47.370 --> 24:48.930
to treat disease.

613
24:48.930 --> 24:50.580
And I think if you have

614
24:50.580 --> 24:52.800
or you're fortunate to be in a hospital system

615
24:52.800 --> 24:54.060
where they embrace innovation,

616
24:54.060 --> 24:55.440
they embrace technology,

617
24:55.440 --> 24:56.670
then digital therapeutics

618
24:56.670 --> 24:58.230
and virtual reality as a digital therapeutic

619
24:58.230 --> 25:01.260
will not be a strange concept.

620
25:01.260 --> 25:03.060
But then let's take it to the provider level.

621
25:03.060 --> 25:04.110
I mean providers today

622
25:04.110 --> 25:05.700
are being trained to take care of patients,

623
25:05.700 --> 25:07.950
but they're not necessarily being trained

624
25:07.950 --> 25:10.530
to use their imagination to create new products,

625
25:10.530 --> 25:12.450
to take care of patients.

626
25:12.450 --> 25:14.700
For example, you know, virtual reality

627
25:14.700 --> 25:17.880
is definitely helpful for patients that have stress,

628
25:17.880 --> 25:20.400
but what's the environment where that's deployed?

629
25:20.400 --> 25:23.190
That's deployed in an environment where the providers

630
25:23.190 --> 25:25.890
or the physicians have actually had some exposure

631
25:25.890 --> 25:29.670
to the power of virtual reality as a digital therapeutic.

632
25:29.670 --> 25:32.460
The first time that I used the therapy was in 2020

633
25:32.460 --> 25:35.670
during the pandemic and it was on a young lady that came in

634
25:35.670 --> 25:38.730
with an intestinal obstruction and she required surgery.

635
25:38.730 --> 25:40.860
And so I performed the surgery laparoscopically,

636
25:40.860 --> 25:41.970
had to resect some bowel,

637
25:41.970 --> 25:43.980
but then afterwards the question was,

638
25:43.980 --> 25:45.990
well how do we address the pain medic, you know,

639
25:45.990 --> 25:47.760
her pain requirement needs

640
25:47.760 --> 25:49.110
and I'm in a hospital that hasn't

641
25:49.110 --> 25:51.000
used it as a digital therapeutic before.

642
25:51.000 --> 25:52.980
The concept was foreign.

643
25:52.980 --> 25:55.080
We used a virtual reality headset on the child.

644
25:55.080 --> 25:56.730
She didn't require as much narcotics

645
25:56.730 --> 25:58.830
as she did and she was up

646
25:58.830 --> 26:01.200
and walking around the next day, you know,

647
26:01.200 --> 26:03.750
in her room and before she left,

648
26:03.750 --> 26:04.800
her family says that she had

649
26:04.800 --> 26:05.910
to take a picture with me, again,

650
26:05.910 --> 26:07.050
this is in the middle of the pandemic,

651
26:07.050 --> 26:08.580
so I'm wearing a couple different masks

652
26:08.580 --> 26:10.680
and she hugs me around my leg.

653
26:10.680 --> 26:13.530
So what is the return on investment for that experience?

654
26:13.530 --> 26:14.363
The return on investment

655
26:14.363 --> 26:16.170
from that experience from my perspective

656
26:16.170 --> 26:19.380
is the child did not require a lot of narcotics.

657
26:19.380 --> 26:20.700
And we understand the power

658
26:20.700 --> 26:22.440
of narcotics being out in the communities

659
26:22.440 --> 26:23.610
and their impact when they don't,

660
26:23.610 --> 26:25.560
when they're overprescribed.

661
26:25.560 --> 26:26.580
But then also the smile

662
26:26.580 --> 26:28.740
and the stress that was on the child's face

663
26:28.740 --> 26:30.600
and on the parents' face when they recognized

664
26:30.600 --> 26:33.210
that their child actually was better when they came in.

665
26:33.210 --> 26:34.350
And when they left the hospital,

666
26:34.350 --> 26:36.390
it wasn't a scary experience.

667
26:36.390 --> 26:39.480
So I think the opportunity for other physicians

668
26:39.480 --> 26:41.640
to understand the power of that is actually having

669
26:41.640 --> 26:43.590
that personal experience.

670
26:43.590 --> 26:46.320
One last story, my godsons have autism

671
26:46.320 --> 26:49.530
and when they were going to their primary care visit,

672
26:49.530 --> 26:50.880
their well-child visit,

673
26:50.880 --> 26:52.380
they could never get the kids outta the car.

674
26:52.380 --> 26:53.640
'Cause they would scream and they would yell

675
26:53.640 --> 26:55.170
and they were crying and upset.

676
26:55.170 --> 26:56.430
Fortunately they had a good physician

677
26:56.430 --> 26:57.600
that would come out to the car,

678
26:57.600 --> 26:59.310
did their examinations,

679
26:59.310 --> 27:02.730
insert virtual reality as a digital therapeutic.

680
27:02.730 --> 27:05.190
Now they're immersed in an environment where they're like,

681
27:05.190 --> 27:07.950
you know, spraying animals and washing them, you know,

682
27:07.950 --> 27:09.810
shooting bubbles that have colors

683
27:09.810 --> 27:10.860
and now they're actually able

684
27:10.860 --> 27:14.550
to complete their entire well-child visit in the office

685
27:14.550 --> 27:16.140
and they're actually able to get their immunizations

686
27:16.140 --> 27:18.120
and shots without any problems.

687
27:18.120 --> 27:20.400
So once you expose that to the nurses

688
27:20.400 --> 27:22.380
and the doctors that are in that environment,

689
27:22.380 --> 27:24.450
that's where their return of investment

690
27:24.450 --> 27:26.460
comes in as the buy-in.

691
27:26.460 --> 27:28.770
And then from the consumer perspective,

692
27:28.770 --> 27:31.590
when the consumers are out here using these immersive

693
27:31.590 --> 27:34.350
products from virtual reality for, you know,

694
27:34.350 --> 27:37.860
decreasing anxiety or just decreasing stress

695
27:37.860 --> 27:41.460
or increasing fitness, well that is changing their,

696
27:41.460 --> 27:43.470
you know, physiology and changing their biology

697
27:43.470 --> 27:45.030
and changing their health.

698
27:45.030 --> 27:47.790
And that in turn is gonna cause them to seek the providers

699
27:47.790 --> 27:50.040
that are actually using this technology.

700
27:50.040 --> 27:53.430
So if you're not using this technology as a provider,

701
27:53.430 --> 27:55.740
your consumers are gonna become smart

702
27:55.740 --> 27:58.020
as more and more digital therapeutics are available

703
27:58.020 --> 27:59.250
and they're gonna seek those physicians

704
27:59.250 --> 28:01.470
that actually understand how to use the data,

705
28:01.470 --> 28:02.850
are willing to use the data

706
28:02.850 --> 28:03.840
and can more importantly,

707
28:03.840 --> 28:06.300
imagine different ways to manage health

708
28:06.300 --> 28:08.010
with the data that they receive.

709
28:08.010 --> 28:09.720
<v ->Absolutely, yeah.</v>

710
28:09.720 --> 28:10.620
It's a real tide.

711
28:10.620 --> 28:12.240
And Sarah, do you agree?

712
28:12.240 --> 28:16.230
Are you seeing that that trend with consumers demanding?

713
28:16.230 --> 28:17.490
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

714
28:17.490 --> 28:20.400
You know, immersive media is just as effective

715
28:20.400 --> 28:22.172
as a dose of hydromorphone,

716
28:22.172 --> 28:24.540
dilaudid, a very powerful pain killer.

717
28:24.540 --> 28:27.930
And when you can quickly interrupt the stress response,

718
28:27.930 --> 28:30.150
that has a huge impact.

719
28:30.150 --> 28:34.830
And as it relates to, you know, that consumerism of health

720
28:34.830 --> 28:37.020
and reimbursement codes, you know,

721
28:37.020 --> 28:39.780
there's programs not just here in the US

722
28:39.780 --> 28:42.870
but also overseas, the DIGA, D-I-G-A,

723
28:42.870 --> 28:44.760
I'd encourage you all to look into it,

724
28:44.760 --> 28:48.870
that has some fascinating onboarding modalities

725
28:48.870 --> 28:50.970
that places these digital therapeutics

726
28:50.970 --> 28:51.810
in their real world

727
28:51.810 --> 28:54.690
and also in the provider's hands, to discover them,

728
28:54.690 --> 28:56.130
not only for pain,

729
28:56.130 --> 28:58.440
but also for stress management as well.

730
28:58.440 --> 29:02.370
And you know, certainly of the stories of, you know,

731
29:02.370 --> 29:06.368
the transformative power with Healium,

732
29:06.368 --> 29:09.840
we were giving an intervention to an individual

733
29:09.840 --> 29:10.740
who had lost,

734
29:10.740 --> 29:13.080
you know, conceivably lost the use of his hands.

735
29:13.080 --> 29:15.420
He wasn't able to lift his hands above his head.

736
29:15.420 --> 29:17.370
His provider told us that you'll have

737
29:17.370 --> 29:18.870
to place the goggles on him,

738
29:18.870 --> 29:22.260
because he's not able to physically do it himself.

739
29:22.260 --> 29:24.240
But halfway through that experience,

740
29:24.240 --> 29:27.360
you know, his arms were above his waist

741
29:27.360 --> 29:30.630
and he was reaching out to the people that he saw, you know,

742
29:30.630 --> 29:31.923
inside the goggles.

743
29:33.287 --> 29:35.460
So powerful transformative tool

744
29:35.460 --> 29:38.280
that's not necessarily meant to be a replacement

745
29:38.280 --> 29:41.373
for psychotropic medication or professional counseling,

746
29:42.270 --> 29:46.140
but certainly has great value in these areas.

747
29:46.140 --> 29:48.120
And that hurdle is education,

748
29:48.120 --> 29:49.200
not just for the patients,

749
29:49.200 --> 29:50.940
but for the providers as well.

750
29:50.940 --> 29:52.650
<v ->These stories are so important.</v>

751
29:52.650 --> 29:54.210
Your godson, your patients.

752
29:54.210 --> 29:57.030
Your consumers who's lives have been changed.

753
29:57.030 --> 30:00.510
They show us how far we've come in just the last five years,

754
30:00.510 --> 30:03.030
but there are still some ways to go.

755
30:03.030 --> 30:07.140
And, Ed perhaps, I can come to you for your take on

756
30:07.140 --> 30:10.380
what needs to happen in the next five to 10 years

757
30:10.380 --> 30:12.300
to realize the potential

758
30:12.300 --> 30:14.370
that we've been hearing about here today.

759
30:14.370 --> 30:16.770
<v ->Yeah, I mean I think one of the great things</v>

760
30:16.770 --> 30:21.430
that being an event like CES is it's full of innovators

761
30:23.040 --> 30:26.430
and I think, this is gonna sound maybe trivial,

762
30:26.430 --> 30:28.500
but it's meant to be the opposite is,

763
30:28.500 --> 30:31.830
what's it gonna take is us caring,

764
30:31.830 --> 30:33.360
is us actually making it happen.

765
30:33.360 --> 30:35.100
Things don't just happen.

766
30:35.100 --> 30:36.573
humans make them happen.

767
30:37.878 --> 30:40.350
Like we don't have a cure for polio and then we do.

768
30:40.350 --> 30:43.470
We don't know how to sail across the oceans and then we did.

769
30:43.470 --> 30:44.303
Right?

770
30:44.303 --> 30:46.680
And and I think it's one of those things that

771
30:46.680 --> 30:49.320
if you think about the impact

772
30:49.320 --> 30:53.313
of what happens if this is successful, right?

773
30:54.423 --> 30:55.890
Of the 6 billion people that have smartphones

774
30:55.890 --> 30:58.020
and the 8 billion people that are on planet,

775
30:58.020 --> 31:00.420
all of them are more scared than they should be.

776
31:00.420 --> 31:02.460
And all of them are more sad than they should be

777
31:02.460 --> 31:05.160
and none of them are getting the best care that they could.

778
31:05.160 --> 31:08.070
And the idea that a small group of us, like, I don't know,

779
31:08.070 --> 31:11.670
there's 20,000, 30,000 people probably just in this hotel,

780
31:11.670 --> 31:13.650
and you know, maybe a couple million people

781
31:13.650 --> 31:14.850
in the group in the vicinity,

782
31:14.850 --> 31:16.170
but you're still talking a fraction

783
31:16.170 --> 31:18.720
of the human population to say,

784
31:18.720 --> 31:21.120
I can actually push on this,

785
31:21.120 --> 31:24.120
so that someday a billion people,

786
31:24.120 --> 31:25.140
one out of every five,

787
31:25.140 --> 31:28.980
one out every six smartphones is managing their health

788
31:28.980 --> 31:31.343
with the supercomputer in their hand.

789
31:31.343 --> 31:32.910
And and if you think about that,

790
31:32.910 --> 31:34.691
the idea that you could be some small part

791
31:34.691 --> 31:37.530
of either making a billion people live better

792
31:37.530 --> 31:41.040
or live longer, that's how we do it.

793
31:41.040 --> 31:45.030
And if you want like a very bolt, you know,

794
31:45.030 --> 31:47.940
nuts and bolts answer, it's we should build more products.

795
31:47.940 --> 31:49.470
We should take them to the FDA,

796
31:49.470 --> 31:50.460
we should get them regulated.

797
31:50.460 --> 31:51.480
We should launch them.

798
31:51.480 --> 31:52.380
We should build more products.

799
31:52.380 --> 31:55.170
We should take the them to consumers and employers

800
31:55.170 --> 31:56.790
and match to those needs.

801
31:56.790 --> 31:59.910
But the tech is here, the need has never been greater.

802
31:59.910 --> 32:02.013
The pandemic has made the need greater.

803
32:03.421 --> 32:05.190
But you know, it's like being burdened

804
32:05.190 --> 32:07.620
with glorious purpose, right?

805
32:07.620 --> 32:10.870
That's a really fun thing to be doing

806
32:12.155 --> 32:13.740
and it's a really meaningful thing to be doing.

807
32:13.740 --> 32:16.140
And I'll make this one point.

808
32:16.140 --> 32:18.690
If you ever wanna understand the potential

809
32:18.690 --> 32:21.963
of a digital therapeutic, explain it to a child.

810
32:22.890 --> 32:25.560
'Cause they get it the very first time,

811
32:25.560 --> 32:27.390
very first time, right?

812
32:27.390 --> 32:29.010
So the stats that say only 2%

813
32:29.010 --> 32:30.720
of adults are creative geniuses,

814
32:30.720 --> 32:32.940
but 98% of children are,

815
32:32.940 --> 32:35.340
that means that we've closed our minds off

816
32:35.340 --> 32:36.390
to what's possible.

817
32:36.390 --> 32:38.010
We did that, right?

818
32:38.010 --> 32:40.110
But if you can explain to a child

819
32:40.110 --> 32:43.620
how a friend on their phone will make them less scared

820
32:43.620 --> 32:45.750
or a friend on on their phone will make them less sad

821
32:45.750 --> 32:48.270
and it's a medicine that the doctor they really like

822
32:48.270 --> 32:49.950
and they trust gave them,

823
32:49.950 --> 32:52.500
and they get it the very first time you explain it,

824
32:53.790 --> 32:56.103
that means there's an opportunity,

825
32:56.970 --> 32:58.350
<v ->It's a fascinating perspective.</v>

826
32:58.350 --> 33:00.060
And we have our marching orders

827
33:00.060 --> 33:01.230
for the people in the room.

828
33:01.230 --> 33:03.153
We need to make more products,

829
33:04.067 --> 33:05.130
take them to the FDA.

830
33:05.130 --> 33:08.220
I think before we come to some closing remarks,

831
33:08.220 --> 33:11.310
I just really wanna focus in on that point

832
33:11.310 --> 33:13.500
and I think we have some people that are biased

833
33:13.500 --> 33:14.550
with me on stage.

834
33:14.550 --> 33:15.930
We've been hearing a lot about children

835
33:15.930 --> 33:17.790
and the next generation,

836
33:17.790 --> 33:19.110
but where is the need

837
33:19.110 --> 33:21.930
for digital therapeutics greatest?

838
33:21.930 --> 33:25.875
What should we be prioritizing when it comes

839
33:25.875 --> 33:28.860
to addressing the most critical and pressing unmet needs?

840
33:28.860 --> 33:30.900
Patrick, perhaps you can take that.

841
33:30.900 --> 33:32.790
<v ->Yeah, I'll start with one of my favorite quotes</v>

842
33:32.790 --> 33:34.200
by, you know, Einstein

843
33:34.200 --> 33:36.900
and that is "Imagination is more important than knowledge."

844
33:36.900 --> 33:39.120
And that was a pretty smart dude.

845
33:39.120 --> 33:41.940
And I'll also start out with saying, you know,

846
33:41.940 --> 33:43.340
what's the first question that your provider

847
33:43.340 --> 33:45.000
or your doctor should ask you when you come

848
33:45.000 --> 33:47.580
in the, you know, for your visit?

849
33:47.580 --> 33:49.680
You know, how can I help you?

850
33:49.680 --> 33:53.400
And I think when you look at those two statements,

851
33:53.400 --> 33:56.520
the next thing that we have to tackle is a responsibility

852
33:56.520 --> 33:59.610
of creating meaningful products.

853
33:59.610 --> 34:03.270
But I want to really emphasize that we have to design

854
34:03.270 --> 34:06.720
meaningful products that have empathy built within them

855
34:06.720 --> 34:09.330
that are actually listening to what the patients,

856
34:09.330 --> 34:11.040
the customers need.

857
34:11.040 --> 34:12.510
So while we're going out here

858
34:12.510 --> 34:16.650
and we're creating new digital therapeutics,

859
34:16.650 --> 34:18.030
we really need to be cognizant.

860
34:18.030 --> 34:22.170
Are we really answering the question of how can I help you?

861
34:22.170 --> 34:25.260
Are we really addressing the needs of the consumers

862
34:25.260 --> 34:28.050
that that we're taking care of?

863
34:28.050 --> 34:29.190
And I think the first thing you have

864
34:29.190 --> 34:32.100
to do is you honestly have to actively listen

865
34:32.100 --> 34:33.870
and actively design

866
34:33.870 --> 34:36.810
and actively be bold enough to use your imagination.

867
34:36.810 --> 34:38.700
And if you do those things,

868
34:38.700 --> 34:40.800
then you will be contributing

869
34:40.800 --> 34:42.930
to the art of healing and the art of medicine.

870
34:42.930 --> 34:45.678
I think a lot of physicians want to go, again,

871
34:45.678 --> 34:47.760
to not dealing with burnout, but burning out disease.

872
34:47.760 --> 34:49.830
And I think that's a very powerful way to do it.

873
34:49.830 --> 34:51.930
<v ->It's very hard to argue with Einstein.</v>

874
34:51.930 --> 34:53.430
So thank you for that.

875
34:53.430 --> 34:57.270
And thank you all for helping us to navigate this topic

876
34:57.270 --> 34:59.520
so expertly from understanding

877
34:59.520 --> 35:01.620
what digital therapeutics are,

878
35:01.620 --> 35:04.680
why we should be excited right now in this moment

879
35:04.680 --> 35:09.150
as an industry and as consumers and as patients.

880
35:09.150 --> 35:10.440
But also thank you for helping us

881
35:10.440 --> 35:11.670
keep our feet on the ground

882
35:11.670 --> 35:13.980
and and focus on the task ahead.

883
35:13.980 --> 35:16.740
We've heard that there are still a ways to go in terms

884
35:16.740 --> 35:19.350
of the vital issues of reimbursement

885
35:19.350 --> 35:21.093
and adoption and and trust.

886
35:21.970 --> 35:24.450
And I would love to draw today's session to a close

887
35:24.450 --> 35:26.340
with a reflection from each of you

888
35:26.340 --> 35:28.410
and we'll go down the line in terms

889
35:28.410 --> 35:30.600
of what you would like the audience

890
35:30.600 --> 35:33.000
to take away from today's discussion.

891
35:33.000 --> 35:35.637
One thing, please, Ed, we'll start with you.

892
35:35.637 --> 35:40.170
<v ->Yeah, the thing I'd leave you with is I think the best way</v>

893
35:40.170 --> 35:41.240
to think about digital therapeutics

894
35:41.240 --> 35:45.570
and digital medicine is its empathy at scale.

895
35:45.570 --> 35:49.110
And the reason I say that is there is nothing more personal

896
35:49.110 --> 35:53.070
in our life than the supercomputer in our pocket, right?

897
35:53.070 --> 35:53.903
All of us have 'em.

898
35:53.903 --> 35:56.040
And I bet none of us use it the exact same way

899
35:56.040 --> 35:57.810
and none of us have all the same apps.

900
35:57.810 --> 35:59.460
And it's probably the first thing you look

901
35:59.460 --> 36:01.860
at when you wake up. I mean, I try to look at my wife first,

902
36:01.860 --> 36:04.050
but I probably look at my phone.

903
36:04.050 --> 36:05.280
And it's definitely the last

904
36:05.280 --> 36:06.750
thing I look at when I go to bed.

905
36:06.750 --> 36:09.990
And so it is this incredibly, incredibly personal thing

906
36:09.990 --> 36:12.240
that is with you all the time.

907
36:12.240 --> 36:15.060
And yet, it is scaled on a level

908
36:15.060 --> 36:18.600
that nothing else has scaled except books.

909
36:18.600 --> 36:19.830
So something

910
36:19.830 --> 36:23.400
that is an individual human experience has scaled

911
36:23.400 --> 36:26.610
on a quantum that only books have.

912
36:26.610 --> 36:30.510
And so to me the idea that you could be hyper-personalized,

913
36:30.510 --> 36:31.590
hyper empathetic,

914
36:31.590 --> 36:34.110
and meet that person in that exact moment,

915
36:34.110 --> 36:37.260
not just 2:00 PM on a Tuesday, but 2:00 AM on a Tuesday.

916
36:37.260 --> 36:39.300
I mean, the way I feel about all

917
36:39.300 --> 36:42.060
of us in this industry is we are authors

918
36:42.060 --> 36:44.280
in the era of Gutenberg.

919
36:44.280 --> 36:46.020
Like something's happened

920
36:46.020 --> 36:49.440
and now just a few people could read what we wrote

921
36:49.440 --> 36:51.780
and now everyone can read what we wrote.

922
36:51.780 --> 36:53.880
And that is a magical time to be alive.

923
36:53.880 --> 36:58.111
And so that's what I want the audience to feel.

924
36:58.111 --> 36:59.310
And for those of you in this industry,

925
36:59.310 --> 37:02.610
all of us on this panel, I'm grateful,

926
37:02.610 --> 37:04.353
'cause I have a little girl that's gonna live in the world

927
37:04.353 --> 37:06.600
that we either build or don't build,

928
37:06.600 --> 37:07.800
and I think we are gonna build it,

929
37:07.800 --> 37:10.020
which is gonna be a better world.

930
37:10.020 --> 37:12.630
<v ->Fantastic, absolutely a new frontier.</v>

931
37:12.630 --> 37:15.213
Jeff, your one takeaway please.

932
37:18.000 --> 37:19.473
<v ->It's hard to follow Ed.</v>

933
37:21.000 --> 37:23.040
He's one of the OGs of this space

934
37:23.040 --> 37:25.090
and it's an honor to be on stage with him

935
37:26.420 --> 37:28.870
and sort of hearing his inspirational words here.

936
37:29.940 --> 37:33.363
My one takeaway is, I think,

937
37:34.896 --> 37:36.240
is if you're building digital therapeutics

938
37:36.240 --> 37:38.400
and you're investing in digital therapeutics,

939
37:38.400 --> 37:41.613
really focus on solving a problem that matters to patients.

940
37:42.658 --> 37:45.360
And we launched a digital therapeutic at Otsuka

941
37:45.360 --> 37:46.460
in the last six months

942
37:47.689 --> 37:50.250
that is a prescription digital therapeutic

943
37:50.250 --> 37:52.140
that treats depression.

944
37:52.140 --> 37:54.300
And I had to explain it to my child

945
37:54.300 --> 37:56.880
and I said,

946
37:56.880 --> 37:58.590
it's something on your phone

947
37:58.590 --> 38:03.030
that helps make you happy and my kid got it.

948
38:03.030 --> 38:05.553
They said, well that makes a lot of sense.

949
38:07.608 --> 38:09.330
And I think the more that we focus

950
38:09.330 --> 38:12.120
on solving real problems for real people,

951
38:12.120 --> 38:13.900
the better chance we have

952
38:15.468 --> 38:18.120
of seeing that adoption

953
38:18.120 --> 38:19.600
wave take over

954
38:22.503 --> 38:24.660
and really make the phone in our pocket

955
38:24.660 --> 38:26.580
the most powerful piece of healthcare

956
38:26.580 --> 38:28.770
that we interact with on a daily basis.

957
38:28.770 --> 38:30.960
And so I'm really optimistic.

958
38:30.960 --> 38:32.160
Ed said he was more optim,

959
38:32.160 --> 38:34.060
I'm very optimistic about the space

960
38:35.611 --> 38:38.040
and hopeful that we'll see real impact

961
38:38.040 --> 38:41.250
in everyone's life in the coming years.

962
38:41.250 --> 38:42.083
<v ->Fantastic.</v>

963
38:42.083 --> 38:43.530
And Sarah, your reflections,

964
38:43.530 --> 38:46.530
<v ->Certainly this is the stress Olympics, right?</v>

965
38:46.530 --> 38:48.480
And not all of us have trained for it.

966
38:48.480 --> 38:50.940
But we do have some training tools, you know,

967
38:50.940 --> 38:52.950
on our wrists and in headbands

968
38:52.950 --> 38:54.690
and all of these wearables, even sensors,

969
38:54.690 --> 38:57.420
that are coming from the camera that have the ability

970
38:57.420 --> 39:00.510
to allow us to learn to not just track our data

971
39:00.510 --> 39:02.340
but interact with it,

972
39:02.340 --> 39:05.520
create content and develop a relationship with it,

973
39:05.520 --> 39:06.720
not just for patients

974
39:06.720 --> 39:09.300
but for caregivers as well.

975
39:09.300 --> 39:11.094
So important.

976
39:11.094 --> 39:12.870
You reduce stress among the caregivers,

977
39:12.870 --> 39:14.730
you increase and you make them

978
39:14.730 --> 39:17.010
make better management decisions.

979
39:17.010 --> 39:19.920
You reduce the likelihood of heirs

980
39:19.920 --> 39:22.590
and increase safety, reduce liability.

981
39:22.590 --> 39:26.700
And so I think going forward, mental health, you know,

982
39:26.700 --> 39:29.340
to me to answer your question,

983
39:29.340 --> 39:33.750
is a paramount need, not only with the lack of therapists.

984
39:33.750 --> 39:36.780
You know, there are 8 million children right now

985
39:36.780 --> 39:40.440
out in the world that lack access to school counselors.

986
39:40.440 --> 39:42.670
77% of counties

987
39:43.646 --> 39:45.996
are in a mental health therapist shortage zone.

988
39:47.000 --> 39:48.240
So we need to have some drugless,

989
39:48.240 --> 39:52.050
non-harmful coping mechanisms for that stress Olympics.

990
39:52.050 --> 39:55.410
And that starts not just with mental health interventions

991
39:55.410 --> 39:57.000
and digital therapeutics,

992
39:57.000 --> 39:59.880
but before that with the digiceuticals

993
39:59.880 --> 40:03.060
and the mental fitness that is teaching you

994
40:03.060 --> 40:05.400
to train your mind,

995
40:05.400 --> 40:08.430
just as you would train your physical body.

996
40:08.430 --> 40:11.250
And that begins with not just teaching people

997
40:11.250 --> 40:12.690
how to calm down,

998
40:12.690 --> 40:15.900
but actually allowing them to see their data,

999
40:15.900 --> 40:18.960
see their own brain patterns and heart rate,

1000
40:18.960 --> 40:20.520
in near real time,

1001
40:20.520 --> 40:21.840
something personified

1002
40:21.840 --> 40:25.503
as a stress animal that they can learn to control.

1003
40:26.625 --> 40:28.860
And I think the more that consumers

1004
40:28.860 --> 40:32.082
as well as providers are educated about,

1005
40:32.082 --> 40:34.410
you know, the ability to see their feelings,

1006
40:34.410 --> 40:36.340
the easier it's going to be for them

1007
40:37.234 --> 40:40.134
to learn to self-regulate in this mental health emergency.

1008
40:41.430 --> 40:43.170
<v ->All of you have have talked about the next generation</v>

1009
40:43.170 --> 40:45.150
as being absolutely intrinsic

1010
40:45.150 --> 40:47.490
and embedded with digital therapeutics.

1011
40:47.490 --> 40:50.070
It's been a great through line through through all of this.

1012
40:50.070 --> 40:53.460
Patrick, if I can come to you for final remarks?

1013
40:53.460 --> 40:54.293
<v ->Yeah, sure.</v>

1014
40:54.293 --> 40:56.400
So I'll say this as a pediatric surgeon

1015
40:56.400 --> 40:57.810
and a clinical informaticist

1016
40:57.810 --> 41:00.600
and somebody that uses robotic technology

1017
41:00.600 --> 41:02.850
and virtual reality as a digital therapeutic.

1018
41:03.870 --> 41:07.560
The first thing, you know, we all have had a family member

1019
41:07.560 --> 41:10.170
that's been in the hospital, a child that's been sick,

1020
41:10.170 --> 41:12.450
a family member that we have to take care of,

1021
41:12.450 --> 41:15.000
or struggling with our own health issues,

1022
41:15.000 --> 41:17.430
and what is it that we really want?

1023
41:17.430 --> 41:18.630
I think at the end of the day,

1024
41:18.630 --> 41:21.270
no matter what product you design,

1025
41:21.270 --> 41:23.910
you want somebody to actually ask you, you know,

1026
41:23.910 --> 41:25.770
how can I help you?

1027
41:25.770 --> 41:30.090
And you want a tailored solution that can actually help you

1028
41:30.090 --> 41:32.520
deal with whatever health ailment

1029
41:32.520 --> 41:35.100
or issue that you're challenged with.

1030
41:35.100 --> 41:37.650
So I think digital therapeutics actually gives us

1031
41:37.650 --> 41:41.040
the opportunity, again, for all the designers, you know,

1032
41:41.040 --> 41:42.090
that are here.

1033
41:42.090 --> 41:43.590
Or if you don't have a designer on your team,

1034
41:43.590 --> 41:45.540
you should have a designer on your team.

1035
41:45.540 --> 41:47.640
'cause they will actually help you build products

1036
41:47.640 --> 41:49.500
effectively and efficiently,

1037
41:49.500 --> 41:53.220
because I think they ask the question, how can I help you?

1038
41:53.220 --> 41:55.050
What is it that you need?

1039
41:55.050 --> 41:57.910
And when we're trying to tackle this enormous problem

1040
41:59.165 --> 42:01.440
of like making healthcare, you know, meaningful

1041
42:01.440 --> 42:03.990
or making healthcare interpretable,

1042
42:03.990 --> 42:04.830
I think the power

1043
42:04.830 --> 42:07.773
of the imagination is what we really need to unleash.

1044
42:09.517 --> 42:10.890
So my final takeaway would be,

1045
42:10.890 --> 42:12.600
is as we're creating these products

1046
42:12.600 --> 42:13.680
that are gonna help change

1047
42:13.680 --> 42:16.620
the healthcare ecosystem and save lives,

1048
42:16.620 --> 42:19.080
don't be afraid to use your imagination

1049
42:19.080 --> 42:22.020
and don't be afraid to partner with other people

1050
42:22.020 --> 42:24.120
that can really drill down the question

1051
42:24.120 --> 42:26.580
of what do we really need to create

1052
42:26.580 --> 42:28.830
to generate the greatest impact.

1053
42:28.830 --> 42:29.850
<v ->Fantastic, thank you.</v>

1054
42:29.850 --> 42:33.060
Don't be afraid to use your imagination.

1055
42:33.060 --> 42:34.050
Well, I've learned a lot.

1056
42:34.050 --> 42:35.520
I hope that the audience have to,

1057
42:35.520 --> 42:37.710
I'd like to thank all of my panelists,

1058
42:37.710 --> 42:39.930
not just for their contribution to the discussion,

1059
42:39.930 --> 42:42.720
but to a really exciting industry.

1060
42:42.720 --> 42:44.220
Your fantastic work.

1061
42:44.220 --> 42:47.730
And I hope that you have a fantastic rest of your CES.

1062
42:47.730 --> 42:48.563
Thank you all.

1063
42:49.893 --> 42:50.726
(people clapping)

1064
42:50.726 --> 42:53.309
(upbeat music)
