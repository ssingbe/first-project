00:00.734 --> 00:03.317
(lively music)

00:10.830 --> 00:15.660
<v ->All right. Well, good morning and welcome to CES 2025.</v>

00:16.980 --> 00:18.690
I'm Mike Oitzman.

00:18.690 --> 00:21.210
I'm senior editor for The Robot Report,

00:21.210 --> 00:25.230
co-host and producer of "The Robot Report Podcast."

00:25.230 --> 00:28.680
If you love robotics and love hearing about industry,

00:28.680 --> 00:31.650
hearing from industry folks in the industry,

00:31.650 --> 00:35.280
I encourage you to download an episode for your flight home

00:35.280 --> 00:37.680
and stay up to date with what's going on

00:37.680 --> 00:39.810
in the robotics industry.

00:39.810 --> 00:41.040
I love my job

00:41.040 --> 00:44.400
because I get to talk to interesting people all day

00:44.400 --> 00:47.133
and help amplify the stories that are,

00:47.970 --> 00:50.970
you know, on the cutting edge of robotics and innovation.

00:50.970 --> 00:53.970
And so I'm excited to be here this morning at CES

00:53.970 --> 00:57.630
not only to see all of the innovation on the showfloor,

00:57.630 --> 00:58.890
and there's lots of that,

00:58.890 --> 01:02.010
so I hope you guys are, you know,

01:02.010 --> 01:05.010
excited to see what is going on there.

01:05.010 --> 01:07.020
But more than that, I'm excited to be on stage

01:07.020 --> 01:10.350
with this incredible cast of individuals,

01:10.350 --> 01:13.500
who all have some very industry-leading stories

01:13.500 --> 01:14.580
to talk about.

01:14.580 --> 01:19.020
So let's get going because I know they've got a lot to say.

01:19.020 --> 01:21.131
And so I'm gonna ask each of them

01:21.131 --> 01:23.130
to introduce themselves individually

01:23.130 --> 01:26.400
as we go along here with the first question.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.440
And so you'll get to know who they are.

01:28.440 --> 01:31.170
And, Sally, I'm gonna start with you.

01:31.170 --> 01:32.787
So please introduce yourself

01:32.787 --> 01:35.940
and tell us what emerging technologies and trends

01:35.940 --> 01:37.680
you're seeing that are shaping the future

01:37.680 --> 01:39.750
of robotics and automation at DHL.

01:39.750 --> 01:41.940
<v ->Sure. Thanks, Mike.</v>

01:41.940 --> 01:46.230
My name is Sally Miller. I'm with DHL.

01:46.230 --> 01:48.570
I would ask for a raise of hands

01:48.570 --> 01:52.440
but I can't see any of you, because the lights are bright,

01:52.440 --> 01:54.970
but I'm sure you're a customer

01:56.106 --> 01:58.200
of one of our divisions at some point.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.813
So DHL has five divisions.

02:02.490 --> 02:06.750
We run the postal business for Germany,

02:06.750 --> 02:08.430
we have a forwarding business

02:08.430 --> 02:12.210
where we move freight between continents,

02:12.210 --> 02:17.210
and we are the largest time-definite parcel provider

02:17.670 --> 02:19.950
outside the US.

02:19.950 --> 02:23.610
And then we have a newer division called e-commerce,

02:23.610 --> 02:27.330
which inserts packages less than five pounds

02:27.330 --> 02:31.320
into the postal system of a couple of different countries.

02:31.320 --> 02:33.390
And then we have the supply chain division,

02:33.390 --> 02:34.830
which is the division I'm in,

02:34.830 --> 02:38.460
and we provide warehousing and transportation

02:38.460 --> 02:41.133
and value added services to companies.

02:42.150 --> 02:46.050
We service several market verticals.

02:46.050 --> 02:50.850
And I bring this up in the context of the conversation today

02:50.850 --> 02:55.110
of what, you know, are the emerging trends

02:55.110 --> 02:58.023
and things that are important to our business.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.650
We have over 55,000 hourly associates

03:04.650 --> 03:06.840
across the US and Canada.

03:06.840 --> 03:11.430
And we have a high dependency on hourly labor

03:11.430 --> 03:16.430
to provide service to our customers and our sites,

03:16.740 --> 03:20.250
we have about 500 across the US and Canada.

03:20.250 --> 03:24.210
And so what we're seeing and what we're focused on

03:24.210 --> 03:29.210
are trends that can help our operations be more efficient

03:29.340 --> 03:32.310
and reduce our dependency on hourly labor.

03:32.310 --> 03:35.820
So we look at robotics,

03:35.820 --> 03:40.650
mainly assisted robotics that work with people

03:40.650 --> 03:45.480
to help make the more mundane, non-value added activities

03:45.480 --> 03:50.480
easier, reduce travel time, make the job less stressful.

03:51.600 --> 03:54.120
The second thing is autonomous material

03:54.120 --> 03:55.350
and handling equipment.

03:55.350 --> 04:00.350
So autonomous forklift trucks are of interest to us.

04:00.420 --> 04:03.570
And also AI in several forms.

04:03.570 --> 04:07.560
And I know it's highly overused lately,

04:07.560 --> 04:11.700
but gen AI, we're doing a lot of use cases

04:11.700 --> 04:16.700
and back office activities, including IT development,

04:16.740 --> 04:21.207
data mapping, generating documents,

04:22.620 --> 04:25.230
you know, like most large organizations.

04:25.230 --> 04:28.800
And DHL, I believe, is the 15th largest

04:28.800 --> 04:30.300
private employer in the world.

04:30.300 --> 04:35.280
We generate a lot of legal documents, associate documents,

04:35.280 --> 04:37.740
and documents to suppliers and customers.

04:37.740 --> 04:42.390
And those are all very nice use cases for gen AI.

04:42.390 --> 04:45.900
We're also using AI machine learning

04:45.900 --> 04:48.300
to take data from different systems

04:48.300 --> 04:51.510
that we utilize in our operations

04:51.510 --> 04:55.380
to make our core activities more efficient.

04:55.380 --> 04:57.930
So there's a lot going on.

04:57.930 --> 05:00.123
It's a fun time to be in IT.

05:02.067 --> 05:05.820
I think after years of reporting uptime statistics

05:05.820 --> 05:10.020
and, you know, number of applications deployed,

05:10.020 --> 05:13.560
we're really focused on driving innovation

05:13.560 --> 05:17.640
and changing how things are done in the industry.

05:17.640 --> 05:21.900
So that's a bit about me and my focus.

05:21.900 --> 05:23.280
<v ->Well, thanks for that.</v>

05:23.280 --> 05:25.440
Jay, same question to you.

05:25.440 --> 05:26.430
Please introduce yourself,

05:26.430 --> 05:29.010
tell us what emerging technologies you foresee

05:29.010 --> 05:32.460
shaping the future of robotics and automation at Oshkosh.

05:32.460 --> 05:34.080
<v ->Yeah, good morning. Can you hear me?</v>

05:34.080 --> 05:35.490
Okay.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

05:35.490 --> 05:36.323
<v ->Good morning.</v>

05:36.323 --> 05:38.970
As an introduction, my name is Jay Iyengar.

05:38.970 --> 05:40.410
I'm the chief technology

05:40.410 --> 05:43.503
and strategic sourcing officer for Oshkosh Corporation.

05:44.850 --> 05:46.833
As an introduction to Oshkosh,

05:48.308 --> 05:51.450
you know, we are an industrial technology company

05:51.450 --> 05:54.840
who've been around since 1917.

05:54.840 --> 05:56.070
The company was founded

05:56.070 --> 05:59.223
on innovation for mobility since 1917.

06:00.720 --> 06:03.360
What our products, what we work on

06:03.360 --> 06:06.663
is we use the term everyday heroes,

06:07.500 --> 06:10.233
those who move the world forward, right?

06:12.621 --> 06:15.483
We couldn't exist without them, as an example.

06:16.470 --> 06:20.973
Everyday heroes are, you know, people that work daily,

06:22.358 --> 06:24.810
your refuse collection, your firefighters,

06:24.810 --> 06:27.540
people that deliver your mail,

06:27.540 --> 06:29.913
people that actually serve the military,

06:31.020 --> 06:33.330
people that work in construction.

06:33.330 --> 06:37.320
So these are all the people that, everyday heroes.

06:37.320 --> 06:40.110
And all our products and technology

06:40.110 --> 06:41.670
serve those everyday heroes.

06:41.670 --> 06:44.670
As an example, we have, you know, firefighting,

06:44.670 --> 06:47.040
we have, you know, firefighting equipment,

06:47.040 --> 06:50.190
which is fire trucks both for, you know,

06:50.190 --> 06:52.713
residential, commercial use, as well as airports.

06:53.790 --> 06:58.790
We have, you know, equipment around the airport itself,

07:00.540 --> 07:03.360
such as ground support equipment around the airport itself,

07:03.360 --> 07:05.490
people that work on the tarmac.

07:05.490 --> 07:09.960
Chances are if you flew in, you know, to this event

07:09.960 --> 07:11.520
in the last couple of days,

07:11.520 --> 07:13.170
you probably got on the jet bridge,

07:13.170 --> 07:14.913
which was an Oshkosh jet bridge.

07:15.870 --> 07:18.120
That's an example of another one of the everyday heroes

07:18.120 --> 07:19.500
that I talked about, right?

07:19.500 --> 07:20.880
People that collect your refuse.

07:20.880 --> 07:24.750
We do have refuse and recycling collection trucks.

07:24.750 --> 07:27.630
So we are a vehicle manufacturer,

07:27.630 --> 07:30.090
we are a technology provider.

07:30.090 --> 07:32.580
And, again, the common theme that ties it together

07:32.580 --> 07:34.293
is this everyday heroes theme.

07:35.280 --> 07:40.280
And what we do is we apply technology

07:40.350 --> 07:45.350
to address both spoken and unspoken needs of our customers.

07:45.750 --> 07:48.480
By the way, these jobs are very difficult jobs.

07:48.480 --> 07:50.190
These aren't something that,

07:50.190 --> 07:53.850
you know, many times it's tendency to take it for granted.

07:53.850 --> 07:55.590
As an example, your refuse collection,

07:55.590 --> 07:56.820
your garbage collection job

07:56.820 --> 07:59.670
is the seventh most dangerous job in the country

07:59.670 --> 08:01.500
according to Department of Labor,

08:01.500 --> 08:04.740
because they have to climb in and out of the vehicles.

08:04.740 --> 08:08.850
They actually, on average, do 24,000 steps a day.

08:08.850 --> 08:11.193
So these are very, very difficult jobs.

08:12.120 --> 08:14.430
It takes time for somebody to learn

08:14.430 --> 08:16.410
how to actually drive the vehicle,

08:16.410 --> 08:18.600
park it right next to your garbage can

08:18.600 --> 08:21.960
and deploy the arm and using the joystick

08:21.960 --> 08:25.560
and collect it, you know, and dump it back into the trucks,

08:25.560 --> 08:28.173
and that repetitive task frequently.

08:29.880 --> 08:33.180
Those kind of things, there's opportunities that we see

08:33.180 --> 08:36.930
in terms of technology, how the technology can apply

08:36.930 --> 08:40.830
to make those jobs more efficient,

08:40.830 --> 08:43.170
more productive, and safer.

08:43.170 --> 08:44.640
So that's what we focus on,

08:44.640 --> 08:48.750
is we have, you know, automation, autonomous technologies,

08:48.750 --> 08:50.580
we use it at moments of autonomy.

08:50.580 --> 08:53.160
You don't really need a completely driverless vehicle,

08:53.160 --> 08:54.930
but there's a lot we could do

08:54.930 --> 08:59.930
to make those difficult jobs easier, efficient, et cetera.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.330
Another example is your jet bridge.

09:03.330 --> 09:05.880
How many times have you been stuck on an aircraft

09:05.880 --> 09:09.690
because don't you know that your jet bridge didn't deploy

09:09.690 --> 09:12.300
or a person that was supposed to deploy the jet bridge

09:12.300 --> 09:13.893
wasn't available, right?

09:15.162 --> 09:17.310
That's an example of something we are working on,

09:17.310 --> 09:18.450
you know, automating it

09:18.450 --> 09:20.820
so that there is an autonomous jet dock

09:20.820 --> 09:24.030
where the dock identifies an aircraft

09:24.030 --> 09:26.340
and actually, you know, automatically moves,

09:26.340 --> 09:29.100
identifies the aircraft and the door of the aircraft

09:29.100 --> 09:31.080
and automatically it deploys itself.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.240
So get very, very close to the door.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.990
So there a lot of opportunities there in applying AI,

09:36.990 --> 09:39.660
you know, advanced sensing and robotics

09:39.660 --> 09:43.230
to really make those difficult jobs easier.

09:43.230 --> 09:44.063
At the end of the day,

09:44.063 --> 09:46.650
making it very productive for our customers,

09:46.650 --> 09:48.840
providing them both, you know, financial benefits

09:48.840 --> 09:51.660
and overall total cost ownership benefits.

09:51.660 --> 09:53.910
<v ->Yeah, some great examples of everyday automation</v>

09:53.910 --> 09:56.361
that we don't think about.

09:56.361 --> 09:57.194
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
<v ->We're interacting with</v>

09:57.194 --> 09:58.773
or interacting with parts of our lives.

09:59.769 --> 10:01.170
<v ->Absolutely.</v>
<v ->So thanks for sharing that.</v>

10:01.170 --> 10:03.600
Andrew, I'm gonna ask you to go next.

10:03.600 --> 10:06.100
Now, you're the entrepreneur on the panel here

10:07.140 --> 10:10.560
and you're developing a new robotic system.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.570
So tell us a bit about your journey

10:12.570 --> 10:14.550
and how you've come to evaluate

10:14.550 --> 10:16.620
the opportunities for automation in robotics

10:16.620 --> 10:18.360
in the markets that you're serving.

10:18.360 --> 10:20.460
<v ->Sure. First of all, thank you.</v>

10:20.460 --> 10:21.780
I'm very happy to be here.

10:21.780 --> 10:23.400
I love what I do and I'm grateful

10:23.400 --> 10:25.500
to get to share a little bit more about it.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.090
I'm the founder of Lucid Bots,

10:27.090 --> 10:29.550
and we focus on extending human reach

10:29.550 --> 10:32.880
by building robots that do dangerous and demanding jobs.

10:32.880 --> 10:35.370
Currently, we're focused on exterior cleaning.

10:35.370 --> 10:36.900
And we have customers around the world

10:36.900 --> 10:39.090
doing anything from cleaning office windows

10:39.090 --> 10:42.930
to industrial water tanks, all the way to stadium domes.

10:42.930 --> 10:44.910
On average, it's about two times faster

10:44.910 --> 10:46.080
than traditional methods

10:46.080 --> 10:48.900
and you're not suspending human workers from lifts,

10:48.900 --> 10:50.370
ladder, scaffolds.

10:50.370 --> 10:53.100
You're able to relocate them to the ground.

10:53.100 --> 10:56.040
And there are three fundamental beliefs about the future

10:56.040 --> 10:58.890
that really guide how we think about our business.

10:58.890 --> 11:03.840
The first is there's this world of dirty, dangerous jobs

11:03.840 --> 11:07.170
where robots are primed to step in and be helpful.

11:07.170 --> 11:09.690
And the second is these robots, we feel,

11:09.690 --> 11:11.790
really need to be built domestically

11:11.790 --> 11:14.070
as we think about our own economic resilience,

11:14.070 --> 11:16.590
national security, and data privacy.

11:16.590 --> 11:17.490
And the third belief

11:17.490 --> 11:19.980
is everything that moves will be automated.

11:19.980 --> 11:23.250
And that combination of robotics and automation

11:23.250 --> 11:26.460
is what can unlock a world of prosperity.

11:26.460 --> 11:29.520
And to tell a little bit of a story of how we began,

11:29.520 --> 11:33.660
I had a very unusual journey into the robotics world.

11:33.660 --> 11:36.690
I originally went to Davidson College to play baseball,

11:36.690 --> 11:39.270
and I was majoring in the highly relevant fields

11:39.270 --> 11:41.280
of economics and Spanish.

11:41.280 --> 11:44.220
And it was a fall windy day of my junior year

11:44.220 --> 11:47.520
and I saw these window washers cleaning large building

11:47.520 --> 11:50.220
and the platform they were on got caught in the wind,

11:50.220 --> 11:52.410
started slamming against the building.

11:52.410 --> 11:53.850
And you saw the workers up there

11:53.850 --> 11:57.420
just white knuckling the rails, hanging on for dear life.

11:57.420 --> 12:00.510
And I just asked what seemed like an obvious question:

12:00.510 --> 12:03.870
how can we leverage technology to make this job safer,

12:03.870 --> 12:05.670
to make it more efficient?

12:05.670 --> 12:08.610
And I looked around me at all of these buildings

12:08.610 --> 12:10.560
and I realized we're building more buildings,

12:10.560 --> 12:12.810
they're getting larger, more complex

12:12.810 --> 12:15.750
yet we've got less and less people willing to do the work,

12:15.750 --> 12:18.630
which represents just an enormous opportunity

12:18.630 --> 12:21.333
to introduce robotics and automation.

12:22.237 --> 12:24.720
And in terms of how we think about it at Lucid Bots,

12:24.720 --> 12:26.160
again, we're a little bit unique

12:26.160 --> 12:29.340
versus the traditional robotics world.

12:29.340 --> 12:31.740
Firstly, for the last several decades,

12:31.740 --> 12:32.940
we've been building robots

12:32.940 --> 12:36.810
but primarily for the factory settings and warehouses.

12:36.810 --> 12:38.130
And the way we think about this

12:38.130 --> 12:40.230
is static environment robots,

12:40.230 --> 12:42.930
one robot on the same job site every day,

12:42.930 --> 12:44.850
sometimes literally bolted to the floor

12:44.850 --> 12:46.503
where the work comes to it.

12:47.663 --> 12:50.070
In our world, we focus on dynamic robots,

12:50.070 --> 12:53.370
robots that operate on a different job site every day

12:53.370 --> 12:54.897
and they actually go to work.

12:54.897 --> 12:56.310
And the second big difference

12:56.310 --> 12:58.650
is just how we approached our business.

12:58.650 --> 13:00.900
We weren't originally a team of researchers

13:00.900 --> 13:03.930
looking to expand some foundational technology.

13:03.930 --> 13:08.220
What we saw was a real world, everyday expensive problem,

13:08.220 --> 13:10.920
and we wanted to focus on solving that problem

13:10.920 --> 13:13.890
and delivering customer value as quickly as possible

13:13.890 --> 13:15.903
as we now look to continue expanding.

13:17.790 --> 13:20.220
<v ->Yeah, that's a great story and thanks for sharing.</v>

13:20.220 --> 13:21.900
And, again, it speaks to the fact

13:21.900 --> 13:24.990
that anybody in this room could start their own journey

13:24.990 --> 13:28.230
by recognizing a problem that could be automated,

13:28.230 --> 13:30.933
a dull, dangerous, dirty job,

13:31.898 --> 13:34.290
and, you know, helping to make society better.

13:34.290 --> 13:38.640
And I think, again, that is on display on the floor here

13:38.640 --> 13:41.310
from all of these companies that are displaying here,

13:41.310 --> 13:42.510
their own technologies

13:42.510 --> 13:45.540
that are impacting consumers' lives, right?

13:45.540 --> 13:49.080
So the last individual I wanna introduce you to is Rahul.

13:49.080 --> 13:53.160
And he works for an organization.

13:53.160 --> 13:56.100
If you're in the industry, you'll recognize the name.

13:56.100 --> 13:58.797
But, Rahul, tell us a little bit about who you are

13:58.797 --> 14:00.810
and what Siemens is doing.

14:00.810 --> 14:03.450
<v ->Yeah, happy to be here. I'm Rahul Garg.</v>

14:03.450 --> 14:05.670
I lead the global business

14:05.670 --> 14:09.180
for our industrial machinery manufacturers,

14:09.180 --> 14:12.780
companies that make machines, companies that build robots,

14:12.780 --> 14:17.780
companies that make equipment that enable their customers

14:17.820 --> 14:20.940
to manufacture in their factories.

14:20.940 --> 14:24.600
So as part of my job, I have the good fortune

14:24.600 --> 14:27.540
to work with companies who are driving innovation

14:27.540 --> 14:29.490
inside their factories.

14:29.490 --> 14:34.490
And at Siemens, we enable a lot of the automation

14:34.770 --> 14:36.850
inside a factory and we also enable

14:38.188 --> 14:39.480
a lot of the development of the products

14:39.480 --> 14:41.280
that are gonna be built in the factories.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.440
We have a extensive industrial

14:43.440 --> 14:46.020
software business application as well.

14:46.020 --> 14:48.600
So as part of what we are trying to do

14:48.600 --> 14:53.600
is drive this whole notion of a comprehensive digital twin.

14:54.390 --> 14:57.360
Now, most of you may have heard the idea of a digital twin

14:57.360 --> 15:00.270
and you think of it as a product,

15:00.270 --> 15:01.530
and the digital twin of the product.

15:01.530 --> 15:04.290
But when I'm referring to the comprehensive digital twin,

15:04.290 --> 15:07.050
a physics-based digital twin, we try and extend that

15:07.050 --> 15:10.470
throughout the entire lifecycle of the product,

15:10.470 --> 15:13.020
from the time it is designed, engineered

15:13.020 --> 15:15.150
to the time it's manufactured,

15:15.150 --> 15:18.090
and to the time it's serviced and supported as well.

15:18.090 --> 15:21.990
And we think bringing that digital twin,

15:21.990 --> 15:24.180
comprehensive digital twin capability

15:24.180 --> 15:27.270
and combining it closer to the physical world

15:27.270 --> 15:30.480
will allow you to do some very useful things

15:30.480 --> 15:34.080
in optimizing your business processes,

15:34.080 --> 15:36.720
helping you ask very difficult questions

15:36.720 --> 15:39.900
and meet your many challenging demands.

15:39.900 --> 15:42.180
So as part of that whole digital twin

15:42.180 --> 15:43.590
and the comprehensive digital twin,

15:43.590 --> 15:47.403
we enable the digital twin of a factory as well.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.850
And inside the digital twin of a factory,

15:50.850 --> 15:55.830
we think in terms of how to harmonize

15:55.830 --> 15:57.570
and build the entire process

15:57.570 --> 16:00.300
for what you're gonna be building inside a factory.

16:00.300 --> 16:02.070
And inside a factory, you've got equipment,

16:02.070 --> 16:04.500
you've got robots, you've got humans.

16:04.500 --> 16:08.610
So how do you get all of that to work in a seamless manner?

16:08.610 --> 16:11.970
And as part of that whole process through a digital twin,

16:11.970 --> 16:14.100
we can enable you to look

16:14.100 --> 16:16.080
at how the machine would be functioning,

16:16.080 --> 16:18.510
what are the speeds that you would be needing

16:18.510 --> 16:20.130
to work the machine at,

16:20.130 --> 16:22.380
you can look at how the humans would be interacting,

16:22.380 --> 16:24.270
how the robots would be interacting.

16:24.270 --> 16:29.270
So as part of that process, it becomes very critical

16:29.340 --> 16:33.870
that you can evaluate all these capabilities

16:33.870 --> 16:37.740
in a digital way and gives you the freedom

16:37.740 --> 16:40.590
and the flexibility to try out different options,

16:40.590 --> 16:45.390
to try out different scenarios you would want to run,

16:46.890 --> 16:50.160
and make sure that you can design the most flexible,

16:50.160 --> 16:55.110
the most optimal production facility

16:55.110 --> 16:57.420
and get the necessary output

16:57.420 --> 16:59.040
that you would want from your factory.

16:59.040 --> 17:00.513
<v ->Yeah.</v>

17:00.513 --> 17:02.160
And I think the interesting thing about digital twins,

17:02.160 --> 17:05.490
and there's been a lot of news this week about,

17:05.490 --> 17:07.980
you know, simulation in the real world

17:07.980 --> 17:09.933
and in the virtual world,

17:10.890 --> 17:14.430
the idea that you can create an entire factory line,

17:14.430 --> 17:16.200
a process manufacturing

17:16.200 --> 17:21.200
or a typical labor-based manufacturing line

17:21.657 --> 17:25.650
and actually change the parameters parametrically

17:25.650 --> 17:26.610
and see the output,

17:26.610 --> 17:30.240
see how the KPIs change is just incredible.

17:30.240 --> 17:32.670
And it helps close the loop that much faster

17:32.670 --> 17:34.920
on the rights answer.

17:34.920 --> 17:35.820
<v ->It does, it does.</v>

17:35.820 --> 17:39.450
And in fact, and bringing in a lot of AI capabilities

17:39.450 --> 17:42.480
into the digital twin, allowing you to simulate

17:42.480 --> 17:44.700
a lot more variables that you did not have

17:44.700 --> 17:46.383
at your hand before.
<v ->Right.</v>

17:47.940 --> 17:52.560
Well, having made it through 2024,

17:52.560 --> 17:54.300
the big hype for us last year

17:54.300 --> 17:57.270
in the robotics industry was humanoids.

17:57.270 --> 18:00.993
The big question of course was what are they gonna do?

18:01.950 --> 18:04.050
As a journalist, I'm a skeptic,

18:04.050 --> 18:06.750
that's my job, to be a skeptic,

18:06.750 --> 18:10.920
and I'm still questioning exactly when humanoids

18:10.920 --> 18:13.590
are going to become real or if they're gonna become real.

18:13.590 --> 18:16.170
So I wanted to pull you guys,

18:16.170 --> 18:19.140
and we talked about this before we got on stage here

18:19.140 --> 18:21.240
as one of the most hyped stories.

18:21.240 --> 18:22.500
You know, so there's multiple vendors

18:22.500 --> 18:23.460
on the showfloor today.

18:23.460 --> 18:27.090
You're gonna see opportunities to interact with humanoids.

18:27.090 --> 18:29.583
They're getting better every quarter.

18:30.930 --> 18:31.950
From the capabilities,

18:31.950 --> 18:34.740
but the question remains is there work for them to do?

18:34.740 --> 18:37.870
And it's this question of general purpose automation

18:38.880 --> 18:41.580
versus specific purpose automation.

18:41.580 --> 18:42.750
Purpose-built automation,

18:42.750 --> 18:44.430
automation like an industrial robot

18:44.430 --> 18:48.390
that does one welding operation a thousand times a day

18:48.390 --> 18:50.310
versus a general purpose automation

18:50.310 --> 18:54.540
that can do many different tasks and change it up.

18:54.540 --> 18:58.740
So having said that, it seems that labor availability

18:58.740 --> 19:00.660
has been one of the key things

19:00.660 --> 19:03.120
that both the venture capital community sees

19:03.120 --> 19:05.070
as an opportunity here,

19:05.070 --> 19:07.170
why they've invested some large sums of money

19:07.170 --> 19:09.750
in some humanoid companies this last two years.

19:09.750 --> 19:13.170
And so I wanted to ask you guys your thoughts

19:13.170 --> 19:15.780
about the reality in future for humanoids,

19:15.780 --> 19:18.739
whether you believe it's a good thing or a bad thing.

19:18.739 --> 19:20.430
And so I'm asking you to go on a record a bit here.

19:20.430 --> 19:22.340
So, Sally, I'm gonna start with you

19:22.340 --> 19:24.960
'cause I know you are in charge of a program

19:24.960 --> 19:28.260
that actually evaluates new technology

19:28.260 --> 19:29.840
for the use cases.
<v Sally>Yes.</v>

19:29.840 --> 19:31.590
<v ->So tell us a little bit about your experience</v>

19:31.590 --> 19:33.000
with the humanoid world.

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
<v ->So humanoids are a vision of roboticists</v>

19:40.800 --> 19:45.573
and well-financed friends, I would say.

19:47.160 --> 19:51.840
In supply chain in a warehouse,

19:51.840 --> 19:55.170
you don't need a robot to have legs.

19:55.170 --> 19:59.220
In fact, if they have a stronger base

19:59.220 --> 20:04.050
that has a battery pack, they can operate for more hours.

20:04.050 --> 20:06.360
And I'm a firm believer

20:06.360 --> 20:10.110
in that what you deploy in the warehouse

20:10.110 --> 20:13.050
should look like its intended use.

20:13.050 --> 20:16.140
And I'm taking that quote from Rodney Brooks,

20:16.140 --> 20:19.410
who invented the Roomba, which we all have,

20:19.410 --> 20:20.860
especially if you have a dog.

20:22.110 --> 20:25.080
And there is a human element

20:25.080 --> 20:27.300
in everything that we've talked about

20:27.300 --> 20:29.310
while we've introduced ourselves.

20:29.310 --> 20:32.340
And, you know, I have to wonder,

20:32.340 --> 20:36.006
would you wanna be working next to,

20:36.006 --> 20:39.900
you know, something that looked outta "Star Wars" every day

20:39.900 --> 20:44.900
or a robot with a nice screen, interactive lights

20:45.690 --> 20:50.553
that was designed for the use case it was intended?

20:51.930 --> 20:55.740
My hope, because I'm an optimistic person,

20:55.740 --> 20:59.670
is that there are, you know, products

20:59.670 --> 21:04.380
that come out of the huge investment in humanoids

21:04.380 --> 21:08.730
that can be leveraged for the use cases

21:08.730 --> 21:13.730
in what we do in warehouses, which is receive product,

21:13.977 --> 21:17.370
put it away, pick it, package it, and ship it out.

21:17.370 --> 21:22.370
And I really don't think it will be very well received

21:24.052 --> 21:26.903
in the look and feel in the warehouse.

21:26.903 --> 21:27.990
There's a lot of sensitivities

21:27.990 --> 21:31.650
to robots taking over humans' jobs.

21:31.650 --> 21:33.450
And I think if you design a robot

21:33.450 --> 21:35.730
that looks just like a human,

21:35.730 --> 21:40.680
you're looking for some problem with the labor force

21:40.680 --> 21:44.790
that we're desperately trying to attract, retain, and keep

21:44.790 --> 21:46.653
and make as efficient as possible.

21:48.071 --> 21:48.960
<v ->Yeah. Jay, what's your thoughts?</v>

21:48.960 --> 21:52.383
<v ->Yeah, so I agree with comments made by Sally too.</v>

21:53.460 --> 21:54.480
At the end of the day,

21:54.480 --> 21:57.543
if you think of what a humanoid is, right,

21:59.160 --> 22:01.680
what we all do as humans is we sense,

22:01.680 --> 22:03.960
sensing is a really critical part of it.

22:03.960 --> 22:06.390
We perceive sensing, perception,

22:06.390 --> 22:09.153
self-learning, and making decisions, right?

22:11.483 --> 22:12.570
Very simplistically, those are the key elements

22:12.570 --> 22:15.420
of what a humanoid is.

22:15.420 --> 22:17.490
Human form is, you agree with me,

22:17.490 --> 22:20.640
human form is extremely inefficient from an,

22:20.640 --> 22:23.640
you don't wanna mimic something that's inefficient

22:23.640 --> 22:26.850
to do something that you're trying to solve.

22:26.850 --> 22:29.250
Creating a human form just for the sake of it

22:29.250 --> 22:30.210
doesn't do anything.

22:30.210 --> 22:33.279
In our industry, what we are trying to do is,

22:33.279 --> 22:36.030
as I mentioned earlier, is to solve,

22:36.030 --> 22:39.180
there's a lot of low-hanging fruit inefficiencies

22:39.180 --> 22:41.380
as we are looking at the manufacturing floor

22:42.390 --> 22:44.760
or on our own products,

22:44.760 --> 22:48.690
what we could do for the users of our products as well.

22:48.690 --> 22:50.703
I'll just give you maybe one example,

22:51.708 --> 22:55.680
is we are the leaders in access equipment,

22:55.680 --> 22:56.940
people working at height.

22:56.940 --> 22:59.131
If you walk around the building,

22:59.131 --> 23:00.030
you see the JLG machines.

23:00.030 --> 23:02.610
By the way, they're really, really safe.

23:02.610 --> 23:05.400
The platform stays flat at 185 feet.

23:05.400 --> 23:08.070
So there's a lot of technology that goes into it.

23:08.070 --> 23:11.747
But still there's a human being standing up there

23:11.747 --> 23:15.105
that's cleaning the window, or it's used for a lot of,

23:15.105 --> 23:16.200
like welding is another example.

23:16.200 --> 23:19.380
They go there and move materials and they weld.

23:19.380 --> 23:22.620
Sometimes there's two machines, two machines go together

23:22.620 --> 23:25.140
where, you know, the material is carried on one

23:25.140 --> 23:26.730
and the person's on the other one.

23:26.730 --> 23:31.730
So there's a lot of repetitive human parts.

23:32.580 --> 23:34.350
You can even argue to an extent

23:34.350 --> 23:39.240
it is more of mundane type of tasks that are there.

23:39.240 --> 23:42.450
So we call about end-effector humanoids

23:42.450 --> 23:45.480
where you could still have the saw machines

23:45.480 --> 23:48.610
but the last part of the work that they do can be automated

23:49.959 --> 23:51.330
with having an arm that actually,

23:51.330 --> 23:53.880
you know, goes and welds automatically, right,

23:53.880 --> 23:56.880
and then coordinates with another machine

23:56.880 --> 24:00.060
to bring the equipment, bring the materials out there

24:00.060 --> 24:03.030
so that that work can be more efficiently,

24:03.030 --> 24:04.920
whereas human being can move on

24:04.920 --> 24:07.530
to something higher level tasks.

24:07.530 --> 24:10.110
We don't believe in just we have to replace something,

24:10.110 --> 24:13.140
we can augment what people do today

24:13.140 --> 24:15.150
and take out the mundane work,

24:15.150 --> 24:17.280
take out the, you know, potentially unsafe work,

24:17.280 --> 24:20.280
and talked about dangerous environments, et cetera,

24:20.280 --> 24:22.140
but make that more efficient

24:22.140 --> 24:24.270
so that we can move on to some higher level work.

24:24.270 --> 24:28.350
So that's what we focus on from that sense.

24:28.350 --> 24:29.760
We're seeing a lot advancements

24:29.760 --> 24:31.740
in, you know, we use cameras, LiDARs

24:31.740 --> 24:33.480
and, you know, processors.

24:33.480 --> 24:37.530
And AI chips have come a very, very long way.

24:37.530 --> 24:40.833
We saw some announcements this week, yet from Nvidia,

24:41.790 --> 24:44.700
being able to do, we do digital twins today by the way.

24:44.700 --> 24:48.810
We simulate factories, we simulate test environments,

24:48.810 --> 24:50.940
we do some virtual testing

24:50.940 --> 24:52.830
before we do physical testing on our products,

24:52.830 --> 24:55.440
using a lot of Siemens's applications.

24:55.440 --> 25:00.210
But with AI, you can do a lot more scenario planning

25:00.210 --> 25:03.390
you couldn't normally do with today with this thing.

25:03.390 --> 25:07.950
So I think there's a lot of low-hanging fruit opportunities

25:07.950 --> 25:10.170
we need to go after before you design,

25:10.170 --> 25:11.760
before you really wanna mimic

25:11.760 --> 25:14.940
the inefficient human form in a humanoid.

25:14.940 --> 25:16.710
<v ->Yeah, if you listen to the podcast,</v>

25:16.710 --> 25:18.690
Steve, my co-host, we talk often

25:18.690 --> 25:22.140
about the humanoid robot video of the week

25:22.140 --> 25:24.060
because it seems like every week,

25:24.060 --> 25:26.640
one of the other companies is one-upping each other

25:26.640 --> 25:27.540
with what they're doing.

25:27.540 --> 25:31.530
And I'm supporting my Boston Dynamics Atlas Socks

25:31.530 --> 25:33.600
on stage today as an homage

25:33.600 --> 25:37.260
to, you know, one of the OGs in the industry.

25:37.260 --> 25:40.411
But having said that, Rahul, what are your thoughts about,

25:40.411 --> 25:41.730
you know, humanoids even in the digital twin?

25:41.730 --> 25:45.104
Is it a good opportunity to try to validate that-

25:45.104 --> 25:46.620
<v ->Yeah, you know, first of all,</v>

25:46.620 --> 25:50.490
I do think humanoids are on the cutting edge of technology.

25:50.490 --> 25:51.540
They're very fascinating.

25:51.540 --> 25:55.080
And they bring in some new capabilities

25:55.080 --> 25:58.170
that can be adopted more universally

25:58.170 --> 26:00.540
but on a technology side.

26:00.540 --> 26:02.733
I think from a general purpose perspective,

26:04.500 --> 26:08.370
the usage of humanoids is not there as yet

26:08.370 --> 26:09.600
from a production perspective.

26:09.600 --> 26:12.840
I think we have to still rely on special purpose robots

26:12.840 --> 26:15.030
that are eventually gonna do the function

26:15.030 --> 26:16.620
in a more efficient manner.

26:16.620 --> 26:19.650
The reason you're using robot is to bring in more efficiency

26:19.650 --> 26:22.050
and a humanoid will not get you that efficiency

26:22.050 --> 26:23.400
that you're looking for.

26:23.400 --> 26:25.590
So from a digital twin perspective,

26:25.590 --> 26:30.120
we actually do have the ability already in place

26:30.120 --> 26:32.522
to create a digital twin of a human.

26:32.522 --> 26:35.460
In fact, we have a Jack and a Jill version of the human

26:35.460 --> 26:39.420
to allow you to evaluate different ergonomics,

26:39.420 --> 26:41.220
different safety criteria,

26:41.220 --> 26:46.220
different capabilities that a human could be functioning

26:46.290 --> 26:49.182
in a manufacturing environment.

26:49.182 --> 26:50.610
So you can do that complete evaluation

26:50.610 --> 26:52.380
from a digital perspective.

26:52.380 --> 26:56.250
You can even evaluate a person

26:56.250 --> 26:59.100
based on characteristics of a person,

26:59.100 --> 27:01.200
whether it's, not only a man or woman,

27:01.200 --> 27:04.410
but if they're from the US versus China

27:04.410 --> 27:07.380
and their capacities of handling things.

27:07.380 --> 27:09.360
So all that can be done digitally.

27:09.360 --> 27:12.510
But trying to bring in that humanoid, I think it's not,

27:12.510 --> 27:14.760
the ability is not on the digital side,

27:14.760 --> 27:16.110
it's more on the physical side.

27:16.110 --> 27:20.010
I think the systems are not there, as Jay indicated,

27:20.010 --> 27:22.170
the perception capabilities,

27:22.170 --> 27:24.333
a lot of those things are still missing.

27:25.447 --> 27:29.260
The freedom of movements are not there as yet

27:30.403 --> 27:32.430
to bring in that capability as yet.

27:32.430 --> 27:35.550
<v ->Yeah. And, Andrew, I'll let you get a moment here.</v>

27:35.550 --> 27:38.130
I know you're not using humanoids at all,

27:38.130 --> 27:40.500
but we had some interesting thoughts

27:40.500 --> 27:42.150
in our pre-conversation.

27:42.150 --> 27:44.640
<v ->I'll acknowledge that the human form factor</v>

27:44.640 --> 27:46.080
is highly adaptable,

27:46.080 --> 27:49.233
but three things cause me to be reserved about humanoids.

27:50.314 --> 27:53.190
If you're optimizing for strength, stability, and cost,

27:53.190 --> 27:55.863
a humanoid is not the design you would tend toward.

27:57.966 --> 28:00.120
Another big thing, just from a physics perspective,

28:00.120 --> 28:02.820
rotational motion is much more power-dense

28:02.820 --> 28:05.430
than linear motion, which is humanoids.

28:05.430 --> 28:06.985
And then the last thing

28:06.985 --> 28:08.940
that I think often goes overlooked with robotics

28:08.940 --> 28:10.650
is robots are a little bit like cars

28:10.650 --> 28:13.770
and they need ongoing maintenance and servicing.

28:13.770 --> 28:17.130
And simplicity is what scales in this industry.

28:17.130 --> 28:20.790
And the humanoid introduces so many extra failure points

28:20.790 --> 28:22.770
that would need to be serviced and cared for

28:22.770 --> 28:25.350
over the duration of a customer relationship.

28:25.350 --> 28:27.930
And in robotics, you wanna minimize customer headaches

28:27.930 --> 28:29.883
at every opportunity you get.

28:31.415 --> 28:34.770
<v ->Says the entrepreneur who's rolling out products</v>

28:34.770 --> 28:36.120
to new customers every week.

28:36.120 --> 28:38.820
So yeah, serviceability, maintainability,

28:38.820 --> 28:42.420
and customer service key for any robotics company.

28:42.420 --> 28:44.550
So with the time we have left,

28:44.550 --> 28:46.380
we brought up the topic of AI,

28:46.380 --> 28:49.260
which again is changing so rapidly.

28:49.260 --> 28:50.970
We've already talked briefly about this.

28:50.970 --> 28:55.110
But again, as you walk the CES floor today,

28:55.110 --> 28:57.540
I stopped counting how many companies

28:57.540 --> 29:01.650
are talking about AI as the core part of their products.

29:01.650 --> 29:05.133
And, again, as a skeptic, Jay said that,

29:06.049 --> 29:09.000
you know, where is AI deployed and really what is it, right?

29:09.000 --> 29:10.530
I think that's the question,

29:10.530 --> 29:15.530
is what are those places that AI and innovation

29:16.560 --> 29:19.560
is feasible today to do real work?

29:19.560 --> 29:23.181
So did you wanna expand a bit more on-

29:23.181 --> 29:25.580
<v ->Sure. Oh, okay, okay.</v>

29:25.580 --> 29:30.580
So AI is being used today extensively in our products.

29:32.280 --> 29:35.700
And clearly we apply AI as we're making decisions,

29:35.700 --> 29:37.980
whether it's within the factories

29:37.980 --> 29:39.830
and making decisions on what happens.

29:41.490 --> 29:43.800
You know, is the supplier gonna deliver something on time?

29:43.800 --> 29:46.470
There's things that we use for AI for enterprise decisions,

29:46.470 --> 29:49.170
but right on the products there's AI being used.

29:49.170 --> 29:50.280
If you go to the Oshkosh booth,

29:50.280 --> 29:52.280
you're gonna see some of that in action.

29:54.038 --> 29:55.861
Machine learning, deep learning,

29:55.861 --> 29:57.060
at the edge, on the devices,

29:57.060 --> 29:59.430
having embedded systems on the devices.

29:59.430 --> 30:01.590
One simple example I'll give you

30:01.590 --> 30:04.890
is that I talked about refuse collection earlier, right?

30:04.890 --> 30:08.370
So we have sensors and technology on your arm

30:08.370 --> 30:11.193
on the side of your refuse truck.

30:12.661 --> 30:15.540
As today, what they do is they drive by

30:15.540 --> 30:16.980
and then they look to make sure

30:16.980 --> 30:19.560
that they actually parked the vehicle closer to,

30:19.560 --> 30:21.160
stop the vehicle closer to your,

30:22.759 --> 30:25.020
where you put your, you know, refuse on the curb,

30:25.020 --> 30:26.280
then they use their joystick

30:26.280 --> 30:28.620
and then they line it all up and then they grab it.

30:28.620 --> 30:33.150
That whole task, applying sensors in AI,

30:33.150 --> 30:38.150
it actually identifies and locates the refuse bin.

30:38.640 --> 30:40.830
If there's a kid there or if there's a bicycle there,

30:40.830 --> 30:42.636
it won't deploy.

30:42.636 --> 30:44.820
It identifies and locates that is exactly refuse bin,

30:44.820 --> 30:48.240
deploys the arm and grabs it and puts it back,

30:48.240 --> 30:49.740
empties out the refuse container.

30:49.740 --> 30:52.200
That's a very real world use case

30:52.200 --> 30:55.293
that you see today in production applying AI.

30:56.159 --> 30:58.290
<v ->And helping that driver just get that much more efficiency</v>

30:58.290 --> 30:59.550
out of their task, yeah.
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

30:59.550 --> 31:01.053
We've done the mapping.

31:01.945 --> 31:03.090
Actually if you look at putting,

31:03.090 --> 31:05.970
it's almost, you can say one hour of work a day.

31:05.970 --> 31:09.060
They do thousands of these pickups each day.

31:09.060 --> 31:11.880
Look at the fatigue that they have to face, right?

31:11.880 --> 31:14.190
The second example is, I don't know how many of you

31:14.190 --> 31:15.750
really are good about recycling.

31:15.750 --> 31:18.120
Many times, I have to admit,

31:18.120 --> 31:19.860
I mix recycling and refuse together.

31:19.860 --> 31:21.930
I try hard not to put the recycling in there,

31:21.930 --> 31:23.940
but there are times I mix it up.

31:23.940 --> 31:25.080
I'm getting a lot better now

31:25.080 --> 31:26.400
after learning a lot about this.

31:26.400 --> 31:27.780
But it's the wrong thing to do

31:27.780 --> 31:30.600
because it costs more money to sort it out

31:30.600 --> 31:32.610
when you mixed things together on the,

31:32.610 --> 31:34.560
we call it cross-contamination.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.480
Applying cameras in AI technology,

31:36.480 --> 31:38.730
we actually identify there's been a,

31:38.730 --> 31:39.990
as soon as the garbage goes in there,

31:39.990 --> 31:42.930
identify there's been a cross-contamination,

31:42.930 --> 31:46.560
which actually informs the driver, informs the customer.

31:46.560 --> 31:48.900
You do not wanna throw batteries in your garbage.

31:48.900 --> 31:49.800
Do not do that.

31:49.800 --> 31:52.833
It's got a serious impact in terms of safety.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.080
Those are the kind of things

31:55.080 --> 31:56.640
we can actually provide more warning

31:56.640 --> 31:59.400
and it can be in consumer education piece of it.

31:59.400 --> 32:01.893
So there is practical applications.

32:02.831 --> 32:03.664
And the jet dock is another example.

32:03.664 --> 32:05.220
How does it know it's an aircraft?

32:05.220 --> 32:07.440
How does it know it's a door of the aircraft?

32:07.440 --> 32:08.760
Aircraft's very, very expensive.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.160
You just cannot deploy something and hit it.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.643
So there are practical applications of AI, things like that,

32:15.450 --> 32:19.620
but what we do see is advancements in AI processing

32:19.620 --> 32:23.220
and being able to do a better job of sensor fusion

32:23.220 --> 32:25.863
between the cameras and LADARs and LiDARs.

32:27.391 --> 32:30.281
Training the models much more efficiently,

32:30.281 --> 32:33.540
millions of scenarios, training using videos.

32:33.540 --> 32:36.030
So we see that, we see it taken to the next level,

32:36.030 --> 32:37.950
but AI is here and now

32:37.950 --> 32:41.040
and you'll see it across the board on our products.

32:41.040 --> 32:41.933
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

32:42.769 --> 32:44.010
Rahul, for the Siemens,

32:44.010 --> 32:47.370
again, you're a hardware company and a software company.

32:47.370 --> 32:50.763
We talked about the digital aspects of the digital world,

32:51.825 --> 32:53.610
but, again, how is AI being infused

32:53.610 --> 32:55.920
across that entire stack?

32:55.920 --> 32:59.400
<v ->Yeah, we are, (clears throat) excuse me,</v>

32:59.400 --> 33:01.140
we are looking at AI, in modern,

33:01.140 --> 33:03.330
what we are calling as industrial AI

33:03.330 --> 33:04.770
where we are trying to make sure

33:04.770 --> 33:08.700
that the AI that's being used is robust and reliable enough

33:08.700 --> 33:11.220
from an industrial application perspective.

33:11.220 --> 33:12.720
And from our point of view,

33:12.720 --> 33:14.880
we are looking at it in three ways.

33:14.880 --> 33:18.930
The first one is leveraging the AI on the shop floor

33:18.930 --> 33:22.320
for the operators, making it easy for them

33:22.320 --> 33:25.260
to perhaps even communicate on issues.

33:25.260 --> 33:26.610
Something very simple.

33:26.610 --> 33:27.870
When an operator has an issue,

33:27.870 --> 33:29.850
we have found that 80% of the issues

33:29.850 --> 33:31.470
do not even get reported

33:31.470 --> 33:34.470
because of the challenges in trying to document

33:34.470 --> 33:36.120
the issue, for example.

33:36.120 --> 33:38.850
So just having a very easy mechanism

33:38.850 --> 33:40.290
to capture that information,

33:40.290 --> 33:42.630
getting it to the right person inside the company,

33:42.630 --> 33:44.430
getting, using large language models

33:44.430 --> 33:47.610
for any language perspective, taking photographs,

33:47.610 --> 33:49.380
getting that in front of-

33:49.380 --> 33:51.705
<v ->Part of process improvement then, yeah.</v>

33:51.705 --> 33:53.198
<v ->Exactly, exactly, right.</v>

33:53.198 --> 33:57.990
And then even using our edge devices.

33:57.990 --> 34:00.090
Jay just mentioned, there's some announcements from Nvidia.

34:00.090 --> 34:01.830
We have partnered with Nvidia now

34:01.830 --> 34:05.760
where we are embedding their GPUs inside our edge devices

34:05.760 --> 34:08.520
so that when an operator finds an issue,

34:08.520 --> 34:12.240
they can get their resolution capabilities right there

34:12.240 --> 34:17.240
without having any issues around security of the data.

34:17.430 --> 34:18.810
So that's one on the operator.

34:18.810 --> 34:23.250
The second piece is enabling the engineers,

34:23.250 --> 34:27.240
the programmers with the AI using copilots.

34:27.240 --> 34:29.040
We see tremendous advantage

34:29.040 --> 34:33.450
in trying to design the product, design the factory,

34:33.450 --> 34:37.140
designing the simulation, programming the robots.

34:37.140 --> 34:40.380
Close to 75% of the cost of a robot

34:40.380 --> 34:41.760
and the during the life of a robot

34:41.760 --> 34:43.200
is actually in programming.

34:43.200 --> 34:48.090
And if we can minimize that using copilot capabilities,

34:48.090 --> 34:50.490
we can help that significantly

34:50.490 --> 34:55.350
by driving more adoption of robots in the factories as well.

34:55.350 --> 34:58.606
So that's the second big application we see

34:58.606 --> 35:03.093
in the mass usage of copilots.

35:04.066 --> 35:05.070
And the third piece is actually

35:05.070 --> 35:07.050
on the production floor itself

35:07.050 --> 35:09.243
and actually using AI for production.

35:10.500 --> 35:13.020
And this is where visual capabilities at least

35:13.020 --> 35:17.160
are becoming more adaptive and useful today.

35:17.160 --> 35:18.450
Simple example I would give you,

35:18.450 --> 35:21.360
for example, trying to look at deformities

35:21.360 --> 35:23.400
on the paint of a car, right?

35:23.400 --> 35:24.480
It's not an easy thing,

35:24.480 --> 35:28.110
but using visual cameras to identify the issues

35:28.110 --> 35:30.060
and figure out where the issue is,

35:30.060 --> 35:35.010
what's the depth of the issue, the size of the issue,

35:35.010 --> 35:38.250
and then processing it to take it to the next level

35:38.250 --> 35:39.600
to actually fix the paint.

35:39.600 --> 35:42.540
And as you're trying to move that whole assembly line,

35:42.540 --> 35:45.810
moving it in the right space and at the right time.

35:45.810 --> 35:47.670
So those are some applications

35:47.670 --> 35:52.350
we are starting to adapt inside our factories.

35:52.350 --> 35:54.780
<v ->Yeah, real practical applications,</v>

35:54.780 --> 35:58.803
maybe the less sexy examples of where AI is being deployed.

35:59.684 --> 36:02.700
And, Andrew, you know, again, you're flying drones,

36:02.700 --> 36:06.540
you've got your ground-based robots for cleaning.

36:06.540 --> 36:08.100
AI, I assume, is a core part

36:08.100 --> 36:12.033
of what it's doing to navigate and complete its tasks.

36:13.024 --> 36:14.490
<v ->It's really fun living at the forefront</v>

36:14.490 --> 36:18.210
of trying to embody AI on a physical robot,

36:18.210 --> 36:21.270
'cause that's where the most opportunity is.

36:21.270 --> 36:24.240
And over the summer, we actually acquired an AI company

36:24.240 --> 36:26.670
and where we've seen the greatest benefits from AI

36:26.670 --> 36:28.410
just in the short run.

36:28.410 --> 36:30.990
One has been with our actual software development.

36:30.990 --> 36:33.210
Things, five years ago, we used a program,

36:33.210 --> 36:35.250
we're up to 20 times faster today

36:35.250 --> 36:37.710
just using AI tools and workflows.

36:37.710 --> 36:39.660
But we get most excited about, though,

36:39.660 --> 36:43.800
is truly getting agentic AI to work on our robots.

36:43.800 --> 36:45.660
And when I say that, that's allowing the robot

36:45.660 --> 36:48.750
the ability to perceive, reason, act, and learn.

36:48.750 --> 36:50.130
And to give an example,

36:50.130 --> 36:52.500
it's like having a coworker right next to you

36:52.500 --> 36:54.840
where you can communicate what needs to be done.

36:54.840 --> 36:56.460
They can take in their surroundings

36:56.460 --> 36:58.957
and use relevant sensors and data to understand,

36:58.957 --> 37:00.990
"Here are the actions I need to do."

37:00.990 --> 37:02.400
And as they're doing those actions,

37:02.400 --> 37:04.200
they continue to take your feedback,

37:04.200 --> 37:06.150
they continue to perceive and reason.

37:06.150 --> 37:08.760
And as they do it, they learn and refine.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.080
And starting that flywheel

37:10.080 --> 37:13.020
where every single time your robot operates,

37:13.020 --> 37:14.640
it's getting more intelligent,

37:14.640 --> 37:17.970
it's improving its autonomy, efficiency, effectiveness,

37:17.970 --> 37:21.690
that's the holy grail within this AI robotic space.

37:21.690 --> 37:22.523
<v ->Yeah.</v>

37:23.524 --> 37:24.357
Well, we're just about out of time,

37:24.357 --> 37:28.740
but I wanna ask Sally to give us a preview.

37:28.740 --> 37:30.540
Sally, you are responsible

37:30.540 --> 37:35.220
for the innovation, evaluation team at DHL.

37:35.220 --> 37:36.690
So you're continually looking

37:36.690 --> 37:39.180
at young entrepreneurial opportunities,

37:39.180 --> 37:42.240
companies like Jay, but for the warehousing space.

37:42.240 --> 37:46.410
So talk to us briefly about the program

37:46.410 --> 37:48.360
for folks that might be interested

37:48.360 --> 37:51.720
in, you know, getting involved in that

37:51.720 --> 37:54.540
and how you evaluate the capabilities

37:54.540 --> 37:56.400
of some of these systems you're deploying.

37:56.400 --> 38:01.400
<v ->Yeah, so we have a innovation funnel where we look at,</v>

38:02.027 --> 38:03.870
you know, I mentioned trends and supply chain,

38:03.870 --> 38:07.110
what will impact our business, make us more efficient.

38:07.110 --> 38:09.090
So it's targeted.

38:09.090 --> 38:11.763
We're not, you know, looking for,

38:12.930 --> 38:17.070
you know, things that are necessarily way far out.

38:17.070 --> 38:20.193
We're more use case-driven.

38:21.660 --> 38:24.060
You know, problems we're trying to solve

38:24.060 --> 38:27.033
and optimize in what we do every day.

38:27.871 --> 38:31.210
And working with a lot of startup companies like yourself

38:32.790 --> 38:37.790
to help roboticists, non-operational supply chain people

38:39.120 --> 38:44.120
develop their products so that we get an ROI.

38:46.949 --> 38:49.349
We're running a business. We have to make money.

38:50.220 --> 38:53.730
You know, you mentioned your Boston Dynamics Socks.

38:53.730 --> 38:57.510
It's a good example of, you know, the leader,

38:57.510 --> 38:59.373
I would say, in robotics.

39:00.450 --> 39:03.840
Worked with them on developing the stretch product

39:03.840 --> 39:06.540
which unloads cartons from a trailer

39:06.540 --> 39:09.660
and will have more specific use cases

39:09.660 --> 39:13.470
to be able to do other case movements within the warehouse.

39:13.470 --> 39:16.770
So working alongside companies

39:16.770 --> 39:19.680
that have the robotics expertise,

39:19.680 --> 39:22.620
we bring the operational expertise.

39:22.620 --> 39:25.020
And we're interested in things

39:25.020 --> 39:27.360
that can scale across our operations.

39:27.360 --> 39:30.150
There are a lot of niche solutions,

39:30.150 --> 39:32.700
but, you know, assisted picking,

39:32.700 --> 39:36.488
we do each picking in a lot of facilities.

39:36.488 --> 39:40.230
So the ability, you know, to scale up

39:40.230 --> 39:42.300
gives us the best benefit.

39:42.300 --> 39:46.680
And we've got over 7,500 bots deployed globally

39:46.680 --> 39:51.680
and are always looking for solutions in our use case,

39:52.710 --> 39:54.393
you know, that fit our use case.

39:55.890 --> 39:59.707
<v ->Great. Well, we are right on time, so.</v>

39:59.707 --> 40:01.260
<v Sally>Yeah, I saw the countdown-</v>

40:01.260 --> 40:03.300
<v ->Yeah, so I wanna thank you guys</v>

40:03.300 --> 40:05.818
for the great conversation.

40:05.818 --> 40:08.520
I think you guys can hang out for a few minutes here.

40:08.520 --> 40:11.853
So if you wanna reach out to any of the folks on stage,

40:13.080 --> 40:14.520
catch them over here on the side.

40:14.520 --> 40:16.830
But, again, thanks for your time today.

40:16.830 --> 40:18.655
Thank you, guys.

40:18.655 --> 40:21.120
And, again, download the episode

40:21.120 --> 40:23.919
of "The Robot Report Podcast" for your flight home.

40:23.919 --> 40:26.430
And thank you for your time today.

40:26.430 --> 40:27.671
<v ->Thank you.</v>
<v Rahul>Thank you.</v>

40:27.671 --> 40:29.393
(audience applauding)

40:29.393 --> 40:31.976
