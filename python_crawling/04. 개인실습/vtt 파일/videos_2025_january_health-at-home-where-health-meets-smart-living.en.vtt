1
00:00.235 --> 00:02.818
(upbeat music)

2
00:11.100 --> 00:12.150
<v ->Hello everyone.</v>

3
00:12.150 --> 00:16.538
We have handheld mics, so hope these work out for all of us.

4
00:16.538 --> 00:20.850
Welcome to our session. We're all really excited to be here.

5
00:20.850 --> 00:23.340
Before I let everyone introduce themselves

6
00:23.340 --> 00:28.050
and share their vision, I wanna introduce our panel first.

7
00:28.050 --> 00:32.310
My name, Jane Sarasohn-Khan. I write the Health Populi blog.

8
00:32.310 --> 00:34.440
This is my 16th CES.

9
00:34.440 --> 00:36.210
I think health is everywhere,

10
00:36.210 --> 00:39.143
and it's certainly everywhere at CES this year.

11
00:39.143 --> 00:43.343
I wanna introduce our panel about the home and health

12
00:43.343 --> 00:48.343
with a quote from 20, almost 21 years ago.

13
00:48.480 --> 00:52.260
Dr. Charles Safran, S-A-F-R-A-N,

14
00:52.260 --> 00:56.280
who still teaches at Harvard, was president of AMIA.

15
00:56.280 --> 00:57.796
Those are the wonky folks who do

16
00:57.796 --> 01:00.750
healthcare industry standards and things.

17
01:00.750 --> 01:04.140
He's a healthcare informatician.

18
01:04.140 --> 01:07.800
And Charles gave testimony to Congress,

19
01:07.800 --> 01:10.200
the House Ways and Means Committee,

20
01:10.200 --> 01:13.743
when EHRs were but a little dream,

21
01:14.580 --> 01:16.500
which may have become a nightmare or not,

22
01:16.500 --> 01:18.810
depending who you are, who we ask.

23
01:18.810 --> 01:21.840
But Charles told the Congress folk

24
01:21.840 --> 01:26.040
that patients were the most underutilized resource

25
01:26.040 --> 01:28.740
in the United States health system.

26
01:28.740 --> 01:31.260
So we fast forward a couple of decades,

27
01:31.260 --> 01:34.500
and patients are still pretty underutilized in many ways.

28
01:34.500 --> 01:37.800
But the home has a lot of promise

29
01:37.800 --> 01:40.380
for enabling engagement in health,

30
01:40.380 --> 01:42.630
and that's what we're gonna talk about today.

31
01:42.630 --> 01:45.870
So without further ado, I'm gonna ask first Ricky Choi

32
01:45.870 --> 01:47.940
of Samsung to introduce himself

33
01:47.940 --> 01:52.940
and share his/Samsung's Holy Grail vision,

34
01:53.400 --> 01:58.400
a hope and promise for health that's smarter from home.

35
02:00.090 --> 02:01.350
Ricky.

36
02:01.350 --> 02:04.410
<v ->Great, well good morning. Congratulations to all of you.</v>

37
02:04.410 --> 02:06.210
You've made it to Thursday of CES.

38
02:06.210 --> 02:09.000
So we really appreciate your attention and interest

39
02:09.000 --> 02:10.560
in this whole area.

40
02:10.560 --> 02:11.820
My name is Ricky Choi.

41
02:11.820 --> 02:13.020
I'm the Head of Digital Health

42
02:13.020 --> 02:14.640
at Samsung Electronics America.

43
02:14.640 --> 02:17.493
I'm also a practicing clinician, as faculty at Stanford.

44
02:18.660 --> 02:22.440
For Samsung, our vision is to build a healthier future

45
02:22.440 --> 02:25.650
through connected care, centered around the home.

46
02:25.650 --> 02:29.040
Now it's kind of obvious, but the home is just so critical.

47
02:29.040 --> 02:31.770
It's where we begin our health journey almost every day.

48
02:31.770 --> 02:33.930
Maybe not this week, but most days.

49
02:33.930 --> 02:35.520
It's where we sleep to restore our body.

50
02:35.520 --> 02:37.260
It's where we cook, and where we eat.

51
02:37.260 --> 02:40.770
It's where we exercise, where we live our lives.

52
02:40.770 --> 02:41.853
And at Samsung we feel like

53
02:41.853 --> 02:43.680
that we have an incredible opportunity

54
02:43.680 --> 02:46.650
to start to improve health through the home.

55
02:46.650 --> 02:50.400
Given our very broad portfolio, our really deep penetration.

56
02:50.400 --> 02:51.233
As we think about it,

57
02:51.233 --> 02:55.050
70% of American homes have Samsung technology in it.

58
02:55.050 --> 02:59.907
TVs, refrigerators, microwaves, wearables, and et cetera.

59
02:59.907 --> 03:02.700
And so as a doctor, and as a leader in the health team,

60
03:02.700 --> 03:04.200
I'm constantly trying to think about

61
03:04.200 --> 03:07.320
how do we then tie these touch points together

62
03:07.320 --> 03:09.720
to help people better understand their health.

63
03:09.720 --> 03:11.640
To recognize their health status,

64
03:11.640 --> 03:14.220
bring awareness when they might have a early sign

65
03:14.220 --> 03:15.990
or symptom of a health condition,

66
03:15.990 --> 03:18.000
tie them to care when they might need it,

67
03:18.000 --> 03:20.310
help them when they get back home to recover.

68
03:20.310 --> 03:22.200
And of course, care for their dependents,

69
03:22.200 --> 03:26.250
whether it be aging parents, or their children.

70
03:26.250 --> 03:28.680
So thinking a lot about the role of AI to do this,

71
03:28.680 --> 03:31.590
or the role of next generation biosensing wearables

72
03:31.590 --> 03:33.090
to tie those things together,

73
03:33.090 --> 03:35.190
so we can drive personalized insights

74
03:35.190 --> 03:38.430
to help people figure out what's that next best thing to do.

75
03:38.430 --> 03:40.230
And if we do this really well,

76
03:40.230 --> 03:41.970
then we have healthier people

77
03:41.970 --> 03:43.860
who have more control over their health

78
03:43.860 --> 03:46.860
and they can spend more time focusing on living their life

79
03:46.860 --> 03:48.870
than constantly worrying about their health.

80
03:48.870 --> 03:51.150
I should just add one other point.

81
03:51.150 --> 03:53.490
While Samsung has this broad portfolio,

82
03:53.490 --> 03:56.760
we fully recognize that health is a team sport.

83
03:56.760 --> 03:59.004
As a physician, I can't practice by myself.

84
03:59.004 --> 04:02.130
I need other people around me to be able to do this better.

85
04:02.130 --> 04:04.740
People who are experts in what they do.

86
04:04.740 --> 04:07.770
And so we have a very strong ecosystem-based approach

87
04:07.770 --> 04:10.110
in order try to move this forward,

88
04:10.110 --> 04:12.840
so we can find best partners to work together

89
04:12.840 --> 04:14.700
in order to move towards this vision.

90
04:14.700 --> 04:15.900
Thank you.

91
04:15.900 --> 04:18.570
<v ->And as we move on to Antoine Robiliard,</v>

92
04:18.570 --> 04:20.550
if there's someone who can turn the clock on

93
04:20.550 --> 04:22.890
and get us on the right time, I would appreciate it.

94
04:22.890 --> 04:27.360
So we can keep everyone to time, thank you. Antoine.

95
04:27.360 --> 04:29.520
<v ->Good morning everyone. My name is Antoine.</v>

96
04:29.520 --> 04:32.490
I lead Withings' efforts with the healthcare industry.

97
04:32.490 --> 04:34.440
So for those of you who don't know us,

98
04:34.440 --> 04:37.650
Withings invented the smart scale about 15 years ago.

99
04:37.650 --> 04:39.720
And since then we've been developing devices

100
04:39.720 --> 04:42.030
to help people take care of themselves at home.

101
04:42.030 --> 04:43.926
We have a full ecosystem of devices.

102
04:43.926 --> 04:48.060
And what we're really, really good at is at finding our way

103
04:48.060 --> 04:51.672
into the daily life of users for a very long time.

104
04:51.672 --> 04:55.080
And thanks to that, we're able to help them, to nudge them,

105
04:55.080 --> 04:58.770
to drive them in the right direction towards better health.

106
04:58.770 --> 04:59.820
About five years ago,

107
04:59.820 --> 05:02.308
we created a division for the healthcare industry

108
05:02.308 --> 05:05.700
to help care teams monitor their patients

109
05:05.700 --> 05:09.270
with chronic conditions and drive better health outcome.

110
05:09.270 --> 05:11.940
And it's thanks to this expertise with the consumer,

111
05:11.940 --> 05:13.800
thanks to our ability to find our way

112
05:13.800 --> 05:16.650
into their daily routine, their daily habits,

113
05:16.650 --> 05:19.170
that we're seeing success in healthcare today.

114
05:19.170 --> 05:21.210
Because we actually make devices and experience

115
05:21.210 --> 05:24.090
that people like to use, that people want to use,

116
05:24.090 --> 05:25.500
that people use in the long term,

117
05:25.500 --> 05:27.510
and therefore generate data.

118
05:27.510 --> 05:30.840
We're not asking them to use a piece of hospital at home.

119
05:30.840 --> 05:35.190
We're sending data back from home to the hospital.

120
05:35.190 --> 05:37.650
So for us, the vision is, thanks to that,

121
05:37.650 --> 05:41.730
thanks to all this data that we're able to generate,

122
05:41.730 --> 05:43.869
all the trends that we're able to see,

123
05:43.869 --> 05:47.313
we're able to enable proactive healthcare.

124
05:48.240 --> 05:51.750
So it's about collecting data in the daily life,

125
05:51.750 --> 05:54.990
bringing this data to life in a meaningful way

126
05:54.990 --> 05:57.960
to patients or to users, nudge them in the right direction,

127
05:57.960 --> 05:58.793
and you mentioned AI.

128
05:58.793 --> 06:01.738
I think there will be a lot of things to be said about that.

129
06:01.738 --> 06:03.270
And more importantly,

130
06:03.270 --> 06:06.090
connecting them to the healthcare industry when needed,

131
06:06.090 --> 06:07.649
when we detect something.

132
06:07.649 --> 06:09.750
When we have somebody that sleeps in their bed

133
06:09.750 --> 06:12.120
and we see that there is a risk of sleep apnea.

134
06:12.120 --> 06:14.910
When they're wearing a wearable, no matter the brand,

135
06:14.910 --> 06:17.086
and we see there is a risk of AFib.

136
06:17.086 --> 06:20.430
When we're able to detect various chronic conditions.

137
06:20.430 --> 06:22.284
There are a lot that we can do today.

138
06:22.284 --> 06:24.270
And the future for us will be about that.

139
06:24.270 --> 06:28.620
Will be how can we help both users and care teams

140
06:28.620 --> 06:30.990
identify a risk at a time

141
06:30.990 --> 06:33.450
where we can actually have an impact on it

142
06:33.450 --> 06:35.463
and avoid sick care.

143
06:37.620 --> 06:39.150
<v Jane>Gabby.</v>

144
06:39.150 --> 06:41.580
<v ->Hi there. My name is Gabby Goldblatt.</v>

145
06:41.580 --> 06:44.520
I lead healthcare partnerships at DiMe,

146
06:44.520 --> 06:46.770
or the Digital Medicine Society.

147
06:46.770 --> 06:50.160
DiMe is a global research and education nonprofit,

148
06:50.160 --> 06:53.348
and we convene and activate diverse stakeholders

149
06:53.348 --> 06:55.710
around really complex problems

150
06:55.710 --> 06:59.040
at the intersection of healthcare and technology.

151
06:59.040 --> 07:01.530
We were really excited at the end of 2024

152
07:01.530 --> 07:05.010
to announce a new Connected Health Collaborative Community

153
07:05.010 --> 07:08.880
with the Consumer Technology Association and FDA

154
07:08.880 --> 07:12.660
so that we can really intentionally convene, and again,

155
07:12.660 --> 07:16.530
activate all of the different parties needed

156
07:16.530 --> 07:19.320
to unlock the power of connected health

157
07:19.320 --> 07:21.000
and healthcare at home.

158
07:21.000 --> 07:23.520
What I'm excited about with healthcare at home

159
07:23.520 --> 07:28.140
is how it really has the opportunity to empower people

160
07:28.140 --> 07:30.990
to take their health into their own hands.

161
07:30.990 --> 07:32.850
Have this real-time feedback,

162
07:32.850 --> 07:35.730
this real-time data to learn more about themselves

163
07:35.730 --> 07:37.390
and how they can make changes

164
07:39.030 --> 07:41.537
that are really meaningful and impactful.

165
07:41.537 --> 07:43.260
We're excited that we have

166
07:43.260 --> 07:45.060
the Connected Health Collaborative Community

167
07:45.060 --> 07:46.863
to make this a reality.

168
07:48.300 --> 07:49.200
<v Jane>Carlos.</v>

169
07:49.200 --> 07:51.660
<v ->Hi. Hello everyone, my name is Carlos Nunez.</v>

170
07:51.660 --> 07:54.480
I'm the Chief Medical Officer of a company called ResMed.

171
07:54.480 --> 07:56.460
And ResMed is the world's leading provider

172
07:56.460 --> 07:59.430
of digital and connected solutions for sleep health,

173
07:59.430 --> 08:00.263
breathing health,

174
08:00.263 --> 08:02.340
and healthcare that's delivered in the home.

175
08:02.340 --> 08:04.650
And I'm gonna make a pretty bold statement right now.

176
08:04.650 --> 08:08.220
I think what this panel represents is the culmination of

177
08:08.220 --> 08:10.860
what the health division at CTA represents.

178
08:10.860 --> 08:12.660
The reason companies like ResMed

179
08:12.660 --> 08:15.150
or the Digital Medicine Society are here,

180
08:15.150 --> 08:17.979
it's because consumer companies like Samsung or Withings

181
08:17.979 --> 08:21.900
are converging into this space between the home,

182
08:21.900 --> 08:23.070
between the consumer,

183
08:23.070 --> 08:25.920
and the traditional parts of the healthcare system.

184
08:25.920 --> 08:28.620
We, as healthcare companies, or as medical companies,

185
08:28.620 --> 08:30.360
are moving closer to the consumer.

186
08:30.360 --> 08:33.240
And consumer companies are moving closer into this area

187
08:33.240 --> 08:34.620
of health and wellness,

188
08:34.620 --> 08:36.750
and even disease management in the home.

189
08:36.750 --> 08:39.810
And so, again, bit of bold statement, but for me,

190
08:39.810 --> 08:42.720
what this represents, this conversation today,

191
08:42.720 --> 08:46.800
is the promise of what CTA brings to the table here.

192
08:46.800 --> 08:49.050
The consumer, the person,

193
08:49.050 --> 08:51.420
long before they ever become a patient,

194
08:51.420 --> 08:53.700
worries about their health and their wellness.

195
08:53.700 --> 08:56.340
And the United States and health systems around the world.

196
08:56.340 --> 08:58.440
We call ourselves healthcare systems,

197
08:58.440 --> 09:01.290
but we truly are more like disease intervention systems.

198
09:01.290 --> 09:04.650
We don't do as good a job keeping people healthy,

199
09:04.650 --> 09:06.330
having them live their best lives

200
09:06.330 --> 09:09.330
where they want to be, in the place where they live.

201
09:09.330 --> 09:13.252
And so being able to work with companies like the consumer,

202
09:13.252 --> 09:16.020
work with the Consumer Technology Association,

203
09:16.020 --> 09:17.850
and companies that are members

204
09:17.850 --> 09:20.220
to make sure that those consumers in their homes

205
09:20.220 --> 09:23.490
have access to the technology and the innovation

206
09:23.490 --> 09:25.440
that can generate the data and the insights

207
09:25.440 --> 09:28.740
to help keep them happy and healthy where they want to be.

208
09:28.740 --> 09:30.330
It's the promise and the future

209
09:30.330 --> 09:31.740
of where healthcare needs to go.

210
09:31.740 --> 09:33.120
If we don't do this right,

211
09:33.120 --> 09:35.520
the system is unsustainable as it stands.

212
09:35.520 --> 09:38.070
And more people are in their homes,

213
09:38.070 --> 09:40.410
or where they live their lives than they are in a hospital

214
09:40.410 --> 09:42.180
or in a doctor's office, hopefully.

215
09:42.180 --> 09:43.740
And it gives us an opportunity,

216
09:43.740 --> 09:45.840
those unique insights into the patient,

217
09:45.840 --> 09:49.200
which are the most underutilized resources in healthcare.

218
09:49.200 --> 09:51.990
<v ->Thank you. So it's the conversation.</v>

219
09:51.990 --> 09:55.200
Let's riff a little bit on prevention and well-being,

220
09:55.200 --> 09:57.780
since you brought it up, Carlos, and not sick care.

221
09:57.780 --> 09:59.400
'Cause that's one of the promises of the home.

222
09:59.400 --> 10:02.130
Since we're only seeing a doc a couple times a year

223
10:02.130 --> 10:03.316
and for a few minutes.

224
10:03.316 --> 10:07.232
How can this smarter home for health

225
10:07.232 --> 10:11.640
bolster our well-being, not just to make good choices,

226
10:11.640 --> 10:16.470
whatever your technology or device your program seeks to do.

227
10:16.470 --> 10:18.663
Who would like to take that on first?

228
10:20.070 --> 10:21.723
<v ->I'm happy to go with this.</v>

229
10:24.360 --> 10:26.070
To me, it's about the long term.

230
10:26.070 --> 10:28.920
It's about how do we find our way into the daily life

231
10:28.920 --> 10:32.520
of the users, or the patients, to generate this data,

232
10:32.520 --> 10:37.200
to generate this trend that will help us

233
10:37.200 --> 10:39.060
to nudge them in the right directions.

234
10:39.060 --> 10:41.970
And too often I think we forget that,

235
10:41.970 --> 10:45.150
on the other side of this remote patient monitoring program

236
10:45.150 --> 10:48.450
or any program that healthcare organizations are leading,

237
10:48.450 --> 10:51.840
too often, we forget that that patient is a user,

238
10:51.840 --> 10:53.190
but that user is a consumer.

239
10:53.190 --> 10:56.130
They consume, they have expectations.

240
10:56.130 --> 10:59.910
We can't just expect them to change their daily habits,

241
10:59.910 --> 11:03.750
to go in completely different directions,

242
11:03.750 --> 11:04.890
towards better health.

243
11:04.890 --> 11:07.020
We need to find ways to really integrate

244
11:07.020 --> 11:08.010
into their daily lives,

245
11:08.010 --> 11:12.037
and give them this little insight, little help,

246
11:12.037 --> 11:13.860
to make little changes every day

247
11:13.860 --> 11:16.200
because the accumulation of these little changes

248
11:16.200 --> 11:18.480
that will drive something better.

249
11:18.480 --> 11:21.183
I like to use an example. I love details.

250
11:22.470 --> 11:26.010
On our scales, we show the weight trend.

251
11:26.010 --> 11:27.840
Because who cares about the actual number?

252
11:27.840 --> 11:29.010
The number is not important.

253
11:29.010 --> 11:30.690
What's important is how you trend.

254
11:30.690 --> 11:32.700
And by knowing how you trend every single day,

255
11:32.700 --> 11:35.490
when you step on that scale, it helps you, as a user,

256
11:35.490 --> 11:38.400
to make that little decision every single day

257
11:38.400 --> 11:39.930
to be a little bit more healthy.

258
11:39.930 --> 11:41.130
So for us it's really, yeah,

259
11:41.130 --> 11:43.230
finding your way into the daily life.

260
11:43.230 --> 11:45.150
The very, very long-term,

261
11:45.150 --> 11:47.550
creating experience that are enticing

262
11:47.550 --> 11:51.240
and that blend completely into the daily habits.

263
11:51.240 --> 11:52.320
<v Jane>Go ahead, Rick.</v>

264
11:52.320 --> 11:53.760
<v ->I just wanna comment on something</v>

265
11:53.760 --> 11:55.110
you just kinda said offhandedly,

266
11:55.110 --> 11:57.540
how you might only see your doctor a couple times a year.

267
11:57.540 --> 11:59.340
I remember being in a meeting,

268
11:59.340 --> 12:02.220
and hearing a presentation about diabetes.

269
12:02.220 --> 12:03.667
And the speaker was saying,

270
12:03.667 --> 12:06.932
"It's such an outrage that patients on average,

271
12:06.932 --> 12:10.407
diabetics may only see their doctor an hour a year."

272
12:10.407 --> 12:13.530
And I thought, "Wow, that's four visits a year.

273
12:13.530 --> 12:15.060
That's a lot of visits!"

274
12:15.060 --> 12:17.100
And so that kinda speaks to the mind frame,

275
12:17.100 --> 12:19.865
where as a physician, wow, that's a lot of time.

276
12:19.865 --> 12:23.100
But the patient obviously needs so much more than that.

277
12:23.100 --> 12:25.350
Now, I think a lot of consumer technologies,

278
12:25.350 --> 12:27.420
it started out with very basic things.

279
12:27.420 --> 12:29.040
Like if you think about your wearable.

280
12:29.040 --> 12:31.200
It was counting steps early on.

281
12:31.200 --> 12:33.330
And now fast forward to where we are now,

282
12:33.330 --> 12:36.030
now we're detecting risks of sleep apnea

283
12:36.030 --> 12:38.910
and measuring percentage body fat and et cetera.

284
12:38.910 --> 12:40.560
We've come a long way.

285
12:40.560 --> 12:41.550
And at Samsung,

286
12:41.550 --> 12:44.580
our four pillars are around stress management,

287
12:44.580 --> 12:48.630
diet, exercise, and sleep.

288
12:48.630 --> 12:50.340
Can't forget sleep, sorry, Carlos.

289
12:50.340 --> 12:51.696
And sleep, absolutely.

290
12:51.696 --> 12:54.270
And as we've started to refine and develop

291
12:54.270 --> 12:57.390
what are traditionally kind of wellness types of areas,

292
12:57.390 --> 12:59.790
we very quickly found out, oh, by the way,

293
12:59.790 --> 13:03.120
those are the very foundations of prevention.

294
13:03.120 --> 13:05.370
And as we think towards down that whole pathway

295
13:05.370 --> 13:07.127
from prevention to early signs of illness

296
13:07.127 --> 13:08.790
and on and going on,

297
13:08.790 --> 13:11.880
most chronic disease and many disease programs

298
13:11.880 --> 13:14.880
have at their foundation, not surprisingly,

299
13:14.880 --> 13:17.340
sleep, exercise, diet and stress management.

300
13:17.340 --> 13:20.160
And so we think of, and rehab programs and et cetera.

301
13:20.160 --> 13:23.130
So there is a, for a different population.

302
13:23.130 --> 13:25.260
So if you think about it, for me,

303
13:25.260 --> 13:27.080
for the young spry people on the stage,

304
13:27.080 --> 13:28.740
10,000 steps, who cares?

305
13:28.740 --> 13:29.880
We did that yesterday, right?

306
13:29.880 --> 13:32.400
We did 20 right on the floor at CES.

307
13:32.400 --> 13:35.100
But for someone who just had a heart attack, bypass surgery,

308
13:35.100 --> 13:36.810
knee replacement and et cetera,

309
13:36.810 --> 13:39.270
1,000 steps, 5,000 steps, 10,000 steps

310
13:39.270 --> 13:40.950
are extremely meaningful,

311
13:40.950 --> 13:43.500
and create some interesting business opportunities I think,

312
13:43.500 --> 13:44.850
because of that particular segment.

313
13:44.850 --> 13:47.293
So all this to say is that there is a continuum

314
13:47.293 --> 13:49.710
that from the consumer side that we're seeing,

315
13:49.710 --> 13:52.380
there's value, leaning in on prevention,

316
13:52.380 --> 13:54.390
and then in some ways, risk management.

317
13:54.390 --> 13:57.720
<v ->Also, I just wanna brag about holding it here.</v>

318
13:57.720 --> 13:59.850
I wanna brag about something Samsung

319
13:59.850 --> 14:01.380
has done well for a few years,

320
14:01.380 --> 14:05.130
and it's finally really come to be commercial and real.

321
14:05.130 --> 14:06.540
'Cause I've been tracking this.

322
14:06.540 --> 14:08.373
Your smart refrigerator,

323
14:09.360 --> 14:12.420
shout out to your partnership with Instacart.

324
14:12.420 --> 14:13.980
So you might not have read this press release

325
14:13.980 --> 14:17.460
a few days ago, but Samsung and Instacart are collaborating.

326
14:17.460 --> 14:19.050
You all know who Instacart are.

327
14:19.050 --> 14:22.830
And if your app with your fridge

328
14:22.830 --> 14:26.790
knows that you're managing diabetes or a low-salt diet,

329
14:26.790 --> 14:30.030
the fridge can look inside, look at ingredients you have,

330
14:30.030 --> 14:32.520
say you're a busy working mom.

331
14:32.520 --> 14:34.980
The fridge knows what ingredients you have,

332
14:34.980 --> 14:38.400
generates a recipe with the ingredients you have,

333
14:38.400 --> 14:40.316
puts it in the screen, in your app,

334
14:40.316 --> 14:42.577
sends a note to Instacart to say,

335
14:42.577 --> 14:44.730
"Make a list of what's not in the fridge

336
14:44.730 --> 14:46.530
she needs for this recipe."

337
14:46.530 --> 14:49.140
And Instacart will either deliver it to you

338
14:49.140 --> 14:51.270
or you can pick it up at the grocery store.

339
14:51.270 --> 14:52.500
That's streamlined.

340
14:52.500 --> 14:55.260
That's not just nudging, but supporting me,

341
14:55.260 --> 14:56.520
and my, and my family's health.

342
14:56.520 --> 14:57.960
So I just have to give you a shout-out.

343
14:57.960 --> 14:59.910
I have no skin in his game at all.

344
14:59.910 --> 15:01.800
I'm saying this as a consumer

345
15:01.800 --> 15:03.870
who could spot what good looks like.

346
15:03.870 --> 15:04.703
Congrats.

347
15:04.703 --> 15:05.536
<v ->I mean, and I've just said,</v>

348
15:05.536 --> 15:07.560
I think the layer, I hear what you're saying.

349
15:07.560 --> 15:10.350
And this is the my mantra, even with my patients,

350
15:10.350 --> 15:13.830
is how do we make the healthier choice the easier choice.

351
15:13.830 --> 15:15.060
The easier thing to do.

352
15:15.060 --> 15:17.010
So every time we take a friction step,

353
15:17.010 --> 15:20.040
including I have to restock my fridge off your to-do list,

354
15:20.040 --> 15:21.780
it makes it that much easier to do.

355
15:21.780 --> 15:23.280
It's a little like how you set,

356
15:23.280 --> 15:24.930
you can, for your paycheck,

357
15:24.930 --> 15:27.570
you can automatically get it sent to a savings account

358
15:27.570 --> 15:30.690
or donating, otherwise it's out of sight, out of mind,

359
15:30.690 --> 15:32.310
but you're still doing the right thing.

360
15:32.310 --> 15:34.320
The more we can do healthy things that way,

361
15:34.320 --> 15:35.550
I think, the better.

362
15:35.550 --> 15:38.700
<v ->Carlos, how do we nudge for better sleep</v>

363
15:38.700 --> 15:39.960
and sleep health?

364
15:39.960 --> 15:43.080
<v ->Yeah. So, and thank you for mentioning sleep, Ricky.</v>

365
15:43.080 --> 15:45.567
And you've heard it a couple times now.

366
15:45.567 --> 15:47.896
I'm here to convince you that

367
15:47.896 --> 15:50.970
there is the most powerful medicine on earth.

368
15:50.970 --> 15:53.610
It lives within you, and it's completely free.

369
15:53.610 --> 15:54.443
And it really is.

370
15:54.443 --> 15:55.290
It's a good night's sleep.

371
15:55.290 --> 15:57.810
You heard Ricky mention the pillars of good health.

372
15:57.810 --> 16:00.303
Sleep, diet, exercise, stress management.

373
16:01.590 --> 16:05.280
Where you live, in your home, where you spend your time.

374
16:05.280 --> 16:08.730
We have overemphasized in some ways,

375
16:08.730 --> 16:11.430
things like diet and exercise at the expense of sleep.

376
16:12.630 --> 16:14.640
We sometimes wear it as a badge of honor.

377
16:14.640 --> 16:16.860
And if we want to talk about health and wellness

378
16:16.860 --> 16:19.620
in the home, really, sleep is a massive part of it.

379
16:19.620 --> 16:22.800
And it's not just, ResMed is a company that is known for

380
16:22.800 --> 16:25.110
treating some sleep disorders like sleep apnea.

381
16:25.110 --> 16:26.850
And both the Withings and the Samsung wearables

382
16:26.850 --> 16:28.380
can actually detect sleep apnea.

383
16:28.380 --> 16:29.820
And that's a very good thing.

384
16:29.820 --> 16:31.050
But just sleep in general,

385
16:31.050 --> 16:32.610
good healthy sleep is so important.

386
16:32.610 --> 16:33.879
You mentioned,

387
16:33.879 --> 16:37.080
how do we promote health and wellness in the home?

388
16:37.080 --> 16:40.560
How do we go from sick care to more of a healthcare system?

389
16:40.560 --> 16:42.750
And I think people just need to be aware

390
16:42.750 --> 16:45.450
that there are significant components to health

391
16:45.450 --> 16:47.040
that we often ignore.

392
16:47.040 --> 16:49.230
And going back to the original thread

393
16:49.230 --> 16:53.010
about the health in the home and consumer tech,

394
16:53.010 --> 16:55.680
we've seen now for the last 20 or so years,

395
16:55.680 --> 16:57.870
as you know, the Internet era has blossomed

396
16:57.870 --> 17:00.810
and transformed into now the era of AI,

397
17:00.810 --> 17:02.910
data is the currency that drives so much

398
17:02.910 --> 17:04.320
of what we want to do.

399
17:04.320 --> 17:07.980
And it's the consumer technology companies and platforms

400
17:07.980 --> 17:10.380
that have shown us, if you collect enough data,

401
17:10.380 --> 17:13.800
even if it's messy, even if it's not as coordinated

402
17:13.800 --> 17:16.590
or beautiful as it is lined up in your EHR,

403
17:16.590 --> 17:19.050
you learn a lot about people.

404
17:19.050 --> 17:21.331
And the things you learn can help nudge them

405
17:21.331 --> 17:23.760
to make better choices about their food,

406
17:23.760 --> 17:25.560
to make better choices about their sleep,

407
17:25.560 --> 17:27.540
and to understand why it's important.

408
17:27.540 --> 17:30.180
And if you are going from wellness

409
17:30.180 --> 17:32.520
to actually taking care of a chronic disease in the home,

410
17:32.520 --> 17:35.310
I'll pick on the one I know the best, sleep apnea.

411
17:35.310 --> 17:37.110
Having devices that are connected

412
17:37.110 --> 17:39.990
so that not just your provider can see how you're doing,

413
17:39.990 --> 17:42.267
but that you can understand how you're doing.

414
17:42.267 --> 17:43.530
And the last thing I'll mention,

415
17:43.530 --> 17:46.140
there is a protocol emerging in the smart home.

416
17:46.140 --> 17:47.370
It's called Matter.

417
17:47.370 --> 17:50.070
And it's a consortium of all of the major tech companies,

418
17:50.070 --> 17:52.560
including like the Apples and the Amazons and the Googles

419
17:52.560 --> 17:53.580
of the world,

420
17:53.580 --> 17:56.040
that are trying to make a unified platform

421
17:56.040 --> 17:59.130
so that whatever smart doorbell or smart light bulb you buy,

422
17:59.130 --> 18:00.990
it will work with whatever assistant.

423
18:00.990 --> 18:02.820
And there is a working group within Matter

424
18:02.820 --> 18:05.850
that is looking to make sure that connected medical devices

425
18:05.850 --> 18:07.830
can participate in that protocol.

426
18:07.830 --> 18:10.050
So imagine a future that's not so far away

427
18:10.050 --> 18:13.470
that your smart assistant of choice, let's say it's Alexa,

428
18:13.470 --> 18:16.200
you set your alarm and it wakes you up,

429
18:16.200 --> 18:18.390
and turns on your lights and says, "Good morning, Carlos.

430
18:18.390 --> 18:21.900
By the way, your connected CPAP device said you did great.

431
18:21.900 --> 18:24.420
You slept eight hours and you kept it on all night.

432
18:24.420 --> 18:26.970
And we're gonna correlate it to the number of steps you take

433
18:26.970 --> 18:30.180
or how well you make decisions about the food you eat."

434
18:30.180 --> 18:31.230
That's the future.

435
18:31.230 --> 18:33.600
The future is this multimodal approach

436
18:33.600 --> 18:37.590
to using data in the right way, secure, anonymized,

437
18:37.590 --> 18:38.790
appropriate for you,

438
18:38.790 --> 18:41.340
appropriate for your provider in your situation,

439
18:41.340 --> 18:43.560
to make sure that everything in your home,

440
18:43.560 --> 18:44.730
everything in your life

441
18:44.730 --> 18:46.980
can nudge you to make those good choices.

442
18:46.980 --> 18:48.510
You use the term good choices.

443
18:48.510 --> 18:51.300
We're in the city where people sometimes make bad choices,

444
18:51.300 --> 18:52.530
mostly 'cause they stay up late,

445
18:52.530 --> 18:53.970
and my friends in the National Sleep Foundation

446
18:53.970 --> 18:55.590
that are sitting right there in the front row,

447
18:55.590 --> 18:56.587
this morning told me, he says,

448
18:56.587 --> 18:58.440
"Maybe people make bad decisions in Vegas

449
18:58.440 --> 19:00.000
'cause they don't sleep well."

450
19:00.000 --> 19:03.150
So, not to belabor the point, but yes,

451
19:03.150 --> 19:04.320
sleep is extremely important.

452
19:04.320 --> 19:05.490
I think it's a cornerstone of

453
19:05.490 --> 19:07.680
what we're trying to accomplish.

454
19:07.680 --> 19:08.513
<v Antoine>If I could add,</v>

455
19:08.513 --> 19:09.346
<v ->I wanna ask Gabby.</v>

456
19:09.346 --> 19:12.960
In the partnerships that DiMe is forging,

457
19:12.960 --> 19:16.860
are there any focusing on prevention well-being?

458
19:16.860 --> 19:19.560
Can you tell us a story about that?

459
19:19.560 --> 19:22.765
<v ->Yeah, I think there's an increasing focus on prevention.</v>

460
19:22.765 --> 19:26.520
To Carlos's earlier point, we have a sick care system,

461
19:26.520 --> 19:30.480
and we need to reverse that into a true healthcare system.

462
19:30.480 --> 19:32.550
And so we work with a lot of partners

463
19:32.550 --> 19:36.150
who are literally sitting at the intersection

464
19:36.150 --> 19:39.540
of consumer technology and healthcare,

465
19:39.540 --> 19:41.280
and starting to bridge that gap

466
19:41.280 --> 19:44.911
and making it easier for consumers, patients,

467
19:44.911 --> 19:48.540
whether they're at home, or whether they're on the go,

468
19:48.540 --> 19:51.840
and can actually use these connected devices

469
19:51.840 --> 19:55.920
to continuously keep track

470
19:55.920 --> 19:59.760
and work towards those preventative goals.

471
19:59.760 --> 20:01.860
<v ->Antoine, did you wanna insert something?</v>

472
20:02.880 --> 20:05.342
<v ->I wanted to add something on what Carlos said.</v>

473
20:05.342 --> 20:08.993
You said that's the future. I think the future is here.

474
20:08.993 --> 20:11.190
I think it's happening already today.

475
20:11.190 --> 20:14.220
And I have a personal story to share on sleep apnea.

476
20:14.220 --> 20:15.780
We have a device that track sleep apnea.

477
20:15.780 --> 20:18.390
So I have four years of every single night

478
20:18.390 --> 20:20.028
how my sleep apnea evolves.

479
20:20.028 --> 20:22.260
Three years ago, I moved to the US,

480
20:22.260 --> 20:24.213
and I started, I got my first kids.

481
20:25.560 --> 20:27.813
I started to gain a little weight.

482
20:28.650 --> 20:31.110
I have kids,
<v Jane>Welcome to America.</v>

483
20:31.110 --> 20:33.540
<v ->No, I'm not saying...
(audience laughing)</v>

484
20:33.540 --> 20:37.080
I didn't say that.
(audience laughing)

485
20:37.080 --> 20:40.140
I'm blaming the kids, I'm blaming the kids.

486
20:40.140 --> 20:41.070
But I didn't care.

487
20:41.070 --> 20:43.350
I didn't care because I have a wife, I have two kids.

488
20:43.350 --> 20:46.184
Who care if I gain a little weight? It's okay.

489
20:46.184 --> 20:47.017
And then one day,

490
20:47.017 --> 20:50.550
I realized that my sleep apnea is going like crazy.

491
20:50.550 --> 20:53.460
I move from being pretty much all the time in the green

492
20:53.460 --> 20:56.460
to being in the yellow and sometimes in red.

493
20:56.460 --> 20:58.110
And I'm like, "Wow, that's bad."

494
20:58.110 --> 21:00.780
Gaining a little bit of weight is kind of okay.

495
21:00.780 --> 21:05.607
But developing sleep apnea is much less.

496
21:05.607 --> 21:10.607
And having access to this data has allowed me, as a user,

497
21:10.890 --> 21:14.010
to change little things every day.

498
21:14.010 --> 21:17.910
Lose a little bit of weight, and it got much better.

499
21:17.910 --> 21:21.060
So I divided my AHI by two over six months

500
21:21.060 --> 21:24.180
by losing about 15 pounds by myself.

501
21:24.180 --> 21:27.540
No external help. And it just works.

502
21:27.540 --> 21:32.370
And I am very excited about the potential

503
21:32.370 --> 21:35.220
of everybody being empowered by this kind of data,

504
21:35.220 --> 21:37.140
to make these little choices every day,

505
21:37.140 --> 21:39.643
and be on their way to better health.

506
21:39.643 --> 21:42.000
And I think it has started already.

507
21:42.000 --> 21:43.350
<v ->Just to talk a little bit about the data.</v>

508
21:43.350 --> 21:44.700
Again, it's so important.

509
21:44.700 --> 21:47.220
Because, healthcare, there's an old quote.

510
21:47.220 --> 21:50.070
Healthcare is data rich and information poor.

511
21:50.070 --> 21:52.290
We could almost say that about the home,

512
21:52.290 --> 21:55.590
except as I mentioned before, companies like Samsung,

513
21:55.590 --> 21:59.640
Alphabet, Meta, have shown us that you can collect this,

514
21:59.640 --> 22:02.010
every human now gives off a digital exhaust stream

515
22:02.010 --> 22:03.990
every single minute of every single day.

516
22:03.990 --> 22:06.060
Millions of data points generated.

517
22:06.060 --> 22:09.420
And we've learned now through the rise of generative AI,

518
22:09.420 --> 22:11.520
you can take these messy data

519
22:11.520 --> 22:13.590
and turn them into real insights.

520
22:13.590 --> 22:16.860
So where maybe hospitals are data rich and information poor,

521
22:16.860 --> 22:18.682
although that is getting much, much better,

522
22:18.682 --> 22:20.250
that tech companies,

523
22:20.250 --> 22:21.960
the consumer tech companies have shown us

524
22:21.960 --> 22:24.150
that the home doesn't have to be that way.

525
22:24.150 --> 22:25.650
That you can take all of these data

526
22:25.650 --> 22:27.240
and create those insights.

527
22:27.240 --> 22:28.650
And sleep is so important,

528
22:28.650 --> 22:30.150
not just for the reasons I mentioned,

529
22:30.150 --> 22:32.580
but it's one of the most connected specialties

530
22:32.580 --> 22:33.780
in all of healthcare.

531
22:33.780 --> 22:35.280
Not to talk specifically about my company,

532
22:35.280 --> 22:37.290
but it's the example I know the best.

533
22:37.290 --> 22:39.450
Every one of our CPAP devices, for example,

534
22:39.450 --> 22:40.560
has a cellular radio.

535
22:40.560 --> 22:42.600
And it's had those for 10 years.

536
22:42.600 --> 22:46.800
We have 25 million connected devices in patients' homes,

537
22:46.800 --> 22:49.080
and 20 billion days and nights

538
22:49.080 --> 22:50.820
of sleep and respiratory data.

539
22:50.820 --> 22:52.890
Not 20 billion individual points,

540
22:52.890 --> 22:54.630
20 billion days and nights,

541
22:54.630 --> 22:56.730
of millions and millions of data points.

542
22:56.730 --> 22:59.130
That allows us to do really interesting things

543
22:59.130 --> 23:02.190
with research in making products better.

544
23:02.190 --> 23:04.470
And also, doing it in an ethical way,

545
23:04.470 --> 23:07.260
so that we can be a part of this ecosystem

546
23:07.260 --> 23:09.510
and be proud of how we participate.

547
23:09.510 --> 23:12.217
Because when you wake up and you get that score and it says,

548
23:12.217 --> 23:14.100
"Oh my gosh, my breathing is worse."

549
23:14.100 --> 23:15.270
I wear two different wearables,

550
23:15.270 --> 23:17.280
a smart watch, and a smart ring.

551
23:17.280 --> 23:19.710
And the insights and the apps

552
23:19.710 --> 23:24.150
that the consumer facing companies can build for engagement,

553
23:24.150 --> 23:25.860
it's a lot different than an EHR

554
23:25.860 --> 23:27.960
that sometimes struggles just to engage the physicians

555
23:27.960 --> 23:29.220
that have to use them.

556
23:29.220 --> 23:31.710
So you're absolutely right.

557
23:31.710 --> 23:33.900
Whether it's data about the way you're sleeping,

558
23:33.900 --> 23:35.670
now there are over the counter CGMs.

559
23:35.670 --> 23:38.700
I've tried both of the ones available in the US.

560
23:38.700 --> 23:41.850
It's amazing how engaging the data and the insights can be

561
23:41.850 --> 23:43.530
to help change your behaviors.

562
23:43.530 --> 23:44.670
Maybe lose a few pounds

563
23:44.670 --> 23:46.650
and do better when you sleep at night and breathe.

564
23:46.650 --> 23:48.397
Or watch what you eat and decide,

565
23:48.397 --> 23:49.230
"You know what?

566
23:49.230 --> 23:51.960
Maybe I'm not gonna have that extra serving

567
23:51.960 --> 23:54.000
that the American portions have given me.

568
23:54.000 --> 23:55.500
I'm gonna go back to my French thinking,

569
23:55.500 --> 23:58.100
and eat good bread and drink good wine."

570
23:58.100 --> 23:59.730
(audience laughing)

571
23:59.730 --> 24:02.733
<v ->Is Eric Wicklund, the writer, in the audience?</v>

572
24:03.870 --> 24:04.980
Eric! Hi.

573
24:04.980 --> 24:07.650
So the reason I'm taking your name not in vain,

574
24:07.650 --> 24:09.600
but in joy and love,

575
24:09.600 --> 24:12.180
is Eric recently wrote a piece in the last couple weeks

576
24:12.180 --> 24:16.530
on the hospital to home isn't going so well.

577
24:16.530 --> 24:19.320
And I take your point, I'm a health economist,

578
24:19.320 --> 24:20.460
we're the dismal scientists.

579
24:20.460 --> 24:23.310
We know, we think about barriers and limits.

580
24:23.310 --> 24:28.310
So I wanna address some of the barriers and obstacles

581
24:28.320 --> 24:30.977
to getting to our Holy Grail of health at home

582
24:30.977 --> 24:32.340
from each of you.

583
24:32.340 --> 24:34.233
And Eric, thanks for the inspiration.

584
24:35.700 --> 24:39.720
Each of you, I would love you to identify one obstacle

585
24:39.720 --> 24:44.358
or barrier to getting to the vision that you shared earlier

586
24:44.358 --> 24:46.800
and how to mitigate it, get over it,

587
24:46.800 --> 24:49.920
or how you might have done that at Samsung or Withings

588
24:49.920 --> 24:52.560
or ResMed or a lesson from DiMe.

589
24:52.560 --> 24:55.382
So who would like to talk about

590
24:55.382 --> 24:59.133
one of these darker sides and how to mitigate it?

591
25:00.090 --> 25:02.910
<v ->Yeah, I'm happy to get that conversation started.</v>

592
25:02.910 --> 25:06.180
I think that what we've been hearing from consumers,

593
25:06.180 --> 25:10.380
as well as healthcare industry stakeholders,

594
25:10.380 --> 25:13.680
is a kind of a fatigue around point solutions.

595
25:13.680 --> 25:16.050
And there are a lot of them on the floor.

596
25:16.050 --> 25:18.120
And I think, I'm not an engineer,

597
25:18.120 --> 25:20.340
but I know you have to start somewhere in an MVP

598
25:20.340 --> 25:22.500
and build out and start and then building out.

599
25:22.500 --> 25:24.150
But there is this kind of general,

600
25:24.150 --> 25:27.150
can we start to think about the person more holistically,

601
25:27.150 --> 25:30.390
from a thinking about the person perspective,

602
25:30.390 --> 25:33.210
but also thinking about from a operational

603
25:33.210 --> 25:34.650
and business perspective,

604
25:34.650 --> 25:36.480
can we engage with this in a way

605
25:36.480 --> 25:38.760
that can scale within my institution?

606
25:38.760 --> 25:41.190
So I think that we need to start to think about

607
25:41.190 --> 25:42.780
how do we get towards a little bit more

608
25:42.780 --> 25:44.430
of a platform-based approach

609
25:44.430 --> 25:46.500
in terms of addressing these things.

610
25:46.500 --> 25:49.020
I just want to, and maybe add a little bit of color,

611
25:49.020 --> 25:51.780
and a little bit of a shout out to the CTA is,

612
25:51.780 --> 25:56.205
I think yesterday, they just made public a report

613
25:56.205 --> 25:59.790
based on an interviews of people

614
25:59.790 --> 26:01.560
of multiple different generations,

615
26:01.560 --> 26:04.526
asking about their awareness, their use,

616
26:04.526 --> 26:08.206
barriers, demands as it comes to smart technologies

617
26:08.206 --> 26:10.140
and connected care in the home.

618
26:10.140 --> 26:13.980
And not surprisingly, the top two were ease of use.

619
26:13.980 --> 26:16.140
And the second one is around cost.

620
26:16.140 --> 26:18.210
So what I'm trying to get to is that

621
26:18.210 --> 26:19.590
we need to start to think about

622
26:19.590 --> 26:21.510
how do we have a platform-based approach,

623
26:21.510 --> 26:24.120
that can kind of keep the messiness below the platform,

624
26:24.120 --> 26:27.210
but make it incredibly easy to use on top of the platform

625
26:27.210 --> 26:30.630
where we're engaging with a patient, consumer, and user,

626
26:30.630 --> 26:31.650
whoever that may be.

627
26:31.650 --> 26:33.900
Caregiver too. We should be talking about that as well.

628
26:33.900 --> 26:36.720
And I'm sure you're excited to talk about that.

629
26:36.720 --> 26:38.760
Today, I mean, here at CES,

630
26:38.760 --> 26:41.310
through our really strong partnership with AARP,

631
26:41.310 --> 26:42.143
we started to think about

632
26:42.143 --> 26:44.070
what could that platform look like?

633
26:44.070 --> 26:45.863
And so you have a project called CareHub,

634
26:45.863 --> 26:48.690
where we're imagining where you bring streams of data

635
26:48.690 --> 26:52.920
from multiple different technology companies and solutions.

636
26:52.920 --> 26:56.190
How do we create an interface that is easy to use

637
26:56.190 --> 26:59.820
that solves problems, and hopefully that will,

638
26:59.820 --> 27:01.350
we can use that as a starting point

639
27:01.350 --> 27:02.800
to continue to build forward.

640
27:04.114 --> 27:05.100
<v Jane>Great. Antoine?</v>

641
27:05.100 --> 27:08.040
<v ->I fully agree with this. I would add another one.</v>

642
27:08.040 --> 27:10.470
I think it's around trust.

643
27:10.470 --> 27:15.470
How do we help care teams cut through the noise,

644
27:15.870 --> 27:20.870
understand what is legit and act on this flow of data

645
27:23.070 --> 27:24.150
that is coming to them.

646
27:24.150 --> 27:25.590
And I don't think it's about more data,

647
27:25.590 --> 27:26.910
I think it's about better data,

648
27:26.910 --> 27:28.140
but that's a different story.

649
27:28.140 --> 27:31.530
But the fact is, we're getting all this data from home.

650
27:31.530 --> 27:32.517
Care teams are not used to that.

651
27:32.517 --> 27:33.690
And it's not their fault.

652
27:33.690 --> 27:36.930
It's just the way it has been working forever.

653
27:36.930 --> 27:39.540
So how do us, as the industry,

654
27:39.540 --> 27:44.540
we can do the job to educate better on what we're building,

655
27:46.050 --> 27:49.170
develop this trust, and help them understand

656
27:49.170 --> 27:52.110
how it can be helpful in the management of the patient.

657
27:52.110 --> 27:54.720
For me, when I show my data to a physician,

658
27:54.720 --> 27:57.000
one of two things happen.

659
27:57.000 --> 27:58.837
One, they know Withings, and they're like,

660
27:58.837 --> 28:00.300
"Oh, cool. So, what does it say?

661
28:00.300 --> 28:01.500
Tell me more. Tell me more."

662
28:01.500 --> 28:02.333
The other one is like,

663
28:02.333 --> 28:04.470
"Yeah, nevermind. Let's start."

664
28:04.470 --> 28:08.184
But I'm coming with so much data

665
28:08.184 --> 28:10.380
that I understand that it's hard.

666
28:10.380 --> 28:12.360
So I think the burden is on us. It's not on the care teams.

667
28:12.360 --> 28:13.500
They already have so many things to do.

668
28:13.500 --> 28:18.500
It's on us to kind of raise the bar and better explain,

669
28:18.690 --> 28:21.813
better demonstrate the impact of what we can do at home.

670
28:24.180 --> 28:26.820
<v ->Very much agree with both of you.</v>

671
28:26.820 --> 28:29.580
One thing that we also think a lot about at DiMe

672
28:29.580 --> 28:32.820
is how we're actually articulating the ROI

673
28:32.820 --> 28:35.910
associated with these new and emerging technologies.

674
28:35.910 --> 28:39.483
And articulating that ROI to different stakeholders,

675
28:40.590 --> 28:42.810
while also being aligned

676
28:42.810 --> 28:45.120
with how that is being articulated, right?

677
28:45.120 --> 28:48.120
So that ensures

678
28:48.120 --> 28:52.263
that you're actually thinking about why a clinician,

679
28:53.640 --> 28:58.640
or how a clinician can be engaged with consumer technology.

680
28:58.980 --> 29:02.464
There's a huge risk in not bringing clinicians along,

681
29:02.464 --> 29:06.870
as we increase the use of consumer technology

682
29:06.870 --> 29:09.210
and creating more silos and more data

683
29:09.210 --> 29:12.371
that maybe clinicians don't know what to do with it.

684
29:12.371 --> 29:14.040
So making sure again,

685
29:14.040 --> 29:16.440
that we're thinking about that clinical ROI,

686
29:16.440 --> 29:19.080
but also that health economic ROI.

687
29:19.080 --> 29:22.500
And that's why it's important, and what we do at DiMe,

688
29:22.500 --> 29:25.320
is bringing together all of these diverse stakeholders

689
29:25.320 --> 29:27.720
to really uncover what we're talking about

690
29:27.720 --> 29:30.090
when we're thinking about the return on investment,

691
29:30.090 --> 29:34.110
and what value looks like to different stakeholders.

692
29:34.110 --> 29:36.930
<v ->Yeah, similar to what Antoine was saying about trust.</v>

693
29:36.930 --> 29:38.040
I think that for me,

694
29:38.040 --> 29:40.170
one of the barriers coming from this direction,

695
29:40.170 --> 29:43.563
from healthcare towards the consumer is that,

696
29:44.760 --> 29:46.010
forgive my, sorry, Ricky.

697
29:46.010 --> 29:48.312
So I'm a physician like Ricky, obviously.

698
29:48.312 --> 29:51.630
We need to sort of get over ourselves a little bit.

699
29:51.630 --> 29:55.770
Stop being so paternalistic and so protective of healthcare

700
29:55.770 --> 29:58.950
and start to meet patients and people where they are.

701
29:58.950 --> 30:01.860
Understand that things that they learn

702
30:01.860 --> 30:03.630
in the ways that they learn them.

703
30:03.630 --> 30:04.740
It might be social media,

704
30:04.740 --> 30:07.080
it might be a question that they ask to ChatGPT,

705
30:07.080 --> 30:10.230
or Perplexity, matter to them.

706
30:10.230 --> 30:13.890
That these new technologies may be different,

707
30:13.890 --> 30:16.800
or uncomfortable, but we have to be curious.

708
30:16.800 --> 30:18.720
We have to kind of get over ourselves,

709
30:18.720 --> 30:20.940
stop being so set in our ways.

710
30:20.940 --> 30:24.393
So worried about disruption and embrace the disruption.

711
30:25.747 --> 30:27.240
It's happening.

712
30:27.240 --> 30:30.090
And healthcare has notoriously been behind

713
30:30.090 --> 30:31.353
in other industries.

714
30:32.670 --> 30:34.297
Bill Gates once famously said,

715
30:34.297 --> 30:37.110
"If the automobile industry was like the computer industry

716
30:37.110 --> 30:39.240
where computers get more and more powerful every year,

717
30:39.240 --> 30:40.950
and cheaper and cheaper every year,

718
30:40.950 --> 30:42.867
cars would be free, and run on water."

719
30:43.920 --> 30:46.890
Healthcare has lagged, sometimes 20 years behind,

720
30:46.890 --> 30:48.660
in the adoption of certain things.

721
30:48.660 --> 30:51.720
And again, it's often that paternalistic approach.

722
30:51.720 --> 30:53.160
It's not the regulatory agencies.

723
30:53.160 --> 30:55.170
I see folks from the FDA in the audience.

724
30:55.170 --> 30:57.690
They have a digital health practice within the FDA,

725
30:57.690 --> 30:59.070
they've approved, if I get the number wrong,

726
30:59.070 --> 30:59.903
please forgive me,

727
30:59.903 --> 31:04.680
but nearly 1,000 devices that are software-based,

728
31:04.680 --> 31:07.980
AI-based applications in healthcare.

729
31:07.980 --> 31:10.890
It's not the regulators that are often holding us up.

730
31:10.890 --> 31:13.500
It's not the patients who are refusing to embrace this.

731
31:13.500 --> 31:15.390
It's often medicine,

732
31:15.390 --> 31:18.540
organized medicine in the healthcare system that is slow,

733
31:18.540 --> 31:21.960
because, I don't know why,

734
31:21.960 --> 31:23.610
but we just, again, I hate to say it like this,

735
31:23.610 --> 31:25.410
get over ourselves and be curious.

736
31:25.410 --> 31:27.690
Embrace the disruption. It's happening.

737
31:27.690 --> 31:29.100
And if you are not a part of it,

738
31:29.100 --> 31:32.250
it's gonna happen around you and you'll be disintermediated.

739
31:32.250 --> 31:33.083
<v ->I love that.</v>

740
31:33.083 --> 31:35.010
And just, if I could just add one thing,

741
31:35.010 --> 31:37.260
to weave a bit together.

742
31:37.260 --> 31:39.150
To Gabby's point about an ROI,

743
31:39.150 --> 31:41.010
which is something I think about a lot.

744
31:41.010 --> 31:44.434
There was this seminal article in JAMA many years ago,

745
31:44.434 --> 31:48.060
when value-based payment was starting to be a phrase.

746
31:48.060 --> 31:50.820
And now we're kind of sick of it, 'cause when, when.

747
31:50.820 --> 31:53.220
But the title of the article, and look it up,

748
31:53.220 --> 31:55.530
because it's really worth reading.

749
31:55.530 --> 31:57.840
It's "Value-based Payment

750
31:57.840 --> 32:01.560
Requires Valuing What Matters to Patients."

751
32:01.560 --> 32:03.420
And it's sort of pay,

752
32:03.420 --> 32:06.480
if we're doing this home health thing,

753
32:06.480 --> 32:09.330
the new home as the health hub,

754
32:09.330 --> 32:12.000
people are inviting us into their home.

755
32:12.000 --> 32:15.810
So we need to be designful, respectful,

756
32:15.810 --> 32:18.510
loving, enchanting, even.

757
32:18.510 --> 32:20.220
But we have to keep that in mind

758
32:20.220 --> 32:23.640
as we're all at CES looking at shiny new things,

759
32:23.640 --> 32:25.980
to make sure that these are products

760
32:25.980 --> 32:27.690
designed with ethics by design.

761
32:27.690 --> 32:30.000
You talked about, Carlos, privacy by design.

762
32:30.000 --> 32:33.660
So I think about the ROI in the eyes of the patient,

763
32:33.660 --> 32:35.340
or the caregiver who may be paying

764
32:35.340 --> 32:37.080
for this out of their own pocket.

765
32:37.080 --> 32:41.951
So as we come to the last big question,

766
32:41.951 --> 32:45.090
which is that we are all in this together.

767
32:45.090 --> 32:47.490
No one owns the home.

768
32:47.490 --> 32:51.450
It's a sandbox full of opportunity for collaboration.

769
32:51.450 --> 32:55.022
So let's talk about friends and collaboratives.

770
32:55.022 --> 32:58.500
How do you figure out who to collaborate with

771
32:58.500 --> 33:02.280
in delivering new, new solutions, new programs?

772
33:02.280 --> 33:05.670
What filters do you use? Some best practices?

773
33:05.670 --> 33:06.960
So who want...

774
33:06.960 --> 33:08.040
Gabby, do you wanna start?

775
33:08.040 --> 33:11.220
'Cause you're kind of the collaboration guru here.

776
33:11.220 --> 33:12.808
<v ->Happy to.</v>

777
33:12.808 --> 33:15.930
A lot of times, it starts at places like CES,

778
33:15.930 --> 33:20.070
where we're listening to what the field is saying.

779
33:20.070 --> 33:23.040
It also happens in conversations with people,

780
33:23.040 --> 33:26.400
with friends and family, to hear what their challenges are,

781
33:26.400 --> 33:28.060
and where there's opportunity

782
33:29.280 --> 33:33.990
to match both what people at CES are saying,

783
33:33.990 --> 33:37.140
and what people are saying.

784
33:37.140 --> 33:39.090
Taking that data-driven approach,

785
33:39.090 --> 33:41.190
and then actually convening around

786
33:41.190 --> 33:44.220
a very specific problem statement

787
33:44.220 --> 33:46.230
and bringing different stakeholders together

788
33:46.230 --> 33:49.470
around the table is really how we're going to be able

789
33:49.470 --> 33:54.470
to not only adopt a smart home, a health at home model,

790
33:55.230 --> 33:59.010
but really accelerate it and achieve the promise

791
33:59.010 --> 34:02.248
that all of us spoke about at the beginning.

792
34:02.248 --> 34:04.500
And if we don't,

793
34:04.500 --> 34:07.530
if we're not all kind of rowing in the same direction,

794
34:07.530 --> 34:10.980
if you will, we risk making mistakes

795
34:10.980 --> 34:13.290
that we've made in healthcare before.

796
34:13.290 --> 34:15.450
Like we saw in scaling EHRs,

797
34:15.450 --> 34:17.370
like we've seen in other situations.

798
34:17.370 --> 34:21.360
And so we have the opportunity now to commit ourselves,

799
34:21.360 --> 34:25.290
to actually commit ourselves to collaboration.

800
34:25.290 --> 34:28.410
So that's what's exciting about these types of conversations

801
34:28.410 --> 34:30.990
and I look forward to hopefully being able to

802
34:30.990 --> 34:33.480
working with all of you and you all, in again,

803
34:33.480 --> 34:36.723
making this connected health space a reality, and sooner.

804
34:39.090 --> 34:41.158
<v Jane>Jump in.</v>
<v ->I'll go next.</v>

805
34:41.158 --> 34:43.230
I think collaboration is going to be key.

806
34:43.230 --> 34:45.330
To the point I was making before,

807
34:45.330 --> 34:47.610
the traditional sides of the healthcare industry

808
34:47.610 --> 34:49.590
are going to have to be comfortable collaborating

809
34:49.590 --> 34:51.870
with a consumer electronics company,

810
34:51.870 --> 34:55.320
collaborating with conveners like DiMe or like CTA.

811
34:55.320 --> 34:57.030
I think, for those of you who don't know,

812
34:57.030 --> 35:00.120
the health division within CTA, for many years now,

813
35:00.120 --> 35:01.860
has been the fastest growing division.

814
35:01.860 --> 35:03.870
And there are members of the health division

815
35:03.870 --> 35:06.570
that you'll never see at a booth on the floor here

816
35:06.570 --> 35:08.940
because there are 361 days a year

817
35:08.940 --> 35:11.580
where organizations like CTA aren't at CTS

818
35:11.580 --> 35:14.550
doing lots of other stuff, like policy, advocacy,

819
35:14.550 --> 35:17.640
working with regulators like the FDA and others.

820
35:17.640 --> 35:20.250
And I think those partnerships are important,

821
35:20.250 --> 35:22.590
as well as the partnerships across the industry.

822
35:22.590 --> 35:23.423
From the consumer,

823
35:23.423 --> 35:26.640
and from the traditional healthcare side of it.

824
35:26.640 --> 35:29.040
And, I maybe I was a little harsh,

825
35:29.040 --> 35:30.060
as we need to get over ourselves.

826
35:30.060 --> 35:31.170
What we need to do is, like I said,

827
35:31.170 --> 35:33.900
embrace not just the disruption,

828
35:33.900 --> 35:36.780
but embrace these non-traditional tech

829
35:36.780 --> 35:38.310
and innovation companies.

830
35:38.310 --> 35:40.590
Because healthcare is nearly 20%

831
35:40.590 --> 35:43.140
of the gross domestic product of the United States.

832
35:43.140 --> 35:45.480
And we spend more per capita than anybody else.

833
35:45.480 --> 35:47.640
But it is no secret that our outcomes

834
35:47.640 --> 35:50.220
are not as good as they should be.

835
35:50.220 --> 35:51.897
But when you look at how the technology

836
35:51.897 --> 35:53.700
and the consumer technology industry

837
35:53.700 --> 35:56.310
has advanced in the last few decades,

838
35:56.310 --> 35:57.630
they're doing amazing things.

839
35:57.630 --> 35:59.310
And it does get cheaper and cheaper

840
35:59.310 --> 36:01.860
to do more amazing things every year.

841
36:01.860 --> 36:04.260
If we do not listen and if we do not pay attention,

842
36:04.260 --> 36:06.120
healthcare will get disrupted around us

843
36:06.120 --> 36:07.440
if we don't participate.

844
36:07.440 --> 36:09.120
So it's really all of the partnerships,

845
36:09.120 --> 36:10.230
all the collaboration,

846
36:10.230 --> 36:12.380
and all the participation that's important.

847
36:13.290 --> 36:14.470
<v ->Yeah, just to add on,</v>

848
36:14.470 --> 36:17.610
sometimes I come to conferences and I listen to sessions.

849
36:17.610 --> 36:19.590
I thought, "Oh yeah, I heard all those things before."

850
36:19.590 --> 36:21.360
And I don't know if I walk away

851
36:21.360 --> 36:23.460
remembering anything really meaningful.

852
36:23.460 --> 36:24.293
And maybe for me,

853
36:24.293 --> 36:27.810
the big thing in this conversation is the urgency.

854
36:27.810 --> 36:29.220
And I think we all know the numbers,

855
36:29.220 --> 36:30.540
but just to highlight them, right?

856
36:30.540 --> 36:32.970
We think about over half of adults

857
36:32.970 --> 36:34.590
in the United States are caregivers.

858
36:34.590 --> 36:36.600
We've actually, even on our own team,

859
36:36.600 --> 36:39.270
have had some personal tragedies in the family

860
36:39.270 --> 36:40.380
as they've been trying to figure out

861
36:40.380 --> 36:42.240
how do they care for their aging parents or,

862
36:42.240 --> 36:45.210
and sometimes and feeling really frustrated

863
36:45.210 --> 36:47.160
about their limited ability to do so.

864
36:47.160 --> 36:48.420
We can think about the shortage,

865
36:48.420 --> 36:51.809
the workforce shortage in healthcare.

866
36:51.809 --> 36:53.940
It's, what is it? Two, three million now?

867
36:53.940 --> 36:57.300
Will be 10 in the next five years. They need help.

868
36:57.300 --> 36:58.530
Caregivers need help.

869
36:58.530 --> 37:01.440
And I think people who want to stay at home and age at home,

870
37:01.440 --> 37:03.113
70% of adults, right?

871
37:03.113 --> 37:05.070
Aging adults wanna stay at home.

872
37:05.070 --> 37:07.530
The opportunity is tremendous. The need is very high.

873
37:07.530 --> 37:10.020
There is tremendous urgency here.

874
37:10.020 --> 37:12.060
Now, I don't think any of us on stage,

875
37:12.060 --> 37:14.760
or anyone out there, has quite figured it out.

876
37:14.760 --> 37:16.890
And I think that it's through collaborations

877
37:16.890 --> 37:19.080
just as Carlos shared, that we're gonna be able to do this.

878
37:19.080 --> 37:20.760
So it takes a little bit of humility,

879
37:20.760 --> 37:22.890
it takes a little bit of let's trust the people around us,

880
37:22.890 --> 37:23.874
let's work together,

881
37:23.874 --> 37:26.460
and let's figure out how we can complement each other,

882
37:26.460 --> 37:29.250
create synergies, what problems can we solve together,

883
37:29.250 --> 37:32.286
whether it be regulation, or whether it be around

884
37:32.286 --> 37:35.670
having a very forward approach to the way we communicate

885
37:35.670 --> 37:39.300
to the general public about what x, y, z technology could do

886
37:39.300 --> 37:40.620
and how it could help you.

887
37:40.620 --> 37:43.320
And I think that slowly, we'll start to make progress.

888
37:44.670 --> 37:45.834
<v ->I'm very aligned with all this.</v>

889
37:45.834 --> 37:50.100
We've always been very open at Withings at sharing data,

890
37:50.100 --> 37:52.350
of course, with the consent of the end users.

891
37:52.350 --> 37:54.810
But we have thousands of partners

892
37:54.810 --> 37:58.242
that collect data from our devices with their users.

893
37:58.242 --> 38:01.087
And we're about to reach a million patient

894
38:01.087 --> 38:05.682
that have been equipped with our devices from care teams.

895
38:05.682 --> 38:08.430
So partnership has always been extremely important for us.

896
38:08.430 --> 38:10.530
But I think now we need to think of

897
38:10.530 --> 38:14.160
how can we partner together on new business models as well.

898
38:14.160 --> 38:16.890
Because specifically here in the US,

899
38:16.890 --> 38:20.460
we know quite well how to pay for sick care.

900
38:20.460 --> 38:23.700
We know how to reimburse the monitoring of patients

901
38:23.700 --> 38:25.350
that are already sick.

902
38:25.350 --> 38:27.300
But we don't know how to pay for the patient

903
38:27.300 --> 38:28.440
that are not sick.

904
38:28.440 --> 38:31.980
How do we avoid these patients to even become sick?

905
38:31.980 --> 38:34.323
And that's probably the easiest thing to do.

906
38:36.150 --> 38:37.500
And that's by being in the room,

907
38:37.500 --> 38:39.330
that's by this everyday data.

908
38:39.330 --> 38:41.610
There is just no mechanism today to make this work.

909
38:41.610 --> 38:43.290
So for us, what's important

910
38:43.290 --> 38:46.320
is how do we find this forward-thinking partners

911
38:46.320 --> 38:48.090
that are looking at the tomorrow,

912
38:48.090 --> 38:50.550
that are looking at how can we help our population

913
38:50.550 --> 38:51.810
to stay healthy,

914
38:51.810 --> 38:55.050
and to stay as far away as the hospital as possible.

915
38:55.050 --> 38:57.060
While of course being connected with care teams,

916
38:57.060 --> 38:59.860
and getting the care they need when they need that care.

917
39:01.680 --> 39:04.170
<v ->That's great. Well, we're coming to a close.</v>

918
39:04.170 --> 39:06.840
I just wanna wrap up a little bit.

919
39:06.840 --> 39:10.530
Collaboration is key, cooperating in the sandbox,

920
39:10.530 --> 39:12.210
design thinking.

921
39:12.210 --> 39:15.030
And I can say your organization,

922
39:15.030 --> 39:17.430
I've met with you guys this week.

923
39:17.430 --> 39:20.760
Withings' and ResMed's products I know pretty well.

924
39:20.760 --> 39:23.100
Design thinking is embedded in them.

925
39:23.100 --> 39:26.910
And thinking about the user, the end user,

926
39:26.910 --> 39:30.780
and the patient as the payer, or the caregiver as the payer.

927
39:30.780 --> 39:33.930
Caregiver's huge, thank you for bringing that up.

928
39:33.930 --> 39:36.777
Also think about people's drivers of health

929
39:36.777 --> 39:39.300
and their Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

930
39:39.300 --> 39:40.380
Clean air, clean water.

931
39:40.380 --> 39:43.080
Sleep, I'm putting in there, and connectivity.

932
39:43.080 --> 39:45.660
So to have cellular in a device,

933
39:45.660 --> 39:48.570
I did not know you had that kind of connectivity.

934
39:48.570 --> 39:51.090
So we have to assume that in a connected home,

935
39:51.090 --> 39:52.950
we have connectivity.

936
39:52.950 --> 39:55.467
Connectivity in terms of the tech,

937
39:55.467 --> 40:00.467
but connectivity in terms of mental social health.

938
40:00.510 --> 40:03.690
Social connections from the heart are really key

939
40:03.690 --> 40:05.400
when we talk about connectivity.

940
40:05.400 --> 40:09.390
And as we close, and our theme was, the home is health.

941
40:09.390 --> 40:13.770
I want us to spend 30 seconds in your busy day today

942
40:13.770 --> 40:16.200
with a prayerful heart and mind

943
40:16.200 --> 40:18.870
for anyone in Southern California

944
40:18.870 --> 40:21.960
who's dealing with the tragic fires.

945
40:21.960 --> 40:25.890
We need to be mindful that there's no home care

946
40:25.890 --> 40:27.600
without a home.

947
40:27.600 --> 40:31.860
And that's a presupposition we have to not take for granted.

948
40:31.860 --> 40:34.830
So everyone, be well, enjoy CES,

949
40:34.830 --> 40:37.906
and we thank you for coming to share our visions.

950
40:37.906 --> 40:42.906
(audience applauding)
(upbeat music)
