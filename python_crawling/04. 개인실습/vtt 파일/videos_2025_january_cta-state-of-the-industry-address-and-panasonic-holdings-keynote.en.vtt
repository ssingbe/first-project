00:00.294 --> 00:02.877
(upbeat music)

2
00:10.770 --> 00:13.020
<v ->Please welcome the CEO and vice chair</v>

3
00:13.020 --> 00:15.330
of the Consumer Technology Association

4
00:15.330 --> 00:18.170
and best selling author, Gary Shapiro.

5
00:18.170 --> 00:20.897
(upbeat music)

6
00:20.897 --> 00:23.730
(audience cheers)

7
00:26.040 --> 00:30.753
<v ->Thank you and welcome to CES 2025.</v>

8
00:33.358 --> 00:35.580
(audience cheering)

9
00:35.580 --> 00:37.800
Thank you so much for coming to CES.

10
00:37.800 --> 00:39.810
It is the coolest, funnest,

11
00:39.810 --> 00:42.150
and most exciting technology show, or in fact,

12
00:42.150 --> 00:44.280
any show in the world.

13
00:44.280 --> 00:47.730
It gathers the innovators, the disruptors,

14
00:47.730 --> 00:51.630
and the dreamers, the people who reshape our world now

15
00:51.630 --> 00:54.723
and actually are creating a better future.

16
00:55.680 --> 00:59.313
These days, it feels like everyone is pivoting.

17
01:00.180 --> 01:04.470
Certainly, the United States and Canada are in the midst

18
01:04.470 --> 01:07.110
of a dramatic pivot in government.

19
01:07.110 --> 01:09.450
But so is the rest of the world.

20
01:09.450 --> 01:12.227
That's what I hear from the innovators in Eureka Park,

21
01:12.227 --> 01:14.010
our home for startups,

22
01:14.010 --> 01:16.379
and from the global technology brands

23
01:16.379 --> 01:20.160
that are driving our economies and our world forward.

24
01:20.160 --> 01:22.620
It's what I hear from leaders in technology

25
01:22.620 --> 01:25.770
and in government every day.

26
01:25.770 --> 01:28.357
And it's what inspired CTA's new book,

27
01:28.357 --> 01:33.297
"Pivot or Die: How Leaders Thrive When Everything Changes".

28
01:34.958 --> 01:36.933
(audience cheering)
Thank you.

29
01:38.160 --> 01:43.160
Of course, progress has never come from standing still.

30
01:43.500 --> 01:46.020
It comes from those who took a chance

31
01:46.020 --> 01:48.330
and they tried something new.

32
01:48.330 --> 01:49.650
Think about it.

33
01:49.650 --> 01:51.960
Humans discovered fire,

34
01:51.960 --> 01:56.130
and that sparked the birth of civilization.

35
01:56.130 --> 01:58.590
We didn't just use fire.

36
01:58.590 --> 02:02.940
We harnessed it: to cook, to warm our homes,

37
02:02.940 --> 02:05.040
to shape the world.

38
02:05.040 --> 02:06.660
Along came the wheel,

39
02:06.660 --> 02:10.323
an innovation that allowed us to travel further and faster.

40
02:11.491 --> 02:13.320
A lot of other innovations occurred.

41
02:13.320 --> 02:18.320
Cars, machines that shrunk time and space.

42
02:18.360 --> 02:20.970
We turned our eyes to the sky.

43
02:20.970 --> 02:22.770
The airplane wasn't just

44
02:22.770 --> 02:25.350
a way to get from one place to another.

45
02:25.350 --> 02:27.900
It showed our ability to break barriers,

46
02:27.900 --> 02:30.450
to stretch the limits of what's possible.

47
02:30.450 --> 02:31.560
As humans, we've done

48
02:31.560 --> 02:34.860
this over and over, pivoting,

49
02:34.860 --> 02:38.670
innovating to survive and to thrive.

50
02:38.670 --> 02:41.850
And that's especially true in the rapidly evolving world

51
02:41.850 --> 02:46.850
of technology, where we have to adapt or become obsolete.

52
02:47.400 --> 02:49.173
Pivot or die.

53
02:50.654 --> 02:53.821
(audience applauding)

54
02:55.500 --> 02:58.860
As we know, successful companies don't just ride the wave

55
02:58.860 --> 03:01.440
of change, they create it.

56
03:01.440 --> 03:04.890
Just look at our CES 2025 keynotes.

57
03:04.890 --> 03:07.140
Nvidia, amazing last night.

58
03:07.140 --> 03:12.030
Panasonic, Sirius XM, X, formerly known

59
03:12.030 --> 03:17.030
as Twitter, Delta, Volvo Group, Accenture, and Waymo.

60
03:17.400 --> 03:20.670
All companies with the agility to adapt and pivot

61
03:20.670 --> 03:22.530
in response to changing markets

62
03:22.530 --> 03:24.600
and a rapidly changing world.

63
03:24.600 --> 03:25.770
And that's not to mention

64
03:25.770 --> 03:30.180
the over 1,000 speakers joining us on CES stages

65
03:30.180 --> 03:32.700
over the next four days.

66
03:32.700 --> 03:34.470
These leaders succeed not just

67
03:34.470 --> 03:37.110
because of their amazing products and services,

68
03:37.110 --> 03:40.980
they succeed because they know that technology is only

69
03:40.980 --> 03:44.100
as powerful as the people around it.

70
03:44.100 --> 03:46.210
And today we're actually seeing technology

71
03:46.210 --> 03:48.960
and humanity intersect.

72
03:48.960 --> 03:51.300
AI, autonomous vehicles,

73
03:51.300 --> 03:54.570
and quantum computing aren't just changing industries,

74
03:54.570 --> 03:57.933
they're solving some of the world's biggest challenges.

75
03:58.770 --> 04:02.580
AI is revolutionizing automation and decision making.

76
04:02.580 --> 04:05.490
Autonomous vehicles are reshaping mobility,

77
04:05.490 --> 04:08.100
making roads safer and systems more efficient,

78
04:08.100 --> 04:09.991
and it's opening new doors

79
04:09.991 --> 04:14.070
for the elderly and people with disabilities.

80
04:14.070 --> 04:16.536
And health technology is supporting patients

81
04:16.536 --> 04:19.590
and extending quality of life.

82
04:19.590 --> 04:21.720
While these technologies solve problems,

83
04:21.720 --> 04:23.490
they can also create a new one,

84
04:23.490 --> 04:25.950
an increasing demand for energy.

85
04:25.950 --> 04:28.770
And that's why here at CES 2025,

86
04:28.770 --> 04:33.360
you'll also see solutions in sustainability, efficiency,

87
04:33.360 --> 04:35.130
and energy production.

88
04:35.130 --> 04:38.790
And that will help us navigate this big energy transition

89
04:38.790 --> 04:40.440
in front of us.

90
04:40.440 --> 04:44.340
To share more, I am so thrilled to introduce

91
04:44.340 --> 04:47.850
a true champion of innovation and a star at CTA,

92
04:47.850 --> 04:51.420
President of the Consumer Technology Association,

93
04:51.420 --> 04:54.995
Kinsey Fabrizio!

94
04:54.995 --> 04:59.995
(upbeat music)
(audience cheering)

95
05:00.540 --> 05:04.063
<v ->Thank you. (laughs)</v>

96
05:04.063 --> 05:08.700
Thank you, Gary. And welcome, everyone.

97
05:08.700 --> 05:13.230
There is truly no place on earth like CES

98
05:13.230 --> 05:17.550
as a gathering spot for so many people around the world

99
05:17.550 --> 05:20.850
who believe in the power and the possibility

100
05:20.850 --> 05:22.739
of tech innovation.

101
05:22.739 --> 05:27.180
From solving big global challenges like access to food

102
05:27.180 --> 05:29.940
and medical care and education

103
05:29.940 --> 05:32.130
to making our everyday lives just

104
05:32.130 --> 05:33.540
a little bit greater,

105
05:33.540 --> 05:37.410
technology is an incredible force for good.

106
05:37.410 --> 05:38.715
Take healthcare.

107
05:38.715 --> 05:43.080
Remote patient monitoring has revolutionized how we care

108
05:43.080 --> 05:47.686
for people, especially in rural and underserved areas.

109
05:47.686 --> 05:52.110
And AI is powering everything from diagnostics

110
05:52.110 --> 05:53.583
to drug discovery.

111
05:54.450 --> 05:56.910
Or take accessibility.

112
05:56.910 --> 06:01.440
At CES 2025, you'll find smart home technology,

113
06:01.440 --> 06:06.440
autonomous mobility, and even 3D printed prosthetics.

114
06:06.510 --> 06:09.390
And I'll tell you a personal story,

115
06:09.390 --> 06:12.840
my father-in-law has mild hearing loss.

116
06:12.840 --> 06:15.240
And during the holidays, you know,

117
06:15.240 --> 06:19.620
he was using his new hearing aid feature on his AirPods.

118
06:19.620 --> 06:23.970
And he said he was so thankful to CTA for our work

119
06:23.970 --> 06:27.906
to make over-the-counter hearing aids possible.

120
06:27.906 --> 06:29.643
(audience cheers)
Thank you.

121
06:30.960 --> 06:32.280
And trust me,

122
06:32.280 --> 06:35.640
between the jolly chowder and the rowdy children,

123
06:35.640 --> 06:40.640
it's a big Italian family, those AirPods came just in time.

124
06:40.680 --> 06:44.550
At CES, you'll see over-the-counter hearing aid technology

125
06:44.550 --> 06:45.990
on the show floor,

126
06:45.990 --> 06:50.790
along with wearable tech for every need you can imagine.

127
06:50.790 --> 06:52.170
<v ->I love that story, Kinsey.</v>

128
06:52.170 --> 06:54.660
You know, we spend a lot of our time talking

129
06:54.660 --> 06:56.490
about the big picture of technology,

130
06:56.490 --> 07:00.060
like its power to drive economic growth,

131
07:00.060 --> 07:03.090
boost our stock portfolios, and change industries.

132
07:03.090 --> 07:05.446
But that's all important.

133
07:05.446 --> 07:06.780
But it really is just as important to talk

134
07:06.780 --> 07:10.110
about how technology changes our individual lives,

135
07:10.110 --> 07:11.610
the way you just did.

136
07:11.610 --> 07:13.830
Because at the end of the day, technology matters,

137
07:13.830 --> 07:16.800
because it helps people like your father-in-law

138
07:16.800 --> 07:19.353
and millions more around the world.

139
07:20.670 --> 07:21.690
<v ->It's true.</v>

140
07:21.690 --> 07:24.540
And it's far from replacing people.

141
07:24.540 --> 07:26.880
Technology empowers them.

142
07:26.880 --> 07:28.380
Think about ag tech

143
07:28.380 --> 07:30.870
that helps farmers make better decisions

144
07:30.870 --> 07:32.640
about the crops they plant

145
07:32.640 --> 07:35.430
and augmented reality glasses

146
07:35.430 --> 07:39.224
that provide real-time language translation.

147
07:39.224 --> 07:42.000
And how about cybersecurity tools

148
07:42.000 --> 07:46.260
that are helping us protect ourselves and our data?

149
07:46.260 --> 07:50.850
From AI to robotics and healthcare and sustainability,

150
07:50.850 --> 07:54.021
CES 2025 will show what's possible

151
07:54.021 --> 07:59.021
when the entire tech ecosystem comes together in one place.

152
08:00.090 --> 08:03.390
You'll see the companies driving forward our autonomous

153
08:03.390 --> 08:07.848
future, adapting to new environments in real time

154
08:07.848 --> 08:12.480
and opening doors for people with mobility challenges.

155
08:12.480 --> 08:15.090
And you're going to see innovations

156
08:15.090 --> 08:18.030
that are creating new power and supporting

157
08:18.030 --> 08:20.640
a more sustainable world.

158
08:20.640 --> 08:21.600
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

159
08:21.600 --> 08:23.100
You know, Kinsey, each year at CES,

160
08:23.100 --> 08:27.477
we see that innovation can come from anyone, anywhere.

161
08:29.010 --> 08:31.470
But for good ideas to become great products,

162
08:31.470 --> 08:34.987
innovators need pro-innovation policies.

163
08:34.987 --> 08:38.580
To keep our economies thriving and inflation in check,

164
08:38.580 --> 08:41.624
we need policies that enable startups,

165
08:41.624 --> 08:43.890
allow businesses to flourish,

166
08:43.890 --> 08:46.980
and create the next generation of tech leaders.

167
08:46.980 --> 08:48.900
Policies that create rules of the road

168
08:48.900 --> 08:50.683
for tech companies and offer guardrails

169
08:50.683 --> 08:54.690
to protect safety, privacy, and fairness.

170
08:54.690 --> 08:55.836
Here in the U.S.,

171
08:55.836 --> 08:59.430
that means finding a way to break through the gridlock

172
08:59.430 --> 09:01.710
and pass sensible immigration reforms

173
09:01.710 --> 09:04.537
to promote highly skilled immigration.

174
09:04.537 --> 09:06.408
Thank you, Michael.

175
09:06.408 --> 09:08.858
(audience applauding)
<v ->He's a good cheerleader.</v>

176
09:10.680 --> 09:13.470
<v ->And recognizing that tariffs are taxes paid</v>

177
09:13.470 --> 09:16.800
for by American businesses and the American people

178
09:16.800 --> 09:17.883
and the world.

179
09:21.540 --> 09:25.020
In fact, we actually just released some research Sunday

180
09:25.020 --> 09:26.940
at our Tech Trends presentation,

181
09:26.940 --> 09:28.980
and it shows that the proposed tariffs

182
09:28.980 --> 09:31.860
on tech products could tank U.S.

183
09:31.860 --> 09:36.860
consumer purchasing power by as much as $143 billion

184
09:37.170 --> 09:38.703
in just the first year.

185
09:39.540 --> 09:42.240
<v ->And with the growing scrutiny of the tech ecosystem</v>

186
09:42.240 --> 09:46.830
and a new U.S. administration coming soon, the conversations

187
09:46.830 --> 09:50.700
that we're having here at CES over the next four days

188
09:50.700 --> 09:53.430
have never been more important.

189
09:53.430 --> 09:55.650
And to help drive those conversations,

190
09:55.650 --> 10:00.650
we're also looking to CTA's Global Innovation Scorecard.

191
10:00.750 --> 10:02.790
First launched in 2019,

192
10:02.790 --> 10:05.760
the scorecard is designed to rank countries

193
10:05.760 --> 10:09.420
on the policies and practices that fuel the fire

194
10:09.420 --> 10:13.890
of innovation or stand in the way of progress.

195
10:13.890 --> 10:14.723
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

196
10:14.723 --> 10:16.920
It's so important that other countries

197
10:16.920 --> 10:18.344
have the opportunities

198
10:18.344 --> 10:22.470
to have their citizens take advantage of innovation

199
10:22.470 --> 10:24.180
and also be the innovators.

200
10:24.180 --> 10:26.820
For the 2025 Global Innovation Scorecard,

201
10:26.820 --> 10:30.750
we asked which countries have the political, economic,

202
10:30.750 --> 10:34.080
and demographic realities that catalyze innovators

203
10:34.080 --> 10:35.790
to invent the future?

204
10:35.790 --> 10:38.188
That means not just evaluating the investment

205
10:38.188 --> 10:41.730
in cutting-edge sectors or red tape for startups,

206
10:41.730 --> 10:44.280
but recognizing that countries that ensure freedom

207
10:44.280 --> 10:48.022
of speech, create opportunities for workshop diversity

208
10:48.022 --> 10:51.360
and respect people's fundamental freedoms.

209
10:51.360 --> 10:53.820
And by celebrating the best of the best,

210
10:53.820 --> 10:56.364
our innovation champions, we encourage other countries

211
10:56.364 --> 10:58.800
to follow their lead.

212
10:58.800 --> 11:00.123
Let's learn more.

213
11:01.797 --> 11:05.820
<v Narrator>Since 2019, the Consumer Technology Association</v>

214
11:05.820 --> 11:08.463
has produced the Global Innovation Scorecard,

215
11:10.080 --> 11:11.880
leading the world in ranking countries

216
11:11.880 --> 11:13.350
on their commitment to fostering

217
11:13.350 --> 11:15.603
an ecosystem driving innovation.

218
11:17.340 --> 11:21.123
Innovation typically means a new method, idea, or product.

219
11:22.020 --> 11:24.243
But what makes an innovation champion?

220
11:25.440 --> 11:27.930
It's when technology and policy come together

221
11:27.930 --> 11:30.933
to fuel transformation for a country and its people.

222
11:32.220 --> 11:35.130
This new class of global innovation champions reflect

223
11:35.130 --> 11:38.010
the art of what's possible and are finding new ways

224
11:38.010 --> 11:40.173
to solve the world's biggest challenges.

225
11:41.100 --> 11:44.580
Congratulations to this year's innovation champions.

226
11:44.580 --> 11:46.623
We can't wait to see what you do next.

227
11:51.209 --> 11:53.460
(audience applauding)

228
11:53.460 --> 11:55.260
<v Announcer>Please welcome our 2025</v>

229

12:56.422 --> 12:59.589
(audience applauding)

246
13:08.790 --> 13:10.490
<v ->Oh, we go for our group picture.</v>

247
13:11.654 --> 13:14.392
We're gonna do a group photo.

248
13:14.392 --> 13:15.355
Okay.

249
13:15.355 --> 13:16.188
<v ->I think we...</v>

250
13:17.881 --> 13:19.131
<v ->There you go.</v>

251
13:20.596 --> 13:21.958
<v ->There you go. Very good.</v>
<v ->I think you switch.</v>

252
13:21.958 --> 13:22.791
You guys.

253
13:25.065 --> 13:27.240
<v ->There we go.</v>
<v ->Thank you.</v>

254
13:27.240 --> 13:28.390
<v ->We're nailing it now.</v>

255
13:31.890 --> 13:34.678
<v ->Okay, thank you all.</v>
<v ->Thank you all. Thank you.</v>

256
13:34.678 --> 13:35.511
(audience applauding)

257
13:35.511 --> 13:39.930
Thank you. You guys can go off stage this way.

258
13:39.930 --> 13:40.763
All right.

259
13:40.763 --> 13:42.060
Congratulations again

260
13:42.060 --> 13:46.522
to our 2025 Global Innovation Champions.

261
13:46.522 --> 13:49.689
(audience applauding)

262
13:51.300 --> 13:53.250
Gary, as you know,

263
13:53.250 --> 13:57.090
we are wrapping up an exciting year for CTA.

264
13:57.090 --> 14:00.840
It's our 100th anniversary. Yes.

265
14:00.840 --> 14:02.640
<v ->Woohoo
(audience applauding)</v>

266
14:02.640 --> 14:07.080
<v ->It's a huge milestone and it's an incredible reflection</v>

267
14:07.080 --> 14:09.900
on how far we've come since we started out

268
14:09.900 --> 14:12.903
as the Radio Manufacturers Association.

269
14:13.830 --> 14:16.917
<v ->That's funny. You know, I don't feel 100.</v>

270
14:18.068 --> 14:20.280
<v ->You don't even look 100.</v>

271
14:20.280 --> 14:23.923
You don't look a day over 99. (laughs)

272
14:26.010 --> 14:27.854
But we rehearsed it and he liked it.

273
14:27.854 --> 14:30.240
(audience laughing)

274
14:30.240 --> 14:33.006
But more seriously, this year we've had a chance

275
14:33.006 --> 14:37.410
to celebrate a century of staying ahead of the curve,

276
14:37.410 --> 14:40.321
a century of working to advance technology

277
14:40.321 --> 14:43.680
and the innovation that fuels it.

278
14:43.680 --> 14:44.513
<v ->Certainly.</v>

279
14:44.513 --> 14:46.980
I mean, we've grown as an association and along

280
14:46.980 --> 14:48.690
with the tech industry,

281
14:48.690 --> 14:52.440
but our industry has certainly never, ever been stronger.

282
14:52.440 --> 14:54.180
Today, we reflect the energy,

283
14:54.180 --> 14:57.030
the momentum and the impact of a sector that's shaping

284
14:57.030 --> 15:00.600
the world now and the future that our children

285
15:00.600 --> 15:03.060
and our grandchildren will inherit.

286
15:03.060 --> 15:05.400
And one of the best parts of our career is handing

287
15:05.400 --> 15:06.780
this over to you.

288
15:06.780 --> 15:09.300
<v ->It is one of the best parts of our job.</v>

289
15:09.300 --> 15:13.290
And we love building on all the incredible success

290
15:13.290 --> 15:15.310
we've had in the past while looking ahead

291
15:15.310 --> 15:18.300
to the next 100 years.

292
15:18.300 --> 15:19.920
And with that in mind,

293
15:19.920 --> 15:23.610
we refreshed the CTA brand last fall

294
15:23.610 --> 15:28.610
with one shared identity for the first time in our history.

295
15:28.890 --> 15:31.380
And this isn't just about a new logo,

296
15:31.380 --> 15:34.560
though we think ours is pretty great.

297
15:34.560 --> 15:37.890
It's about visually representing the connection

298
15:37.890 --> 15:40.830
between technology and humanity,

299
15:40.830 --> 15:44.193
a bond that we've championed for the last century.

300
15:45.030 --> 15:46.950
And as part of our evolution,

301
15:46.950 --> 15:51.950
we also launched a refresh to CES.tech this year after

302
15:52.500 --> 15:54.420
a lot of feedback from many of you.

303
15:54.420 --> 15:55.590
Thank you so much.

304
15:55.590 --> 15:57.930
And I hope that you've all found it to be

305
15:57.930 --> 16:01.983
a very helpful resource in the lead up to CES 2025.

306
16:03.180 --> 16:05.040
And speaking of helpful resources,

307
16:05.040 --> 16:09.390
do not forget to download the CES 2025 app.

308
16:09.390 --> 16:12.341
It is new and improved and more helpful than ever.

309
16:12.341 --> 16:16.620
And coming soon is a new CTA.tech,

310
16:16.620 --> 16:19.380
another step to make it easier for the industry

311
16:19.380 --> 16:23.220
to connect, collaborate, and innovate.

312
16:23.220 --> 16:24.060
<v ->Great.</v>

313
16:24.060 --> 16:26.280
I love these changes we're making.

314
16:26.280 --> 16:28.920
It gives us the look that reflects what we're doing.

315
16:28.920 --> 16:30.840
But as we look ahead,

316
16:30.840 --> 16:34.013
I am excited to share two big announcements

317
16:34.013 --> 16:37.020
that are investments by the Association,

318
16:37.020 --> 16:39.180
the Consumer Technology Association,

319
16:39.180 --> 16:41.970
that reflect the future of technology.

320
16:41.970 --> 16:42.990
And to help us do that,

321
16:42.990 --> 16:46.080
I'd like to invite two members of CTA's executive board

322
16:46.080 --> 16:47.820
to join us on stage.

323
16:47.820 --> 16:50.430
Everyone, please join me in welcoming Austere founder

324
16:50.430 --> 16:52.980
and CEO and immediate past chair

325
16:52.980 --> 16:55.230
of CTA's executive board, Deena Ghazarian,

326
16:55.230 --> 16:59.730
and former executive on IBM, Verizon Business,

327
16:59.730 --> 17:03.210
and Kratos Defense, and Quantum Crunch founder and CEO

328
17:03.210 --> 17:07.927
and CTA executive board member, Debbie Taylor Moore.

329
17:07.927 --> 17:12.927
(upbeat music)
(audience cheering)

330
17:13.017 --> 17:15.520
Get out here.
<v ->Good to see you.</v>

331
17:17.940 --> 17:20.287
<v ->Good luck.</v>
<v ->Here you go.</v>

332
17:20.287 --> 17:21.663
<v ->Break a leg.</v>

333
17:21.663 --> 17:24.330
Wait, Kinzie, come back here. We're doing a photo.

334
17:24.330 --> 17:26.164
<v ->Are you ready?</v>
<v ->Oh.</v>

335
17:26.164 --> 17:26.997
<v ->Hi, everybody.</v>

336
17:26.997 --> 17:28.350
<v ->We have to say hello.</v>

337
17:28.350 --> 17:29.520
<v ->Oh, we have to take a picture?</v>

338
17:29.520 --> 17:31.220
<v ->Yeah, we have to take a picture.</v>

339
17:35.220 --> 17:36.860
Okay, well now-
<v ->All right.</v>

340
17:38.820 --> 17:39.930
<v ->Hi, everybody.</v>

341
17:39.930 --> 17:42.630
I am so excited to join Gary and Kinsey

342
17:42.630 --> 17:45.480
to share some very big news for CTA.

343
17:45.480 --> 17:47.490
When I founded my company Austere,

344
17:47.490 --> 17:49.880
I had the advantage of decades of connections

345
17:49.880 --> 17:52.440
in the consumer technology space.

346
17:52.440 --> 17:55.290
But it's a tougher road for many entrepreneurs trying

347
17:55.290 --> 17:57.870
to break into the industry to gain access

348
17:57.870 --> 18:01.110
to capital, especially for women and black

349
18:01.110 --> 18:02.580
and brown founders.

350
18:02.580 --> 18:07.580
Only 2% of venture capital goes to marginalized founders.

351
18:07.590 --> 18:10.950
That's why I have been such a fierce advocate

352
18:10.950 --> 18:14.670
for CTA's work through the Innovation for All Fund

353
18:14.670 --> 18:19.597
spearheaded at CTA by Tiffany Moore.

354
18:19.597 --> 18:22.597
(audience cheering)

355
18:23.640 --> 18:27.210
Since its announcement in CES 2019,

356
18:27.210 --> 18:29.551
the fund has provided $10 million

357
18:29.551 --> 18:33.750
to 10 venture capital firms that support women,

358
18:33.750 --> 18:36.000
people of color, veterans,

359
18:36.000 --> 18:39.390
and other underrepresented entrepreneurs.

360
18:39.390 --> 18:44.070
Today, I am thrilled to share that based on our success

361
18:44.070 --> 18:47.280
and demonstrated impact, CTA will invest

362
18:47.280 --> 18:51.574
an additional $5 million into this incredible effort.

363
18:51.574 --> 18:54.741
(audience applauding)

364
18:56.610 --> 18:59.640
This investment will help to support and catalyze

365
18:59.640 --> 19:04.640
the next generation of world changing entrepreneurs.

366
19:04.710 --> 19:07.014
Thank you to everyone who supported this work,

367
19:07.014 --> 19:08.880
especially my colleagues

368
19:08.880 --> 19:13.200
on the Innovation for All Committee, chairwoman Mara Lewis

369
19:13.200 --> 19:15.630
and committee member Denise Gibson,

370
19:15.630 --> 19:18.900
who proposed the original idea for the fund.

371
19:18.900 --> 19:20.940
And most importantly, John Shalam,

372
19:20.940 --> 19:23.160
who's the chairman of the investment committee,

373
19:23.160 --> 19:26.983
who made their dream come to life.

374
19:26.983 --> 19:30.360
(audience applauding)

375
19:30.360 --> 19:31.740
For our next announcement,

376
19:31.740 --> 19:34.110
I'll turn it over to my fellow board member

377
19:34.110 --> 19:36.540
and friend, Debbie Taylor Moore.

378
19:36.540 --> 19:38.310
<v ->Thanks, Deena.</v>

379
19:38.310 --> 19:40.650
And thank you so much for all of your work

380
19:40.650 --> 19:41.700
over the past year.

381
19:41.700 --> 19:43.793
It's been outstanding.
<v ->Thank you, Debbie.</v>

382
19:47.760 --> 19:51.540
<v ->So I've worked in the cybersecurity field for more</v>

383
19:51.540 --> 19:55.560
than two decades, and one of the biggest sea changes

384
19:55.560 --> 19:58.800
I've ever seen in our industry is the emergence

385
19:58.800 --> 20:02.250
and the development of quantum technology.

386
20:02.250 --> 20:05.299
I'll put it this way for the Taylor Swift fans

387
20:05.299 --> 20:10.299
who are, there you go, who are familiar with her Eras tour.

388
20:11.910 --> 20:16.276
She has had an era, I think we would agree.

389
20:16.276 --> 20:20.340
If the 2020s are the AI era,

390
20:20.340 --> 20:23.673
then the 2030s will most certainly be the quantum era.

391
20:24.660 --> 20:27.270
Broader use of quantum technology is going

392
20:27.270 --> 20:30.780
to completely transform my field, cybersecurity,

393
20:30.780 --> 20:34.157
as well as enterprises in healthcare, telecom,

394
20:34.157 --> 20:37.200
in material sciences.

395
20:37.200 --> 20:38.460
It's gonna change the way

396
20:38.460 --> 20:41.404
we optimize supply chain management.

397
20:41.404 --> 20:45.570
And that's why I was thrilled to work

398
20:45.570 --> 20:48.870
with the incredible CTA staff to broker

399
20:48.870 --> 20:53.506
a major investment in Quantum World Congress.

400
20:53.506 --> 20:56.673
(audience applauding)

401
20:58.110 --> 20:59.910
Quantum World Congress is a first

402
20:59.910 --> 21:03.540
of its kind global quantum conference that's located

403
21:03.540 --> 21:05.070
in Washington, D.C.

404
21:05.070 --> 21:08.310
that convenes the entire quantum ecosystem.

405
21:08.310 --> 21:13.310
This investment expands CTA's reach into emerging areas

406
21:13.440 --> 21:15.780
of critical technology.

407
21:15.780 --> 21:19.067
So congratulations to CTA

408
21:19.067 --> 21:22.003
and to the Quantum World Congress team.

409
21:22.003 --> 21:25.170
(audience applauding)

410
21:26.520 --> 21:30.120
And I just want to say it's gonna be a wild year.

411
21:30.120 --> 21:34.335
Have a happy new year and just a fabulous CES.

412
21:34.335 --> 21:39.090
(audience applauding)
(upbeat music)

413
21:39.090 --> 21:40.450
<v ->Good job, Debbie.</v>

414
21:42.510 --> 21:47.510
<v ->Thank you, Deena and Debbie, two of my favorite ladies.</v>

415
21:48.030 --> 21:51.360
At CES 2025, we have also been working

416
21:51.360 --> 21:53.990
with the Quantum World Congress over the last year

417
21:53.990 --> 21:58.260
to produce a new quantum focused conference track,

418
21:58.260 --> 22:02.586
one of several new CES conference tracks this year.

419
22:02.586 --> 22:07.050
So let's talk about what else is new at CES 2025.

420
22:07.050 --> 22:11.291
This year we are thrilled to have South Hall back online

421
22:11.291 --> 22:15.060
and buzzing for the first time since 2020,

422
22:15.060 --> 22:19.620
showcasing classic CES products and accessories.

423
22:19.620 --> 22:23.190
And digital health has a new home at the Venetian,

424
22:23.190 --> 22:27.510
uniting health, lifestyle, fitness, and smart home,

425
22:27.510 --> 22:29.220
all those categories together

426
22:29.220 --> 22:33.576
to reflect our connected living experience.

427
22:33.576 --> 22:37.650
And the CES keynotes will span the Las Vegas strip.

428
22:37.650 --> 22:39.660
Nvidia's Jensen Huang delivered

429
22:39.660 --> 22:43.890
an amazing sold out keynote at Mandalay Bay last night.

430
22:43.890 --> 22:46.650
And we will see Delta's Ed Bastian

431
22:46.650 --> 22:48.784
at the Sphere tonight.

432
22:48.784 --> 22:52.020
And if you're planning to join us at Sphere,

433
22:52.020 --> 22:55.170
don't forget that you will need a separate ticket

434
22:55.170 --> 22:57.780
to experience Delta's keynote.

435
22:57.780 --> 22:59.070
I'm pretty sure there's information

436
22:59.070 --> 23:00.090
on the screen behind me,

437
23:00.090 --> 23:02.940
but tickets are limited and can be picked up

438
23:02.940 --> 23:05.700
on a first serve, first come basis.

439
23:05.700 --> 23:07.950
And they are located at the Aria,

440
23:07.950 --> 23:10.620
the Venetian Expo, North, South,

441
23:10.620 --> 23:13.140
and West Halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center.

442
23:13.140 --> 23:13.973
They're everywhere.

443
23:13.973 --> 23:16.320
So make sure you find one and pick them up before

444
23:16.320 --> 23:17.253
the event tonight.

445
23:18.360 --> 23:21.300
One other new addition that I am especially excited

446
23:21.300 --> 23:25.551
for is the new CES Creator Space presented by Sony

447
23:25.551 --> 23:28.413
and the Central Hall's Grand Lobby.

448
23:29.250 --> 23:32.730
This space is an exclusive area for our storytellers,

449
23:32.730 --> 23:36.570
the amazing media and content creators who cover

450
23:36.570 --> 23:39.600
the show, helping them develop content

451
23:39.600 --> 23:43.950
and make connections with exhibitors and each other.

452
23:43.950 --> 23:47.580
This area will also feature three days of exciting

453
23:47.580 --> 23:52.580
on stage programming sponsored by Sony and Pinterest.

454
23:53.743 --> 23:56.550
And with so much to see and do,

455
23:56.550 --> 24:01.550
we are ready to dive in to new tech, new partnerships,

456
24:02.460 --> 24:04.473
and new ideas.

457
24:07.560 --> 24:10.790
Ready to dive in to...

458
24:11.670 --> 24:15.570
To all of these new tech and new partnerships and new ideas.

459
24:15.570 --> 24:20.250
Where's Gary? Gary, are you coming?

460
24:20.250 --> 24:22.680
Oh, my gosh.

461
24:22.680 --> 24:27.120
Gary, I said dive in, like the campaign, not ride in.

462
24:27.120 --> 24:28.736
<v ->I think I need one</v>

463
24:28.736 --> 24:30.990
of those new hearing aids your father-in-law got.

464
24:30.990 --> 24:32.850
<v ->What are you doing?</v>

465
24:32.850 --> 24:35.121
<v ->Well, what I'm doing is I think I've also learned</v>

466
24:35.121 --> 24:38.514
that I can't ride circles around you.

467
24:38.514 --> 24:43.514
<v ->(laughs) Well, you are truly the master of pivots, Gary,</v>

468
24:44.370 --> 24:47.700
so take it away.

469
24:47.700 --> 24:48.533
<v ->Thank you.</v>

470
24:49.620 --> 24:53.215
Everybody, the amazing Kinsey Fabrizio!

471
24:53.215 --> 24:56.382
(audience applauding)

472
24:59.400 --> 25:00.510
You know, in Pivot or Die,

473
25:00.510 --> 25:05.310
I talk about the need for reinvention and transformation.

474
25:05.310 --> 25:07.631
But even as we embrace new things,

475
25:07.631 --> 25:12.631
some technologies and companies thrive long term.

476
25:12.870 --> 25:16.560
Like the bicycle, invented before any of us were born.

477
25:16.560 --> 25:19.020
It's been reinvented over the years to become

478
25:19.020 --> 25:23.340
the e-bike, like the bike I just rode in on from Panasonic.

479
25:23.340 --> 25:25.320
Or like Panasonic itself,

480
25:25.320 --> 25:28.212
a company that's reinvented and transformed itself

481
25:28.212 --> 25:32.520
to stay practical, relevant, and vital.

482
25:32.520 --> 25:34.920
More than 100 years later, Panasonic

483
25:34.920 --> 25:38.070
is still transforming, not only as a country

484
25:38.070 --> 25:40.110
and as a group of employees,

485
25:40.110 --> 25:42.870
but they're transforming entire industries,

486
25:42.870 --> 25:44.910
societies, and lifestyles.

487
25:44.910 --> 25:47.186
That kind of agility is what I hope all

488
25:47.186 --> 25:49.950
the companies, entrepreneurs,

489
25:49.950 --> 25:54.150
and innovators can embrace here at CES 2025.

490
25:54.150 --> 25:56.760
Because CES isn't just an event,

491
25:56.760 --> 25:58.560
it's where the future is made.

492
25:58.560 --> 26:01.863
So welcome to CES 2025.

493
26:03.032 --> 26:06.199
(audience applauding)

494
26:08.070 --> 26:08.903
This morning,

495
26:08.903 --> 26:13.050
it's my honor and pleasure to introduce our opening keynote.

496
26:13.050 --> 26:16.290
Panasonic is a mainstay of CES,

497
26:16.290 --> 26:18.690
one of just a handful of companies

498
26:18.690 --> 26:22.470
that have exhibited every year since the first CES

499
26:22.470 --> 26:25.443
in 1967 was held in New York City.

500
26:26.724 --> 26:29.891
(audience applauding)

501
26:30.780 --> 26:33.060
And we share some common ground.

502
26:33.060 --> 26:36.675
Both Panasonic and CTA thrive today because we've pivoted

503
26:36.675 --> 26:39.150
to be leaders in innovation and embrace

504
26:39.150 --> 26:42.840
and drive forward trends in technology and society.

505
26:42.840 --> 26:44.940
Panasonic's ability to evolve

506
26:44.940 --> 26:47.100
and embrace new things fuels

507
26:47.100 --> 26:50.280
its extraordinary longevity and relevance.

508
26:50.280 --> 26:52.470
Panasonic also succeeds

509
26:52.470 --> 26:54.900
because its leaders know something important.

510
26:54.900 --> 26:55.860
You have to stick

511
26:55.860 --> 26:59.520
to your principles and know when not to pivot.

512
26:59.520 --> 27:00.780
Over a century ago,

513
27:00.780 --> 27:05.370
Panasonic's founder Kōnosuke Matsushita declared

514
27:05.370 --> 27:08.370
the company's mission to overcome poverty

515
27:08.370 --> 27:10.140
and enrich society.

516
27:10.140 --> 27:12.600
He wasn't just talking about profits.

517
27:12.600 --> 27:15.060
He was talking about the roles that business leaders

518
27:15.060 --> 27:17.790
and technology could and must play

519
27:17.790 --> 27:21.000
in making society better and our lives healthier

520
27:21.000 --> 27:22.710
and more fulfilling.

521
27:22.710 --> 27:27.710
That's a legacy that Panasonic's CEO Yuki Kusumi embraces.

522
27:28.350 --> 27:31.110
It drives his approach to pioneering new markets

523
27:31.110 --> 27:34.200
in our data driven AI powered future

524
27:34.200 --> 27:38.400
and Panasonic's leadership in more sustainable technology.

525
27:38.400 --> 27:40.890
To share their next chapter and a vision

526
27:40.890 --> 27:43.530
for the technology that propels us forward

527
27:43.530 --> 27:48.530
and makes us well into the future, please welcome Panasonic.

528
27:50.649 --> 27:53.603
(audience applauding)

529
27:53.603 --> 27:56.020
(soft music)

530
28:02.520 --> 28:05.822
<v ->Panasonic story began over a decade ago</v>

531
28:05.822 --> 28:07.623
with this double socket.

532
28:09.293 --> 28:13.020
This is the spark that ignited decades of innovation

533
28:13.020 --> 28:16.920
and passion, comfort and connection to every corner

534
28:16.920 --> 28:17.753
of the globe.

535
28:18.600 --> 28:20.970
Panasonic grew to take bigger challenges

536
28:20.970 --> 28:22.560
of the modern world,

537
28:22.560 --> 28:25.860
leading the transformation to sustainable technologies

538
28:25.860 --> 28:27.630
and solutions and factories,

539
28:27.630 --> 28:31.413
supply chains in the air and on the road.

540
28:32.730 --> 28:34.770
Born in this tiny innovation,

541
28:34.770 --> 28:38.400
Panasonic continues its core mission to inspire

542
28:38.400 --> 28:41.190
a healthy society that enriches the lives

543
28:41.190 --> 28:42.907
of people around the world.

544
28:42.907 --> 28:47.907
Now, these efforts blossom across new landscapes seeded

545
28:48.270 --> 28:50.066
by artificial intelligence.

546
28:50.066 --> 28:52.647
Panasonic has always thrived at the intersection

547
28:52.647 --> 28:57.647
of yesterday and tomorrow, of human with the technological.

548
28:57.968 --> 29:00.930
The fabric of connection and intersection

549
29:00.930 --> 29:05.880
makes Panasonic code system one of the most fertile

550
29:05.880 --> 29:08.910
in the world of technology and innovation.

551
29:08.910 --> 29:13.320
Today, you'll meet game changers and startups,

552
29:13.320 --> 29:17.835
innovating leaders and visionaries like Anthropic, AARP,

553
29:17.835 --> 29:20.790
Redwood Materials and more.

554
29:20.790 --> 29:25.790
Panasonic is over 100 years along on a 250 year plan,

555
29:27.390 --> 29:30.258
and as we engineer and reveal our next phase,

556
29:30.258 --> 29:33.270
Panasonic is a great company.

557
29:33.270 --> 29:36.270
As you'll see, you might look at this double socket

558
29:36.270 --> 29:38.550
and say, simple!

559
29:38.550 --> 29:39.750
It's a no brainer.

560
29:39.750 --> 29:40.800
But after a century,

561
29:40.800 --> 29:42.240
it remains the foundation

562
29:42.240 --> 29:45.570
of a company whose original mission remains true,

563
29:45.570 --> 29:48.750
unbroken by time, forging connections

564
29:48.750 --> 29:51.210
in a universe of disruption.

565
29:51.210 --> 29:54.720
And that Panasonic commitment continues well

566
29:54.720 --> 29:55.593
into the future.

567
29:56.506 --> 30:01.440
CES 2025 begins here and now!

568
30:01.440 --> 30:04.830
Please welcome CEO of Panasonic Holding Group,

569
30:04.830 --> 30:06.870
Mr. Yuki Kasumi.

570
30:06.870 --> 30:09.453
(upbeat music)

571
30:19.615 --> 30:20.532
<v ->Hi, Gary.</v>

572
30:28.137 --> 30:29.220
Good morning.

573
30:30.600 --> 30:32.600
Thank you all for joining me here today.

574
30:34.440 --> 30:37.245
I'd like to thank Gary for the kind introduction

575
30:37.245 --> 30:42.033
and for the entering in style on the Panasonic e-bike.

576
30:43.290 --> 30:46.980
And of course, my friend, Anthony Mackie,

577
30:46.980 --> 30:51.087
who seems to have covered 100 years

578
30:51.087 --> 30:55.623
of Panasonic history in about 90 seconds.

579
30:56.610 --> 30:58.710
<v ->It's an honor to share the stage with you, Mr. Kasumi.</v>

580
30:58.710 --> 31:00.540
<v ->You as well, Mr. Mackie.</v>

581
31:00.540 --> 31:02.130
Or should I say, Captain America?

582
31:02.130 --> 31:06.690
<v ->Nah, come on, Kasumi-san. You call me Anthony.</v>

583
31:06.690 --> 31:09.450
<v ->Thank you, Anthony. And please call me Yuki.</v>

584
31:09.450 --> 31:10.283
<v ->You got it.</v>

585
31:12.555 --> 31:14.530
(audience cheers)
As anyone who comes...

586
31:18.090 --> 31:22.350
As anyone who comes to CES year after year can tell you,

587
31:22.350 --> 31:25.972
technology moves ahead at an amazing pace.

588
31:25.972 --> 31:30.972
So it's important that we be intentional in our work.

589
31:32.158 --> 31:35.820
We all know that our current systems and practices

590
31:35.820 --> 31:39.750
are not sustainable, not for the planet,

591
31:39.750 --> 31:43.263
and not for the mental and physical health of its people.

592
31:44.340 --> 31:47.730
The communities where we all work and live are dealing

593
31:47.730 --> 31:51.281
with climate change in different ways.

594
31:51.281 --> 31:55.080
This is certainly true in my hometown of Osaka,

595
31:55.080 --> 31:57.417
where my family lives.

596
31:57.417 --> 32:00.480
And where my first grandchild was born,

597
32:00.480 --> 32:01.863
just three months ago.

598
32:02.879 --> 32:06.046
(audience applauding)

599
32:08.820 --> 32:13.110
Professionally and personally, I want to do everything

600
32:13.110 --> 32:17.280
I can to make sure that my children and grandchildren,

601
32:17.280 --> 32:21.150
and yours, and future generations enjoy

602
32:21.150 --> 32:23.278
a healthy environment.

603
32:23.278 --> 32:27.690
We must balance our drive to deliver innovation

604
32:27.690 --> 32:32.690
and create abundance with the need to do so sustainably.

605
32:33.107 --> 32:36.873
In today's reality, everything is connected.

606
32:37.920 --> 32:40.620
<v ->This morning, you learned the latest ways</v>

607
32:40.620 --> 32:43.380
that sustainable technology solutions from Panasonic

608
32:43.380 --> 32:45.270
are driving the process

609
32:45.270 --> 32:48.120
in large-scale renewable energy solutions,

610
32:48.120 --> 32:49.560
EV batteries technology,

611
32:49.560 --> 32:52.230
and a sustainable home technologies.

612
32:52.230 --> 32:54.000
You'll also hear some exciting news

613
32:54.000 --> 32:58.230
about a fundamental shift in Panasonic's business model.

614
32:58.230 --> 33:01.260
It centers on AI-led software and services,

615
33:01.260 --> 33:04.710
taking related investments and partnerships

616
33:04.710 --> 33:06.300
to a whole new level.

617
33:06.300 --> 33:07.470
As part of this,

618
33:07.470 --> 33:10.680
you'll hear about new solutions to support the well-being

619
33:10.680 --> 33:13.623
of families and societies around the world.

620
33:17.675 --> 33:19.637
The value of Panasonic brings this market

621
33:19.637 --> 33:23.583
to its highest point, and it's even getting bigger.

622
33:24.570 --> 33:28.080
<v ->We are fortunate that in every step of the journey,</v>

623
33:28.080 --> 33:31.560
we have fantastic partners working side

624
33:31.560 --> 33:33.900
by side with Panasonic.

625
33:33.900 --> 33:38.900
In fact, a few of them will be joining us on stage today.

626
33:38.910 --> 33:42.540
<v ->The timing of these announcements couldn't be better.</v>

627
33:42.540 --> 33:44.730
It's a critical future for Panasonic

628
33:44.730 --> 33:46.350
and everyone here today.

629
33:46.350 --> 33:49.440
The World Economy Forum estimates that manufacturing

630
33:49.440 --> 33:52.320
and production account for one-fifth

631
33:52.320 --> 33:54.570
of global CO2 emissions.

632
33:54.570 --> 33:57.060
Now, if Panasonic and its partners committed

633
33:57.060 --> 33:59.640
to net-zero operations globally,

634
33:59.640 --> 34:02.820
that would make a huge difference to the planet.

635
34:02.820 --> 34:06.450
Panasonic's renewable energy journey is well underway,

636
34:06.450 --> 34:08.130
as you're about to see.

637
34:08.130 --> 34:10.740
So Yuki, tell us about how this journey is going.

638
34:10.740 --> 34:11.880
<v ->Yes.</v>

639
34:11.880 --> 34:16.880
Currently, 44 of our manufacturing sites worldwide

640
34:16.972 --> 34:19.668
have achieved net-zero status.

641
34:19.668 --> 34:22.835
(audience applauding)

642
34:24.570 --> 34:26.100
Thank you.

643
34:26.100 --> 34:28.980
We are most excited about our fuel cell factory

644
34:28.980 --> 34:32.550
in Japan, which is the world's first factory

645
34:32.550 --> 34:35.884
to be fully powered by a combination of hydrogen,

646
34:35.884 --> 34:40.080
solar panels, and battery storage units.

647
34:40.080 --> 34:44.943
This renewable energy solution is called Panasonic HX.

648
34:46.020 --> 34:49.837
Panasonic HX generates only the amount of power needed

649
34:49.837 --> 34:53.679
and uses our original energy management system

650
34:53.679 --> 34:57.847
to balance supply and demand in response to changes

651
34:57.847 --> 35:00.153
in electricity and weather.

652
35:01.045 --> 35:04.080
We have also expanded Panasonic HX

653
35:04.080 --> 35:07.993
to our manufacturing UK operation in Cardiff.

654
35:07.993 --> 35:10.800
And we will bring the solution

655
35:10.800 --> 35:14.579
to our Panasonic office building in Munich in spring

656
35:14.579 --> 35:16.023
of this year.

657
35:17.430 --> 35:20.880
We are extremely motivated to bring these solutions

658
35:20.880 --> 35:23.670
to life in our own operations.

659
35:23.670 --> 35:26.250
But what is more encouraging

660
35:26.250 --> 35:30.390
is that commercial enterprises and governments around

661
35:30.390 --> 35:33.548
the world are stepping up and want

662
35:33.548 --> 35:35.523
to make these changes too.

663
35:37.470 --> 35:40.688
We are currently working with forward-thinking planners

664
35:40.688 --> 35:44.691
at the Greater Manchester Combined Authority in the UK

665
35:44.691 --> 35:49.560
to explore implementing our solution, Panasonic HX,

666
35:49.560 --> 35:54.560
for net-zero energy at select public and government sites.

667
35:54.960 --> 35:57.573
It's the world's first agreement of this nature.

668
35:58.620 --> 36:01.110
Imagine the positive impact

669
36:01.110 --> 36:04.440
as these solutions become widely adopted.

670
36:04.440 --> 36:08.943
This is an opportunity to truly make a difference at scale.

671
36:10.290 --> 36:12.390
Now, let's switch gears

672
36:12.390 --> 36:15.330
and talk about a different kind of power.

673
36:15.330 --> 36:18.000
I have asked Anthony to share more about the story.

674
36:18.000 --> 36:19.560
<v ->Thank you, Yuki. I appreciate it.</v>

675
36:19.560 --> 36:22.199
This is really exciting news.

676
36:22.199 --> 36:27.000
In the EV battery market, Panasonic is a quiet giant,

677
36:27.000 --> 36:30.654
some would say, supplying 15 billion batteries

678
36:30.654 --> 36:32.580
with superior performance.

679
36:32.580 --> 36:35.926
Now, that's enough batteries to power more

680
36:35.926 --> 36:40.530
than 3 million electric vehicles worldwide and counting.

681
36:40.530 --> 36:43.980
In fact, Panasonic is the largest manufacturer

682
36:43.980 --> 36:46.599
of EV batteries in North America.

683
36:46.599 --> 36:50.340
They've been investing in battery technology for decades.

684
36:50.340 --> 36:54.090
Their latest 2170 battery set a new benchmark

685
36:54.090 --> 36:55.590
for performance and capacity.

686
36:55.590 --> 36:58.950
Furthermore, the cutting edge 4680 in line

687
36:58.950 --> 37:00.810
for production has a capacity

688
37:00.810 --> 37:05.580
that is five times greater than the 2170 cell.

689
37:05.580 --> 37:08.880
And Panasonic continues to advance the state of the art

690
37:08.880 --> 37:12.900
in partnership with leading global automakers Subaru

691
37:12.900 --> 37:16.080
and Mazda, as well as U.S. EV company Lucid

692
37:16.080 --> 37:19.170
and other prestigious brands.

693
37:19.170 --> 37:22.260
The capacity and quality of their batteries

694
37:22.260 --> 37:24.640
has kept Panasonic at the leading edge

695
37:24.640 --> 37:26.970
of EV battery technology.

696
37:26.970 --> 37:27.803
Take a look.

697
37:29.238 --> 37:30.990
(upbeat music)
<v ->Whether it's</v>

698
37:30.990 --> 37:33.180
the wide open highway or a run

699
37:33.180 --> 37:35.850
to the market, zero emissions driving

700
37:35.850 --> 37:40.080
has never been more innovative, efficient and exciting.

701
37:40.080 --> 37:43.800
Panasonic is accelerating the EV revolution.

702
37:43.800 --> 37:46.800
Our batteries power millions of cars that are easier

703
37:46.800 --> 37:50.250
on the planet, but built for muscle and speed.

704
37:50.250 --> 37:53.370
From the Gigafactory in Nevada to our new plant

705
37:53.370 --> 37:56.670
in Kansas, Panasonic has set a new benchmark

706
37:56.670 --> 38:00.330
for the industry with our 2170 platform.

707
38:00.330 --> 38:03.750
Panasonic is now the largest provider of EV batteries

708
38:03.750 --> 38:05.550
in North America, powering some

709
38:05.550 --> 38:07.878
of the world's leading auto brands.

710
38:07.878 --> 38:10.132
And we are ready to begin production

711
38:10.132 --> 38:13.677
on our next generation 4680 platform,

712
38:13.677 --> 38:18.570
producing higher capacity, five times that of the 2170,

713
38:18.570 --> 38:21.960
at a lower cost, mile after mile.

714
38:21.960 --> 38:25.350
As ever, Panasonic is leading with sustainability

715
38:25.350 --> 38:26.760
at the core.

716
38:26.760 --> 38:29.970
Our factories employ a circular economy model with among

717
38:29.970 --> 38:33.333
the highest levels of recycling solutions in the industry.

718
38:34.410 --> 38:38.280
The EV battery market is just shifting into high gear,

719
38:38.280 --> 38:42.543
and Panasonic is driving it forward well into the future.

720
38:44.790 --> 38:46.370
<v ->Come on.</v>

721
38:46.370 --> 38:49.620
(audience applauding)

722
38:49.620 --> 38:53.460
Yuki, I didn't realize how massive Panasonic

723
38:53.460 --> 38:56.490
is supporting the adoption of electric vehicles.

724
38:56.490 --> 39:00.450
Obviously, the battery is a huge part of making that happen.

725
39:00.450 --> 39:02.340
Now, I'm hearing more and more

726
39:02.340 --> 39:06.600
about this circular economy model for recycling

727
39:06.600 --> 39:07.893
and battery production.

728
39:08.910 --> 39:12.330
<v ->Yes, bringing battery manufacturing into harmony</v>

729
39:12.330 --> 39:14.460
with our need to protect the environment

730
39:14.460 --> 39:19.443
is a complicated challenge, but it is absolutely essential.

731
39:20.400 --> 39:23.370
And we are fortunate to have the best partner

732
39:23.370 --> 39:26.490
on the planet to help us make it happen.

733
39:26.490 --> 39:27.834
<v ->Indeed you do.</v>

734
39:27.834 --> 39:32.834
Please welcome Redwood Materials CEO, J.B. Strauble.

735
39:33.076 --> 39:38.076
(upbeat music)
(audience applauding)

736
39:38.626 --> 39:39.753
<v ->Hi, J.B.</v>

737
39:41.070 --> 39:44.520
Thank you very much for joining on stage today.

738
39:44.520 --> 39:46.830
And what the audience probably knows,

739
39:46.830 --> 39:51.713
you are a co-founder and longtime CTO of Tesla.

740
39:51.713 --> 39:54.150
I bet they would love to hear about

741
39:54.150 --> 39:56.913
what led you to start Redwood Materials.

742
39:58.110 --> 40:00.720
<v ->Thank you very much, Mr. Kasumi.</v>

743
40:00.720 --> 40:02.070
I'd be happy to share a little bit

744
40:02.070 --> 40:04.260
of the Redwood origin story and some of the work

745
40:04.260 --> 40:06.450
we're doing together with Panasonic.

746
40:06.450 --> 40:08.010
I'm an engineer at heart,

747
40:08.010 --> 40:10.560
and my passion for energy and sustainability

748
40:10.560 --> 40:13.830
is what drives me and what drives most of the things

749
40:13.830 --> 40:15.660
we're focused on at Redwood.

750
40:15.660 --> 40:17.276
And while people often associate me

751
40:17.276 --> 40:20.910
with electric vehicles and cars, for me,

752
40:20.910 --> 40:23.160
it's always been more about the battery

753
40:23.160 --> 40:25.080
and energy technology.

754
40:25.080 --> 40:28.021
And proving that the battery technology is now scalable

755
40:28.021 --> 40:32.940
and a sustainable energy solution is core to my belief.

756
40:32.940 --> 40:35.100
Today, this same mission drives us

757
40:35.100 --> 40:37.870
at Redwood Materials, where we're tackling challenges

758
40:37.870 --> 40:39.978
within the ecosystem to enable

759
40:39.978 --> 40:43.293
a fully responsible transition to electrification.

760
40:44.160 --> 40:46.410
It's a monumental shift for the industry

761
40:46.410 --> 40:48.720
that will unfold over decades,

762
40:48.720 --> 40:51.030
but I am convinced it's inevitable.

763
40:51.030 --> 40:53.141
And Redwood, with Panasonic's partnership,

764
40:53.141 --> 40:56.040
is here to make this as sustainable as possible

765
40:56.040 --> 40:58.887
at every step along the way.

766
40:58.887 --> 41:01.833
My personal journey with Panasonic began

767
41:01.833 --> 41:04.140
when we were building the first Gigafactory

768
41:04.140 --> 41:07.528
in Nevada together about a decade ago.

769
41:07.528 --> 41:11.010
I recognized both a challenge and an opportunity

770
41:11.010 --> 41:14.438
to reuse the batteries we were producing and repurpose

771
41:14.438 --> 41:17.016
the resulting production scrap material,

772
41:17.016 --> 41:19.470
moving toward a circular ecosystem

773
41:19.470 --> 41:21.785
for those battery materials.

774
41:21.785 --> 41:23.550
Today, the Panasonic

775
41:23.550 --> 41:27.390
and Redwood partnership extends well beyond recycling,

776
41:27.390 --> 41:30.389
and we're taking old batteries and critical materials

777
41:30.389 --> 41:33.180
and turning them into functional battery components

778
41:33.180 --> 41:36.030
that Panasonic can use to manufacture new cells

779
41:36.030 --> 41:37.203
in the United States.

780
41:38.310 --> 41:42.030
Material from the Panasonic Gigafactory in Nevada arrives

781
41:42.030 --> 41:45.210
at Redwood multiple times every single day,

782
41:45.210 --> 41:47.379
just a few miles down the road.

783
41:47.379 --> 41:50.430
We're recycling that material and recovering greater

784
41:50.430 --> 41:54.840
than 98% of the critical materials like cobalt, lithium,

785
41:54.840 --> 41:56.304
nickel, and copper,

786
41:56.304 --> 42:00.210
and then rebuilding new cathode active materials right here

787
42:00.210 --> 42:01.290
in the U.S.

788
42:01.290 --> 42:03.586
that will be returned to Panasonic's value chain

789
42:03.586 --> 42:06.690
into manufacturing new batteries.

790
42:06.690 --> 42:07.830
This will be the first time

791
42:07.830 --> 42:10.200
that this has happened anywhere in the world

792
42:10.200 --> 42:12.500
with this level of recycled content.

793
42:12.500 --> 42:15.092
Cathode has never been produced with this type

794
42:15.092 --> 42:20.092
of closed-loop ecosystem so close to the factory,

795
42:20.280 --> 42:22.500
and Panasonic will be the first to put it back

796
42:22.500 --> 42:25.491
into new batteries at this incredible scale.

797
42:25.491 --> 42:28.020
Panasonic is an amazing leader when it comes

798
42:28.020 --> 42:31.440
to technology and their commitment to sustainability both

799
42:31.440 --> 42:34.200
in the U.S. and globally, and Panasonic

800
42:34.200 --> 42:37.320
has made tremendous commitments towards circular economy

801
42:37.320 --> 42:40.582
practices both in the Nevada Gigafactory and now

802
42:40.582 --> 42:43.650
in their new factory in Kansas.

803
42:43.650 --> 42:45.720
I believe they're a model for the entire industry,

804
42:45.720 --> 42:48.660
and we need more players to invest in this sustainable

805
42:48.660 --> 42:50.700
and sensible approach.

806
42:50.700 --> 42:52.830
I want to thank Panasonic for this opportunity

807
42:52.830 --> 42:55.800
to share our work together with you at CES,

808
42:55.800 --> 42:58.920
and my thanks again to you, Mr. Kasumi.

809
42:58.920 --> 43:00.570
<v ->Thank you so much, J.B.,</v>

810
43:00.570 --> 43:02.987
and look forward to doing more great work together

811
43:02.987 --> 43:04.500
in the coming years.

812
43:04.500 --> 43:05.333
<v ->Likewise.</v>

813
43:08.730 --> 43:11.670
<v ->We've seen how sustainable technology is advancing</v>

814
43:11.670 --> 43:14.760
in the world of commercial facilities and EVs.

815
43:14.760 --> 43:17.820
Now, let's take a look at how Panasonic

816
43:17.820 --> 43:20.460
is bringing sustainability home.

817
43:20.460 --> 43:23.760
Sustainable home design brings together two broad areas

818
43:23.760 --> 43:27.570
of focus for Panasonic: renewable energy technology

819
43:27.570 --> 43:30.360
and the well-being of society.

820
43:30.360 --> 43:32.790
A core element in sustainable home design

821
43:32.790 --> 43:34.650
is efficient HVAC,

822
43:34.650 --> 43:37.650
and Panasonic is revolutionizing this space.

823
43:37.650 --> 43:41.850
Air quality isn't only about the outside air.

824
43:41.850 --> 43:45.513
The inside air has to be improved and is just as important.

825
43:46.470 --> 43:49.260
<v ->And our engineers have done something</v>

826
43:49.260 --> 43:51.598
that just makes sense.

827
43:51.598 --> 43:55.110
We have identified three Panasonic systems

828
43:55.110 --> 43:59.250
that heat, cool, and power homes.

829
43:59.250 --> 44:03.330
And we are bringing them together in a unified solution

830
44:03.330 --> 44:07.560
that is not only more energy efficient and economical,

831
44:07.560 --> 44:11.490
but healthier and more comfortable as well.

832
44:11.490 --> 44:16.490
Today, we are announcing Oasys, and here is why it matters.

833
44:20.376 --> 44:21.870
(upbeat music)

834
44:21.870 --> 44:23.640
<v Narrator>When I come home and the house is clean</v>

835
44:23.640 --> 44:27.510
and I can breathe fresh air, it makes my heart full.

836
44:27.510 --> 44:29.400
<v Narrator>Being able to be energy efficient</v>

837
44:29.400 --> 44:30.390
is really important

838
44:30.390 --> 44:33.240
and meaningful for us as we start a family.

839
44:33.240 --> 44:34.500
<v Narrator>Our home, to me,</v>

840
44:34.500 --> 44:36.420
is a place for us to come together.

841
44:36.420 --> 44:38.062
<v Narrator>It really says, family,</v>

842
44:38.062 --> 44:40.103
when you have three generations under one roof.

843
44:42.120 --> 44:46.230
<v ->I love fresh air blowing through our home,</v>

844
44:46.230 --> 44:50.070
but then during the springtime, I get seasonal allergies.

845
44:50.070 --> 44:52.320
So that's where air filtration,

846
44:52.320 --> 44:54.840
air quality is super important to us.

847
44:54.840 --> 44:57.840
<v ->As I think about the next phase and having kids,</v>

848
44:57.840 --> 45:01.230
one of the most important things is modeling our values

849
45:01.230 --> 45:02.760
and our behavior.

850
45:02.760 --> 45:05.460
<v ->Wouldn't it be amazing to actually be able to see</v>

851
45:05.460 --> 45:07.350
how we're using energy,

852
45:07.350 --> 45:10.140
or if there was ways to inform and teach us

853
45:10.140 --> 45:12.210
to be more energy efficient?

854
45:12.210 --> 45:16.143
<v ->Sustainability starts with awareness and knowledge.</v>

855
45:22.950 --> 45:25.680
<v ->It is very important that our home is a healthy place.</v>

856
45:25.680 --> 45:27.777
My son, Logan, has asthma.

857
45:27.777 --> 45:30.951
It's important that our kids are able to breathe

858
45:30.951 --> 45:32.340
the clean air so they don't get sick.

859
45:32.340 --> 45:36.240
We vacuum often. We change our air filter religiously.

860
45:36.240 --> 45:38.130
When we open the windows, try to get fresh air,

861
45:38.130 --> 45:40.500
pollen comes in, then we have sneezing

862
45:40.500 --> 45:41.760
and coughing happening.

863
45:41.760 --> 45:44.820
<v ->It would be nice to have a better filtration system</v>

864
45:44.820 --> 45:46.683
that could really clean the air.

865
45:54.030 --> 45:57.540
<v ->There's seven of us in the house, eight with my dad.</v>

866
45:57.540 --> 46:01.440
So managing the temperature in here, it's interesting.

867
46:01.440 --> 46:03.900
<v ->He's always warm and I'm always cold,</v>

868
46:03.900 --> 46:06.810
so when I'm working I have my electric blanket on.

869
46:06.810 --> 46:10.109
<v ->During the summertime when we are running our AC,</v>

870
46:10.109 --> 46:12.960
our electricity bill is ridiculous, yet

871
46:12.960 --> 46:15.480
we're still hot, still uncomfortable.

872
46:15.480 --> 46:17.913
We need a better unit, better circulation.

873
46:26.280 --> 46:28.920
<v ->The world I hope my kids and their kids will grow up</v>

874
46:28.920 --> 46:32.460
in is hopefully that each home is more sustainable.

875
46:32.460 --> 46:35.370
<v ->I want the world to be a healthy place for them</v>

876
46:35.370 --> 46:36.360
to live in.

877
46:36.360 --> 46:40.440
I don't want them to have to struggle with the air quality.

878
46:40.440 --> 46:42.270
<v ->In starting our own family,</v>

879
46:42.270 --> 46:44.970
we're definitely thinking of what is the world

880
46:44.970 --> 46:47.374
that these future generations are going to inherit

881
46:47.374 --> 46:50.670
and how have we contributed to either

882
46:50.670 --> 46:54.573
that more beautiful future or not beautiful future.

883
47:00.203 --> 47:03.720
(audience applauding)

884
47:03.720 --> 47:06.810
<v ->Oasys offers us a look at the future of home comfort</v>

885
47:06.810 --> 47:10.260
and indoor air quality with wellness, comfort,

886
47:10.260 --> 47:14.733
energy efficiency, and resiliency all under one roof.

887
47:15.581 --> 47:17.640
And in a few short weeks,

888
47:17.640 --> 47:22.500
we'll actually be opening our first Oasys concept home here

889
47:22.500 --> 47:23.820
in the U.S.

890
47:23.820 --> 47:26.850
So stay tuned, that's pretty good.

891
47:26.850 --> 47:28.770
From factories to homes,

892
47:28.770 --> 47:31.800
from cars we drive to the air we breathe,

893
47:31.800 --> 47:33.870
Panasonic is the leading edge

894
47:33.870 --> 47:37.263
of sustainability effects around the world.

895
47:38.490 --> 47:42.570
<v ->A few years ago at CES 2022,</v>

896
47:42.570 --> 47:45.983
Panasonic established a major initiative,

897
47:45.983 --> 47:50.760
Panasonic Green Impact, that sets some aggressive goals

898
47:50.760 --> 47:52.860
for carbon reduction.

899
47:52.860 --> 47:54.210
We are working hard

900
47:54.210 --> 47:57.720
to realize net zero CO2 emissions across all

901
47:57.720 --> 47:59.610
of our operations, including

902
47:59.610 --> 48:02.970
all factories worldwide by 2030.

903
48:02.970 --> 48:06.630
<v ->Now, however, Panasonic Green Impact aims higher.</v>

904
48:06.630 --> 48:09.990
Panasonic aims to reduce total emissions by more

905
48:09.990 --> 48:13.739
than 300 million tons by 2050.

906
48:13.739 --> 48:16.650
That's equivalent to approximately 1%

907
48:16.650 --> 48:19.200
of current global CO2 emissions.

908
48:19.200 --> 48:23.280
So that's 1% being done by Panasonic alone.

909
48:23.280 --> 48:25.200
Now imagine if 99 other

910
48:25.200 --> 48:27.210
industry leading companies joined us.

911
48:27.210 --> 48:32.210
That's 1% times 100. Yeah, yeah, I saw you.

912
48:32.550 --> 48:34.230
You just did the math. I saw you.

913
48:34.230 --> 48:36.270
That was fast. (laughs)

914
48:36.270 --> 48:38.070
The first 100 million tons

915
48:38.070 --> 48:40.440
of this commitment involves direct emissions

916
48:40.440 --> 48:43.410
from Panasonic's entire supply chain,

917
48:43.410 --> 48:45.360
including energy consumed

918
48:45.360 --> 48:47.880
by Panasonic products already purchased.

919
48:47.880 --> 48:50.400
The remainder will need to be achieved

920
48:50.400 --> 48:52.740
through avoided emissions.

921
48:52.740 --> 48:55.110
Now this term describes emissions that are prevented

922
48:55.110 --> 48:58.560
by using a sustainable product or technology in place

923
48:58.560 --> 49:01.380
of a more carbon intensive option.

924
49:01.380 --> 49:03.516
<v ->By working toward avoided emissions,</v>

925
49:03.516 --> 49:06.120
we can extend our impact far

926
49:06.120 --> 49:08.310
beyond the Panasonic supply chain

927
49:08.310 --> 49:12.930
to our partners, customers, and society at large.

928
49:12.930 --> 49:16.080
I've invited a colleague and visionary thinker

929
49:16.080 --> 49:18.737
on this topic to share a few insights

930
49:18.737 --> 49:23.737
about how our industry can work together globally

931
49:23.790 --> 49:27.480
with a focus on avoided emissions as an important path

932
49:27.480 --> 49:29.223
to a carbon neutral society.

933
49:30.780 --> 49:33.690
Peter Bakker is President and CEO

934
49:33.690 --> 49:37.350
of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.

935
49:37.350 --> 49:41.730
He was recently named one of the top 100 climate leaders

936
49:41.730 --> 49:45.600
in business by Time Magazine and was a recipient

937
49:45.600 --> 49:48.780
of the Clinton Global Citizen Award.

938
49:48.780 --> 49:51.580
Please join me in welcoming him.

939
49:52.433 --> 49:55.016
(upbeat music)

940
49:57.217 --> 50:01.679
Hi, Peter-san, thank you very much for being here today.

941
50:01.679 --> 50:06.300
<v ->Thank you.</v>

942
50:06.300 --> 50:09.123
Well, thank you, Kusumi-san, for this kind introduction.

943
50:09.962 --> 50:14.962
(speaking in foreign language) Guided by this vision,

944
50:15.180 --> 50:16.895
Panasonic has committed itself

945
50:16.895 --> 50:19.753
to contributing to sustainable development

946
50:19.753 --> 50:22.173
and the advancement of society.

947
50:23.040 --> 50:26.297
Let me begin by expressing my gratitude to Panasonic

948
50:26.297 --> 50:28.893
and to all of you here in the audience today.

949
50:29.790 --> 50:32.264
Panasonic's dedication to sustainability

950
50:32.264 --> 50:36.840
and innovation inspires global process

951
50:36.840 --> 50:41.220
and aligns perfectly with WBCSD's mission to accelerate

952
50:41.220 --> 50:43.320
the transition to a net-zero,

953
50:43.320 --> 50:46.113
nature-positive and more equitable future.

954
50:47.190 --> 50:50.550
We all know here that we're running out of time

955
50:50.550 --> 50:54.286
to prevent the most devastating impacts of climate change.

956
50:54.286 --> 50:58.470
Without bold action, global temperatures could rise

957
50:58.470 --> 51:03.470
by 2.4 to 2.7 degrees Celsius this century,

958
51:03.960 --> 51:07.050
far exceeding the critical threshold

959
51:07.050 --> 51:09.273
and safe operating space for humanity.

960
51:10.500 --> 51:12.867
But in this era of rapid innovation

961
51:12.867 --> 51:15.510
and growing consumer awareness,

962
51:15.510 --> 51:16.980
sustainability is not just

963
51:16.980 --> 51:20.310
a moral imperative to curb this warming.

964
51:20.310 --> 51:22.383
It is now also a competitive one.

965
51:23.250 --> 51:24.540
Businesses that fail

966
51:24.540 --> 51:28.560
to embrace sustainable practices risk falling behind

967
51:28.560 --> 51:30.090
in an evolving marketplace

968
51:30.090 --> 51:34.350
where consumers, investors, governments and partners

969
51:34.350 --> 51:39.350
are increasingly demanding transparency and accountability.

970
51:39.659 --> 51:42.420
That's why over 20 years ago,

971
51:42.420 --> 51:44.220
WBCSD in partnership

972
51:44.220 --> 51:47.160
with the World Resources Institute developed

973
51:47.160 --> 51:49.980
the greenhouse gas protocol,

974
51:49.980 --> 51:53.719
the global standard for measuring and managing emissions.

975
51:53.719 --> 51:58.087
Today, the greenhouse gas protocol is used by 97%

976
51:58.087 --> 52:01.719
of all global companies and is an essential tool

977
52:01.719 --> 52:05.553
to measure and manage their direct and indirect emissions.

978
52:06.720 --> 52:09.390
Kusumi-san just spoke about the importance

979
52:09.390 --> 52:14.040
of avoided emissions, a powerful new metric to measure

980
52:14.040 --> 52:17.670
the emission reduction potential of low-carbon solutions

981
52:17.670 --> 52:20.580
and products, of which so many are being launched

982
52:20.580 --> 52:22.413
this week at CES.

983
52:23.940 --> 52:26.940
Avoided emissions accounting will make it possible

984
52:26.940 --> 52:29.820
to compare the potential emission reductions

985
52:29.820 --> 52:33.540
of innovations in low-carbon solutions,

986
52:33.540 --> 52:37.530
allowing financial institutions to improve the allocation

987
52:37.530 --> 52:41.313
of capital on the basis of this impact potential.

988
52:42.780 --> 52:46.290
Panasonic's leadership in this space is pivotal.

989
52:46.290 --> 52:49.707
Together, WBCSD and Panasonic are advancing

990
52:49.707 --> 52:53.142
the standardization of avoided emissions accounting

991
52:53.142 --> 52:56.981
to ensure they eliminate the risk of greenwashing

992
52:56.981 --> 53:00.300
and are being recognized by governments,

993
53:00.300 --> 53:03.213
financial institutions and society at large.

994
53:04.200 --> 53:06.870
This work is not just about measurement.

995
53:06.870 --> 53:08.610
It's about innovation

996
53:08.610 --> 53:11.460
and disclosure, empowering customers,

997
53:11.460 --> 53:13.680
industries and investors

998
53:13.680 --> 53:17.433
to accelerate decarbonization and innovation.

999
53:18.276 --> 53:21.600
Collaboration is the key to success.

1000
53:21.600 --> 53:23.550
We all need to work together

1001
53:23.550 --> 53:25.380
to fully integrate sustainability

1002
53:25.380 --> 53:28.141
into our innovation agenda and actions

1003
53:28.141 --> 53:29.550
so that we can make it

1004
53:29.550 --> 53:33.273
the foundation of economic growth and resilience.

1005
53:34.170 --> 53:37.770
Panasonic's commitment to sustainability and its vision

1006
53:37.770 --> 53:41.550
for an ideal society with affluence both in matter

1007
53:41.550 --> 53:45.363
and in mind can serve as a guiding example for all of us.

1008
53:46.320 --> 53:51.030
The time to act is now, and the world is watching.

1009
53:51.030 --> 53:54.780
Let's ensure that the incredible innovations demonstrated

1010
53:54.780 --> 53:57.840
here this week contribute to a thriving,

1011
53:57.840 --> 54:01.890
sustainable future for generations to come.

1012
54:01.890 --> 54:03.035
Thank you.

1013
54:03.035 --> 54:04.803
(audience applauding)
<v ->Thank you so much,</v>

1014
54:04.803 --> 54:05.636
Peter-san.

1015
54:05.636 --> 54:07.860
It's a great honor for Panasonic to be a part

1016
54:07.860 --> 54:09.690
of your important work.

1017
54:09.690 --> 54:10.523
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1018
54:10.523 --> 54:11.700
<v ->We couldn't do it without you.</v>

1019
54:11.700 --> 54:13.300
<v ->Thank you.</v>
<v ->Thanks, Anthony.</v>

1020
54:16.680 --> 54:21.030
<v ->Our commitment to sustainability will never end</v>

1021
54:21.030 --> 54:25.740
because we all have a responsibility to our future together.

1022
54:25.740 --> 54:28.950
<v ->This future is already here today.</v>

1023
54:28.950 --> 54:32.133
This is the time of enormous challenge and transformation.

1024
54:37.800 --> 54:42.800
Wait for it. Now is the time to eat some candy or something.

1025
54:44.250 --> 54:45.543
Talk amongst yourselves.

1026
54:47.490 --> 54:48.323
<v ->From here?</v>

1027
54:49.830 --> 54:53.611
<v ->Hey, here we go. Hey. (laughs)</v>

1028
54:53.611 --> 54:57.843
<v ->Our commitment to sustainability will never end</v>

1029
54:57.843 --> 55:02.460
because we all have a responsibility to our future together.

1030
55:02.460 --> 55:05.545
<v ->The future is already here today.</v>

1031
55:05.545 --> 55:08.160
This is the time of enormous challenge

1032
55:08.160 --> 55:12.293
and transformation, but also a time of hope.

1033
55:12.293 --> 55:13.440
<v ->Our customers</v>

1034
55:13.440 --> 55:16.950
are now more varied, more globally diverse,

1035
55:16.950 --> 55:19.980
and yet more connected to each other,

1036
55:19.980 --> 55:22.410
and the world around them.

1037
55:22.410 --> 55:26.700
Today, I want to talk to you about our journey forward.

1038
55:26.700 --> 55:28.890
<v ->Building on Panasonic's history.</v>

1039
55:28.890 --> 55:33.120
Building into a new future. You ready?

1040
55:33.120 --> 55:36.303
Because here we go.

1041
55:39.620 --> 55:41.670
(soft music)
<v ->Over a century ago,</v>

1042
55:41.670 --> 55:45.963
our founder Kōnosuke Matsushita shared a remarkable vision.

1043
55:47.130 --> 55:49.327
A 250-year journey divided

1044
55:49.327 --> 55:53.160
into 10 periods of innovation and progress.

1045
55:53.160 --> 55:57.120
Each 25-year period would build on prior successes

1046
55:57.120 --> 56:00.510
and adapt to society's needs and dreams.

1047
56:00.510 --> 56:03.330
His mission was simple, yet ambitious.

1048
56:03.330 --> 56:06.150
To use technology to make a meaningful difference

1049
56:06.150 --> 56:08.220
in people's lives.

1050
56:08.220 --> 56:10.320
For more than 100 years,

1051
56:10.320 --> 56:12.153
Panasonic has been there:

1052
56:12.990 --> 56:16.920
in your homes, your businesses, your daily moments.

1053
56:16.920 --> 56:20.310
From the first radio sets to sustainable energy,

1054
56:20.310 --> 56:22.290
we've grown alongside you,

1055
56:22.290 --> 56:25.203
driven by our intent to build a better world.

1056
56:26.040 --> 56:28.920
And now our world is changing.

1057
56:28.920 --> 56:31.260
In the fifth period of our vision,

1058
56:31.260 --> 56:34.997
we intend to rise and meet that change.

1059
56:34.997 --> 56:38.883
This is the spirit of Panasonic Go.

1060
56:39.900 --> 56:42.690
We're accelerating into an era where AI

1061
56:42.690 --> 56:45.960
and data platforms will create new ecosystems

1062
56:45.960 --> 56:47.943
that amplify human potential.

1063
56:49.110 --> 56:52.470
We're building a new portfolio of tools to improve

1064
56:52.470 --> 56:55.350
the lives of the consumers, enterprises,

1065
56:55.350 --> 56:59.340
partners and shareholders that make up Panasonic,

1066
56:59.340 --> 57:03.688
all while contributing to a more sustainable world.

1067
57:03.688 --> 57:07.230
Panasonic products and services already make a difference

1068
57:07.230 --> 57:11.370
in the lives of over a billion people every day.

1069
57:11.370 --> 57:14.400
This is how we intend to expand our reach

1070
57:14.400 --> 57:15.843
to the next billion.

1071
57:16.800 --> 57:20.053
This is Panasonic Go.

1072
57:20.053 --> 57:22.886
(audience cheers)

1073
57:27.090 --> 57:30.300
<v ->Panasonic Go is a growth initiative</v>

1074
57:30.300 --> 57:33.761
that is driving the transformation of our business,

1075
57:33.761 --> 57:36.420
and creating new experiences

1076
57:36.420 --> 57:39.900
for global customers and partners.

1077
57:39.900 --> 57:43.650
We are providing our global enterprise with AI tools

1078
57:43.650 --> 57:46.290
and processes to serve our customers

1079
57:46.290 --> 57:48.663
in fundamentally different ways.

1080
57:49.598 --> 57:52.327
We are not starting from scratch.

1081
57:52.327 --> 57:56.285
We have already invested more than $10 billion

1082
57:56.285 --> 57:59.662
in North America, including Blue Yonder

1083
57:59.662 --> 58:04.662
and Panasonic UL, which you will hear more about today.

1084
58:05.220 --> 58:08.280
Together, these investments are creating

1085
58:08.280 --> 58:11.349
an AI orchestration and service platform

1086
58:11.349 --> 58:13.969
that will create new possibilities

1087
58:13.969 --> 58:17.340
to serve our next billion customers.

1088
58:17.340 --> 58:20.940
<v ->Moving from pressing a button to powering a business,</v>

1089
58:20.940 --> 58:23.520
from a microwave competing on wattage

1090
58:23.520 --> 58:25.890
to an AI-powered sustainable home

1091
58:25.890 --> 58:28.710
that uses almost no watts at all.

1092
58:28.710 --> 58:30.947
From a refrigerator that keeps your food cold

1093
58:30.947 --> 58:35.490
to a food that's just what you want when you want it.

1094
58:35.490 --> 58:39.476
From just touching a screen to powering the touch points

1095
58:39.476 --> 58:42.270
of every business.

1096
58:42.270 --> 58:45.210
And from a brand that you've known to a brand

1097
58:45.210 --> 58:46.310
that you need to know.

1098
58:48.120 --> 58:49.636
<v ->Today...</v>

1099
58:49.636 --> 58:51.690
(audience laughing)

1100
58:51.690 --> 58:55.440
Today, we're announcing a new commitment as part

1101
58:55.440 --> 58:59.700
of our company-wide transformation initiative for Panasonic.

1102
58:59.700 --> 59:04.700
By 2035, 30% of our business, our revenue,

1103
59:05.413 --> 59:10.413
will be generated through software and AI-enabled solutions.

1104
59:12.091 --> 59:15.258
(audience applauding)

1105
59:16.470 --> 59:18.060
Thank you.

1106
59:18.060 --> 59:20.111
And this transformation will change

1107
59:20.111 --> 59:22.983
everything you know about Panasonic.

1108
59:23.880 --> 59:26.910
This is Panasonic Go.

1109
59:26.910 --> 59:29.910
<v ->Okay, so let's dig into it.</v>

1110
59:29.910 --> 59:31.740
Hit us with the details, Yuki.

1111
59:31.740 --> 59:35.133
Now we'll start with Panasonic's subsidiary, Blue Yonder.

1112
59:35.970 --> 59:40.306
<v ->They are reinventing the global supply chain using</v>

1113
59:40.306 --> 59:44.250
advanced data analytics and AI.

1114
59:44.250 --> 59:45.420
To tell you more,

1115
59:45.420 --> 59:48.510
I'm delighted to welcome Blue Yonder's

1116
59:48.510 --> 59:51.420
Chief Strategy Officer, Wayne Usie.

1117
59:52.516 --> 59:56.760
(upbeat music)
(audience applauding)

1118
59:56.760 --> 59:59.810
Hi Wayne, thank you very much for being here.

1119
01:00:01.577 --> 01:00:04.410
<v ->Thank you, Kasumi-san and the entire Panasonic team.</v>

1120
01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:07.410
It's exciting to be here at CES.

1121
01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:10.890
Modern supply chains are extremely complex.

1122
01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:13.604
They're global, they're interconnected,

1123
01:00:13.604 --> 01:00:17.220
but they're also burdened with outdated technology

1124
01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:19.684
and operational silos.

1125
01:00:19.684 --> 01:00:22.380
Companies need to manage operations across

1126
01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:25.839
the globe, collaborate on disparate systems internally

1127
01:00:25.839 --> 01:00:27.960
and with partners.

1128
01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:32.250
And they need to do all of this seamlessly and effectively.

1129
01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:35.760
Now, all of us know that AI is changing how we work

1130
01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.023
and do business today.

1131
01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:41.670
Whether you're in retail, manufacturing, technology,

1132
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:43.500
or logistics service providers,

1133
01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:45.540
every industry will benefit

1134
01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:49.290
from these massive changes brought on by the use of AI

1135
01:00:49.290 --> 01:00:50.313
in the supply chain.

1136
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:53.280
This is where we come in.

1137
01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:55.050
Blue Yonder empowers businesses

1138
01:00:55.050 --> 01:00:57.990
to navigate modern supply chain complexity

1139
01:00:57.990 --> 01:01:01.440
with the most advanced and innovative technology.

1140
01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:05.670
We're combining predictive and generative AI to unlock

1141
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:10.670
the value in data to build autonomous supply chains.

1142
01:01:10.830 --> 01:01:14.610
So how does this translate into tangible benefits?

1143
01:01:14.610 --> 01:01:18.270
Here are five key ways that we see AI will impact

1144
01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:19.173
the supply chain.

1145
01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:23.970
First, multi-enterprise ecosystems.

1146
01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:26.310
Blue Yonder's AI-driven solution provides

1147
01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:28.650
an end-to-end visibility across

1148
01:01:28.650 --> 01:01:31.350
a company's entire supply chain,

1149
01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:35.460
including its suppliers and its trading partners.

1150
01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:38.640
With predictive insights, supply chain professionals can

1151
01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:41.130
understand relevant information.

1152
01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:45.003
They can assess scenarios and make informed decisions.

1153
01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.709
Second, personalization.

1154
01:01:48.709 --> 01:01:52.050
We're building autonomous AI agents

1155
01:01:52.050 --> 01:01:55.140
for various supply chain roles.

1156
01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:59.340
These multimodal conversational assistants will synthesize

1157
01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:04.340
data, generate content, solve repetitive tasks,

1158
01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:08.910
perform root cause analysis, recommend solutions,

1159
01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:11.343
and even execute decisions.

1160
01:02:12.367 --> 01:02:15.480
Third, inventory management.

1161
01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:19.110
Using our AI, businesses can analyze buying trends,

1162
01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:22.350
inflation news, production projections,

1163
01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:26.160
and inventory data to far cast better the balance

1164
01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.393
of demand and supply.

1165
01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:31.380
This helps them avoid overproduction of goods

1166
01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:34.620
and rejection of waste and carbon emissions right

1167
01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:35.470
at the beginning.

1168
01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:39.300
Fourth, on-time delivery.

1169
01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:42.840
Our AI-powered solutions help organizations facilitate

1170
01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:46.503
faster shipments while avoiding unnecessary miles.

1171
01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:50.268
And lastly, capital savings.

1172
01:02:50.268 --> 01:02:53.100
As a result of all the improved efficiency,

1173
01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:55.920
companies see an influx of capital savings,

1174
01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.960
which means an opportunity

1175
01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:00.753
to invest more in innovation and growth.

1176
01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:03.870
One of our global customers, Sainsbury,

1177
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:06.750
has implemented Blue Yonder's AI capabilities

1178
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:09.210
to transform operations across more

1179
01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:14.100
than 600 supermarkets and 800 convenience stores

1180
01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:18.270
to save time, save money, and future-proof the enterprise.

1181
01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:19.170
Let's take a look.

1182
01:03:20.976 --> 01:03:22.950
<v ->There are probably three good examples</v>

1183
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:26.730
where Sainsbury's are using AI and or machine learning.

1184
01:03:26.730 --> 01:03:28.980
The first one being our supply chain transformation program

1185
01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:31.410
with Blue Yonder, where we're using those platforms

1186
01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:34.500
to enable us to develop a better store order,

1187
01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:36.480
but also in our P&amp;L going forward

1188
01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.190
for a more sustainable supply chain.

1189
01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:40.920
We're also using AI in a very different way

1190
01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:42.480
in our store environment.

1191
01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:44.280
We're using it to detect theft.

1192
01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.140
We're using it through cameras,

1193
01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:49.260
through an AI model that helps us monitor the behavior,

1194
01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:51.330
the way that our customers shop with us,

1195
01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:52.710
and therefore able to predict

1196
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:55.350
where potential theft might be taking place.

1197
01:03:55.350 --> 01:03:58.200
The third place we're using AI is in our forecast

1198
01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.150
and predictive modeling

1199
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:01.350
of where we think customers

1200
01:04:01.350 --> 01:04:03.420
might shop food products with us.

1201
01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:04.650
So in our marketing space,

1202
01:04:04.650 --> 01:04:07.110
we've been using it to understand customer behavior

1203
01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:08.490
to help us think about marketing

1204
01:04:08.490 --> 01:04:10.240
with those customers going forward.

1205
01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:19.260
<v ->So long before it became a buzzword it is today,</v>

1206
01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:21.660
Blue Yonder has been offering AI-driven solutions

1207
01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:24.000
for more than two decades,

1208
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.760
but it's not about the most advanced technology.

1209
01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:29.148
It's also about one of the largest supply chain team

1210
01:04:29.148 --> 01:04:31.920
of data scientists in the industry.

1211
01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:33.842
And with over 400 patents

1212
01:04:33.842 --> 01:04:37.620
and 20 billion predictions per day

1213
01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:39.300
on the Blue Yonder platform,

1214
01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:42.930
we are delivering future-proof solutions today.

1215
01:04:42.930 --> 01:04:46.980
As Kusumi-san said, Panasonic is not new to AI,

1216
01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:48.390
but with Panasonic Go,

1217
01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:51.900
you can expect to see a lot more AI-driven innovation

1218
01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:54.900
as we continue to create smarter, safer,

1219
01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:58.050
and more sustainable solutions for the global supply chain.

1220
01:04:58.050 --> 01:04:58.883
Thank you.

1221
01:04:59.718 --> 01:05:02.310
(audience applauding)
<v ->Thanks so much, Wayne.</v>

1222
01:05:02.310 --> 01:05:03.143
Great job.

1223
01:05:07.468 --> 01:05:12.000
One of the most exciting things about Panasonic Go

1224
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.540
is the expansion of products and services we will bring

1225
01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:19.353
to millions of modern households around the globe.

1226
01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:23.853
We have a new catalyst for well-being innovation,

1227
01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:29.870
Panasonic Well, and a new service we are introducing today.

1228
01:05:30.079 --> 01:05:31.560
Here to tell you more,

1229
01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:35.640
please welcome the Executive Officer of Panasonic Group

1230
01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:39.930
and Panasonic Well CEO, Yoky Matsuoka.

1231
01:05:39.930 --> 01:05:44.930
(upbeat music)
(audience applauding)

1232
01:05:45.208 --> 01:05:47.667
Hi Yoky, it's great to see you here,

1233
01:05:47.667 --> 01:05:50.550
and now it's your turn to share some news.

1234
01:05:50.550 --> 01:05:52.353
<v ->Sounds great. Let's do this.</v>

1235
01:05:53.970 --> 01:05:57.630
We have some amazing announcements to share with you today.

1236
01:05:57.630 --> 01:05:59.850
At Panasonic Well, we're focused

1237
01:05:59.850 --> 01:06:03.093
on helping people lead healthier, happier lives.

1238
01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:08.130
In addition to my role at Panasonic, I'm also a wife,

1239
01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:10.950
a mother of four, and the only child

1240
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:13.653
that's caring for my aging parents in Japan.

1241
01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:17.370
And as an expert multitasker,

1242
01:06:17.370 --> 01:06:20.550
I'm also a proud caregiver of two dogs,

1243
01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:25.550
a chatty cockatiel, and a 200-pound pet pig.

1244
01:06:27.810 --> 01:06:30.810
It's a beautifully chaotic household,

1245
01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:32.733
probably just like yours.

1246
01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:36.600
And this chaos motivates me to create solutions

1247
01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:38.853
to help families every day.

1248
01:06:40.170 --> 01:06:41.940
I'm sure you can relate in some way

1249
01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:45.363
because modern families need help.

1250
01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:49.830
In fact, the US Surgeon General recently issued

1251
01:06:49.830 --> 01:06:52.620
an advisory on the well-being of parents,

1252
01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:55.350
sharing that nearly half of the parents

1253
01:06:55.350 --> 01:06:59.010
are reporting feeling overwhelmed with stress,

1254
01:06:59.010 --> 01:07:03.033
and roughly 65% of parents are feeling lonely.

1255
01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:08.280
When parenting has an advisory label like a pack

1256
01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:11.790
of cigarettes, we know we're in a crisis

1257
01:07:11.790 --> 01:07:13.353
that demands our attention.

1258
01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:17.670
To understand firsthand what modern families

1259
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:22.170
are facing today, we went into homes and lives

1260
01:07:22.170 --> 01:07:23.823
of real families.

1261
01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.523
I want to show you what we found.

1262
01:07:29.849 --> 01:07:32.266
(soft music)

1263
01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:42.014
<v ->The days feel so long sometimes.</v>

1264
01:07:42.014 --> 01:07:44.597
(child crying)

1265
01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:46.700
Going to mama's...

1266
01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:52.620
<v ->The idea of consistency in life right now</v>

1267
01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:54.060
is out the window.

1268
01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:55.050
I guess, you know,

1269
01:07:55.050 --> 01:07:57.473
as we're kind of coming to a close on this meeting...

1270
01:07:57.473 --> 01:07:59.883
<v Narrator>There's very little downtime.</v>

1271
01:08:02.550 --> 01:08:04.217
<v ->Have a good day.</v>
<v ->Bye.</v>

1272
01:08:05.913 --> 01:08:07.830
<v Narrator>It's just managing.</v>

1273
01:08:07.830 --> 01:08:10.113
It's hard to schedule just life.

1274
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:13.230
<v Narrator>How do people do this?</v>

1275
01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:16.923
Like, I can't do this. I feel so alone.

1276
01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:20.250
<v ->Whenever, you know,</v>

1277
01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:23.550
it's a rough day or feeling kind of mentally unwell,

1278
01:08:23.550 --> 01:08:26.853
it's so amazing to be able to just be outside in my element.

1279
01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:28.983
I got a promotion.

1280
01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:35.760
<v ->My life is the highest highs and the lowest lows.</v>

1281
01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:37.958
When I achieve something,

1282
01:08:37.958 --> 01:08:41.280
it's a win and I immediately feel calm.

1283
01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:43.950
But if not, things start to shake a little bit.

1284
01:08:43.950 --> 01:08:45.993
But the lowest are low.

1285
01:08:48.450 --> 01:08:50.700
<v Narrator>Life has ups and downs.</v>

1286
01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:55.413
Everything will work itself out. I believe that.

1287
01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:02.583
You want as much time with it as you can have.

1288
01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:06.999
<v ->There's a monster.</v>

1289
01:09:06.999 --> 01:09:09.180
(child crying)

1290
01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:11.245
Good night.
<v ->Good night.</v>

1291
01:09:11.245 --> 01:09:12.745
<v ->Man, we're done.</v>

1292
01:09:14.490 --> 01:09:15.720
<v Narrator>I don't think we figured it out yet.</v>

1293
01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:17.120
We haven't cracked the code.

1294
01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:24.780
<v ->Every family's looking for the same thing.</v>

1295
01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:27.573
More highs and less lows.

1296
01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:30.180
And when I say families,

1297
01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:33.030
it could be any of the people you cherish,

1298
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:36.990
from your nuclear families to your neighborhood families

1299
01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:39.150
to anything in between.

1300
01:09:39.150 --> 01:09:42.360
And these families everywhere are weathering

1301
01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:44.043
the same storm of struggles.

1302
01:09:46.050 --> 01:09:48.390
This may paint a cloudy picture,

1303
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:51.030
yet it also highlights what we can do

1304
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:53.640
to achieve wellness together.

1305
01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:55.740
Science shows that physical activity is good

1306
01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:59.190
for your heart and is a natural mood booster.

1307
01:09:59.190 --> 01:10:01.494
Sharing meals lowers depression rates,

1308
01:10:01.494 --> 01:10:04.410
and that's just a start.

1309
01:10:04.410 --> 01:10:06.690
I haven't even touched on the wellness benefits

1310
01:10:06.690 --> 01:10:10.860
of sleep, the power of play, self-care,

1311
01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:12.603
or reducing screen time.

1312
01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:17.237
These activities not only support your personal wellness,

1313
01:10:17.237 --> 01:10:19.897
but when you share it with loved ones,

1314
01:10:19.897 --> 01:10:22.194
they enhance positive outcomes

1315
01:10:22.194 --> 01:10:24.363
and foster deeper connections.

1316
01:10:25.650 --> 01:10:28.380
This is why we created Umi,

1317
01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:30.810
an AI-powered family wellness coach

1318
01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:33.540
that helps families care, coordinate,

1319
01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:35.163
and connect with each other.

1320
01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:37.653
Meet Umi.

1321
01:10:39.233 --> 01:10:44.233
(upbeat music)
(audience applauding)

1322
01:12:09.731 --> 01:12:12.731
(audience cheering)

1323
01:12:14.130 --> 01:12:18.450
For my family, Umi will be a game changer.

1324
01:12:18.450 --> 01:12:21.067
Creating wellness goals that we can achieve

1325
01:12:21.067 --> 01:12:23.610
and getting help in a fun,

1326
01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:26.640
easy and creative way will empower us

1327
01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:28.390
to achieve those positive outcomes.

1328
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:33.603
Our current goals are to stay active and eat together.

1329
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:35.730
But you know what?

1330
01:12:35.730 --> 01:12:38.574
This holiday break with four teenagers at home,

1331
01:12:38.574 --> 01:12:42.300
things have been a little bit on the tough side.

1332
01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:44.703
So let me show you how this can work for us.

1333
01:12:47.010 --> 01:12:47.843
Hey, Umi.

1334
01:12:50.730 --> 01:12:52.110
<v Umi>Hello, Yoky.</v>

1335
01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:56.010
Wow. Your schedule today seems intense.

1336
01:12:56.010 --> 01:12:57.660
How are you feeling?

1337
01:12:57.660 --> 01:12:59.790
<v ->I'm actually feeling pretty good.</v>

1338
01:12:59.790 --> 01:13:01.893
I'm at CES in Las Vegas.

1339
01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:06.600
<v Umi>Yeah, I saw that.</v>

1340
01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.430
Are you able to take a break right now

1341
01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:10.730
or a few deep breaths to relax?

1342
01:13:10.730 --> 01:13:13.080
<v ->Not exactly right now.</v>

1343
01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:16.110
Actually, I was checking in on my family.

1344
01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:17.673
Do you have any updates for me?

1345
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:21.930
<v Umi>I'm seeing it's been hard</v>

1346
01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:24.840
to coordinate active time together without you in town.

1347
01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:26.163
Can I share a few ideas?

1348
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:29.520
<v ->I'm a little bit busy right now.</v>

1349
01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:31.440
So can you just schedule something for me

1350
01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:32.913
when I get home this weekend?

1351
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:37.290
<v Umi>Of course.</v>

1352
01:13:37.290 --> 01:13:39.690
Let's do one of your favorites from AllTrails,

1353
01:13:39.690 --> 01:13:41.430
a family walk at Windy Hill,

1354
01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:43.950
and then everyone can make tacos together.

1355
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:45.573
<v ->Sure, that sounds perfect.</v>

1356
01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:49.673
<v Umi>Great.</v>

1357
01:13:49.673 --> 01:13:52.600
I put it on everyone's calendar for this Saturday at 3 p.m.

1358
01:13:53.610 --> 01:13:54.910
<v ->I can't wait to do that.</v>

1359
01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:59.643
So Umi, do you also have an update from my dad?

1360
01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:03.540
<v Umi>Yes.</v>

1361
01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:06.690
Your dad has already gone to bed. It's pretty late in Japan.

1362
01:14:06.690 --> 01:14:09.570
He had a good day today, and he's eating well.

1363
01:14:09.570 --> 01:14:10.403
He told me he liked

1364
01:14:10.403 --> 01:14:12.930
the New Year's food delivery you arranged.

1365
01:14:12.930 --> 01:14:14.010
<v ->Oh, that's great.</v>

1366
01:14:14.010 --> 01:14:16.477
I'm trying to keep him motivated to eat more protein

1367
01:14:16.477 --> 01:14:18.903
in addition to his regular meals.

1368
01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.780
<v Umi>Well, he told me yesterday he loves to eat</v>

1369
01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:26.220
while you're chatting with him.

1370
01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:28.350
Would you like me to set up a few more mealtime calls

1371
01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:30.000
with him later this week?

1372
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.020
<v ->That would be smart.</v>

1373
01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:32.883
Thank you. Thank you so much, Umi.

1374
01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:39.840
<v Umi>Happy to help. Have fun at CES.</v>

1375
01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:40.803
<v ->Thank you, Umi.</v>

1376
01:14:43.097 --> 01:14:44.490
(audience applauding)

1377
01:14:44.490 --> 01:14:47.940
<v ->Whether you're a working parent caring for a loved one</v>

1378
01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:49.950
or realizing halfway through a Zoom call

1379
01:14:49.950 --> 01:14:53.190
that you're still wearing costume makeup from set earlier

1380
01:14:53.190 --> 01:14:57.780
in the day, wellness often takes a backseat.

1381
01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:01.500
This balancing act to fit in wellness in daily life

1382
01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:06.500
is extra challenging for families like yours, Yoky.

1383
01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:09.783
This is called the sandwich generation, right?

1384
01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:13.560
Yoky sandwich. (laughs)

1385
01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:16.530
People raising kids while caring for aging parents

1386
01:15:16.530 --> 01:15:19.530
who are stuck in a constant balancing act.

1387
01:15:19.530 --> 01:15:23.820
And for most families, especially mine and yours,

1388
01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:24.653
this is a source

1389
01:15:24.653 --> 01:15:28.920
of huge strain on both emotions and resources.

1390
01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:31.230
<v ->That's really right, Anthony.</v>

1391
01:15:31.230 --> 01:15:33.143
And there are millions of other families

1392
01:15:33.143 --> 01:15:35.583
who are dealing with this every single day.

1393
01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:38.962
And this is why we designed Umi to be at the heart

1394
01:15:38.962 --> 01:15:40.560
of an ecosystem

1395
01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:43.890
of partners to meet their wellness needs and goals.

1396
01:15:43.890 --> 01:15:48.570
And one of those incredible organizations is AARP.

1397
01:15:48.570 --> 01:15:50.070
<v ->Here to tell you more about it,</v>

1398
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:55.070
please welcome the CEO of AARP, Dr. Myechia Mintor-Jordan.

1399
01:15:56.337 --> 01:16:01.337
(upbeat music)
(audience applauding)

1400
01:16:01.526 --> 01:16:02.776
<v ->There you go.</v>

1401
01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:07.500
Good morning.

1402
01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:10.860
I'm thrilled to be here at CES where AARP plays

1403
01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:12.834
a unique role in fostering innovation

1404
01:16:12.834 --> 01:16:16.230
that helps make aging easier for everyone.

1405
01:16:16.230 --> 01:16:17.910
As a nonprofit organization,

1406
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:21.360
we have an important social mission: to empower people

1407
01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:24.300
to choose how they live as they age.

1408
01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:27.660
Aging, like technology, is constantly evolving.

1409
01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:31.530
In fact, aging is much more dynamic than most people think.

1410
01:16:31.530 --> 01:16:33.900
And the realities of aging are unique from person

1411
01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:36.810
to person and generation to generation.

1412
01:16:36.810 --> 01:16:38.820
That's where you all come in.

1413
01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:42.630
Technology is critical in every aspect of our lives.

1414
01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:44.342
For people 50 and over, it is central

1415
01:16:44.342 --> 01:16:47.910
to driving good health, financial security,

1416
01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:50.670
and the happiness that comes from caring communities,

1417
01:16:50.670 --> 01:16:54.030
strong social connections, and personal fulfillment.

1418
01:16:54.030 --> 01:16:57.420
This, essentially, is what age tech is all about.

1419
01:16:57.420 --> 01:17:01.500
It lives at the intersection of longevity and technology.

1420
01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:02.820
As you explore these halls,

1421
01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:06.600
you will find age tech in almost every corner of CES.

1422
01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:11.100
Why? Because aging is fueling economies around the world.

1423
01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:12.377
In 2030, a year before

1424
01:17:12.377 --> 01:17:15.120
the first millennials start turning 50,

1425
01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:17.580
the world's 50-plus population is projected

1426
01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:21.960
to contribute $65 trillion to the global GDP.

1427
01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:24.360
And that economic contribution is expected

1428
01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:27.090
to nearly double by 2050.

1429
01:17:27.090 --> 01:17:28.440
What are they buying?

1430
01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.990
Everything, especially technology,

1431
01:17:30.990 --> 01:17:33.330
and not just gadgets and wearables.

1432
01:17:33.330 --> 01:17:35.730
They are seeking tech that enhances their lives

1433
01:17:35.730 --> 01:17:38.850
as they age, from smart homes and appliances

1434
01:17:38.850 --> 01:17:41.520
to innovative health and wellness solutions.

1435
01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.750
This is why we launched

1436
01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:46.890
the AgeTech Collaborative, a growing ecosystem

1437
01:17:46.890 --> 01:17:49.350
of tech leaders, visionary startups,

1438
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:51.480
and strategic organizations committed

1439
01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:53.712
to making lives easier, healthier,

1440
01:17:53.712 --> 01:17:56.318
and more fulfilling for the massive population

1441
01:17:56.318 --> 01:18:00.210
of older people and their families around the world.

1442
01:18:00.210 --> 01:18:02.850
The AgeTech Collaborative is where we started our work

1443
01:18:02.850 --> 01:18:05.310
with Panasonic Well, co-promoting

1444
01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:07.710
the Family Wellness Innovative Challenge,

1445
01:18:07.710 --> 01:18:09.090
which you'll hear more

1446
01:18:09.090 --> 01:18:12.210
about in co-developing game-changing technology

1447
01:18:12.210 --> 01:18:13.833
to support family caregivers.

1448
01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:18.180
Many of today's family caregivers are millennials,

1449
01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:20.610
caring for aging parents or grandparents,

1450
01:18:20.610 --> 01:18:22.470
as well as young children.

1451
01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:24.900
We've heard these family caregivers describe life

1452
01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:26.580
in the sandwich generation,

1453
01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:29.550
more like life in a panini press.

1454
01:18:29.550 --> 01:18:32.580
Full of daily stress that is having long-term impacts

1455
01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:35.400
on their physical, mental, and emotional health.

1456
01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:39.960
And make no mistake, this is very real and very personal.

1457
01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:42.750
You will likely be a caregiver or need a caregiver

1458
01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:44.939
at some point in your life.

1459
01:18:44.939 --> 01:18:49.693
Yoky, all of us at AARP thank Panasonic Well

1460
01:18:49.693 --> 01:18:53.730
and its partners for the collaboration, the ingenuity,

1461
01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:56.171
and the tangible difference this work could

1462
01:18:56.171 --> 01:18:58.712
have in the lives of family caregivers today

1463
01:18:58.712 --> 01:19:00.183
and in the future.

1464
01:19:01.473 --> 01:19:04.710
(audience applauding)

1465
01:19:04.710 --> 01:19:06.633
<v ->Thank you so much, Myechia.</v>

1466
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:11.097
With this relationship, families have access to content

1467
01:19:11.097 --> 01:19:16.097
and benefits of AARP to care for each other with Umi.

1468
01:19:16.777 --> 01:19:19.290
Umi is also proud to collaborate

1469
01:19:19.290 --> 01:19:24.290
with best-in-class partners like Blue Apron, Calm,

1470
01:19:24.450 --> 01:19:27.810
Thumbtack, and dozens of other leading companies

1471
01:19:27.810 --> 01:19:32.673
who will help care for families connect across all

1472
01:19:32.673 --> 01:19:34.263
their wellness needs.

1473
01:19:35.370 --> 01:19:38.220
But building an ecosystem requires commitment

1474
01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:41.065
to innovation from the ground up.

1475
01:19:41.065 --> 01:19:45.150
This is why today we're also announcing the winners

1476
01:19:45.150 --> 01:19:47.580
of our global startup competition

1477
01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:50.163
called Family Wellness Innovation Challenge.

1478
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:56.000
With over 550 applicants from 7 countries competing

1479
01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:59.460
for $1 million in prizes, we saw

1480
01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:02.523
groundbreaking technology aimed at family wellness.

1481
01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:07.686
Earlier this week, we celebrated five winners,

1482
01:20:07.686 --> 01:20:12.483
including our grand prize winner, Hearth Display.

1483
01:20:13.425 --> 01:20:15.150
(audience applauding)

1484
01:20:15.150 --> 01:20:17.133
Congratulations to all.

1485
01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:22.200
Swing by our Panasonic booth to make sure

1486
01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.453
to meet these amazing winners.

1487
01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:30.360
We're laying the foundation for a global wellness ecosystem.

1488
01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:33.630
Panasonic Well Partner Collective.

1489
01:20:33.630 --> 01:20:38.100
It is where wellness meets world-changing innovation.

1490
01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:40.923
And trust me, you'll wanna be part of it.

1491
01:20:43.935 --> 01:20:47.102
(audience applauding)

1492
01:20:48.690 --> 01:20:51.933
<v ->Our partners are not just collaborators.</v>

1493
01:20:52.770 --> 01:20:57.360
They are integral to shaping the future of our business.

1494
01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:59.550
With the launch of Panasonic Go,

1495
01:20:59.550 --> 01:21:02.730
we are teaming up with the best in AI

1496
01:21:02.730 --> 01:21:06.210
to deliver cutting-edge solutions rooted in our legacy

1497
01:21:06.210 --> 01:21:09.533
of trust and reliability.

1498
01:21:09.533 --> 01:21:14.533
And when it came to embedding ethical AI into everything

1499
01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:19.410
we do, there was only one clear choice.

1500
01:21:19.410 --> 01:21:21.360
That's why I'm thrilled

1501
01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:26.360
to announce Panasonic's global partners with Anthropic,

1502
01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:32.720
a leading AI safety and research company.

1503
01:21:34.350 --> 01:21:36.030
<v ->And here's to tell us more,</v>

1504
01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:38.280
please welcome co-founder and president

1505
01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:41.683
of Anthropic, Daniela Amodei.

1506
01:21:41.683 --> 01:21:46.683
(upbeat music)
(audience applauding)

1507
01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:52.263
Yeah, let's do this.

1508
01:21:54.090 --> 01:21:56.340
<v ->Good morning and thanks, Yoky.</v>

1509
01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:59.820
What an exciting vision for Umi.

1510
01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:03.960
It's such an honor to be here to talk with you today

1511
01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:07.623
about Anthropic's global partnership with Panasonic.

1512
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:11.910
<v ->Umi is Panasonic's first consumer offering powered</v>

1513
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:15.000
by Anthropic's LLM Claude.

1514
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.070
And today, you saw a sneak preview

1515
01:22:17.070 --> 01:22:20.670
at how our thoughtful integration delivers personalized

1516
01:22:20.670 --> 01:22:22.922
experiences in family wellness.

1517
01:22:22.922 --> 01:22:27.030
But this partnership goes beyond what you saw today.

1518
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:30.240
Together, as a global LLM partner,

1519
01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:34.590
we're advancing AI in a powerful and an ethical way

1520
01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:36.633
that reflects our shared values.

1521
01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:40.050
So, Daniella, would you like to share the audience

1522
01:22:40.050 --> 01:22:43.080
a little bit about what we're working on together?

1523
01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:44.820
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1524
01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:48.684
At Anthropic, we build trustworthy AI.

1525
01:22:48.684 --> 01:22:51.360
For those of you who aren't familiar,

1526
01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:54.360
Anthropic is a company that is focused

1527
01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:58.980
on developing safe and trusted artificial intelligence

1528
01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:02.283
that millions of people around the world rely on every day.

1529
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:06.690
Today, our commitment to building safe, reliable,

1530
01:23:06.690 --> 01:23:10.920
and transparent AI, aligned with human values,

1531
01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:13.263
brings us together with Panasonic.

1532
01:23:14.190 --> 01:23:17.675
These principles have guided Anthropic from day one,

1533
01:23:17.675 --> 01:23:21.840
just as the commitment to human-centered technology

1534
01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:25.829
has guided Panasonic for more than 100 years.

1535
01:23:25.829 --> 01:23:30.300
Through this partnership, Claude, Anthropic's LLM,

1536
01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:33.990
will help transform how Panasonic works and innovates

1537
01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:35.703
with humans at the center.

1538
01:23:37.170 --> 01:23:40.380
Throughout its century-long history,

1539
01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:42.990
Panasonic has consistently evolved

1540
01:23:42.990 --> 01:23:46.273
to meet its customers' changing needs.

1541
01:23:46.273 --> 01:23:49.173
You've already seen Umi in action.

1542
01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:52.745
In the future, and with Claude's help,

1543
01:23:52.745 --> 01:23:57.265
we'll help bring that same personalized experience

1544
01:23:57.265 --> 01:24:00.000
to more of Panasonic's customers,

1545
01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.080
making every interaction more human, more helpful,

1546
01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:05.980
and available whenever people need it.

1547
01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:11.100
Anthropic and Panasonic both believe

1548
01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:14.460
in advancing technology responsibly.

1549
01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:17.760
That's why Panasonic is enhancing its consumer products

1550
01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:21.423
with AI while also giving its workforce access to Claude.

1551
01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:25.560
Building on Panasonic's tradition of innovation,

1552
01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:28.949
the company will integrate Claude as a strategic asset

1553
01:24:28.949 --> 01:24:32.010
to help teams work more creatively

1554
01:24:32.010 --> 01:24:35.820
while delivering better business results across customer

1555
01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:39.993
service, sales, marketing, and coding.

1556
01:24:41.130 --> 01:24:44.772
At Anthropic, we're building trustworthy AI that scales.

1557
01:24:44.772 --> 01:24:48.420
Thank you to Panasonic and to everyone who supports

1558
01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:52.980
this vision for ethical and trusted AI as we work

1559
