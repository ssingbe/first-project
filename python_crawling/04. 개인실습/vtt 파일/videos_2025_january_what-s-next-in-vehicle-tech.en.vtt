00:00.148 --> 00:03.315
(bright upbeat music)

00:11.910 --> 00:13.680
<v ->Good morning, and thank you so much</v>

00:13.680 --> 00:15.600
for joining us this morning.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.220
My name is Julie Kenar.

00:17.220 --> 00:21.357
I work with NIQ/GFK, and I'm the automotive lead.

00:21.357 --> 00:25.110
So, today we are going to talk about

00:25.110 --> 00:28.443
AI and AR in vehicle technology.

00:29.340 --> 00:30.619
We're gonna start very broad,

00:30.619 --> 00:32.634
and talk about the manufacturing

00:32.634 --> 00:35.160
and product development process,

00:35.160 --> 00:37.620
and then we're gonna narrow it down to consumers,

00:37.620 --> 00:41.790
and talk about how this technology is impacting consumers,

00:41.790 --> 00:44.153
how they're benefiting from it,

00:44.153 --> 00:46.200
and we're gonna discuss whether or not

00:46.200 --> 00:49.890
the technology is actually meeting consumer needs.

00:49.890 --> 00:50.790
And along the way,

00:50.790 --> 00:54.360
we'll talk about both opportunities and challenges

00:54.360 --> 00:57.873
with artificial intelligence and augmented reality.

00:58.710 --> 01:03.710
So with me today, I have four esteemed experts in the field.

01:03.960 --> 01:08.190
I have Wendy from 3M, Chris from Goodyear,

01:08.190 --> 01:11.940
Jeff from Xperi, and Fedra from Bosch.

01:11.940 --> 01:13.860
So I'd like to ask each of them

01:13.860 --> 01:15.510
to please take a moment,

01:15.510 --> 01:17.250
to introduce themselves,

01:17.250 --> 01:19.200
tell you more about their company,

01:19.200 --> 01:21.660
and give you a brief overview of

01:21.660 --> 01:23.883
the technology that they're using today.

01:25.140 --> 01:26.880
Fedra, would you like to start?

01:26.880 --> 01:31.320
<v ->Thank you. So my name is Fedra, Fedra Ribeiro,</v>

01:31.320 --> 01:33.210
and I work for Bosch.

01:33.210 --> 01:35.160
Thank you for the introduction.

01:35.160 --> 01:39.480
I work in the domain of compute and ADAS.

01:39.480 --> 01:42.870
Bosch is a lead technology player

01:42.870 --> 01:45.120
in the automotive industry,

01:45.120 --> 01:48.000
and I am in the board of our division

01:48.000 --> 01:49.713
of compute and ADAS.

01:51.330 --> 01:53.310
<v ->Hi everyone, I'm Jeff Jury,</v>

01:53.310 --> 01:57.390
I'm the general manager for the Connected Car for Xperi,

01:57.390 --> 02:01.410
and we develop immersive entertainment solutions

02:01.410 --> 02:03.180
for the automotive space,

02:03.180 --> 02:04.110
and work with all the different

02:04.110 --> 02:06.960
car companies on those implementations.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.119
We do have a booth here

02:08.119 --> 02:11.400
in the West Hall if you'd like to stop by.

02:11.400 --> 02:15.240
And really our focus is whether it's audio,

02:15.240 --> 02:16.290
video, gaming, whatever,

02:16.290 --> 02:17.670
is to bring that content

02:17.670 --> 02:19.560
into the home or into the vehicle.

02:19.560 --> 02:22.110
And in our case, my division,

02:22.110 --> 02:23.700
it's all about how to bring that

02:23.700 --> 02:26.073
all into the car on a global basis.

02:27.930 --> 02:29.670
<v ->Good morning, my name is Wendy Bauer.</v>

02:29.670 --> 02:31.920
I'm our group president for transportation

02:31.920 --> 02:34.350
and electronics at 3M.

02:34.350 --> 02:36.120
For those of you that may not be familiar,

02:36.120 --> 02:37.890
we're a material science company,

02:37.890 --> 02:39.330
and manufacturing company that

02:39.330 --> 02:41.910
really focuses on innovation for some

02:41.910 --> 02:45.030
of the biggest global problems in the world,

02:45.030 --> 02:47.700
spanning many industries from automotive,

02:47.700 --> 02:51.570
to aerospace, to consumers, to personal safety,

02:51.570 --> 02:53.310
climate technologies and beyond.

02:53.310 --> 02:56.340
So we like to think of ourselves as uncomplicated,

02:56.340 --> 02:58.050
if you've had an opportunity to see our booth,

02:58.050 --> 03:00.270
but really bringing material science

03:00.270 --> 03:03.630
and our ability to manufacture at scale to life,

03:03.630 --> 03:05.970
in innovative solutions that really solve

03:05.970 --> 03:08.763
a number of problems in those different industries.

03:10.380 --> 03:12.180
<v ->So good morning, Chris Helsel,</v>

03:12.180 --> 03:14.550
the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company.

03:14.550 --> 03:17.670
We've been in business a little over 125 years.

03:17.670 --> 03:19.619
Some people say, "Why are you guys at CES?"

03:19.619 --> 03:23.940
And we're here because we're not only doing tires,

03:23.940 --> 03:26.130
but how do we do things like tire intelligence.

03:26.130 --> 03:28.189
And so, putting digital into tires,

03:28.189 --> 03:30.930
and then making those connections with that,

03:30.930 --> 03:33.480
to hopefully make driving safer, more efficient.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.615
So I'm our chief technology officer.

03:35.615 --> 03:38.403
I've been serving in that since 2017.

03:40.140 --> 03:42.690
<v ->Thank you for the great introductions.</v>

03:42.690 --> 03:45.630
So, we'll move along to our first question.

03:45.630 --> 03:48.030
So as we all know, the auto industry

03:48.030 --> 03:52.350
seems to always be in the stage of rapid transition.

03:52.350 --> 03:55.860
It's impacted by regulations, by competition,

03:55.860 --> 03:59.430
by consumers, and of course by technology.

03:59.430 --> 04:02.190
So, if each of you could please

04:02.190 --> 04:03.570
help the audience understand

04:03.570 --> 04:06.180
how is your company addressing

04:06.180 --> 04:09.033
one or more of these areas in the industry?

04:10.200 --> 04:11.820
<v ->So maybe I'll start,</v>

04:11.820 --> 04:14.190
if the rest if the colleagues agree.

04:14.190 --> 04:19.050
So at Bosch, we serve the industry end-to-end,

04:19.050 --> 04:22.380
and I will focus a little bit on the transition

04:22.380 --> 04:24.270
towards software defined vehicle,

04:24.270 --> 04:26.334
and software defined mobility.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.002
If we focus a little bit on

04:28.002 --> 04:31.290
the ADAS and the compute area

04:31.290 --> 04:34.050
with optimization of electrical,

04:34.050 --> 04:36.810
electronic architectures on one hand,

04:36.810 --> 04:39.568
an advancement of safety functions,

04:39.568 --> 04:42.480
artificial intelligence and softwarization

04:42.480 --> 04:44.970
of the industry are two core trends

04:44.970 --> 04:46.890
that we are addressing in our business.

04:46.890 --> 04:49.861
So we can explore afterwards a little bit how,

04:49.861 --> 04:52.500
but essentially increasing safety,

04:52.500 --> 04:55.800
personalization, and comfort to the

04:55.800 --> 04:58.323
OEM custom and customers.

05:00.570 --> 05:03.398
<v ->I'd say one of the biggest innovations</v>

05:03.398 --> 05:05.730
you'll see from a production perspective

05:05.730 --> 05:07.230
will be over the air updates,

05:07.230 --> 05:10.250
and the ability with software defined vehicles,

05:10.250 --> 05:12.916
and the ability to take that,

05:12.916 --> 05:15.990
and really innovate as fast in a car

05:15.990 --> 05:17.664
as maybe not as fast as a cell phone,

05:17.664 --> 05:20.250
but faster than a every five or six year cycle.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.630
I think that'll be a revolution

05:21.630 --> 05:26.630
in how cars will be updated and advanced in the future.

05:29.820 --> 05:32.130
<v ->Yeah, for us at 3M it's really, you know,</v>

05:32.130 --> 05:34.230
back to how do we think about bringing

05:34.230 --> 05:36.510
our material science capabilities to life,

05:36.510 --> 05:38.619
and however that manifests for our customers

05:38.619 --> 05:40.592
in the respective industries,

05:40.592 --> 05:42.960
particularly in the automotive industry.

05:42.960 --> 05:45.360
Some of the macro trends that we're really focused on

05:45.360 --> 05:48.093
is as we think about sustainable materials,

05:48.093 --> 05:50.972
as we think about the safety of the vehicles,

05:50.972 --> 05:53.880
as we think about repairability of the vehicles,

05:53.880 --> 05:56.522
materials, innovations and materials

05:56.522 --> 05:59.460
are constantly needed for each of those.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.920
And so for us, as we think about technology,

06:01.920 --> 06:03.540
part of it's understanding

06:03.540 --> 06:05.550
the chemistry and the formulations,

06:05.550 --> 06:08.640
and how to understand specific use cases,

06:08.640 --> 06:11.340
and to bring that speed faster for our customers

06:11.340 --> 06:13.440
as we think about how to make

06:13.440 --> 06:15.210
a vehicle more sustainable or how

06:15.210 --> 06:18.840
to (indistinct) vehicles so that I can repair them.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.180
Materials sit at the core of all that,

06:21.180 --> 06:23.310
but really understanding those formulations

06:23.310 --> 06:26.430
at the speed of innovation that the industry is moving

06:26.430 --> 06:28.020
is one of the best things that we can do

06:28.020 --> 06:29.520
as we work with our customers.

06:31.380 --> 06:32.610
<v ->I kind of mentioned in the start</v>

06:32.610 --> 06:35.250
is the really connectivity.

06:35.250 --> 06:37.650
And I'll use our specific example,

06:37.650 --> 06:39.210
which is you think about

06:39.210 --> 06:41.430
the only thing connecting a vehicle to the road,

06:41.430 --> 06:43.907
is four palm size patches of rubber,

06:43.907 --> 06:45.392
and they carry all the forces,

06:45.392 --> 06:48.150
and keep you connected to ground,

06:48.150 --> 06:50.400
which right now of course is earth.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.660
And that's a really important job.

06:51.660 --> 06:52.890
And we've done it for a long time

06:52.890 --> 06:54.510
with chemistry and materials,

06:54.510 --> 06:57.540
and make no mistake, that innovation continues,

06:57.540 --> 07:00.510
but what we found is with this connectivity is

07:00.510 --> 07:02.250
well why not also be able to monitor

07:02.250 --> 07:03.930
exactly what's happening there,

07:03.930 --> 07:07.800
the friction and those connecting forces objectively?

07:07.800 --> 07:10.230
And it's something that becomes all the more important

07:10.230 --> 07:15.150
when you get out of the loop of the activity of driving.

07:15.150 --> 07:17.880
And so you as a driver do an awful lot

07:17.880 --> 07:20.530
to inform that system you probably don't think about.

07:21.450 --> 07:22.770
And when you're not there,

07:22.770 --> 07:24.300
something has to provide that.

07:24.300 --> 07:25.800
And so connectivity is something

07:25.800 --> 07:26.971
that's allowing us to do that.

07:26.971 --> 07:29.370
And you know, as we all start working

07:29.370 --> 07:30.210
and keep working on this,

07:30.210 --> 07:33.360
partners like Bosch, and the these control systems,

07:33.360 --> 07:34.848
this is a really exciting trend that

07:34.848 --> 07:37.323
we look forward to keep participating in.

07:39.300 --> 07:40.320
<v ->Excellent, thank you.</v>

07:40.320 --> 07:42.540
So, delving more into the

07:42.540 --> 07:45.870
manufacturing and product development process,

07:45.870 --> 07:48.890
how do you think that artificial intelligence

07:48.890 --> 07:52.443
is influencing that process for each of your companies?

07:55.470 --> 07:57.439
<v ->I could start, if you want on that.</v>

07:57.439 --> 07:58.590
(Wendy laughs)

07:58.590 --> 08:01.620
So, actually when I started at Goodyear,

08:01.620 --> 08:04.140
it was all on commuter simulation.

08:04.140 --> 08:05.940
Shockingly, I know I look really young,

08:05.940 --> 08:09.840
but in 1985 I started doing computer aided engineering.

08:09.840 --> 08:12.420
And the bottom line is that is,

08:12.420 --> 08:15.540
you know, heavy, high compute, okay.

08:15.540 --> 08:18.630
And it's awesome to run those kind of analyses,

08:18.630 --> 08:19.924
but if you really wanna start doing

08:19.924 --> 08:23.010
many of these things and more discovery,

08:23.010 --> 08:24.780
you've made a heck of a lot of data,

08:24.780 --> 08:27.210
whether through your testing or that kind of stuff.

08:27.210 --> 08:31.590
And we've built a lot of artificial intelligence,

08:31.590 --> 08:35.010
algorithms and almost expert design systems that help

08:35.010 --> 08:40.010
especially new engineers who come into your teams,

08:40.377 --> 08:43.050
be almost, have access to what

08:43.050 --> 08:45.000
a very experienced engineer would have.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.210
So it's a, think of it as almost like human augmentation

08:48.210 --> 08:51.240
to make them much more sophisticated

08:51.240 --> 08:53.550
than they really would've been warranted back in the day.

08:53.550 --> 08:55.890
So, so we see a lot of coming,

08:55.890 --> 08:58.473
and helping people get up to speed quicker.

08:59.760 --> 09:03.180
<v ->So I'm gonna build up on what Chris shared here on data.</v>

09:03.180 --> 09:07.141
For us at 3M, decades of data on formulations

09:07.141 --> 09:10.380
and use cases for different,

09:10.380 --> 09:13.110
different environments and requirements

09:13.110 --> 09:14.340
that our customers have across

09:14.340 --> 09:15.570
all these different industries.

09:15.570 --> 09:17.924
So how do we think about taking that data,

09:17.924 --> 09:21.090
as our engineers continue to push the boundaries

09:21.090 --> 09:23.220
and solve new challenges for customers,

09:23.220 --> 09:25.560
but learning from what we've done in the past.

09:25.560 --> 09:29.640
So we see data used along with machine learning and AI

09:29.640 --> 09:31.740
in the design cycles to speed it up,

09:31.740 --> 09:33.150
to make it more efficient for them,

09:33.150 --> 09:35.500
but to really push the boundaries of innovation

09:36.420 --> 09:37.440
in the design side,

09:37.440 --> 09:38.633
but then extending that even

09:38.633 --> 09:40.740
into our manufacturing environment.

09:40.740 --> 09:43.321
So the ability to run all of those simulations,

09:43.321 --> 09:46.680
and really fine tune designs for customers

09:46.680 --> 09:48.990
before I then go to the phase of

09:48.990 --> 09:50.910
running samples in the manufacturing,

09:50.910 --> 09:54.450
and spending spending not only the time and the resources,

09:54.450 --> 09:57.510
but then the materials that have to get utilized

09:57.510 --> 10:01.410
or even wasted if it doesn't pan out to be the right design.

10:01.410 --> 10:04.590
So we see that through our entire design cycle processes,

10:04.590 --> 10:07.086
our manufacturing processes,

10:07.086 --> 10:10.140
but then even kind of how do we take that further,

10:10.140 --> 10:11.820
to the benefit of our customer.

10:11.820 --> 10:12.870
You know, one of the demos,

10:12.870 --> 10:15.480
if you have an opportunity to go by our booth,

10:15.480 --> 10:16.915
where we see that kind of flow through

10:16.915 --> 10:20.600
into the manufacturing processes of our customers,

10:20.600 --> 10:23.130
it is automated paint repair.

10:23.130 --> 10:25.380
So taking 3M products,

10:25.380 --> 10:26.760
but it's not just the product,

10:26.760 --> 10:28.500
it's how do you use the product.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.701
So when you think of kind of patterns

10:30.701 --> 10:33.420
for repairing paint on a vehicle,

10:33.420 --> 10:35.670
which is, you know, it's a complicated process

10:35.670 --> 10:37.291
for our automotive OEM customers

10:37.291 --> 10:40.170
in vehicle manufacturing environments,

10:40.170 --> 10:41.728
but now how do you use the product

10:41.728 --> 10:43.770
in the right pattern depending on

10:43.770 --> 10:46.950
the surface you're trying to repair.

10:46.950 --> 10:49.230
You can leverage the data from all the,

10:49.230 --> 10:51.450
all the times that we've done this, you know,

10:51.450 --> 10:53.640
the specific location on the vehicle

10:53.640 --> 10:55.770
using AI and machine learning.

10:55.770 --> 10:57.420
So not, you know, to summarize,

10:57.420 --> 10:59.460
it's really how we do our design work,

10:59.460 --> 11:00.293
but then again,

11:00.293 --> 11:02.160
how our customers utilize the products

11:02.160 --> 11:04.410
that we also create.

11:04.410 --> 11:08.790
<v ->Great. So, with AI being so prevalent</v>

11:08.790 --> 11:12.696
in the manufacturing and product development process,

11:12.696 --> 11:16.470
I'd like to ask if there are any

11:16.470 --> 11:18.420
any sense of an idea of, you know,

11:18.420 --> 11:20.700
right now a new vehicle takes

11:20.700 --> 11:25.590
four to six years to bring to market depending on the OEM.

11:25.590 --> 11:27.690
If you hit a crystal ball,

11:27.690 --> 11:31.110
what would you say that product development process

11:31.110 --> 11:35.010
could potentially get down to?

11:35.010 --> 11:39.450
<v ->Well, if I think about our experience in China,</v>

11:39.450 --> 11:41.670
it's taking seven months.

11:41.670 --> 11:46.670
So there is a bigger and bigger gap between our more,

11:46.950 --> 11:49.800
let's say traditional established OEMs

11:49.800 --> 11:52.590
and their product development cycle,

11:52.590 --> 11:55.680
and tools and methods used, for example,

11:55.680 --> 11:58.920
in China where you can through reuse of data,

11:58.920 --> 12:00.480
like Wendy was saying,

12:00.480 --> 12:03.600
and the connection between field optimization

12:03.600 --> 12:08.490
and new product development, focusing on the core.

12:08.490 --> 12:12.060
So not reinventing components and systems,

12:12.060 --> 12:14.130
every time you develop a new vehicle.

12:14.130 --> 12:15.296
You can get it down.

12:15.296 --> 12:18.130
Well now, there are companies

12:18.130 --> 12:21.000
doing the same job in seven months.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.563
<v ->Wow, that's amazing.</v>

12:23.430 --> 12:26.190
<v ->Yeah, I would say from a software perspective,</v>

12:26.190 --> 12:28.020
we've seen some of our products launching,

12:28.020 --> 12:29.910
that used to take maybe two or three years

12:29.910 --> 12:32.280
into four or five weeks,

12:32.280 --> 12:33.660
because everything, again,

12:33.660 --> 12:35.010
going back to over the air updates

12:35.010 --> 12:36.750
and the ability to rapidly prototype,

12:36.750 --> 12:39.270
that didn't exist maybe five or six years ago

12:39.270 --> 12:42.270
in the automotive space is unbelievable.

12:42.270 --> 12:45.720
So you get a wide range now across,

12:45.720 --> 12:48.270
in some cases it's traditional five, six years,

12:48.270 --> 12:50.910
in other cases, they will have it out in months.

12:50.910 --> 12:52.170
Very different.

12:52.170 --> 12:53.730
<v ->Yeah, I think for us,</v>

12:53.730 --> 12:55.290
we do a tremendous amount of business

12:55.290 --> 12:56.640
with the electronics industry,

12:56.640 --> 13:01.440
consumer electronics, so PC, phones, tablets, et cetera.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.630
And what we've seen in that industry,

13:03.630 --> 13:05.130
is distinctly different than

13:05.130 --> 13:06.880
some of the others that we support,

13:07.920 --> 13:10.336
is the speed of innovation that our customers

13:10.336 --> 13:12.720
and the industry is demanding of us.

13:12.720 --> 13:14.466
So we've really had to think about

13:14.466 --> 13:16.440
if we're gonna best serve and collaborate

13:16.440 --> 13:18.120
with those customers and meet their

13:18.120 --> 13:20.010
speed of innovation expectations,

13:20.010 --> 13:21.795
we have to be able to keep that pace,

13:21.795 --> 13:26.190
and to be able to innovate with them and for them.

13:26.190 --> 13:28.170
So we're, you know, thinking about how to use

13:28.170 --> 13:30.960
virtual testing capabilities or whatnot,

13:30.960 --> 13:33.346
but really bringing the best of what we can do

13:33.346 --> 13:35.190
to serving one industry,

13:35.190 --> 13:36.990
and applying that to others as well.

13:38.160 --> 13:40.680
<v ->Fascinating, just amazing how quickly</v>

13:40.680 --> 13:41.760
things are changing,

13:41.760 --> 13:45.600
and how quickly new products can come to market.

13:45.600 --> 13:48.630
So outside of AI,

13:48.630 --> 13:51.000
are there other innovations

13:51.000 --> 13:54.483
that you feel are impacting the manufacturing process?

13:55.530 --> 13:57.570
And I don't know, Wendy, I saw you nodding your head,

13:57.570 --> 13:58.983
so maybe start with you.

14:00.180 --> 14:03.090
<v ->Yeah, I, you know, I mentioned an example</v>

14:03.090 --> 14:04.981
of how our customers are utilizing

14:04.981 --> 14:08.340
our knowledge and data kind of in their environment.

14:08.340 --> 14:11.100
I think similarly we're looking to leverage technology,

14:11.100 --> 14:15.690
whether it's, you know, basic data visibility,

14:15.690 --> 14:17.780
and real-time analytics and machine learning,

14:17.780 --> 14:18.930
on the factory floor.

14:18.930 --> 14:22.200
A lot of vision systems around quality detection,

14:22.200 --> 14:23.940
but really for us it's, we wanna be able

14:23.940 --> 14:27.450
to move and service our customers as best as possible.

14:27.450 --> 14:29.940
So leveraging every piece of

14:29.940 --> 14:31.530
capability that's out there from a

14:31.530 --> 14:33.690
tools or technology and data perspective,

14:33.690 --> 14:36.990
to really keep refining the operations of our environment,

14:36.990 --> 14:39.600
and getting closer connectivity tissue

14:39.600 --> 14:42.090
to our customers to respond to them more timely.

14:42.090 --> 14:43.950
So, excellent.

14:43.950 --> 14:46.460
<v ->Yeah, I would build on the quality.</v>

14:46.460 --> 14:48.330
And it is related with AI,

14:48.330 --> 14:49.664
but a lot of the image

14:49.664 --> 14:51.963
and automated inspection systems,

14:53.220 --> 14:55.680
you know, we make over 150 million tires a year,

14:55.680 --> 14:56.700
and each and every one of 'em

14:56.700 --> 15:00.150
has to be hand inspected at the end of a line.

15:00.150 --> 15:01.740
So you imagine that if, you know,

15:01.740 --> 15:03.720
your job is coming down a conveyor

15:03.720 --> 15:05.370
is to take a tire,

15:05.370 --> 15:08.400
it gets automatically set up, it's rotating,

15:08.400 --> 15:10.530
and you're under these kind of lights,

15:10.530 --> 15:12.420
and looking for anomalies.

15:12.420 --> 15:15.979
And a lot of really cool things coming,

15:15.979 --> 15:18.670
and that we're implementing in our plants

15:19.770 --> 15:22.920
to make sure that that job is now done,

15:22.920 --> 15:25.800
a combination of AI plus visual inspection.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.530
So some really neat applications there,

15:28.530 --> 15:31.413
and I've seen many of those around the show, actually.

15:33.930 --> 15:38.930
<v ->Fantastic. Okay, so let's kind of shift over to consumers.</v>

15:40.920 --> 15:44.820
So, Jeff, maybe we start with you.

15:44.820 --> 15:47.820
Can you share some examples of how AI

15:47.820 --> 15:50.523
and innovation are benefiting consumers?

15:51.810 --> 15:54.210
<v ->You see it all over the place nowadays</v>

15:54.210 --> 15:56.700
in vehicles, or even in the,

15:56.700 --> 15:59.550
in the process of how people acquire a vehicle,

15:59.550 --> 16:02.670
get it, or engage with information about the vehicle.

16:02.670 --> 16:03.900
The fact that there's chatbots,

16:03.900 --> 16:06.660
the fact that in a car now,

16:06.660 --> 16:09.390
you can ask questions of the car

16:09.390 --> 16:12.210
that relate to something you're trying to achieve.

16:12.210 --> 16:13.170
We were talking earlier,

16:13.170 --> 16:14.940
and there's a lot of evidence of this.

16:14.940 --> 16:17.050
Used to be you go in and you say

16:18.750 --> 16:20.760
you know, "Let's find a pizza place."

16:20.760 --> 16:22.560
Or, you know, use a search engine,

16:22.560 --> 16:24.630
or you use your phone to find this pizza place.

16:24.630 --> 16:25.537
Now you can say to the car,

16:25.537 --> 16:29.190
"Find me the best deep crust pizza place

16:29.190 --> 16:30.960
within five miles of my house

16:30.960 --> 16:33.270
that doesn't cost more than $20 a pie."

16:33.270 --> 16:36.390
And so you can get very more granular and specific

16:36.390 --> 16:40.140
with what information is being asked,

16:40.140 --> 16:41.460
let's say in the vehicle,

16:41.460 --> 16:42.727
and how it can help you to get to

16:42.727 --> 16:45.900
that customer satisfaction that's so important.

16:45.900 --> 16:50.220
So AI can really drive customer satisfaction

16:50.220 --> 16:52.413
in ways that didn't exist in the past.

16:53.310 --> 16:56.915
<v ->If you think about automated driving functions</v>

16:56.915 --> 16:59.841
that customize vehicle behavior

16:59.841 --> 17:04.841
to what your needs and safety, depending on weather,

17:04.920 --> 17:07.650
depending on the road you're driving in,

17:07.650 --> 17:10.080
depending on speed, et cetera, et cetera,

17:10.080 --> 17:14.070
it gives the end user the personalization

17:14.070 --> 17:16.710
of driving style to the safety,

17:16.710 --> 17:19.980
comfort, and speed that they need.

17:19.980 --> 17:24.980
So it's not directly related to consumer or consuming,

17:25.290 --> 17:28.800
but the usage of the vehicle is becoming

17:28.800 --> 17:32.790
much more relevant based on who you are.

17:32.790 --> 17:36.600
And also the development of functions becomes much faster,

17:36.600 --> 17:39.053
and the deployment of those functions in the field

17:39.053 --> 17:43.920
become possible through over the air updates on one hand,

17:43.920 --> 17:47.220
but also the fast development cycles in ADAS,

17:47.220 --> 17:51.870
and enabled by the right computing power in the vehicle.

17:51.870 --> 17:53.504
<v ->And to build on that a little bit,</v>

17:53.504 --> 17:56.580
this idea of the safety system, you know,

17:56.580 --> 17:59.233
I mentioned before, we focus on entertainment systems.

17:59.233 --> 18:00.960
But there's actually a linkage

18:00.960 --> 18:04.560
that can help improve customer satisfaction.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.660
We look at solutions that maybe

18:06.660 --> 18:08.760
with cameras in the car for safety,

18:08.760 --> 18:10.140
you can determine if someone's

18:10.140 --> 18:11.730
engaging with the content that's

18:11.730 --> 18:14.280
a video or audio that's playing whether they like it or not,

18:14.280 --> 18:15.900
or whether they're distracted.

18:15.900 --> 18:19.200
And you might turn down the music if you will,

18:19.200 --> 18:21.240
or switch the music based on

18:21.240 --> 18:23.520
the person may be agitated when they're driving.

18:23.520 --> 18:26.550
So the safety systems and the entertainment systems

18:26.550 --> 18:30.150
can play together in ways that didn't exist in the past,

18:30.150 --> 18:34.293
that are both creating a safer environment and a richer,

18:35.220 --> 18:37.870
immersive entertainment environment for the consumer.

18:40.290 --> 18:44.340
<v ->So, Nielsen IQ and GFK Automotive Research</v>

18:44.340 --> 18:49.340
shows that when people are choosing their next new vehicle,

18:49.590 --> 18:53.070
safety is one of the top reasons.

18:53.070 --> 18:58.070
And you know, we find that there are certain features,

18:58.320 --> 19:00.637
that, you know, when we ask people,

19:00.637 --> 19:01.800
"Hey, what type of features

19:01.800 --> 19:03.870
do you want in your next vehicle?"

19:03.870 --> 19:07.740
And we give the whole list of features across the vehicle,

19:07.740 --> 19:11.460
safety features always float to the top.

19:11.460 --> 19:14.550
So, you know, with that in mind,

19:14.550 --> 19:17.550
I'm wondering if maybe Fedra, we start with you,

19:17.550 --> 19:20.820
if you could share some innovations,

19:20.820 --> 19:22.680
some safety feature innovations,

19:22.680 --> 19:27.210
that you know consumers can really benefit from.

19:27.210 --> 19:30.360
<v ->Right. So if you come to the Bosch booth,</v>

19:30.360 --> 19:34.770
you'll be able to look at a couple of demos in this field.

19:34.770 --> 19:37.620
Like I was saying, advanced driver assistance

19:37.620 --> 19:40.530
is a core part of safety,

19:40.530 --> 19:43.350
from your lane departure functionality

19:43.350 --> 19:45.810
to your parking functionality,

19:45.810 --> 19:48.719
to in-vehicle sensing that determines

19:48.719 --> 19:50.840
if you are tired or not,

19:50.840 --> 19:54.660
or distracted looking at your phone.

19:54.660 --> 19:57.330
So you will be able to see a number of

19:57.330 --> 20:01.023
individual functions that advance safety.

20:02.190 --> 20:03.750
I remind you all that Bosch is

20:03.750 --> 20:05.880
an invented for life company,

20:05.880 --> 20:08.460
and in this spirit of invented for life,

20:08.460 --> 20:12.000
we use AI, safe AI, ethical AI

20:12.000 --> 20:14.550
to advance driver assistance functions

20:14.550 --> 20:16.170
and driving in general,

20:16.170 --> 20:18.633
making it safer for consumers.

20:21.420 --> 20:25.350
<v ->Maybe I could share a couple examples of</v>

20:25.350 --> 20:28.200
where we've done some of the work on this is,

20:28.200 --> 20:31.350
and in particular on just breaking.

20:31.350 --> 20:34.140
In 2029, NHTSA's coming out with a new

20:34.140 --> 20:38.340
automated emergency break requirements,

20:38.340 --> 20:40.710
and there's a lot of opinion out there on it.

20:40.710 --> 20:42.330
Can we meet it? Can we meet it?

20:42.330 --> 20:43.320
Two sides of the problem.

20:43.320 --> 20:46.500
There's a perception side, there's the action side.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.510
A lot of our work is on the action side,

20:48.510 --> 20:50.550
and knowing explicitly, you know,

20:50.550 --> 20:53.700
the capability real-time of,

20:53.700 --> 20:56.943
again, that connection to the ground, the tire,

20:56.943 --> 21:00.300
and is this vehicle really gonna be able to stop?

21:00.300 --> 21:01.890
And then two things dictate that.

21:01.890 --> 21:04.680
Number one is the condition of the tire,

21:04.680 --> 21:06.145
because based on what kind of tire you have,

21:06.145 --> 21:08.280
it has different properties in and of itself.

21:08.280 --> 21:10.230
The second thing is you integrate that

21:10.230 --> 21:12.540
with something around the road.

21:12.540 --> 21:13.950
And at dry conditions,

21:13.950 --> 21:16.184
maybe your friction is 0.8,

21:16.184 --> 21:19.710
but it drops significantly for snow.

21:19.710 --> 21:20.910
We are talking about,

21:20.910 --> 21:23.490
all of us are having snow when we go home.

21:23.490 --> 21:24.420
Too bad we can't stay,

21:24.420 --> 21:26.880
but the bottom line is then you know,

21:26.880 --> 21:29.310
well how much sooner do I have to start applying breaks?

21:29.310 --> 21:32.550
Now a consumer doesn't think about that,

21:32.550 --> 21:34.530
but there's a huge consumer benefit

21:34.530 --> 21:35.940
because people are putting together

21:35.940 --> 21:38.160
systems who will take care of that.

21:38.160 --> 21:39.840
A similar one we talked about,

21:39.840 --> 21:42.180
we introduced last year,

21:42.180 --> 21:43.890
and we're taking it around to many

21:43.890 --> 21:45.990
of the OEMs is on hydroplaning.

21:45.990 --> 21:47.820
And again, you don't think about it,

21:47.820 --> 21:48.840
you're going down the highway,

21:48.840 --> 21:50.640
and all of a sudden you come upon a puddle,

21:50.640 --> 21:53.700
deep puddle, and you completely lose contact,

21:53.700 --> 21:56.376
and at that point no control of your vehicle.

21:56.376 --> 21:59.100
And there was actually a connection into the infotainment,

21:59.100 --> 22:01.863
which is simply, "Hey, we're detecting you're

22:01.863 --> 22:06.180
starting to lose some of that contact area."

22:06.180 --> 22:08.040
And you could pass it at least through a warning

22:08.040 --> 22:09.217
through the infotainment saying,

22:09.217 --> 22:10.350
"You might wanna slow down."

22:10.350 --> 22:12.300
And the second way is through people like Bosch

22:12.300 --> 22:14.220
where they actually take control,

22:14.220 --> 22:15.765
and they'll slow you down.

22:15.765 --> 22:19.110
And so these are huge saviors

22:19.110 --> 22:20.352
and things for people,

22:20.352 --> 22:23.160
hopefully avoiding collisions, accidents.

22:23.160 --> 22:26.040
The consumer isn't maybe asking for that explicitly,

22:26.040 --> 22:27.720
but they're asking to be safer.

22:27.720 --> 22:29.670
They're asking to avoid collisions.

22:29.670 --> 22:32.370
And I think there's again, they're huge opportunities.

22:32.370 --> 22:33.900
And it's not for one of us to solve,

22:33.900 --> 22:35.640
it's how we work together to bring these,

22:35.640 --> 22:36.740
bring these to market.

22:37.890 --> 22:39.810
<v ->And for us at 3M, you know,</v>

22:39.810 --> 22:42.810
some of the ways that we add innovation to the vehicle

22:42.810 --> 22:45.330
around the notion of safety may not be,

22:45.330 --> 22:46.680
you know, quite as obvious,

22:46.680 --> 22:49.498
but you know, as Fedra and her teams,

22:49.498 --> 22:52.620
and other companies are focused on bringing

22:52.620 --> 22:55.860
bigger compute, or with compute centralization to vehicles,

22:55.860 --> 22:58.560
that suddenly creates new problems around

22:58.560 --> 23:01.470
thermal management and power management.

23:01.470 --> 23:03.679
As you're advancing and bringing more sensors,

23:03.679 --> 23:05.700
we have to think about the materials

23:05.700 --> 23:08.100
that go into the sensors and the sensor properties

23:08.100 --> 23:09.420
with like optical films.

23:09.420 --> 23:10.980
For example, or the conductives

23:10.980 --> 23:14.490
and all of the electronics components.

23:14.490 --> 23:15.900
So for us at 3M, you know,

23:15.900 --> 23:19.122
deeply understanding that those performance requirements

23:19.122 --> 23:23.280
as vehicle technology itself is shifting,

23:23.280 --> 23:25.440
we have to stay very much to your point,

23:25.440 --> 23:30.030
very, you know, very collaborative engineering

23:30.030 --> 23:31.350
to really bring that through,

23:31.350 --> 23:32.790
and make sure the material properties

23:32.790 --> 23:34.260
are supporting whatever requirements

23:34.260 --> 23:35.410
of the vehicle as well.

23:37.350 --> 23:40.830
<v ->Okay, so this is a little bit of a loaded question,</v>

23:40.830 --> 23:45.180
but it wouldn't be an automotive discussion topic

23:45.180 --> 23:46.480
if we didn't bring up Evs.

23:47.370 --> 23:51.963
So we know that demand for Evs is leveling off.

23:52.846 --> 23:55.920
I'm gonna ask the panel if you think

23:55.920 --> 23:59.100
that either AI or AR,

23:59.100 --> 24:02.520
or other innovations could possibly

24:02.520 --> 24:04.350
improve demand for EVs.

24:04.350 --> 24:06.030
And Jeff, I'll start with you.

24:06.030 --> 24:09.356
<v ->Sure. I think the biggest application</v>

24:09.356 --> 24:11.160
where AI can help is,

24:11.160 --> 24:14.550
the number one issue remains range anxiety, right?

24:14.550 --> 24:15.900
So there's certain parts of the country

24:15.900 --> 24:17.592
there's charging stations everywhere,

24:17.592 --> 24:19.530
and people have the cars,

24:19.530 --> 24:21.240
and they know where the stations are and everything.

24:21.240 --> 24:22.890
But then really if you look across

24:22.890 --> 24:23.880
the entire United States,

24:23.880 --> 24:26.280
there's vast stretches where no idea,

24:26.280 --> 24:27.840
there just aren't charging stations,

24:27.840 --> 24:30.300
or they're few and far between.

24:30.300 --> 24:33.000
And so the ability of AI to not just

24:33.000 --> 24:34.800
point out where the charging station is,

24:34.800 --> 24:37.020
but what the line is at the station,

24:37.020 --> 24:38.370
is it in a safe area?

24:38.370 --> 24:39.690
Is it, is it well secure?

24:39.690 --> 24:40.590
What else is around?

24:40.590 --> 24:41.797
Is there any shopping around?

24:41.797 --> 24:44.043
All that information would be

24:44.043 --> 24:47.310
really beneficial for that next level

24:47.310 --> 24:49.950
of consumer who worries about that.

24:49.950 --> 24:52.350
So at the end of the day,

24:52.350 --> 24:54.720
you're gonna have range anxiety

24:54.720 --> 24:57.090
that's gonna vary across the population

24:57.090 --> 25:00.090
to the point of some people never wanting to get an EV.

25:00.090 --> 25:04.710
But we're now past, let's say those initial adopters,

25:04.710 --> 25:05.850
and that next wave,

25:05.850 --> 25:07.710
they're gonna have to have a reason

25:07.710 --> 25:09.030
that makes them comfortable

25:09.030 --> 25:10.740
with not having to worry about

25:10.740 --> 25:12.000
where they charge their car,

25:12.000 --> 25:15.933
and it becomes more fabric of how they,

25:16.980 --> 25:19.087
you know, how they look at the vehicle and say,

25:19.087 --> 25:20.610
"That's not gonna be a problem."

25:20.610 --> 25:23.610
And AI can definitely help with that.

25:23.610 --> 25:25.770
<v ->I would build on what you're saying,</v>

25:25.770 --> 25:28.781
adding that, like another couple of use cases

25:28.781 --> 25:30.660
where AI can really help.

25:30.660 --> 25:32.430
One is on the range prediction,

25:32.430 --> 25:37.430
so upstream reduction of that anxiety that you discussed.

25:37.770 --> 25:41.542
And the other piece or end of the lifecycle

25:41.542 --> 25:43.740
is on the used car,

25:43.740 --> 25:45.210
which is a very big problem,

25:45.210 --> 25:47.043
is residual values of EVs.

25:49.230 --> 25:51.090
They are very low.

25:51.090 --> 25:52.350
Nobody wants to buy an EV

25:52.350 --> 25:54.180
because you can't resell it.

25:54.180 --> 25:57.360
So AI can help creating models

25:57.360 --> 26:00.570
that will give the used car customer

26:00.570 --> 26:04.230
a better view on what vehicle they are buying,

26:04.230 --> 26:07.386
and with that, fostering or motivating

26:07.386 --> 26:11.700
an increase in residual values that will

26:11.700 --> 26:15.420
hopefully motivate the market and increase sales.

26:15.420 --> 26:17.550
So those are a couple of use cases

26:17.550 --> 26:20.700
on prediction, range management,

26:20.700 --> 26:23.541
and then the certificate in the

26:23.541 --> 26:26.583
second end the car market.

26:28.470 --> 26:30.390
<v ->Great, thank you.</v>

26:30.390 --> 26:33.543
So, still focusing on consumers,

26:34.500 --> 26:37.050
I'd like to ask the panel,

26:37.050 --> 26:41.310
how do you see AI helping consumers

26:41.310 --> 26:43.170
with their vehicle experience,

26:43.170 --> 26:45.933
and their research process as well?

26:47.370 --> 26:50.163
So, maybe Jeff, we start with you.

26:51.630 --> 26:53.040
<v ->So from the research perspective,</v>

26:53.040 --> 26:54.940
I think it can help a lot.

26:54.940 --> 26:56.426
A lot of times when people go out,

26:56.426 --> 26:59.280
and they try to filter through all the information

26:59.280 --> 27:01.225
that's out there to make a choice on a vehicle,

27:01.225 --> 27:03.466
it's incredibly difficult.

27:03.466 --> 27:07.140
And so being able to synthesize all that information,

27:07.140 --> 27:10.388
and come up with different points of view online,

27:10.388 --> 27:12.721
or even at a a series of dealerships,

27:12.721 --> 27:15.210
I think would be essential to giving

27:15.210 --> 27:17.910
people confidence that they truly understand

27:17.910 --> 27:19.860
the difference between vehicles,

27:19.860 --> 27:22.650
and help them to clarify why

27:22.650 --> 27:24.330
they want one vehicle over the other.

27:24.330 --> 27:25.890
And I think that can actually benefit

27:25.890 --> 27:29.100
both the dealers, and the auto industry and the consumer.

27:29.100 --> 27:33.030
You have less people buying for the wrong reasons,

27:33.030 --> 27:34.170
for lack of better terms,

27:34.170 --> 27:38.460
and it's a much more educated consumer experience.

27:38.460 --> 27:40.170
And I think that particularly,

27:40.170 --> 27:43.140
if you get into an environment where you hear,

27:43.140 --> 27:44.160
like you think of a Tesla

27:44.160 --> 27:46.170
whether there's in a dealership network,

27:46.170 --> 27:48.060
it's one thing in the traditional sense

27:48.060 --> 27:49.200
when someone goes into a dealer,

27:49.200 --> 27:50.730
but if this is not gonna be done

27:50.730 --> 27:51.870
through a dealer network for some

27:51.870 --> 27:53.270
of the car companies going forward,

27:53.270 --> 27:54.780
then that would be essential,

27:54.780 --> 27:55.920
that'd be essential to help them

27:55.920 --> 27:59.103
to determine what and where, and when to buy.

28:01.410 --> 28:04.633
<v ->So we have a very large retail footprint,</v>

28:04.633 --> 28:07.620
and I will just tell you with a,

28:07.620 --> 28:10.147
how many of you go walk in, are thinking about,

28:10.147 --> 28:13.140
"Man, I'm excited to go buy my next set of tires."

28:13.140 --> 28:15.780
We don't, we don't find a lot of those.

28:15.780 --> 28:17.730
It tends to be a bit of a nuisance purchase

28:17.730 --> 28:19.080
except for if you're really

28:19.080 --> 28:21.400
into high performance or off-roading.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.670
And in fact people,

28:23.670 --> 28:25.200
and I think a good example,

28:25.200 --> 28:27.660
to the point made here is,

28:27.660 --> 28:29.250
how do you make people feel like

28:29.250 --> 28:31.290
they're not victims when they're walking in there?

28:31.290 --> 28:32.730
Because it's very hard to be equipped

28:32.730 --> 28:33.990
with the information you need

28:33.990 --> 28:35.440
and make the right selection.

28:36.870 --> 28:39.294
Your size of tire on your car,

28:39.294 --> 28:42.450
there may be 50 different options.

28:42.450 --> 28:44.070
And that's just from us.

28:44.070 --> 28:45.920
And so how do you know what to pick?

28:45.920 --> 28:47.280
And so I think,

28:47.280 --> 28:49.403
I think those are huge applications to,

28:49.403 --> 28:51.840
to give tools to users

28:51.840 --> 28:55.950
who don't engage in a purchase process often.

28:55.950 --> 28:58.470
Boy quickly that they feel like they have

28:58.470 --> 29:01.170
some good information and they're not just

29:01.170 --> 29:03.870
at the will of maybe who's across the counter,

29:03.870 --> 29:04.920
who might just be pushing,

29:04.920 --> 29:08.070
who they got a good incentive from this month,

29:08.070 --> 29:10.305
or they got a whole lot of 'em in the back, right?

29:10.305 --> 29:14.880
And so I think those types of applications that'll come,

29:14.880 --> 29:16.920
are gonna be really valuable.

29:16.920 --> 29:18.873
And if you could put 'em out there,

29:18.873 --> 29:21.060
it's not something you have to charge for.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.440
It just makes people wanna engage

29:22.440 --> 29:24.490
with your product in a more positive way.

29:25.426 --> 29:27.540
<v ->Yeah, I love your point on customer choice.</v>

29:27.540 --> 29:29.010
I think that's super, you know,

29:29.010 --> 29:32.100
giving customers choice is such a powerful

29:32.100 --> 29:33.930
benefit that we can offer to customers.

29:33.930 --> 29:35.790
When I think of AI in vehicles,

29:35.790 --> 29:38.880
I think one of the things that gets me most excited,

29:38.880 --> 29:41.760
is from the perspective of sometimes

29:41.760 --> 29:42.870
I don't even think about

29:42.870 --> 29:44.398
what I'm using in my vehicle,

29:44.398 --> 29:47.940
or of all the technology capabilities at my disposal.

29:47.940 --> 29:50.100
What am I using and what am I not.

29:50.100 --> 29:51.264
I may think I know.

29:51.264 --> 29:54.690
I may think this feature might be important,

29:54.690 --> 29:56.400
but maybe I'm actually not using it.

29:56.400 --> 29:57.750
So as vehicles get smarter,

29:57.750 --> 30:00.210
the ability to harness those insights,

30:00.210 --> 30:03.060
and tell me more about me that I may not even realize,

30:03.060 --> 30:06.900
and how should that feed into that next buying cycle?

30:06.900 --> 30:09.000
There may be a vehicle that's more tailored

30:09.000 --> 30:10.800
and better suited for me than I,

30:10.800 --> 30:12.390
than I would just even think about.

30:12.390 --> 30:15.990
So really bridging actual usage to

30:15.990 --> 30:19.740
me as a consumer and how I do what I do.

30:19.740 --> 30:21.900
You know, tell me what I don't know,

30:21.900 --> 30:23.850
just the power of what AI can do there.

30:25.140 --> 30:27.690
<v ->Excellent. Thank you. Great, great points.</v>

30:27.690 --> 30:30.396
If only we could apply that to mattress shopping.

30:30.396 --> 30:32.820
(group laughs)

30:32.820 --> 30:36.327
Okay, so you know, what we've learned today

30:36.327 --> 30:41.327
is that AI plays a key role in, you know,

30:41.430 --> 30:43.560
really streamlining the manufacturing

30:43.560 --> 30:45.299
and product development process.

30:45.299 --> 30:48.300
You know, we heard, you know, that there are,

30:48.300 --> 30:50.190
there's a great opportunity to really

30:50.190 --> 30:52.135
reduce the length of that process,

30:52.135 --> 30:54.270
and bringing that back to consumers,

30:54.270 --> 30:56.226
you know, potentially we could see

30:56.226 --> 30:57.958
new vehicles or new features

30:57.958 --> 31:00.120
come to market much quicker,

31:00.120 --> 31:03.600
reducing the overall product development time-frame.

31:03.600 --> 31:07.110
From a consumer perspective, obviously,

31:07.110 --> 31:12.030
you know, the automotive industry doesn't really,

31:12.030 --> 31:16.530
from an OEM perspective tout AI in their vehicles

31:16.530 --> 31:19.860
as much as some of the consumer brands do.

31:19.860 --> 31:21.927
Walking around the central hall yesterday,

31:21.927 --> 31:25.560
I saw some of the consumer brands positioning AI as

31:25.560 --> 31:27.300
affectionate intelligence,

31:27.300 --> 31:29.430
using the words empathy and care,

31:29.430 --> 31:31.530
and really trying to humanize it.

31:31.530 --> 31:33.510
I think the industry, you know,

31:33.510 --> 31:35.820
is really going into more of a

31:35.820 --> 31:38.430
technology advanced feature perspective,

31:38.430 --> 31:40.868
which there's a huge pull from consumers

31:40.868 --> 31:44.370
for the latest and greatest features in their vehicles.

31:44.370 --> 31:46.350
So, you know, different industries,

31:46.350 --> 31:48.483
different ways of positioning it.

31:49.320 --> 31:54.270
But we've heard how AI can also benefit consumers,

31:54.270 --> 31:57.176
and you know, even tying in the collaboration

31:57.176 --> 32:00.270
across all four of the companies

32:00.270 --> 32:02.749
in terms of how they need to work together

32:02.749 --> 32:07.749
to bring all this technology to life in a new vehicle.

32:08.100 --> 32:10.310
So, you know, with that,

32:10.310 --> 32:14.010
I'd like to ask each of the panelists to just

32:14.010 --> 32:18.540
kind of provide some final closing thoughts on AI for us,

32:18.540 --> 32:21.720
and then we'll move into questions and answers.

32:21.720 --> 32:24.750
So, I guess, Wendy, if I can start with you.

32:24.750 --> 32:29.070
<v ->Of course. Thought I had a minute to think about this one.</v>

32:29.070 --> 32:31.060
You know, I had a interesting conversation

32:31.060 --> 32:34.477
with someone earlier today, and they were kind of,

32:34.477 --> 32:36.510
"What was your thoughts of this show this year?"

32:36.510 --> 32:40.140
And I think this is the 15th year I've coming to CES.

32:40.140 --> 32:41.240
It's been a long time.

32:42.630 --> 32:45.480
But I think what really resonates with me constantly,

32:45.480 --> 32:49.470
is the speed of innovation.

32:49.470 --> 32:50.820
None of us can do it alone.

32:50.820 --> 32:54.577
We see over and over again how imperative, how just,

32:54.577 --> 32:57.390
you know, the sense of urgency around innovation,

32:57.390 --> 32:58.770
the importance of collaboration.

32:58.770 --> 33:00.270
We can't do this alone,

33:00.270 --> 33:02.340
but just unlimited possibilities.

33:02.340 --> 33:03.630
You go through all the different halls,

33:03.630 --> 33:04.800
all the end industries,

33:04.800 --> 33:07.440
what I can take and, I've done in this industry,

33:07.440 --> 33:08.820
we can apply over here.

33:08.820 --> 33:11.850
Just the possibilities are unlimited.

33:11.850 --> 33:12.960
And with that in mind,

33:12.960 --> 33:14.970
how do you really stay laser focused

33:14.970 --> 33:17.730
on the customer and what your mission is,

33:17.730 --> 33:19.137
and really triangulating them together.

33:19.137 --> 33:21.060
That's a lot to think through.

33:21.060 --> 33:23.130
That's a lot to really make sure

33:23.130 --> 33:24.810
you're focused on the right thing

33:24.810 --> 33:26.760
for your customers and your business.

33:26.760 --> 33:29.940
But innovation, speed, collaboration,

33:29.940 --> 33:32.700
no matter what you do, that sits at the core.

33:32.700 --> 33:33.700
And that's exciting.

33:35.460 --> 33:37.530
<v ->I think that ultimately the consumer</v>

33:37.530 --> 33:39.870
will benefit from all this AI.

33:39.870 --> 33:42.120
You know, we just gave examples of a buying process.

33:42.120 --> 33:44.730
I know in our world of entertainment,

33:44.730 --> 33:49.730
the idea is we can provide a great new experience

33:50.070 --> 33:51.540
that you didn't even know you could have out there

33:51.540 --> 33:54.180
because AI is working with all the content available

33:54.180 --> 33:55.590
to deliver it in a way,

33:55.590 --> 33:58.680
and introduce you to maybe sources, or content,

33:58.680 --> 34:00.944
or artists that you didn't even know existed,

34:00.944 --> 34:03.090
yet really delight you.

34:03.090 --> 34:05.795
And, so that idea of you're getting things

34:05.795 --> 34:07.080
you didn't even know were out there,

34:07.080 --> 34:09.570
the possibilities are endless so to speak.

34:09.570 --> 34:11.351
I think the consumers will really see that

34:11.351 --> 34:13.563
as a great benefit going forward.

34:14.850 --> 34:17.340
<v ->Chris?</v>
<v ->Well I've been coming</v>

34:17.340 --> 34:19.293
now just only seven years,

34:20.640 --> 34:21.870
but what I'd say is, you know,

34:21.870 --> 34:23.460
some of the things that we saw then

34:23.460 --> 34:25.800
are still the same ones I see now.

34:25.800 --> 34:29.550
The only difference I think is the progress continues.

34:29.550 --> 34:32.340
And I think we all have to just

34:32.340 --> 34:34.846
keep thinking that in particular,

34:34.846 --> 34:36.324
you know, our big focus,

34:36.324 --> 34:38.460
and a lot of things I talked about

34:38.460 --> 34:40.560
are different levels of how

34:40.560 --> 34:42.780
autonomy is continuing to come,

34:42.780 --> 34:44.433
and how that'll provide safety.

34:45.300 --> 34:48.210
Every year, I'm encouraged by the progress.

34:48.210 --> 34:50.520
It hasn't been a linear progress.

34:50.520 --> 34:53.220
Maybe, but, and it hasn't been as soon

34:53.220 --> 34:54.750
as everybody thought it would might be,

34:54.750 --> 34:56.430
but it's definitely coming.

34:56.430 --> 34:59.070
And I think if you, if you're open to that,

34:59.070 --> 35:01.680
and as you walk around,

35:01.680 --> 35:04.080
you can also feel it, feel it coming.

35:04.080 --> 35:05.940
So, so really excited about

35:05.940 --> 35:07.893
how that'll pan out and keep coming.

35:09.390 --> 35:12.543
<v ->Well CES inspires me beyond technology.</v>

35:13.680 --> 35:16.350
I don't know how many years it has been,

35:16.350 --> 35:19.350
but the fact that I see people from

35:19.350 --> 35:21.780
all over the world sitting in this room

35:21.780 --> 35:25.020
inspires me beyond the technology,

35:25.020 --> 35:27.630
that whatever is happening outside,

35:27.630 --> 35:30.000
whatever decoupling of regions,

35:30.000 --> 35:34.740
of technology decoupling of who owns what and where,

35:34.740 --> 35:38.610
that this week is able to bring

35:38.610 --> 35:40.950
people from all over the world

35:40.950 --> 35:44.040
that share a glass of wine,

35:44.040 --> 35:48.157
a beer, or just a chat, and that like Wendy said,

35:48.157 --> 35:49.762
"Nobody can do it alone."

35:49.762 --> 35:52.170
So I would encourage all of you

35:52.170 --> 35:55.200
to at least get to know each other,

35:55.200 --> 35:57.870
and advance the cause of mobility

35:57.870 --> 36:01.620
because it is core to our advancement as a species.

36:01.620 --> 36:06.600
Finding ways to sustainably move and share knowledge.

36:06.600 --> 36:09.750
So that is what I always bring when I go back,

36:09.750 --> 36:12.750
is the faces and the passports of people

36:12.750 --> 36:16.080
that come from all over the world to speak.

36:16.080 --> 36:17.820
And hopefully what happens in Vegas

36:17.820 --> 36:20.535
in some cases doesn't stay in Vegas,

36:20.535 --> 36:22.500
and that we leverage globally

36:22.500 --> 36:24.427
the exchanges we have here.

36:24.427 --> 36:26.130
<v ->Thank you. Well said.</v>

36:26.130 --> 36:27.685
We do have time for a couple of questions.

36:27.685 --> 36:30.000
Are there any questions?

36:30.000 --> 36:31.973
The young lady right there in the middle.

36:33.600 --> 36:34.433
Yes. Yeah.

36:36.080 --> 36:40.413
(participant speaking indistinctly)

37:05.040 --> 37:09.630
So the question was, autonomous motor homes.

37:09.630 --> 37:13.500
There is a display out there from her company.

37:13.500 --> 37:17.640
So does anyone here kind of see the potential,

37:17.640 --> 37:20.880
the possibilities for driverless motor homes?

37:20.880 --> 37:22.740
<v ->I will comment at a higher level,</v>

37:22.740 --> 37:24.900
that if you walk around the West Hall,

37:24.900 --> 37:27.720
what's amazing change over the last couple years

37:27.720 --> 37:30.180
is all the autonomy applied to

37:30.180 --> 37:32.310
the industrial side of the industry.

37:32.310 --> 37:34.230
You see dump trucks, you see,

37:34.230 --> 37:37.915
you see combines and all that other equipment

37:37.915 --> 37:39.870
that traditionally you said,

37:39.870 --> 37:41.040
well there's some guy back there

37:41.040 --> 37:42.690
running that tractor or whatever,

37:42.690 --> 37:44.010
and you don't need that anymore.

37:44.010 --> 37:48.660
So at that level you would assume all mobility,

37:48.660 --> 37:51.933
or all vehicles will ultimately have a driverless option.

37:53.640 --> 37:55.170
<v ->Yeah, I agree a hundred percent.</v>

37:55.170 --> 37:59.880
Maybe I'll give a very personal endorsement for this is,

37:59.880 --> 38:00.930
my brother-in-law went out

38:00.930 --> 38:03.936
and bought a 45 foot motor home,

38:03.936 --> 38:06.099
and as much as they love it,

38:06.099 --> 38:08.580
they're scared to death take it outta the garage

38:08.580 --> 38:11.040
because driving it is intimidating.

38:11.040 --> 38:12.660
And so this could be an extremely

38:12.660 --> 38:15.450
interesting case for autonomy actually,

38:15.450 --> 38:18.300
when you think about making the driving experience

38:18.300 --> 38:21.060
so that you can then take advantage of everything else.

38:21.060 --> 38:22.950
I don't think the joy of it is driving it.

38:22.950 --> 38:25.530
The joy of it is when you get it where it wants to be.

38:25.530 --> 38:28.320
So boy that sounds like a pretty darn good use case.

38:28.320 --> 38:30.963
So, definitely go after that one.

38:32.550 --> 38:34.470
<v ->Okay, we have a little over a minute left.</v>

38:34.470 --> 38:36.393
Any other questions? Yes?

38:38.340 --> 38:40.860
<v Participant>You made a comment about how can we increase</v>

38:40.860 --> 38:43.680
the demand for electric vehicles,

38:43.680 --> 38:48.150
how, actually I did a, I did a quick search.

38:48.150 --> 38:49.560
And year-over-year,

38:49.560 --> 38:53.400
auto sales have gone up like 29%

38:56.220 --> 38:58.870
The Ford Mustang Marquee sold more than (indistinct).

39:00.780 --> 39:02.897
So, in spite of the data,

39:02.897 --> 39:05.640
I want to look a little bit further and deeper,

39:05.640 --> 39:10.161
because that's OEM sales went up .09%,

39:10.161 --> 39:12.930
dealer sales are actually having trouble.

39:12.930 --> 39:14.747
<v ->Right. Correct.</v>
<v ->For Evs (indistinct).</v>

39:17.490 --> 39:18.930
<v ->Yes, definitely there's,</v>

39:18.930 --> 39:21.210
there's still, consumers are still hesitant,

39:21.210 --> 39:25.443
and so it's really how do we build demand for EVs?

39:26.760 --> 39:27.930
Right. Yes, I know.

39:27.930 --> 39:30.450
The Marquee outsold the Mustang,

39:30.450 --> 39:35.040
but overall we're seeing from our study that,

39:35.040 --> 39:36.960
and we survey a quarter million new vehicle

39:36.960 --> 39:39.990
and tenders a year that we're not seeing

39:39.990 --> 39:43.263
a long-term uptick in EV demand.

39:45.341 --> 39:46.620
Any other questions?

39:46.620 --> 39:47.880
Or Fedra, do you wanna add to that?

39:47.880 --> 39:49.050
<v ->No, I was just saying,</v>

39:49.050 --> 39:50.820
not contradicting what you're saying,

39:50.820 --> 39:54.540
we see a lot of delays in vehicle introductions from OEMs,

39:54.540 --> 39:58.410
and that is one of the manifestations

39:58.410 --> 39:59.970
of that flattening out.

39:59.970 --> 40:02.595
Of course new technology growth

40:02.595 --> 40:05.580
is still ongoing in double digit.

40:05.580 --> 40:07.923
Very far from the predictions though.

40:11.430 --> 40:13.830
<v ->Okay. And we are at our time.</v>

40:13.830 --> 40:15.840
Thank you very much for attending.

40:15.840 --> 40:19.440
I believe there is a survey that you can fill out

40:19.440 --> 40:21.270
to let us know if you enjoyed this session,

40:21.270 --> 40:25.290
and I hope you enjoy the rest of your stay here at CES.

40:25.290 --> 40:28.584
Thank you.
(audience applauds)

40:28.584 --> 40:31.751
