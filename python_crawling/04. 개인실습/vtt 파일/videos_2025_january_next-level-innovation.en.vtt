1
00:00.251 --> 00:02.834
(upbeat music)

2
00:10.740 --> 00:12.690
<v Chris>Thank you so much for stepping in</v>

3
00:12.690 --> 00:15.720
for our Next Level Innovation session.

4
00:15.720 --> 00:18.458
Mr. John Ellis, president of Codethink.

5
00:18.458 --> 00:20.580
And as I mentioned in the first session,

6
00:20.580 --> 00:21.510
for those of you who are here,

7
00:21.510 --> 00:23.870
this is our 25th anniversary for Connect2Car

8
00:23.870 --> 00:25.620
and pretty excited about a lot

9
00:25.620 --> 00:28.260
of the panels we have looking out to 2050.

10
00:28.260 --> 00:30.780
John gave us a pretty interesting, for those of you,

11
00:30.780 --> 00:31.613
how many of you were here

12
00:31.613 --> 00:34.530
for last year's sessions and saw John?

13
00:34.530 --> 00:36.360
Okay, so there were a couple of people in here

14
00:36.360 --> 00:38.460
that was a pretty interesting presentation.

15
00:38.460 --> 00:40.140
There were horses

16
00:40.140 --> 00:43.623
and there were battery powered cars in 19 what, John?

17
00:45.602 --> 00:48.210
<v ->Uh, wow, 1910.</v>
<v ->Yeah, 1910.</v>

18
00:48.210 --> 00:50.730
So this isn't the first time we've tried it,

19
00:50.730 --> 00:52.517
but I met John when he was

20
00:52.517 --> 00:57.517
doing some really interesting things at Ford at the time,

21
00:57.742 --> 01:00.120
and he spoke at Connect2Car

22
01:00.120 --> 01:01.920
and we were having some issues trying to connect

23
01:01.920 --> 01:04.500
some of our aftermarket devices to the OEM

24
01:04.500 --> 01:06.480
and I mentioned we were having problems

25
01:06.480 --> 01:07.687
and John was like, "Well, what's the problem?

26
01:07.687 --> 01:08.850
"We can fix that."

27
01:08.850 --> 01:10.650
And we've been friends ever since.

28
01:10.650 --> 01:12.540
So John, I really appreciate you doing this.

29
01:12.540 --> 01:13.980
I'll let you introduce your panelists

30
01:13.980 --> 01:15.840
and we'll get this day rolling.

31
01:15.840 --> 01:16.740
Thank you so much.

32
01:20.100 --> 01:20.933
<v ->Thanks Chris.</v>

33
01:22.432 --> 01:24.720
Happy holidays. Happy New Year.

34
01:24.720 --> 01:26.340
Welcome to Las Vegas.

35
01:26.340 --> 01:28.710
So Chris said, my name is John Ellis and I'm really thrilled

36
01:28.710 --> 01:30.480
and delighted to be here again

37
01:30.480 --> 01:33.281
on the stage at Connect2Car with you,

38
01:33.281 --> 01:35.610
but I'm more thrilled to be joined

39
01:35.610 --> 01:37.818
by some esteemed colleagues and friends

40
01:37.818 --> 01:39.450
and I'll introduce 'em quickly.

41
01:39.450 --> 01:41.460
And then I'm gonna do some level setting

42
01:41.460 --> 01:43.980
of some rules about our conversation.

43
01:43.980 --> 01:46.470
So to my immediate right is Madison Beebe

44
01:46.470 --> 01:47.703
from Ford Motor Company,

45
01:48.570 --> 01:50.691
an American OEM and provider

46
01:50.691 --> 01:54.870
of the number one selling car in the US at this time.

47
01:54.870 --> 01:58.241
To her immediate right is Jonathan Moore from Exida,

48
01:58.241 --> 02:02.430
probably renowned for the leading cybersecurity

49
02:02.430 --> 02:05.370
and safety assessment company.

50
02:05.370 --> 02:08.683
Next to him is Sabina Schneider from Globant.

51
02:08.683 --> 02:12.150
Globant is a global digital IT services company.

52
02:12.150 --> 02:14.580
We're pleased to have that conversation.

53
02:14.580 --> 02:16.740
And then last but not least to her immediate far right

54
02:16.740 --> 02:19.380
is Joseph Perry from Sony Picture Entertainment,

55
02:19.380 --> 02:21.123
a global content provider.

56
02:21.960 --> 02:25.200
So we have a cast of characters with a lot

57
02:25.200 --> 02:27.150
of different context backgrounds.

58
02:27.150 --> 02:30.180
And as we begin talking about what we might want to do

59
02:30.180 --> 02:32.970
as we talk about next level innovation was we came up

60
02:32.970 --> 02:35.250
with a few different things that we're gonna do today.

61
02:35.250 --> 02:38.310
First, we're not gonna take any questions from the audience,

62
02:38.310 --> 02:40.189
we only have 39 minutes.

63
02:40.189 --> 02:43.200
Panelists will be available afterwards

64
02:43.200 --> 02:45.630
and they will also be available tonight at the Cavesa event.

65
02:45.630 --> 02:46.463
And they will be available

66
02:46.463 --> 02:47.580
throughout the course of the week.

67
02:47.580 --> 02:48.413
If you use the app,

68
02:48.413 --> 02:51.300
you can get ahold of them if you have questions.

69
02:51.300 --> 02:52.710
Number two is each one of them

70
02:52.710 --> 02:55.080
is gonna represent the context that they're coming from

71
02:55.080 --> 02:57.300
and this is gonna be sort of like a bar conversation.

72
02:57.300 --> 03:00.060
So while we might not be looking at you or the camera,

73
03:00.060 --> 03:01.140
we are aware of you,

74
03:01.140 --> 03:02.970
but we're we're just five folks here

75
03:02.970 --> 03:05.370
trying to talk about innovation through a lens

76
03:05.370 --> 03:07.720
of some future context, whether it's five years, 15 years,

77
03:07.720 --> 03:11.280
2050, 2070, whatnot, okay?

78
03:11.280 --> 03:13.230
So again, thank you so very much for joining us.

79
03:13.230 --> 03:14.670
Appreciate you being here.

80
03:14.670 --> 03:16.830
Look forward to following up with you all afterwards.

81
03:16.830 --> 03:19.140
And with that, let me start.

82
03:19.140 --> 03:20.793
Okay, friends, here we are.

83
03:21.720 --> 03:22.553
Got our drinks.

84
03:22.553 --> 03:26.070
Alright, so I asked a question earlier,

85
03:26.070 --> 03:27.870
I'm gonna ask it again.

86
03:27.870 --> 03:31.500
Next level innovation 2040, 2050.

87
03:31.500 --> 03:33.057
I, last year was talking about 2050

88
03:33.057 --> 03:35.220
and I talked about some things that had to happen.

89
03:35.220 --> 03:36.690
But let's start with you Madison.

90
03:36.690 --> 03:39.207
What do you foresee 2035?

91
03:39.207 --> 03:41.190
So 10 years from today, 2035,

92
03:41.190 --> 03:42.903
and maybe even up to 2045.

93
03:43.800 --> 03:46.110
<v ->Yeah, I think we need to start with the perspective</v>

94
03:46.110 --> 03:49.200
of the consumer and customer expectations

95
03:49.200 --> 03:50.310
because during that timeframe,

96
03:50.310 --> 03:54.720
you're gonna have a wide variety and growing awareness

97
03:54.720 --> 03:57.851
of technology in the purchases of the vehicles.

98
03:57.851 --> 03:59.922
More familiar with technology,

99
03:59.922 --> 04:02.760
higher demand for seamless connectivity

100
04:02.760 --> 04:05.610
and experiences from your apps to your, sorry,

101
04:05.610 --> 04:07.260
from your phone to your car,

102
04:07.260 --> 04:09.420
potentially to other methods of transportation,

103
04:09.420 --> 04:10.950
whether it's your e-bike,

104
04:10.950 --> 04:12.420
your Uber, or even your home, right?

105
04:12.420 --> 04:15.563
So you have a highly educated consumer first of all.

106
04:15.563 --> 04:17.736
And then depending on the region,

107
04:17.736 --> 04:22.736
it's addressing the range anxiety is still a thing, right?

108
04:22.881 --> 04:26.280
So I'm expecting evolutions

109
04:26.280 --> 04:28.803
in the performance of batteries.

110
04:28.803 --> 04:31.560
I'm expecting an evolution of the consumer expectation

111
04:31.560 --> 04:33.840
from seamless connectivity,

112
04:33.840 --> 04:35.790
seamless experiences

113
04:35.790 --> 04:37.524
that are continuously updated over time,

114
04:37.524 --> 04:41.190
but something that helps me transition from home to car,

115
04:41.190 --> 04:42.971
to work to play.

116
04:42.971 --> 04:47.610
And then through that, not just from a battery perspective,

117
04:47.610 --> 04:51.120
but there's a shift from consumers feeling comfortable

118
04:51.120 --> 04:54.783
with EVs to going full in and that being their only car.

119
04:55.740 --> 04:57.480
So it's connectivity, it's experience,

120
04:57.480 --> 05:00.450
it's long range EVs or EREVs right?

121
05:00.450 --> 05:02.659
But beyond that, you have this massive

122
05:02.659 --> 05:05.280
internal electrical architecture revolution.

123
05:05.280 --> 05:09.450
And that varies if it's a startup, if it's a new EV company

124
05:09.450 --> 05:11.460
or if it's a legacy OEM like Ford,

125
05:11.460 --> 05:13.800
where you not only have current vehicles in production

126
05:13.800 --> 05:15.930
that you have to maintain over time,

127
05:15.930 --> 05:17.040
but you have next generation

128
05:17.040 --> 05:20.457
electrical architecture development and the tuning of that.

129
05:20.457 --> 05:23.670
So I view the internal innovation as just as important

130
05:23.670 --> 05:27.090
as the experiences to develop new things at speed,

131
05:27.090 --> 05:30.540
at velocity, at high quality, you know, automation testing

132
05:30.540 --> 05:32.130
and all the DevOps infrastructure

133
05:32.130 --> 05:34.410
that enables that innovation.

134
05:34.410 --> 05:36.570
<v ->So building on that conversation, Joseph,</v>

135
05:36.570 --> 05:38.857
I want to come come over to you

136
05:38.857 --> 05:40.110
and ask you the following question.

137
05:40.110 --> 05:41.970
So experience has obviously played deeply

138
05:41.970 --> 05:43.920
in Madison's conversation and you know,

139
05:43.920 --> 05:48.917
Ford a hundred and almost 125 years now in the making,

140
05:48.917 --> 05:52.620
question that is Sony Pictures Entertainment,

141
05:52.620 --> 05:54.630
Sony, I mean, we've had movies,

142
05:54.630 --> 05:56.130
we've had content for a long period of time.

143
05:56.130 --> 05:58.500
We start with, you know, silent films.

144
05:58.500 --> 06:00.480
We've moved up into where we're at,

145
06:00.480 --> 06:03.930
where do you see the content evolution occurring

146
06:03.930 --> 06:07.680
such that consumption in 2035, is it immersive?

147
06:07.680 --> 06:08.513
Is it three?

148
06:08.513 --> 06:11.340
Where are we or where do you see coming from Sony

149
06:11.340 --> 06:13.320
where that might ultimately end up given the role

150
06:13.320 --> 06:15.870
that you're playing in trying to bring content to vehicles

151
06:15.870 --> 06:17.580
and feel free to make this a global,

152
06:17.580 --> 06:19.380
like if there's regional differences,

153
06:19.380 --> 06:21.210
by all means, feel free to point on that.

154
06:21.210 --> 06:22.950
<v ->Yeah, exactly.</v>

155
06:22.950 --> 06:26.400
So I think before I deep into your answer,

156
06:26.400 --> 06:27.480
dig deep into your answer,

157
06:27.480 --> 06:29.670
I'd like to kind of comment on something

158
06:29.670 --> 06:32.940
that she just mentioned, customer expectations.

159
06:32.940 --> 06:34.890
And I think that's real important.

160
06:34.890 --> 06:37.230
I think customer expectations right now

161
06:37.230 --> 06:40.290
is that they should be able to watch their content

162
06:40.290 --> 06:43.470
from their different various services in their vehicles.

163
06:43.470 --> 06:46.314
And that currently is not available

164
06:46.314 --> 06:47.880
in majority of the vehicles.

165
06:47.880 --> 06:48.840
So let's start off with that.

166
06:48.840 --> 06:52.470
That's the basic minimum of what consumers expect,

167
06:52.470 --> 06:55.350
but where we expect to go from there,

168
06:55.350 --> 06:56.610
Sony pictures as well as

169
06:56.610 --> 06:59.730
other particular entertainment services.

170
06:59.730 --> 07:01.320
We think about the future of

171
07:01.320 --> 07:03.990
what those immersive experiences looks like,

172
07:03.990 --> 07:06.186
and along with the technology

173
07:06.186 --> 07:08.970
and the capabilities of the technology

174
07:08.970 --> 07:12.324
such as the APIs that are being developed,

175
07:12.324 --> 07:15.780
available inside the vehicle to create experiences

176
07:15.780 --> 07:18.798
that are actually, you cannot duplicate inside the house.

177
07:18.798 --> 07:23.798
You can't sit inside your living room and drive down,

178
07:24.000 --> 07:27.870
let's say the 15 here in Las Vegas and move around the car

179
07:27.870 --> 07:30.660
and then maybe have a content experience that reacts to

180
07:30.660 --> 07:32.061
that particular momentum

181
07:32.061 --> 07:35.190
or to be playing a game inside of a vehicle.

182
07:35.190 --> 07:38.580
Sony has groups, has other gaming companies as well

183
07:38.580 --> 07:40.080
that would react to that.

184
07:40.080 --> 07:44.790
So I think taking the basic expectation of being able

185
07:44.790 --> 07:46.950
to access my content in my vehicle

186
07:46.950 --> 07:49.620
or wherever I am in a way that interacts

187
07:49.620 --> 07:52.350
with my environment is where we're gonna go in the future.

188
07:52.350 --> 07:54.750
And I think a leveraging the technology that enables

189
07:54.750 --> 07:56.130
that experience is where

190
07:56.130 --> 07:57.993
we're gonna see in the next 10 years.

191
07:59.074 --> 08:00.390
<v ->So I want to, I'm gonna get to Sabina in a second here,</v>

192
08:00.390 --> 08:02.400
but I want to jump back to you and ask you a question.

193
08:02.400 --> 08:05.010
So are we ever moving away

194
08:05.010 --> 08:06.840
from the single vehicle ownership model?

195
08:06.840 --> 08:07.673
Are we moving away?

196
08:07.673 --> 08:09.510
Because if we're gonna really enable the services

197
08:09.510 --> 08:11.970
and experiences that Joseph just talked about,

198
08:11.970 --> 08:15.390
I don't see drivers necessarily being able

199
08:15.390 --> 08:16.950
to take advantage of that equally.

200
08:16.950 --> 08:18.257
So where do we get to from,

201
08:18.257 --> 08:20.160
say an OEM's perspective broadly?

202
08:20.160 --> 08:21.900
You don't have to talk about Ford just broadly

203
08:21.900 --> 08:24.364
to enable passenger awareness,

204
08:24.364 --> 08:27.543
passenger content, not driver or owner content?

205
08:28.770 --> 08:30.150
<v ->Help me clarify real quick.</v>

206
08:30.150 --> 08:31.500
When you say passenger content, you?

207
08:31.500 --> 08:32.700
<v ->Well, not the driver.</v>

208
08:32.700 --> 08:34.470
So anybody who's not driving the vehicle.

209
08:34.470 --> 08:35.970
So you have, right, you're in the car.

210
08:35.970 --> 08:37.050
So some of the things that you were talking about

211
08:37.050 --> 08:39.360
just very cool, like, you know,

212
08:39.360 --> 08:41.400
and awesome except that it takes away

213
08:41.400 --> 08:42.930
from being able to drive in safety.

214
08:42.930 --> 08:44.970
So we now have to worry about

215
08:44.970 --> 08:47.010
what's the rest of the occupants of the vehicle?

216
08:47.010 --> 08:48.750
Yeah, sorry, non-driver.

217
08:48.750 --> 08:49.583
<v ->That makes sense.</v>

218
08:49.583 --> 08:51.450
I think you were spot on, right?

219
08:51.450 --> 08:55.260
You have, if you're a single person, one car,

220
08:55.260 --> 08:56.520
you're optimizing for safety

221
08:56.520 --> 08:57.720
and the driving experience, right?

222
08:57.720 --> 08:59.970
If you have a family, you have kids in the back,

223
08:59.970 --> 09:02.940
you wanna entertain them, even in different markets

224
09:02.940 --> 09:06.635
where many of the people use their vehicles

225
09:06.635 --> 09:08.910
for a form of relaxation, right?

226
09:08.910 --> 09:11.190
You park in the garage, relax,

227
09:11.190 --> 09:13.050
you wanna have that connected experience

228
09:13.050 --> 09:15.060
that you can actually evolve the vehicle

229
09:15.060 --> 09:18.479
into more of a habitat on wheels type of a vibe.

230
09:18.479 --> 09:21.360
And one of the things kind of aligned to what you're saying,

231
09:21.360 --> 09:23.340
but in addition to the connected experiences,

232
09:23.340 --> 09:25.230
it's more of the personalization of the vehicle.

233
09:25.230 --> 09:27.270
So it's not just used for driving,

234
09:27.270 --> 09:28.620
but it's like the physical aspects

235
09:28.620 --> 09:30.090
of if it's a connected accessory,

236
09:30.090 --> 09:34.050
a physical accessory for camping, for some adventure,

237
09:34.050 --> 09:37.470
I think maybe the demand right now, especially in the US,

238
09:37.470 --> 09:38.760
might not be so large for that type

239
09:38.760 --> 09:40.620
of habitat on wheels environment.

240
09:40.620 --> 09:42.000
Certainly in other regions

241
09:42.000 --> 09:44.640
it's very pervasive and high demand.

242
09:44.640 --> 09:47.324
And I think the vehicle will evolve to have to deliver

243
09:47.324 --> 09:51.090
those seamless experiences, not just for the driver,

244
09:51.090 --> 09:53.700
but for all the passengers in the vehicle.

245
09:53.700 --> 09:56.190
<v ->So Sabina, conversations that we've had</v>

246
09:56.190 --> 09:57.360
over the last couple of weeks

247
09:57.360 --> 10:00.270
as we've been sharing our love of Latin America

248
10:00.270 --> 10:02.044
and software and services,

249
10:02.044 --> 10:06.239
everything that Joseph and Madison are talking about,

250
10:06.239 --> 10:08.520
we can imagine, absolutely.

251
10:08.520 --> 10:11.594
But it is deeply, deeply seeded in software.

252
10:11.594 --> 10:13.074
<v ->Sure, yeah.</v>

253
10:13.074 --> 10:16.604
<v ->Is this industry broadly, automotive,</v>

254
10:16.604 --> 10:18.300
are we ready for it?

255
10:18.300 --> 10:19.350
Are we there yet?

256
10:19.350 --> 10:20.430
And I mean broadly, right?

257
10:20.430 --> 10:22.290
There are elements, there's the traditional,

258
10:22.290 --> 10:23.610
as we called it, OEMs.

259
10:23.610 --> 10:24.900
There's the startup OEMs.

260
10:24.900 --> 10:27.600
We have China, we have Asia, we have other,

261
10:27.600 --> 10:29.250
so OEM is not equal to everyone,

262
10:29.250 --> 10:32.070
but is the industry broadly ready for this?

263
10:32.070 --> 10:33.461
And does it understand what that

264
10:33.461 --> 10:34.350
challenge really looks like?

265
10:34.350 --> 10:36.330
<v ->I think it's a very important question.</v>

266
10:36.330 --> 10:38.430
And before answering the question,

267
10:38.430 --> 10:40.980
I was dreaming about the experience

268
10:40.980 --> 10:42.570
that we can have at the car.

269
10:42.570 --> 10:45.420
If you are thinking more about 35 years from now,

270
10:45.420 --> 10:48.199
even hundreds years from now, we were talking about,

271
10:48.199 --> 10:52.380
you were talking last time about horses a hundred years ago.

272
10:52.380 --> 10:54.021
So really thinking ahead

273
10:54.021 --> 10:56.737
and probably I'm cutting it short,

274
10:56.737 --> 10:59.156
but I think that the autonomous

275
10:59.156 --> 11:01.590
and the electric vehicles are going to be

276
11:01.590 --> 11:05.130
like a commodity at the time, a hundred years from now.

277
11:05.130 --> 11:07.837
And the experience inside the car,

278
11:07.837 --> 11:09.857
to your points, both of you,

279
11:09.857 --> 11:13.899
is going to be the differentiator between the brands,

280
11:13.899 --> 11:17.895
which is a brand that is offering smooth drive.

281
11:17.895 --> 11:20.657
The entertainment inside the car

282
11:20.657 --> 11:22.418
is going to be very important

283
11:22.418 --> 11:25.350
because as this is going to be more autonomous,

284
11:25.350 --> 11:28.170
I'm thinking more about the Disney movies,

285
11:28.170 --> 11:31.890
about capsules driving themselves throughout the country

286
11:31.890 --> 11:34.964
and getting you to one point to the other

287
11:34.964 --> 11:37.920
without even hesitating, that's the objective

288
11:37.920 --> 11:40.260
and is going to be fulfilled very easily.

289
11:40.260 --> 11:42.330
So having that in mind, it's a lot.

290
11:42.330 --> 11:44.400
And going back to your question,

291
11:44.400 --> 11:49.050
AI is going to be core in the technology inside the car.

292
11:49.050 --> 11:51.134
Cybersecurity of course is going

293
11:51.134 --> 11:55.080
to be very important in order to make sure

294
11:55.080 --> 11:57.671
that the car runs smoothly.

295
11:57.671 --> 12:01.984
But above all, I think that to achieve that,

296
12:01.984 --> 12:05.626
I don't see all the ecosystem being ready

297
12:05.626 --> 12:07.863
to jump into something like that.

298
12:07.863 --> 12:10.474
It's a very challenging envisioning

299
12:10.474 --> 12:12.287
that we are putting in place

300
12:12.287 --> 12:17.086
and that really requires the architecture to be

301
12:17.086 --> 12:21.512
flexible to enable this type of technology inside the car

302
12:21.512 --> 12:25.470
and also in the manufacturing of the car.

303
12:25.470 --> 12:28.320
So I think that it involves a massive,

304
12:28.320 --> 12:30.360
profound, to your point, Madison,

305
12:30.360 --> 12:32.700
inside transformation in order

306
12:32.700 --> 12:36.570
to make sure that we are ready for those technologies too,

307
12:36.570 --> 12:38.700
like you mentioned, DevOps,

308
12:38.700 --> 12:41.520
continuous deployment is something

309
12:41.520 --> 12:44.790
that is one of the key points in technology in order

310
12:44.790 --> 12:47.970
to achieve something like this type of envisioning.

311
12:47.970 --> 12:50.910
And we are still struggling with with that I think.

312
12:50.910 --> 12:53.550
<v ->So.</v>
<v ->Sorry and legacies.</v>

313
12:53.550 --> 12:54.925
<v ->No, no. Yes.</v>

314
12:54.925 --> 12:55.758
<v ->Legacies</v>
<v ->And what?</v>

315
12:55.758 --> 12:58.320
<v ->Legacies.</v>
<v ->Legacy, okay. Yeah, yeah.</v>

316
12:58.320 --> 13:02.207
<v ->Sorry, it's about thinking technology</v>

317
13:02.207 --> 13:07.207
away from the traditional IT organizations.

318
13:07.290 --> 13:11.724
It's not the traditional IT that of course is needed

319
13:11.724 --> 13:13.350
for the manufacturing

320
13:13.350 --> 13:15.990
and everything to get like the standardization,

321
13:15.990 --> 13:17.160
don't get me wrong,

322
13:17.160 --> 13:20.220
but what we are talking about the experience inside the car,

323
13:20.220 --> 13:22.020
it involves a different technology,

324
13:22.020 --> 13:26.220
flexibility, scalability, and more consumer centric

325
13:26.220 --> 13:28.530
that is not the traditional IT for sure.

326
13:28.530 --> 13:30.540
<v ->So software's product now.</v>
<v ->Right, yes.</v>

327
13:30.540 --> 13:31.800
<v ->It's actually a product deliver.</v>

328
13:31.800 --> 13:33.267
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

329
13:33.267 --> 13:34.800
So then that Jonathan brings me to you.

330
13:34.800 --> 13:37.890
And so as I build off everything

331
13:37.890 --> 13:41.609
you've just heard from Joseph, Madison, and Sabina,

332
13:41.609 --> 13:44.883
the first reaction that I have and question for you is,

333
13:46.399 --> 13:50.250
is the industry ready for software

334
13:50.250 --> 13:53.182
that is now a product in the car?

335
13:53.182 --> 13:57.020
Where are we at in terms of sort of state of the art today?

336
13:57.020 --> 14:00.420
Where might we need to go in terms of innovation

337
14:00.420 --> 14:03.390
inside of how do we know that we can trust or that we can,

338
14:03.390 --> 14:05.100
that we actually can use that,

339
14:05.100 --> 14:07.560
which they've just talked about this amazing thing,

340
14:07.560 --> 14:10.200
but coming from an industry that is not historically

341
14:10.200 --> 14:15.120
software focused, where are we and where do we need to go?

342
14:15.120 --> 14:16.200
<v ->Well I'm sure everyone's thinking</v>

343
14:16.200 --> 14:20.460
what is a safety engineer doing at the leading innovation?

344
14:20.460 --> 14:21.750
<v ->Because he's a friend of mine.</v>

345
14:21.750 --> 14:23.517
He's a friend. Yeah, that's why, yeah.

346
14:23.517 --> 14:25.260
<v ->And of course safety is regarded</v>

347
14:25.260 --> 14:27.960
as one of the business prevention units

348
14:27.960 --> 14:29.760
in most companies, right?

349
14:29.760 --> 14:32.137
You might as well have a sign on the door that says,

350
14:32.137 --> 14:36.639
"The answer to your next question is no," and-

351
14:36.639 --> 14:38.401
<v ->What about the question after that?</v>

352
14:38.401 --> 14:39.943
Also no?
<v ->Yes.</v>

353
14:39.943 --> 14:41.294
(John laughs)

354
14:41.294 --> 14:43.950
Those silos are becoming ever more entrenched.

355
14:43.950 --> 14:46.170
The standards get bigger.

356
14:46.170 --> 14:49.270
The words that we have to read get more every year

357
14:50.580 --> 14:55.175
and ultimately safety comes down to who you trust.

358
14:55.175 --> 14:59.550
And software couldn't be a more abstract thing

359
14:59.550 --> 15:01.110
to put your trust in.

360
15:01.110 --> 15:02.100
Mechanical engineering,

361
15:02.100 --> 15:05.280
which has been the dominant force in automotive,

362
15:05.280 --> 15:06.330
is very easy to trust.

363
15:06.330 --> 15:09.870
You can look at it and you can see how thick the metal is

364
15:09.870 --> 15:11.550
and how strong the things are.

365
15:11.550 --> 15:13.800
Software you have no idea where on the planet

366
15:13.800 --> 15:15.570
that software was created.

367
15:15.570 --> 15:18.750
And being able to trust software is crucial.

368
15:18.750 --> 15:21.450
And which software do you trust?

369
15:21.450 --> 15:25.950
And I'd love to see a button on my phone that tells me

370
15:25.950 --> 15:30.030
whether I can trust my car for the next journey.

371
15:30.030 --> 15:34.710
And how does a blind person trust the car is safe?

372
15:34.710 --> 15:35.970
We're gonna be transporting

373
15:35.970 --> 15:38.400
a whole new section of society, children.

374
15:38.400 --> 15:40.140
There are gonna be parents

375
15:40.140 --> 15:43.200
who want to put their child in the vehicle

376
15:43.200 --> 15:44.970
and send them around the block a few times

377
15:44.970 --> 15:46.800
because it sends them to sleep.

378
15:46.800 --> 15:49.200
How do they trust that software?

379
15:49.200 --> 15:51.150
So trust is at the heart of it.

380
15:51.150 --> 15:55.170
And unfortunately the standards are mired in ancient dogma

381
15:55.170 --> 15:58.440
from the 1980s where the software was written

382
15:58.440 --> 16:00.222
by electrical engineers,

383
16:00.222 --> 16:04.445
not by competent computer engineers

384
16:04.445 --> 16:06.960
who understood how software works

385
16:06.960 --> 16:10.980
and maybe didn't spend all of their time thinking like I do,

386
16:10.980 --> 16:12.930
about how it can go wrong,

387
16:12.930 --> 16:14.760
but spend enough time putting tools

388
16:14.760 --> 16:16.740
in place to prevent that.

389
16:16.740 --> 16:20.580
And so we need a huge upgrade in how we trust software

390
16:20.580 --> 16:24.540
and what we do in order to achieve that trust.

391
16:24.540 --> 16:27.780
And for me it's an existential threat to my organization

392
16:27.780 --> 16:32.780
because we make a business out of periodically reviewing

393
16:32.831 --> 16:37.462
the work you do and maximally,

394
16:37.462 --> 16:40.620
we can do that about every six months.

395
16:40.620 --> 16:42.300
And yet with the rate of change

396
16:42.300 --> 16:44.790
and the number of recalls that are being suffered

397
16:44.790 --> 16:46.860
by automotive OEMs today,

398
16:46.860 --> 16:50.730
it's clear that we need to provide that assessment daily.

399
16:50.730 --> 16:53.168
And yet most software safety engineers

400
16:53.168 --> 16:56.880
want to hide away behind their sign that says no

401
16:56.880 --> 16:59.070
and don't want to get involved in solving the problem.

402
16:59.070 --> 17:02.460
So I'm here to encourage people to get involved

403
17:02.460 --> 17:05.490
and want to understand how things can go wrong

404
17:05.490 --> 17:07.620
in order that we can convey to our customers

405
17:07.620 --> 17:10.171
that they can better trust our product and your product

406
17:10.171 --> 17:12.093
and the claims that we make.

407
17:12.990 --> 17:14.799
<v ->Sorry, John one point.</v>

408
17:14.799 --> 17:16.140
<v ->No go. Yeah, go ahead.</v>
<v ->Follow up.</v>

409
17:16.140 --> 17:19.500
I like how you stated to trust the software

410
17:19.500 --> 17:22.590
and even more so with AI coming inside the car,

411
17:22.590 --> 17:26.973
what do you think that trust can be fulfilled in a way?

412
17:27.870 --> 17:29.490
<v ->Well, I think it's fairly clear</v>

413
17:29.490 --> 17:32.640
that the uses AI are being put to today

414
17:32.640 --> 17:35.040
are just a bullshit generator.

415
17:35.040 --> 17:38.100
You take crap in and you regurgitate it.

416
17:38.100 --> 17:39.813
And from a safety point of view,

417
17:40.788 --> 17:45.788
something like an AI that's got at best an 85% success rate

418
17:48.576 --> 17:51.570
is just not even close to being something

419
17:51.570 --> 17:53.550
you'd want to trust your life in.

420
17:53.550 --> 17:55.383
It's okay to win a game of go,

421
17:56.310 --> 17:57.870
but would you trust the outcome

422
17:57.870 --> 18:01.860
of the next game of go to your life?

423
18:01.860 --> 18:05.310
And most people would have cause to think about that.

424
18:05.310 --> 18:07.440
And if you're basing your large language model

425
18:07.440 --> 18:10.800
on the information that's publicly available

426
18:10.800 --> 18:12.390
on the internet,

427
18:12.390 --> 18:15.060
of course we all know that the vast majority

428
18:15.060 --> 18:17.288
of that information is written

429
18:17.288 --> 18:20.250
for reasons other than accuracy

430
18:20.250 --> 18:23.940
and contains information other than unbiased fact.

431
18:23.940 --> 18:25.440
And of course that's a big influence

432
18:25.440 --> 18:27.390
in the results of the language models.

433
18:27.390 --> 18:29.550
Now, no doubt given 10 years,

434
18:29.550 --> 18:31.140
there will be solutions to that.

435
18:31.140 --> 18:33.660
But again, it's gonna come down to trust.

436
18:33.660 --> 18:36.210
Which language model are you going to trust?

437
18:36.210 --> 18:37.140
The one that's trained

438
18:37.140 --> 18:41.443
on marketing and advertising click generation?

439
18:41.443 --> 18:44.370
Is that really the right model to be using for safety?

440
18:44.370 --> 18:45.827
And a lot of people

441
18:45.827 --> 18:47.580
don't really know the answer to that yet.

442
18:47.580 --> 18:50.700
<v ->They don't know or they're not willing to accept it?</v>

443
18:50.700 --> 18:51.898
<v ->I know the answer to that.</v>

444
18:51.898 --> 18:54.570
(John laughs)

445
18:54.570 --> 18:56.300
<v ->Alright, so Joseph, you've heard this.</v>

446
18:56.300 --> 18:58.500
I could see what people don't know in the audience.

447
18:58.500 --> 19:01.770
You are with me, an alum of Ford Motor companies.

448
19:01.770 --> 19:03.330
So we have automotive in our,

449
19:03.330 --> 19:04.320
I don't have it in my blood,

450
19:04.320 --> 19:07.164
but I think you do have it in your blood as you claim.

451
19:07.164 --> 19:10.830
But now in content and hearing what we just talked about

452
19:10.830 --> 19:12.540
and where things are at,

453
19:12.540 --> 19:14.940
what does that bring when you have conversations like,

454
19:14.940 --> 19:16.650
I'm gonna bring content into a vehicle.

455
19:16.650 --> 19:19.770
I came from a vehicle group so I understand the dimensions

456
19:19.770 --> 19:21.510
of the problem safety and others,

457
19:21.510 --> 19:24.720
but yet at the same time I'm here to make experiences.

458
19:24.720 --> 19:27.690
Creative, consumptive artistic experiences happen

459
19:27.690 --> 19:29.250
whilst you're in the vehicle.

460
19:29.250 --> 19:31.860
How do you balance or where is Sony Pictures

461
19:31.860 --> 19:32.970
or maybe just you personally,

462
19:32.970 --> 19:34.800
where are you finding yourself in trying

463
19:34.800 --> 19:39.135
to balance both the ask from OEMs or the ask from Sony

464
19:39.135 --> 19:42.810
and the ability to deliver into that environment?

465
19:42.810 --> 19:45.990
<v ->Well, I think it's not necessarily</v>

466
19:45.990 --> 19:48.060
a challenge specific to Sony,

467
19:48.060 --> 19:50.070
but I think it's a challenge

468
19:50.070 --> 19:52.860
that we have multiple industries

469
19:52.860 --> 19:54.750
that are now in a relationship

470
19:54.750 --> 19:57.030
that didn't used to have a relationship

471
19:57.030 --> 20:00.960
and that has created a whole new set of challenges

472
20:00.960 --> 20:02.850
in terms of how we work together,

473
20:02.850 --> 20:05.610
what our processes are, what our workflows are,

474
20:05.610 --> 20:08.670
and integrating those two within those different industries.

475
20:08.670 --> 20:12.953
So I think that is something going, speaking about trust,

476
20:12.953 --> 20:15.330
I think that kind of feeds into that trust issue.

477
20:15.330 --> 20:18.630
It's not so much when I talk to a lot of manufacturers,

478
20:18.630 --> 20:19.823
when I talk to people in the industry

479
20:19.823 --> 20:21.428
or even just consumers,

480
20:21.428 --> 20:24.360
everybody wants content in the vehicles,

481
20:24.360 --> 20:28.021
everybody wants these emerging experiences.

482
20:28.021 --> 20:30.256
But a lot of the feedback is,

483
20:30.256 --> 20:34.398
hey, we're just trying to stabilize our platform right now

484
20:34.398 --> 20:36.600
just to be able to support the services

485
20:36.600 --> 20:37.890
that we have to have.

486
20:37.890 --> 20:39.660
And if we start introducing

487
20:39.660 --> 20:41.364
all these additional other services,

488
20:41.364 --> 20:43.680
our concern is being able to manage

489
20:43.680 --> 20:46.770
all these changes at the same time.

490
20:46.770 --> 20:49.890
So I think that is a really big concern with how we do that.

491
20:49.890 --> 20:51.390
So how to operationalize that.

492
20:52.620 --> 20:53.820
And then one of the other things that I think

493
20:53.820 --> 20:56.572
that came to my mind as we were just talking

494
20:56.572 --> 20:59.948
is that when you have all these changes,

495
20:59.948 --> 21:03.270
it takes so long right now

496
21:03.270 --> 21:04.980
for some of these things to get corrected.

497
21:04.980 --> 21:06.360
You mentioned the recalls.

498
21:06.360 --> 21:08.940
You know, I have had an issue just

499
21:08.940 --> 21:12.030
with my simple wireless CarPlay in one of my vehicles

500
21:12.030 --> 21:13.958
that has not worked right in a year.

501
21:13.958 --> 21:14.791
<v ->Yes.</v>

502
21:14.791 --> 21:16.090
<v ->I mean that we can't even get that fixed, right?</v>

503
21:16.090 --> 21:18.900
And Apple's a company that, you know, embodies trust,

504
21:18.900 --> 21:20.970
but I don't trust Apple when it comes to CarPlay

505
21:20.970 --> 21:23.790
because I know that the technology struggles

506
21:23.790 --> 21:27.750
and then you've got a challenge with the industry experts

507
21:27.750 --> 21:29.190
and the retailers, the dealerships,

508
21:29.190 --> 21:30.450
and they're struggling with it too.

509
21:30.450 --> 21:32.880
So being able to fix all these things

510
21:32.880 --> 21:35.760
where we can respond better, we can have workflows better,

511
21:35.760 --> 21:37.110
we can have processes better,

512
21:37.110 --> 21:38.700
I think all of that is gonna be necessary

513
21:38.700 --> 21:40.740
to get people more comfortable.

514
21:40.740 --> 21:43.260
<v ->Excellent, so I wanna tap on something</v>

515
21:43.260 --> 21:45.270
and feel free, I've not, this is gonna be,

516
21:45.270 --> 21:47.520
we're in the brand new space here, so feel free to say,

517
21:47.520 --> 21:48.720
let's pass on to the question,

518
21:48.720 --> 21:52.260
but what kind of innovation would we expect

519
21:52.260 --> 21:54.840
to see in dealerships or at the point of sale?

520
21:54.840 --> 21:57.840
Maybe just forget dealerships, at point of sale.

521
21:57.840 --> 21:59.730
If I'm a consumer 20 years down the road,

522
21:59.730 --> 22:01.590
am I still going to a physical location?

523
22:01.590 --> 22:03.540
Am I still interacting with someone?

524
22:03.540 --> 22:06.118
Like how might we imagine the car

525
22:06.118 --> 22:09.235
actually suddenly being actually purchased

526
22:09.235 --> 22:11.978
or being acquired?

527
22:11.978 --> 22:13.860
Do you have a thought on that?

528
22:13.860 --> 22:14.850
<v ->I mean, quite frankly,</v>

529
22:14.850 --> 22:17.889
this is a bit out of my realm at Ford.

530
22:17.889 --> 22:18.722
<v ->Okay.</v>

531
22:18.722 --> 22:20.807
<v ->I do think that you touched on a few great points around,</v>

532
22:20.807 --> 22:22.800
you know, it'll tie into this

533
22:22.800 --> 22:25.668
in terms of collaboration and how we work together.

534
22:25.668 --> 22:28.170
When you talk about operational models

535
22:28.170 --> 22:32.177
across the supply chain, they're, I wouldn't say broken,

536
22:33.240 --> 22:35.880
but they weren't established under the framework

537
22:35.880 --> 22:37.590
of a truly software defined vehicle

538
22:37.590 --> 22:39.480
or software as a product, right?

539
22:39.480 --> 22:41.160
So when you talk about collaborative models

540
22:41.160 --> 22:45.100
and even how we improve the point of sale,

541
22:45.100 --> 22:50.100
there is a large opportunity for improvement

542
22:50.280 --> 22:53.160
of how the OEMs collaborate with our supply chain,

543
22:53.160 --> 22:54.270
how we integrate together,

544
22:54.270 --> 22:57.120
how we integrate into our common build pipelines, right?

545
22:57.120 --> 22:59.820
To manage that continuous deployment of new content.

546
22:59.820 --> 23:03.120
But that also helps with the point of sale interaction

547
23:03.120 --> 23:04.860
'cause you're ensuring that the vehicle is

548
23:04.860 --> 23:07.620
as its intended state at the most fresh state

549
23:07.620 --> 23:10.350
with the best and most recent content.

550
23:10.350 --> 23:11.720
Things like that.

551
23:11.720 --> 23:13.560
I think I'd have to pass personally

552
23:13.560 --> 23:16.170
on the point of sale interaction.

553
23:16.170 --> 23:17.670
<v ->Okay. Yeah, no, that's fine.</v>

554
23:18.750 --> 23:20.850
So one of the things that Jonathan,

555
23:20.850 --> 23:25.113
also an automotive background before into safety.

556
23:26.970 --> 23:28.800
Madison just talked about the contracts

557
23:28.800 --> 23:30.870
and the collaboration model having to change

558
23:30.870 --> 23:32.460
as did Joseph, et cetera.

559
23:32.460 --> 23:34.050
You and I have had a long conversation

560
23:34.050 --> 23:37.230
over many, many months where the historic contracts

561
23:37.230 --> 23:39.810
for suppliers were very steeped on hundreds

562
23:39.810 --> 23:41.760
of pages about the physical building,

563
23:41.760 --> 23:44.620
the ability not to delay the plant

564
23:45.480 --> 23:47.070
very little into software.

565
23:47.070 --> 23:49.590
And now however, software is in fact

566
23:49.590 --> 23:51.120
some of the most increasing reasons

567
23:51.120 --> 23:53.280
why either the hardware product is delayed

568
23:53.280 --> 23:56.460
or the car is built out of the factory, but then can't ship.

569
23:56.460 --> 24:01.020
Given where we're at in terms of either the safety industry

570
24:01.020 --> 24:04.980
or our culture of trust for software, how do you see us,

571
24:04.980 --> 24:08.070
what innovations have to actually happen do you think,

572
24:08.070 --> 24:10.470
in order for us to actually

573
24:10.470 --> 24:13.320
not only solve the problem but get ahead of the problem?

574
24:13.320 --> 24:15.900
<v ->Well, the trust model I'm afraid,</v>

575
24:15.900 --> 24:19.110
starts when you walk into the dealership

576
24:19.110 --> 24:21.183
and not many people trust the dealership.

577
24:22.620 --> 24:25.980
And there's not very much transparency there.

578
24:25.980 --> 24:28.170
Not many people are sure they've got a fair price

579
24:28.170 --> 24:30.758
for the vehicle having paid for it.

580
24:30.758 --> 24:32.880
The information you're expected to read

581
24:32.880 --> 24:37.710
and sign in many cases is longer than the Magna Carta

582
24:37.710 --> 24:39.300
and the Magna Carta is sufficient

583
24:39.300 --> 24:41.673
for the whole of the UK to declare freedom.

584
24:42.925 --> 24:44.130
(Sabina laughs)

585
24:44.130 --> 24:46.740
And if now I've got to go into the dealership

586
24:46.740 --> 24:49.260
and believe I don't need airbags

587
24:49.260 --> 24:51.390
and I don't need crash protection

588
24:51.390 --> 24:53.040
because the car's not going to crash

589
24:53.040 --> 24:56.100
'cause it's got crash protection software.

590
24:56.100 --> 24:57.300
So a very long way you've got

591
24:57.300 --> 24:58.920
to bring people in a short period of time

592
24:58.920 --> 25:00.333
to persuade them of that.

593
25:01.246 --> 25:02.130
And of course you think about cars

594
25:02.130 --> 25:05.010
over the last even 15 years,

595
25:05.010 --> 25:06.300
the widths have increased,

596
25:06.300 --> 25:07.440
the weights have increased,

597
25:07.440 --> 25:09.660
the current consumption has increased,

598
25:09.660 --> 25:11.670
and all of that is the exact opposite

599
25:11.670 --> 25:14.880
of what you need for an electric economy.

600
25:14.880 --> 25:17.193
So at some point we have to reconcile

601
25:17.193 --> 25:20.070
the safety improvements we get with safety,

602
25:20.070 --> 25:23.730
with all these potentially unneeded safety features

603
25:23.730 --> 25:26.130
that have evolved in the car that clearly

604
25:26.130 --> 25:29.460
and demonstrably do a good job of keeping us safe.

605
25:29.460 --> 25:31.740
And it's got to start with that initial experience

606
25:31.740 --> 25:33.607
that you have with the people

607
25:33.607 --> 25:36.540
that you hope are going to buy your product.

608
25:36.540 --> 25:38.910
<v ->So everything you just touched on,</v>

609
25:38.910 --> 25:41.772
so Sabina, again steeped in software,

610
25:41.772 --> 25:44.956
where do you see globally,

611
25:44.956 --> 25:48.060
so you're from Argentina, currently now in the States,

612
25:48.060 --> 25:49.380
but Globant is international,

613
25:49.380 --> 25:51.180
like, where do you see regionally,

614
25:51.180 --> 25:54.060
like, are we globally prepared for this?

615
25:54.060 --> 25:55.860
Not forget even just the automotive OEMs,

616
25:55.860 --> 25:58.260
we just talked about the OEMs, but we have supply chains,

617
25:58.260 --> 26:00.360
we have others that are part of a supply chain

618
26:00.360 --> 26:02.280
that's bigger than just automotive.

619
26:02.280 --> 26:05.400
Are we ready to actually do the kind of innovation

620
26:05.400 --> 26:06.630
that are being asked of?

621
26:06.630 --> 26:10.440
So powered by software in the context of this arena

622
26:10.440 --> 26:14.430
being a very safe or trustable vehicle experience on a road.

623
26:14.430 --> 26:15.601
Are we there?

624
26:15.601 --> 26:19.200
<v ->I think there's a long way to get there</v>

625
26:19.200 --> 26:21.540
from I think what you're referring

626
26:21.540 --> 26:26.160
on the contracts put in place for the providers,

627
26:26.160 --> 26:27.935
the IT providers.

628
26:27.935 --> 26:30.060
I see that many of them

629
26:30.060 --> 26:33.420
are mostly for the traditional providers, the IT areas,

630
26:33.420 --> 26:36.180
but not for the innovative,

631
26:36.180 --> 26:38.550
the customer centric type of thing,

632
26:38.550 --> 26:40.740
or building the experiences, as you say,

633
26:40.740 --> 26:44.310
from the dealership up to the OEMs.

634
26:44.310 --> 26:47.040
I think there is a lot of work to be done there.

635
26:47.040 --> 26:49.980
And even I think that we can think about

636
26:49.980 --> 26:54.540
a different operational model inside the companies

637
26:54.540 --> 26:57.900
where you can get that specific innovation,

638
26:57.900 --> 27:01.981
that type of consumer centric IT software development

639
27:01.981 --> 27:03.963
in a different way because it is,

640
27:03.963 --> 27:08.666
it's a different type of product centric thinking,

641
27:08.666 --> 27:11.862
more UX experience for the customers,

642
27:11.862 --> 27:14.040
for the dealers as well.

643
27:14.040 --> 27:16.631
So how to build that ecosystem of collaboration

644
27:16.631 --> 27:18.730
from the digital standpoint

645
27:18.730 --> 27:22.920
requires a different standpoint on the contract,

646
27:22.920 --> 27:25.249
the architecture, the organizational,

647
27:25.249 --> 27:29.424
and how you measure the success of those developments

648
27:29.424 --> 27:33.720
is different to the more traditional IT areas, I think.

649
27:33.720 --> 27:35.230
<v ->Okay, but I don't wanna let let you off the hook</v>

650
27:35.230 --> 27:37.200
with just sort of the framing.

651
27:37.200 --> 27:40.350
I want you to offer if you're willing to like,

652
27:40.350 --> 27:41.880
how ready are we?

653
27:41.880 --> 27:43.666
Are we?
<v ->Oh, we are not. We are not.</v>

654
27:43.666 --> 27:44.520
<v ->Okay.</v>
<v ->No, no.</v>

655
27:44.520 --> 27:46.020
We are far away from ready, I think.

656
27:46.020 --> 27:47.491
<v ->Far from ready?</v>
<v ->Yes.</v>

657
27:47.491 --> 27:49.893
<v ->Okay. Are we like, ready in my lifetime?</v>

658
27:51.150 --> 27:53.130
<v ->Depends on how-</v>
<v ->How long I live?</v>

659
27:53.130 --> 27:54.671
You're right, you're right. Yeah.

660
27:54.671 --> 27:55.822
(audience laughs)
<v ->No!</v>

661
27:55.822 --> 27:56.760
<v ->I'm at the, for those in the audience that know me,</v>

662
27:56.760 --> 27:59.370
I don't have a long expectation.

663
27:59.370 --> 28:00.511
<v ->No, no, I-</v>
<v ->Too much drinking.</v>

664
28:00.511 --> 28:01.410
<v ->I wish you long life.</v>
<v ->Yeah, yeah, I know.</v>

665
28:01.410 --> 28:02.490
Thank you. Yes, yes, yes.

666
28:02.490 --> 28:04.620
But for those in the audience that know me, it's not,

667
28:04.620 --> 28:05.820
they're surprised I'm still here.

668
28:05.820 --> 28:08.340
That's what they're really surprised I'm still here.

669
28:08.340 --> 28:10.560
<v ->No, it's the willingness to change.</v>

670
28:10.560 --> 28:15.330
I think the willingness to see a different mindset

671
28:15.330 --> 28:16.560
inside the organization,

672
28:16.560 --> 28:21.560
a willingness to get quicker cycles of development

673
28:22.185 --> 28:24.606
inside the companies.

674
28:24.606 --> 28:28.080
So that requires a different operational model,

675
28:28.080 --> 28:29.160
different architecture again.

676
28:29.160 --> 28:31.680
So, but it's the willingness to change that.

677
28:31.680 --> 28:34.710
And you don't need to change the whole organization.

678
28:34.710 --> 28:37.890
You can, as with any digital transformation,

679
28:37.890 --> 28:41.789
you can set aside our organizational group

680
28:41.789 --> 28:45.570
that is set up for success, for that development.

681
28:45.570 --> 28:47.368
And then from getting those results,

682
28:47.368 --> 28:49.920
you can start seeing what of those process

683
28:49.920 --> 28:52.290
you can ingest in the organization,

684
28:52.290 --> 28:55.380
but not really thinking about a massive organization

685
28:55.380 --> 28:57.750
that will take like forever to do,

686
28:57.750 --> 29:01.290
but thinking more about building different MVPs,

687
29:01.290 --> 29:04.500
testing like a more agile approach

688
29:04.500 --> 29:07.020
to the software development without thinking

689
29:07.020 --> 29:10.110
about the Pharaonic transformation overall,

690
29:10.110 --> 29:12.060
which, sorry, I've seen many of those

691
29:12.060 --> 29:15.060
Pharaonic transformations that is not going anywhere.

692
29:15.060 --> 29:17.010
The business gets super frustrated

693
29:17.010 --> 29:18.720
and they stop the investment

694
29:18.720 --> 29:20.610
and then you stop the transformation,

695
29:20.610 --> 29:22.290
which is what you need in order

696
29:22.290 --> 29:26.430
to continue having a good experience for the customer.

697
29:26.430 --> 29:30.690
<v ->So Joseph, and I will ask through the lens of Sony,</v>

698
29:30.690 --> 29:33.011
but it's really content creators broadly

699
29:33.011 --> 29:35.040
coming from a different mindset,

700
29:35.040 --> 29:37.740
strong software or strong content creation,

701
29:37.740 --> 29:40.170
which probably maybe a much longer storytelling

702
29:40.170 --> 29:42.951
and narrative of software and the creation of,

703
29:42.951 --> 29:45.720
are you finding to what Sabina talked about,

704
29:45.720 --> 29:48.420
the willingness in the collaborations to,

705
29:48.420 --> 29:51.660
can Sony offer insights to how to move faster,

706
29:51.660 --> 29:52.770
how to change faster?

707
29:52.770 --> 29:55.290
Or any of your co-creators?

708
29:55.290 --> 29:56.123
Again, I don't,

709
29:56.123 --> 29:57.690
you don't even have to talk about your competitors, but.

710
29:57.690 --> 30:00.840
<v ->Yeah, and I don't think it's just, it's with Sony,</v>

711
30:00.840 --> 30:03.030
I think it's with all the stakeholders

712
30:03.030 --> 30:06.300
that are gonna be partners in bringing these services

713
30:06.300 --> 30:09.030
and experiences in the vehicle together.

714
30:09.030 --> 30:13.948
And I think I like this idea of having an agile mindset,

715
30:13.948 --> 30:16.770
but not only in terms of the product development

716
30:16.770 --> 30:18.060
or the technology development,

717
30:18.060 --> 30:20.100
but really for the whole operating model

718
30:20.100 --> 30:22.440
in terms of the business model, how we partner together.

719
30:22.440 --> 30:24.000
We have to work differently

720
30:24.000 --> 30:25.680
within these different frameworks

721
30:25.680 --> 30:28.440
and we cannot wait until it's done or built

722
30:28.440 --> 30:30.630
because our grandchildren will be sitting here

723
30:30.630 --> 30:32.370
still trying to figure it out if we wait that long.

724
30:32.370 --> 30:33.720
So we have to start,

725
30:33.720 --> 30:36.090
we have to start now with the small pieces,

726
30:36.090 --> 30:37.260
with the small steps

727
30:37.260 --> 30:39.968
and then that's our roadmap to get to where we need to be.

728
30:39.968 --> 30:41.130
<v ->Excellent.</v>

729
30:41.130 --> 30:44.730
So Madison, given what Jonathan talked about in terms

730
30:44.730 --> 30:47.790
of the inverse relationship of size of vehicle,

731
30:47.790 --> 30:50.442
weight of vehicle going into electric,

732
30:50.442 --> 30:54.162
giving sort of technology roadmap being place

733
30:54.162 --> 30:58.770
that you sort of occupy, where do you see,

734
30:58.770 --> 31:00.300
what do you see an electric vehicle

735
31:00.300 --> 31:02.730
either looking like, touching like,

736
31:02.730 --> 31:05.070
feeling like in that 15 year timeframe?

737
31:05.070 --> 31:06.630
Is it lighter?

738
31:06.630 --> 31:08.130
Is it heavier batteries?

739
31:08.130 --> 31:09.930
Is it fully consumptive?

740
31:09.930 --> 31:11.070
Like where do you think,

741
31:11.070 --> 31:12.960
and again, just more broadly,

742
31:12.960 --> 31:16.140
where do you think that we as an automotive industry

743
31:16.140 --> 31:17.613
will try and head to?

744
31:18.570 --> 31:20.040
<v ->Well, I think coming from Ford,</v>

745
31:20.040 --> 31:22.110
we have a bit of a unique perspective

746
31:22.110 --> 31:25.500
because we have an electrified F-150,

747
31:25.500 --> 31:26.460
which is at the high end

748
31:26.460 --> 31:29.940
of the weight power, you know, scale.

749
31:29.940 --> 31:33.513
And then we have a Mach-E, which is a crossover essentially.

750
31:34.920 --> 31:35.771
So I think-

751
31:35.771 --> 31:36.604
<v ->They're both awesome vehicles.</v>

752
31:36.604 --> 31:37.530
I'm driven both. They're awesome.

753
31:37.530 --> 31:40.350
<v ->Yeah, I have a Lightning, absolutely love it.</v>

754
31:40.350 --> 31:42.172
So I think it's gonna be,

755
31:42.172 --> 31:45.090
well I think it will vary based on

756
31:45.090 --> 31:46.408
whether you're talking about

757
31:46.408 --> 31:49.620
a Tesla, a Rivian, an EV startup,

758
31:49.620 --> 31:54.620
or you're talking about an OEM with a very broad portfolio

759
31:54.780 --> 31:57.270
and if you look at the distribution

760
31:57.270 --> 31:59.190
and the applicability of an electrical architecture

761
31:59.190 --> 32:02.220
and you're managing ICE, EV, PHEV,

762
32:02.220 --> 32:03.690
potentially EREV, long term,

763
32:03.690 --> 32:06.339
like from an OEM with such a broad portfolio,

764
32:06.339 --> 32:08.580
you have to consider cost, weight, power,

765
32:08.580 --> 32:10.511
but also the scalability of your platform

766
32:10.511 --> 32:13.050
to the breadth of your portfolio, right?

767
32:13.050 --> 32:14.967
So that's one challenge there.

768
32:14.967 --> 32:16.560
From a long-term perspective,

769
32:16.560 --> 32:19.230
I think we're gonna see higher performance batteries.

770
32:19.230 --> 32:20.910
I think we'll see some mid-range

771
32:20.910 --> 32:25.443
of a combination of plugin, hybrid EV and EREV,

772
32:25.443 --> 32:27.660
especially depending on the region

773
32:27.660 --> 32:30.861
in terms of infrastructure, charging infrastructure.

774
32:30.861 --> 32:34.486
I personally took a drive out into the desert

775
32:34.486 --> 32:37.380
with my Lightning and my main concern was,

776
32:37.380 --> 32:39.887
is there going to be a charger available to me?

777
32:39.887 --> 32:43.290
Is it going to be open and is it not going to be broken?

778
32:43.290 --> 32:48.120
So I think there's gonna be an evolution in optimization

779
32:48.120 --> 32:49.710
of the architectures that we have today

780
32:49.710 --> 32:52.320
to span the breadth of your portfolio.

781
32:52.320 --> 32:55.860
I think we'll see more higher performant batteries,

782
32:55.860 --> 32:57.930
lighter weight, higher power,

783
32:57.930 --> 32:59.820
but the mix of EV and EREV together.

784
32:59.820 --> 33:02.700
And I think that has to be coupled with investment

785
33:02.700 --> 33:04.500
and evolution in the infrastructure,

786
33:04.500 --> 33:05.850
especially in areas in the US

787
33:05.850 --> 33:07.830
where it's either difficult to find,

788
33:07.830 --> 33:11.430
difficult to access or they're damaged.

789
33:11.430 --> 33:13.230
<v ->So Jonathan, how do you,</v>

790
33:13.230 --> 33:15.870
having heard what Madison just shared in the variants

791
33:15.870 --> 33:19.049
as a safety person thinking of software, how do you,

792
33:19.049 --> 33:21.210
how does that make you feel?

793
33:21.210 --> 33:22.740
<v ->Well, thankfully we're not trying</v>

794
33:22.740 --> 33:24.325
to dismantle nuclear bombs.

795
33:24.325 --> 33:25.947
(John laughs)

796
33:25.947 --> 33:26.780
That's a good starting point.

797
33:27.771 --> 33:29.490
There are far riskier, far more areas

798
33:29.490 --> 33:31.470
that result in far more harm

799
33:31.470 --> 33:34.470
than automotive will ever have to deal with.

800
33:34.470 --> 33:37.470
So the technology, the solutions already exist there,

801
33:37.470 --> 33:39.330
but scaling them to automotive

802
33:39.330 --> 33:41.866
is of course always the difficulty.

803
33:41.866 --> 33:44.160
And you know, I'm sure Madison would like

804
33:44.160 --> 33:47.763
to talk about 10 exciting products like the Lightning,

805
33:48.750 --> 33:49.860
but of course we're limited

806
33:49.860 --> 33:53.280
by how quickly we can scale our engineering

807
33:53.280 --> 33:55.771
and design process to deliver that.

808
33:55.771 --> 33:56.700
We've got a finite number of people

809
33:56.700 --> 33:58.450
that we can afford to do that work.

810
33:59.466 --> 34:02.880
I'm thrilled to have given Red Hat a certificate this week

811
34:02.880 --> 34:07.080
for a big component of their upcoming open operating system.

812
34:07.080 --> 34:10.770
Certainly openness is going to play a crucial part.

813
34:10.770 --> 34:14.225
What I really like about open software

814
34:14.225 --> 34:18.731
is that the politicians can't do anything about it.

815
34:18.731 --> 34:21.390
We can play around the world

816
34:21.390 --> 34:26.390
to the best of our human ability in the open.

817
34:27.300 --> 34:30.330
And of course there's the trustable framework at Codethink,

818
34:30.330 --> 34:32.151
which is the only,

819
34:32.151 --> 34:35.160
is the only initiative I'm aware of

820
34:35.160 --> 34:36.960
that's even aware of the need

821
34:36.960 --> 34:40.560
for trust in the entire software supply chain.

822
34:40.560 --> 34:43.260
So I'm quite excited about that.

823
34:43.260 --> 34:44.093
I'm an engineer,

824
34:44.093 --> 34:46.080
so I'm a little bit more excited

825
34:46.080 --> 34:48.333
about our ability to solve these problems,

826
34:49.740 --> 34:54.740
but openness and trust are gonna be crucial in that.

827
34:56.520 --> 34:57.353
<v ->Excellent.</v>

828
34:57.353 --> 34:59.580
<v ->Sorry, I have a reflection on what John was saying.</v>

829
34:59.580 --> 35:02.151
I think that's a very important point

830
35:02.151 --> 35:04.290
about the crowdsourcing of the development.

831
35:04.290 --> 35:06.660
If we are thinking about all these very good ideas

832
35:06.660 --> 35:09.030
of where is the vehicle going in,

833
35:09.030 --> 35:10.800
I don't know, a hundred years from now,

834
35:10.800 --> 35:13.053
I think it's almost impossible to think

835
35:13.053 --> 35:16.980
that only one team can solve these type of experiences

836
35:16.980 --> 35:20.745
and the creative power is better if we can boost

837
35:20.745 --> 35:23.940
and have the architecture safe, of course,

838
35:23.940 --> 35:27.090
and scalable to allow different developers

839
35:27.090 --> 35:30.180
to bring the applications on the car.

840
35:30.180 --> 35:33.180
But that requires a good infrastructure

841
35:33.180 --> 35:36.300
in place right there, good architecture.

842
35:36.300 --> 35:38.070
<v ->Excellent, so we have four minutes left.</v>

843
35:38.070 --> 35:40.560
I know the time has been so fast.

844
35:40.560 --> 35:43.260
I'm gonna give each of you, we hadn't talked about this,

845
35:43.260 --> 35:45.690
so audience, this is a surprise,

846
35:45.690 --> 35:48.060
each of you, one minute public service announcement message

847
35:48.060 --> 35:49.080
starting with you Joseph,

848
35:49.080 --> 35:51.420
what do you wanna leave the audience with

849
35:51.420 --> 35:53.250
about the topic of next level innovation

850
35:53.250 --> 35:54.810
or about Sony Picture Entertainment

851
35:54.810 --> 35:56.250
or about your thoughts

852
35:56.250 --> 35:58.290
on where we are of vis-a-vis innovation?

853
35:58.290 --> 36:00.993
I'll ask each of you then to go in one minute each.

854
36:01.980 --> 36:03.840
<v ->I think I would like to leave with the fact</v>

855
36:03.840 --> 36:05.880
that I think we are starting now.

856
36:05.880 --> 36:07.590
I think you've seen some

857
36:07.590 --> 36:10.470
and even announcements as recent as this week

858
36:10.470 --> 36:13.380
in terms of small steps that start us to get to that place

859
36:13.380 --> 36:15.060
of working collaboratively.

860
36:15.060 --> 36:19.851
And just the plug, we do have a vehicle in the Xperi booth

861
36:19.851 --> 36:22.321
that's partnered with our partner Mercedes vehicles

862
36:22.321 --> 36:23.790
that talks about some of those

863
36:23.790 --> 36:25.980
initial immersive experiences.

864
36:25.980 --> 36:27.510
Please stop by and take a look at it

865
36:27.510 --> 36:30.060
and I welcome to talk with any of you

866
36:30.060 --> 36:32.310
about future partnership opportunities.

867
36:32.310 --> 36:34.350
<v ->Fantastic, Sabina?</v>

868
36:34.350 --> 36:37.230
<v ->I think that we barely touched upon that,</v>

869
36:37.230 --> 36:40.020
but it is a huge topic about data.

870
36:40.020 --> 36:43.942
Data monetization for AMS is a good opportunity.

871
36:43.942 --> 36:46.620
Always focusing on the consumer

872
36:46.620 --> 36:50.283
and getting that innovation from the consumer to the rest.

873
36:50.283 --> 36:52.320
And I think that Globant

874
36:52.320 --> 36:55.680
can have a privileged opportunity there

875
36:55.680 --> 36:59.546
to help you step up in those transformationals,

876
36:59.546 --> 37:02.370
process that you already have in place.

877
37:02.370 --> 37:04.050
Or if you want to challenge yourself,

878
37:04.050 --> 37:06.150
we can be the perfect partner for you

879
37:06.150 --> 37:09.120
to get along the this journey and challenge.

880
37:09.120 --> 37:11.010
<v ->Thank you, Jonathan?</v>

881
37:11.010 --> 37:13.380
<v ->Well, become an automotive engineer.</v>

882
37:13.380 --> 37:16.713
It's the most fulfilling and rewarding career you can have.

883
37:18.090 --> 37:21.805
It's tremendously sensitive to small mistakes,

884
37:21.805 --> 37:24.870
but I can tell you every single component on the vehicle

885
37:24.870 --> 37:27.210
is one that the customer notices.

886
37:27.210 --> 37:29.531
And if it's not one they're directly interfacing with,

887
37:29.531 --> 37:32.820
and if it fails, they will notice.

888
37:32.820 --> 37:34.080
And if they don't notice it,

889
37:34.080 --> 37:36.630
it's going to be deleted as a cost save.

890
37:36.630 --> 37:38.550
And I can't think of anything more rewarding

891
37:38.550 --> 37:41.070
than working on something that your customers

892
37:41.070 --> 37:44.220
actively have an interface with and have to deal with.

893
37:44.220 --> 37:46.350
So come and become an automotive engineer,

894
37:46.350 --> 37:49.590
come and solve complex software and safety problems.

895
37:49.590 --> 37:51.063
<v ->Thank you, Madison?</v>

896
37:52.103 --> 37:53.700
<v ->I guess my parting thoughts,</v>

897
37:53.700 --> 37:56.220
first, it's great to be up here on stage with you guys

898
37:56.220 --> 37:58.890
and thank you for everybody who joined.

899
37:58.890 --> 38:00.791
I think a parting thought

900
38:00.791 --> 38:02.490
on the technology advancements

901
38:02.490 --> 38:04.350
is something that you mentioned is the complexity

902
38:04.350 --> 38:06.300
of the systems that we're talking about.

903
38:06.300 --> 38:11.300
And I think we're in a stage of tuning and then next gen,

904
38:12.651 --> 38:15.351
we as an industry have evolved

905
38:15.351 --> 38:18.806
to potentially a zonal based architecture.

906
38:18.806 --> 38:20.700
But I talked about the beginning

907
38:20.700 --> 38:22.260
about customer expectations.

908
38:22.260 --> 38:23.580
Our customer's expectations

909
38:23.580 --> 38:26.130
are about affordable vehicles as well.

910
38:26.130 --> 38:29.640
So I think we're gonna be seeing tuning and optimization

911
38:29.640 --> 38:32.430
and cost downs in addition to the management

912
38:32.430 --> 38:33.810
of these complex systems,

913
38:33.810 --> 38:38.310
the complexity of the software, so yeah.

914
38:38.310 --> 38:39.389
<v ->Excellent.</v>

915
38:39.389 --> 38:42.390
Ladies and gentlemen, please give a big round of applause

916
38:42.390 --> 38:46.291
to my colleagues, Joseph, Sabina, Jonathan and Madison.

917
38:46.291 --> 38:47.940
(audience applauding)

918
38:47.940 --> 38:50.220
It's been great to put this show on for you.

919
38:50.220 --> 38:52.080
It really was for us to show we, like I said,

920
38:52.080 --> 38:54.911
we kind of ignored you and had our little conversation here.

921
38:54.911 --> 38:58.170
All will be available for a few minutes after today.

922
38:58.170 --> 38:59.250
They'll also be available

923
38:59.250 --> 39:01.830
at the session tonight if you're interested.

924
39:01.830 --> 39:03.360
And then as Joseph said,

925
39:03.360 --> 39:05.280
there's booths now, feel free to find them.

926
39:05.280 --> 39:06.330
Use the app.

927
39:06.330 --> 39:08.010
Thank you again for coming and supporting Connect2Car.

928
39:08.010 --> 39:08.880
Appreciate you.

929
39:08.880 --> 39:10.671
Enjoy the rest of your show.

930
39:10.671 --> 39:12.005
(audience applauding)

931
39:12.005 --> 39:14.588
(upbeat music)
