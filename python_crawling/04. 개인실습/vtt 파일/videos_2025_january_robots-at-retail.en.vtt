00:00.003 --> 00:02.836
(energetic music)

00:10.403 --> 00:12.536
- Okay, the mics are on.

00:12.536 --> 00:14.070
Good morning.

00:14.070 --> 00:15.270
9:00 AM Vegas.

00:15.270 --> 00:18.470
You guys are really
impressive, I gotta tell you.

00:18.470 --> 00:22.370
So we get the honor to kick off

00:22.370 --> 00:25.470
the robotics discussion here at CES,

00:25.470 --> 00:27.703
here at 9:00 AM in the West Hall,

00:27.703 --> 00:31.703
about retail robotics, robots at retail.

00:31.703 --> 00:35.536
My name's Oliver Mitchell
and I'm your moderator.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.870
And I'm gonna tell you a
little bit about myself,

00:38.870 --> 00:41.370
a little bit about how I see the landscape

00:41.370 --> 00:42.503
of retail robotics.

00:42.503 --> 00:44.770
And then I'm gonna let
each of our panelists

00:44.770 --> 00:48.070
introduce themselves and share with you

00:48.070 --> 00:49.770
their videos of their products

00:49.770 --> 00:51.503
that you might have never seen.

00:51.503 --> 00:54.403
This is really, you know,
news-breaking stuff here.

00:55.303 --> 00:57.936
So there I am again.

00:57.936 --> 00:59.103
All right.

00:59.103 --> 01:00.870
So does everyone know who that robot

01:00.870 --> 01:03.036
is there serving the drinks?

01:03.036 --> 01:07.403
That's Elon Musk dressed
up as a robot, Optimist.

01:07.403 --> 01:11.470
So as I mentioned
before, my name's Oliver.

01:11.470 --> 01:12.936
I'm a venture capitalist.

01:12.936 --> 01:14.703
And so why should you listen to me?

01:14.703 --> 01:16.170
Because I deploy capital?

01:16.170 --> 01:20.203
No, I've been a founder
and operator of startups.

01:20.203 --> 01:22.770
I've sold them to big multinationals.

01:22.770 --> 01:26.070
And my last one was called
Robot Galaxy at retail.

01:26.070 --> 01:28.370
It was a STEM robotics company.

01:28.370 --> 01:31.336
We had stores, we had wholesale accounts,

01:31.336 --> 01:33.603
we had a multiplayer virtual world,

01:33.603 --> 01:35.803
and we also had entertainment products.

01:35.803 --> 01:38.136
We were transmedia brands.

01:38.136 --> 01:41.303
And near the end of that,

01:42.236 --> 01:44.870
the blogging sphere started,

01:44.870 --> 01:47.936
and my marketing department
created a blog for me.

01:47.936 --> 01:50.436
They know, you know,
that I was always called

01:50.436 --> 01:51.536
the robot guy in New York.

01:51.536 --> 01:53.803
"Hey, there's Oliver, he's the robot guy."

01:53.803 --> 01:56.870
And my marketing department
thought it'd be cute,

01:56.870 --> 02:01.803
knowing that I'm Jewish, to
name the blog Robot Rabbi.

02:01.803 --> 02:04.503
So I got a promotion, I became a rabbi.

02:04.503 --> 02:06.136
But I became a rabbi of robotics,

02:06.136 --> 02:09.436
and I started to write trade
periodicals about robots.

02:09.436 --> 02:11.370
And I got to meet some
really great founders,

02:11.370 --> 02:13.403
some of them on stage like Jeff

02:16.403 --> 02:21.403
and Erik and I started to invest
in automation technologies,

02:21.503 --> 02:24.103
and I had my own investment
vehicle called Atomic Ventures,

02:24.103 --> 02:26.403
where I had eight exits,
two that went public,

02:26.403 --> 02:29.770
and one that got bought by
private equity for 1.4 billion.

02:29.770 --> 02:32.103
And then I ended up joining another fund

02:32.103 --> 02:34.803
called ff Venture Capital,
where I'm at today.

02:34.803 --> 02:37.536
And these are some of our holdings.

02:37.536 --> 02:38.770
I also teach.

02:38.770 --> 02:43.770
And a shameless plug, but
if you scan that QR code,

02:43.970 --> 02:46.603
you can pre-order your book

02:46.603 --> 02:49.936
of "A Startup Field Guide in
the Age of Robots and AI."

02:49.936 --> 02:51.803
Oh, I love it. Look at all those cameras.

02:51.803 --> 02:52.636
Okay.

02:52.636 --> 02:57.270
And I interviewed about
30 luminaries in the space

02:57.270 --> 03:00.136
of taking their idea from ideation

03:00.136 --> 03:01.603
all the way to going public.

03:02.803 --> 03:06.136
One of the people that I
interviewed was Mick Mountz.

03:06.136 --> 03:09.903
Now I would say that Mick
Mountz is the progenitor

03:09.903 --> 03:12.136
of robots at retail.

03:12.136 --> 03:16.370
And this all starts in the
first, you know, web 1.0,

03:17.670 --> 03:22.170
the dot-com era when a
company called Webvan

03:22.170 --> 03:25.303
raised a ton of money, $800 million.

03:25.303 --> 03:28.603
They build huge distribution centers,

03:28.603 --> 03:32.336
and they were the first
online grocery company.

03:32.336 --> 03:33.170
Makes sense, right?

03:33.170 --> 03:34.803
We all use Instacart, right?

03:36.203 --> 03:37.770
But they didn't do much market research,

03:37.770 --> 03:42.370
and they didn't really, you
know, get that many orders,

03:42.370 --> 03:44.136
but they had these huge
distribution centers

03:44.136 --> 03:47.503
and Mick Mountz was the
director of logistics for them.

03:47.503 --> 03:50.570
And he saw that there
was a real problem there.

03:50.570 --> 03:55.270
They were basically, as his
partner, Raphael Andrea says,

03:55.270 --> 03:58.936
they were taping $50 to every
package going out the door

03:58.936 --> 04:01.103
because it was costing them so much money.

04:01.103 --> 04:04.336
And Mick saw that, like,
they were using these slides,

04:04.336 --> 04:06.970
and this was the first
time you opened up a carton

04:08.670 --> 04:11.670
and repack it to ship it to a consumer.

04:11.670 --> 04:13.836
And so he would go to
the company, he's like,

04:13.836 --> 04:16.970
"Listen, can I put a a glass jar of Prego

04:16.970 --> 04:18.370
tomato sauce on the slide?"

04:18.370 --> 04:19.470
They're like, "No, you can't do that.

04:19.470 --> 04:21.470
It's gonna break all over the place."

04:21.470 --> 04:24.436
"Well, can I take, on the
chute can I take something soft

04:24.436 --> 04:25.270
and put it there?"

04:25.270 --> 04:26.503
"No, it's gonna get stuck."

04:26.503 --> 04:29.269
And he saw that there
was nothing really there

04:29.269 --> 04:31.903
that was solving the problem
of online fulfillment.

04:31.903 --> 04:35.436
And sure enough, Webvan went bust,

04:35.436 --> 04:40.069
after a huge IPO, $800
million they raised,

04:40.069 --> 04:42.736
and they went bust within three years.

04:42.736 --> 04:45.036
And so around this time

04:46.603 --> 04:49.636
there was a small online book retailer.

04:49.636 --> 04:51.836
You might have heard of them, amazon.com.

04:51.836 --> 04:54.203
They dropped the dot com shortly after.

04:54.203 --> 04:56.769
And you could see in 1997,

04:57.869 --> 05:00.836
you could see that their
original fulfillment center

05:00.836 --> 05:05.836
in Seattle there using what
Jeff Bezos coined door desks.

05:06.203 --> 05:08.969
They went to Home Depot and put some 2x4s

05:08.969 --> 05:10.403
and created a desk.

05:10.403 --> 05:12.136
And that was the original
fulfillment center.

05:12.136 --> 05:16.436
And as they grew with more
orders, more products,

05:16.436 --> 05:20.303
you would have people
walking miles pushing carts.

05:20.303 --> 05:22.336
And it was really inefficient.

05:22.336 --> 05:25.836
And Mick saw this not just with Amazon,

05:25.836 --> 05:28.303
but with Walmart, with Target.

05:28.303 --> 05:30.136
And he created Kiva.

05:30.136 --> 05:31.936
And what Kiva does...

05:34.769 --> 05:36.836
This would be really
great if this would load.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.003
There we go.

05:38.003 --> 05:42.269
Okay, what Kiva does, it brings
this shelving to the picker

05:42.269 --> 05:44.503
and actually reorganizes the warehouse

05:44.503 --> 05:46.136
based upon best sellers.

05:46.136 --> 05:50.069
And he ended up building
this very quickly,

05:50.069 --> 05:52.169
and he serviced the top 10%

05:52.169 --> 05:54.803
of all online e-commerce companies,

05:54.803 --> 05:57.336
including Walmart and others.

05:57.336 --> 05:59.603
Two of them being diapers.com

05:59.603 --> 06:01.569
and right here in Vegas, Zappos.

06:01.569 --> 06:04.236
And who acquired diapers.com and Zappos?

06:04.236 --> 06:05.069
Amazon.

06:05.069 --> 06:06.769
And when Amazon saw what
Kiva was doing for them,

06:06.769 --> 06:09.403
they're like, "Listen, we need Kiva."

06:09.403 --> 06:11.703
And they bought them for $775 million.

06:12.569 --> 06:15.769
That's still one of the
largest acquisitions to date.

06:15.769 --> 06:19.803
And that was in 2012,
in the robotic space.

06:20.669 --> 06:24.303
That payback came within months.

06:24.303 --> 06:26.003
I mean they were shipping
billions of packages

06:26.003 --> 06:26.836
as you could see,

06:28.369 --> 06:31.503
close to a billion dollars
was within five months.

06:31.503 --> 06:34.536
You know, in five years
it was like three months.

06:34.536 --> 06:38.836
And so this really started

06:38.836 --> 06:41.036
what I would say robots at retail,

06:41.036 --> 06:43.903
because today, if I walk you through

06:43.903 --> 06:45.769
how a retail store lays out,

06:45.769 --> 06:47.469
you have the front of the store,

06:47.469 --> 06:48.903
and this is in brick and mortar,

06:48.903 --> 06:50.569
where you have people greeting you.

06:50.569 --> 06:51.403
And there's been...

06:51.403 --> 06:55.603
Some of these robots here have died,

06:55.603 --> 06:57.536
you know, an unfortunate death,

06:57.536 --> 06:59.869
like Pepper there in the left hand corner.

06:59.869 --> 07:01.703
But the concept is true.

07:01.703 --> 07:04.469
And it's more in Asia,
these greeting robots.

07:04.469 --> 07:07.469
And then you have robots doing functions

07:07.469 --> 07:11.569
that humans don't do so
great, like rack jobbing,

07:11.569 --> 07:13.036
and point of sale scanning.

07:13.036 --> 07:15.769
And Jeff's gonna get into that with Tally,

07:15.769 --> 07:18.303
that can get better
analytics, better data.

07:18.303 --> 07:20.503
Because what happens
when you go to Walgreens

07:20.503 --> 07:22.536
and they're out of your
favorite toothpaste?

07:22.536 --> 07:24.236
You just go to your mobile device

07:24.236 --> 07:27.369
and you just order it on Amazon,
it's gonna come tomorrow.

07:27.369 --> 07:29.103
Maybe you got bad breath for a day.

07:29.103 --> 07:32.869
And so, and then, you know, we
have robots cleaning floors,

07:32.869 --> 07:34.636
like Wiz and Brain Corp.

07:34.636 --> 07:37.569
You have robots moving people in airports.

07:37.569 --> 07:39.969
And then going to one of the biggest areas

07:39.969 --> 07:44.269
is online fulfillment that
Erik's gonna talk to you about.

07:44.269 --> 07:49.269
You even have robot
drones scanning UPC codes

07:49.403 --> 07:53.369
going up two stories to see
the fulfillment centers.

07:53.369 --> 07:55.103
You have robots unloading trucks,

07:55.103 --> 07:56.236
and then you have robot delivery.

07:56.236 --> 07:58.469
And you know, besides Plus One,

07:58.469 --> 07:59.436
which is a portfolio company,

07:59.436 --> 08:01.469
you could see Manna, which
is a drone delivery company,

08:01.469 --> 08:04.636
that ff's an investor in.

08:04.636 --> 08:08.036
And you have autonomous trucks

08:08.036 --> 08:10.769
and (indistinct) delivery there.

08:10.769 --> 08:13.803
And so I bring this up is,
where does this all lead?

08:13.803 --> 08:16.103
Well, I'm sure you've
all seen some videos,

08:16.103 --> 08:18.269
and this is Optimus
who I started off with,

08:18.269 --> 08:19.936
and there's a lot of other humanoids.

08:19.936 --> 08:22.536
But there's a lot of
human functions out there,

08:22.536 --> 08:24.169
like folding shirts.

08:24.169 --> 08:28.303
And as we get large language
models, really the big frontier

08:28.303 --> 08:32.036
as I see it, is dexterity,
human-like dexterity.

08:32.036 --> 08:34.836
And that opens up lots of opportunities.

08:34.836 --> 08:38.469
And that if you look at
the humanoid landscape,

08:38.469 --> 08:39.869
it is growing.

08:39.869 --> 08:41.969
And this is only a handful.

08:41.969 --> 08:46.969
We saw Jensen give a
presentation a couple nights ago

08:47.203 --> 08:49.903
and with even more humanoids

08:49.903 --> 08:53.069
than he did at at his
original Nvidia conference.

08:53.069 --> 08:58.069
And we see that every human
function in the workplace,

08:59.036 --> 09:00.269
and even the home,

09:00.269 --> 09:02.603
potentially could be augmated with robots.

09:02.603 --> 09:04.903
And that's a really
trillion dollar business.

09:04.903 --> 09:07.336
And that's their trillion dollar business.

09:07.336 --> 09:10.769
So I'm gonna let Ujjwala,
and then let Jeff and Erik

09:10.769 --> 09:13.636
tell you a little bit
about what they're doing.

09:13.636 --> 09:14.636
- All right.

09:14.636 --> 09:16.203
Well, good morning everyone.

09:17.369 --> 09:20.436
I hope you all are well
caffeinated like I am.

09:22.536 --> 09:23.669
My name is Ujjwala.

09:23.669 --> 09:27.703
I'm the co-founder and chief
strategy officer at Artiligent.

09:27.703 --> 09:30.569
So we are a research and development lab

09:30.569 --> 09:34.403
that helps businesses
conceptualize, design,

09:34.403 --> 09:37.403
and build custom and semicustom robots.

09:37.403 --> 09:38.436
So how do we do this?

09:38.436 --> 09:41.403
We leverage off the shelf platforms.

09:41.403 --> 09:44.169
So that takes care of your
core robotic technology,

09:44.169 --> 09:47.369
like navigation, obstacle avoidance.

09:47.369 --> 09:51.269
And we build a layer of software,

09:51.269 --> 09:55.069
and based on the customer's
use case, we build the body

09:55.069 --> 09:59.836
of the robot using cost effective
methods like 3D printing.

09:59.836 --> 10:03.369
So I have a little video here,
and hopefully this plays.

10:06.269 --> 10:07.102
- [Oliver] You need to just press

10:07.102 --> 10:08.736
the blue button really hard.

10:08.736 --> 10:11.302
(bright music)

10:37.836 --> 10:41.336
(bright music continues)

10:50.936 --> 10:52.236
- All right.

10:52.236 --> 10:57.236
So a few notable examples
of robots that we've built.

10:57.336 --> 11:01.036
And you probably saw the
Coke Bot robot there.

11:01.036 --> 11:03.402
I'd love to kind of give you a small story

11:03.402 --> 11:06.269
of how that journey came about.

11:06.269 --> 11:10.169
So this is about three years back.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.469
We built a mobile information kiosk

11:12.469 --> 11:14.836
for Bangalore International Airport,

11:14.836 --> 11:16.469
which is the size of JFK.

11:16.469 --> 11:20.169
So sees about 18 million
passengers every year.

11:20.169 --> 11:23.569
And you can imagine the complexity
of questions that come up

11:23.569 --> 11:25.802
with so many passengers.

11:25.802 --> 11:29.002
And we built a conversational AI tool.

11:29.002 --> 11:33.702
This is pre-ChatGPT, so it
was a very successful pilot.

11:33.702 --> 11:35.736
People of course today are very accustomed

11:35.736 --> 11:38.636
to hearing human-like responses from AI,

11:38.636 --> 11:41.802
but back then it was quite innovative.

11:41.802 --> 11:46.802
And the sort of result of
being at an airport space was,

11:48.669 --> 11:53.402
it was also very, like,
highly visible pilot for us.

11:53.402 --> 11:55.469
And we soon started getting observed

11:55.469 --> 11:59.336
by marketers like Ogilvy and WPP

11:59.336 --> 12:03.236
that were interested in having retailers

12:03.236 --> 12:06.402
market their offerings on this robot.

12:06.402 --> 12:10.036
So through those introductions
we started having

12:10.036 --> 12:12.302
more conversations with
WPP, which is of course

12:12.302 --> 12:16.202
the global marketing agency for Coca-Cola.

12:16.202 --> 12:20.069
And they came to us with a very
interesting problem in mind.

12:20.069 --> 12:23.969
So they wanted to increase
the foot traffic in beverage

12:23.969 --> 12:28.569
aisles in supermarkets and grocery stores.

12:28.569 --> 12:30.302
So if you've purchased a Coke

12:30.302 --> 12:32.402
or any other beverage recently,

12:32.402 --> 12:33.936
it's probably an impulse buy.

12:33.936 --> 12:37.102
I think candy kind of falls
in that same category.

12:37.102 --> 12:40.669
So through brainstorming
sessions, we made recommendations

12:40.669 --> 12:42.836
to create a robot that would bring

12:42.836 --> 12:44.702
the beverage to the customer.

12:44.702 --> 12:46.269
That was very well received,

12:46.269 --> 12:50.069
and we launched our first iteration

12:50.069 --> 12:54.436
of the Coke Bot in front of the President

12:54.436 --> 12:57.002
and CFO of Coca-Cola, John Murphy.

12:57.002 --> 12:59.702
He was on a big business trip to India.

12:59.702 --> 13:03.069
And we also saw a 22% uptick in sales

13:03.069 --> 13:04.536
within the first month.

13:04.536 --> 13:08.202
So that led to subsequent
projects with Coke.

13:09.836 --> 13:12.469
We launched Sprite Zero,
Jack Daniels and Coke,

13:12.469 --> 13:15.569
which is their new alcoholic offering.

13:15.569 --> 13:18.669
And we've since built robots for Nestle,

13:18.669 --> 13:20.969
a robot that looks like Kit Kat.

13:20.969 --> 13:23.736
On the other side, so
sort of on the e-commerce

13:23.736 --> 13:26.402
fulfillment side, we've
been working with DHL

13:26.402 --> 13:31.102
to build a robot in
their fulfillment center.

13:31.102 --> 13:33.836
And let's see, what else?

13:33.836 --> 13:37.202
We also partner with OEMs
to help them commercialize

13:37.202 --> 13:39.636
the robots in new markets.

13:39.636 --> 13:43.102
So a lot of exciting things
lined up for us in 2025.

13:43.102 --> 13:47.269
We're very much an early
states startup right now

13:47.269 --> 13:51.136
and very excited, really
looking forward to 2025.

13:51.136 --> 13:55.402
And what a better way to kick
it off than being here at CES.

13:55.402 --> 13:56.436
- [Oliver] Excellent.

13:59.669 --> 14:02.436
- Maybe I'll do introductions
and play a video.

14:02.436 --> 14:03.602
- [Oliver] Yeah, that
sounds like a good idea.

14:03.602 --> 14:04.436
- Cool.

14:04.436 --> 14:06.202
Hey everybody and thanks for having me.

14:06.202 --> 14:07.536
My name's Jeff.

14:07.536 --> 14:08.536
I'm one of the co-founders

14:08.536 --> 14:11.069
and chief design officer
of Simbe Robotics.

14:11.069 --> 14:15.302
And what we've built to date
is a data analytics platform

14:15.302 --> 14:17.436
that we call Store Intelligence,

14:17.436 --> 14:20.669
which is essentially a
single source of truth

14:20.669 --> 14:23.802
for accurate and reliable
data for our retailers

14:23.802 --> 14:26.302
so that they can change the
operations in their space.

14:26.302 --> 14:29.969
Our goal is to really
redefine retail operations

14:29.969 --> 14:32.969
so that they can curb
the loss that happens

14:32.969 --> 14:34.936
in these markets.

14:34.936 --> 14:37.202
And how are we doing this?

14:37.202 --> 14:38.969
For the past 10 years we've built

14:38.969 --> 14:41.502
an autonomous mobile robot named Tally

14:41.502 --> 14:45.536
that I'll show you in a
video post this review.

14:45.536 --> 14:50.069
And we've built this robot to
be unobtrusive and friendly,

14:50.069 --> 14:53.602
to share the space with
people in the store,

14:53.602 --> 14:55.769
including staff and shoppers.

14:55.769 --> 14:57.569
It moves up and down the aisles

14:57.569 --> 14:59.202
and throughout the entire store,

14:59.202 --> 15:03.002
capturing high fidelity
information that we convert

15:03.002 --> 15:08.002
to actionable insights for them
to curb this loss in sales.

15:08.069 --> 15:09.302
When the problem, for most of you,

15:09.302 --> 15:12.069
you probably understand
it, the point of sale knows

15:12.069 --> 15:13.769
what comes in, it knows what comes out,

15:13.769 --> 15:15.169
but the everything in between,

15:15.169 --> 15:17.969
what happens in real time, is a gray area.

15:17.969 --> 15:21.736
If the product's not on the
shelf, people can't buy it.

15:21.736 --> 15:24.636
Wrong price, they may get an empty basket,

15:24.636 --> 15:26.102
they're not gonna do anything with it.

15:26.102 --> 15:28.069
So we're trying to curb that.

15:28.069 --> 15:29.736
In the past it's been 6%.

15:29.736 --> 15:34.235
In the pandemic, it went
up 15% out of stocks rates,

15:34.235 --> 15:38.235
and it is backed down again,
but the problem still exists.

15:38.235 --> 15:41.302
So when we built this platform,

15:41.302 --> 15:46.302
we're applying it to grocery
club format supplier.

15:47.069 --> 15:48.902
One of our newest ones
we'll show in the video,

15:48.902 --> 15:51.769
C-A-L Ranch, and a series of others

15:51.769 --> 15:54.569
that are coming of retail formats.

15:55.469 --> 15:58.535
I'm also happy to announce as of yesterday

15:58.535 --> 16:02.435
that we will be the first
retail technology company

16:02.435 --> 16:05.969
in the world to do
multimodal data capture,

16:05.969 --> 16:10.002
which is essentially taking
computer vision, RFID,

16:10.002 --> 16:12.869
and fixed sensing as an extension of Tally

16:12.869 --> 16:14.969
and working on top of Tally's data

16:14.969 --> 16:18.869
to bring something much
richer, much more holistic

16:18.869 --> 16:20.469
throughout any type of environment

16:20.469 --> 16:23.302
and possibly extending into other aspects

16:23.302 --> 16:26.502
of the supply chain and operations.

16:26.502 --> 16:29.369
We're really looking to
become a turnkey partner here

16:29.369 --> 16:31.935
for our retailers to curb the loss,

16:31.935 --> 16:36.935
and really improve customer
experience overall.

16:37.369 --> 16:39.202
Let's play the video

16:39.202 --> 16:42.569
and you'll get a sense of
what I'm talking about.

16:42.569 --> 16:43.402
Just the blue?

16:44.302 --> 16:45.135
What's that?

16:45.135 --> 16:46.435
- [Oliver] Press the button hard.

16:49.435 --> 16:51.535
One more time.

16:51.535 --> 16:53.269
- [Jeff] Here we go.

16:53.269 --> 16:55.069
- [Ujjwala] And one more time, sorry.

16:55.069 --> 16:57.669
- [Jeff] In the world of
robotics, I still struggle.

16:59.835 --> 17:00.835
- [Madison] Came in the C-A-L Ranch today,

17:00.835 --> 17:02.069
I noticed something a little different.

17:02.069 --> 17:03.502
There was a little robot going around.

17:03.502 --> 17:04.569
- And it has a little eyes on it.

17:04.569 --> 17:07.002
- It's a robot, it's
actually taking inventory.

17:07.002 --> 17:09.569
- Super cute. Found out her name's Tally.

17:09.569 --> 17:12.335
- She traverses the aisle,
she whistles at people.

17:12.335 --> 17:13.935
(Katie whistling and laughing)

17:13.935 --> 17:15.535
- Woot-woo.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.602
(Corey whistling)

17:16.602 --> 17:17.969
(Robot whistling)

17:17.969 --> 17:21.535
We're ranch and home stores,
C-A-L Ranch and Coastal.

17:21.535 --> 17:23.702
We have just about everything you need.

17:23.702 --> 17:26.835
Feed, sporting goods, apparel.

17:26.835 --> 17:30.135
We have 55 locations
spread over six states.

17:30.135 --> 17:32.202
We have stores from 20,000 square feet

17:32.202 --> 17:34.235
up to over 100,000 square feet.

17:34.235 --> 17:36.102
- What made us decide
to partner with Simbe

17:36.102 --> 17:39.602
was we saw huge potential
to use technology

17:39.602 --> 17:43.102
to free-up our associates to
meet the customer's needs.

17:43.102 --> 17:45.835
Before Tally, it'd take
us probably a good month

17:45.835 --> 17:47.302
to get the whole store.

17:47.302 --> 17:49.769
Now we can do it within a matter a day.

17:49.769 --> 17:53.369
Tally can go through our hard
line side three times a day,

17:53.369 --> 17:56.069
condense the reporting and
send it to us each morning,

17:56.069 --> 17:58.002
that then we can go work the exceptions.

17:58.002 --> 18:00.869
- [Katie] With Tally, now
I'm able to scan the code

18:00.869 --> 18:02.369
with the app and it'll show me

18:02.369 --> 18:03.835
the exact location where it is.

18:03.835 --> 18:05.902
So that cuts the time in half.

18:05.902 --> 18:07.569
- We're able to be down every aisle

18:07.569 --> 18:09.469
in every location every day.

18:09.469 --> 18:11.702
And that's super powerful
for us to be able

18:11.702 --> 18:13.869
to be in our stores even when we're not

18:13.869 --> 18:15.335
in our stores physically.

18:15.335 --> 18:18.102
- I actually go into work
excited to, like, work with Tally

18:18.102 --> 18:19.302
because we're like a team.

18:19.302 --> 18:20.602
We help each other.

18:20.602 --> 18:21.869
- It is the first time that I've ever seen

18:21.869 --> 18:23.969
a robot in a store before, and I think

18:23.969 --> 18:25.669
it could go, like, everywhere.

18:25.669 --> 18:28.202
- It allows me to know that
there's gonna be things

18:28.202 --> 18:29.635
on the floor when I come in.

18:29.635 --> 18:31.569
- It's pretty neat that
they're investing in the future

18:31.569 --> 18:33.702
and they wanna make my
experience that much better.

18:33.702 --> 18:36.469
- We're just beginning to
understand the abilities

18:36.469 --> 18:38.802
that Tally offers and the
impact that it'll have

18:38.802 --> 18:40.269
on the company going forward.

18:49.635 --> 18:53.402
- And I am gonna pass it to my
esteemed colleague Erik here.

18:53.402 --> 18:54.402
Thank you everybody.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.002
- Good morning, I'm Erik Nieves.

18:57.002 --> 18:59.235
I'm the founder of Plus One.

18:59.235 --> 19:01.102
We're a robotics company in Texas.

19:01.102 --> 19:02.669
We've been around seven years.

19:03.502 --> 19:07.969
And unlike Artiligent and Simbe,

19:07.969 --> 19:10.869
you will never see our robots, right?

19:10.869 --> 19:13.935
If things go well, our robots
will be invisible to you

19:13.935 --> 19:18.102
because we work behind the scenes.

19:18.102 --> 19:20.435
Because whether it's
brick and mortar retail

19:20.435 --> 19:24.069
or it's e-com, the goods need to move

19:24.069 --> 19:26.035
through the distribution channel.

19:26.035 --> 19:31.035
And Plus One builds AI
robots for that purpose.

19:32.135 --> 19:34.869
And just to give you a
sense of how that works,

19:34.869 --> 19:36.535
(energetic music)

19:36.535 --> 19:40.102
these are computer vision-enabled,

19:40.102 --> 19:43.169
AI-driven machines,

19:43.169 --> 19:47.202
and they will load the sorting conveyors

19:47.202 --> 19:50.569
and such that bring packages to you.

19:50.569 --> 19:55.569
So if they show up at
your porch this week,

19:55.835 --> 19:58.702
they are probably a user
of Plus One's technology.

19:59.969 --> 20:04.469
Parcel shippers, big e-com, et cetera,

20:04.469 --> 20:09.369
use robots like this driven by AI tools

20:09.369 --> 20:13.802
and computer vision to
load and move the parcels

20:13.802 --> 20:15.635
through the facility,

20:15.635 --> 20:20.302
or take parcels off of pallets

20:20.302 --> 20:22.535
and send them into inventory.

20:26.135 --> 20:27.835
I think we've seen enough of that.

20:29.402 --> 20:34.369
The notion is robots, when we
talk about robots and retail,

20:34.369 --> 20:36.902
we really mean the entire ecosystem

20:36.902 --> 20:40.769
because robots and automation
have a role to play

20:40.769 --> 20:45.769
in each piece of the sort
of shopping experience,

20:46.069 --> 20:48.702
whether it's front of
store, back of store,

20:48.702 --> 20:51.835
all of them suffer from the same issues

20:51.835 --> 20:54.535
on labor availability and such.

20:55.969 --> 20:56.869
- Awesome.

20:56.869 --> 20:59.369
Well let's hear it for our panelists here.

20:59.369 --> 21:00.502
That was amazing.

21:00.502 --> 21:04.002
(audience clapping)

21:04.002 --> 21:07.768
So, you know, we have about 20 minutes

21:07.768 --> 21:09.635
for a little open discussion
amongst ourselves.

21:09.635 --> 21:12.568
If there's time allows, we'll
pass the mic to you guys.

21:12.568 --> 21:17.102
But, you know, in seeing the videos,

21:17.102 --> 21:19.335
it brought back so many
memories as a retailer.

21:19.335 --> 21:21.368
I remember doing inventory
with Post-it notes

21:21.368 --> 21:25.235
and closing the store
on a Sunday to Monday.

21:25.235 --> 21:28.468
And it was like a 24-48 hour...

21:28.468 --> 21:32.268
You had to stop inventory
both in the warehouse

21:32.268 --> 21:35.368
and in the stores and do full counts.

21:35.368 --> 21:37.935
And it was the biggest pain
in the **** as a retailer.

21:37.935 --> 21:42.802
And you know, I know
that everything starts

21:42.802 --> 21:45.035
at the warehouse, right?

21:45.035 --> 21:48.335
If you get inventory
and your planning's off,

21:48.335 --> 21:50.835
and fulfillment, whether
that's online fulfillment

21:50.835 --> 21:52.668
or it's brick and mortar
to distribution centers,

21:52.668 --> 21:55.968
I mean, I remember being a wholesale,

21:55.968 --> 22:00.968
and if you were labeled
incorrectly, they sent it back.

22:01.268 --> 22:05.835
And guess who paid for
that, the shipping back?

22:05.835 --> 22:10.468
And then, in store design
the gondolas are so important

22:10.468 --> 22:13.502
when you go into a store,
those are the displays,

22:13.502 --> 22:14.368
for calling people.

22:14.368 --> 22:16.468
You know, there's a real
balance in store design

22:16.468 --> 22:18.768
between something feeling precious

22:18.768 --> 22:20.968
and something being approachable.

22:20.968 --> 22:23.035
I think Warby Parker
does that really well,

22:23.035 --> 22:25.435
that you can touch and feel the glasses,

22:25.435 --> 22:26.935
they're not too precious,

22:26.935 --> 22:29.202
but they're really kind of sexy up there

22:29.202 --> 22:31.402
because it's like designed
nicely and everything like that.

22:31.402 --> 22:32.502
You feel it's really high end.

22:32.502 --> 22:37.035
And your robots that
interface with the users.

22:37.035 --> 22:39.768
And so I'm gonna combine, I
know we did a a little review

22:39.768 --> 22:42.568
of the questions, but time is compressed

22:42.568 --> 22:44.668
so I'm gonna combine a
couple of thoughts here,

22:44.668 --> 22:46.968
and I'd really love your thoughts,

22:46.968 --> 22:50.302
is that one of the big stories, you know,

22:50.302 --> 22:55.302
and you were mentioning
about GPT, is AI, right?

22:55.368 --> 22:59.535
And so much that you rely on

22:59.535 --> 23:02.435
and all three of you is computer vision.

23:02.435 --> 23:06.868
And so much of your
investment into training data.

23:08.968 --> 23:10.035
We gotta take a step back.

23:10.035 --> 23:13.402
What Erik showed, it looks
really simple, right?

23:13.402 --> 23:18.202
Suction, end effectors picking
up robots on a conveyor belt.

23:18.202 --> 23:22.368
But if you notice there
were cardboard boxes there,

23:22.368 --> 23:27.335
there was, you know, different
types of envelopes there,

23:27.335 --> 23:30.902
there was that really
annoying Amazon white

23:32.702 --> 23:34.568
that folds in a different way.

23:34.568 --> 23:38.068
And like, robots go awry, right?

23:38.068 --> 23:40.202
And you need a lot of training data

23:40.202 --> 23:41.102
to protect against that.

23:41.102 --> 23:43.535
If you're gonna make
investments in your stores,

23:43.535 --> 23:47.702
in your brand for robots,
well the roboticists here

23:47.702 --> 23:49.235
need to know what they're dealing with.

23:49.235 --> 23:51.302
And I've never been to
a ranch supply store,

23:51.302 --> 23:54.468
being a New Yorker, but
it looks really cool.

23:54.468 --> 23:59.002
So my question is to all of you
guys is how are you planning

23:59.002 --> 24:01.802
for the future in your investments

24:01.802 --> 24:04.735
of taking the next
iterations of your products,

24:04.735 --> 24:07.202
in utilizing large language models,

24:08.135 --> 24:11.702
and combine that with computer
vision and different sensors,

24:11.702 --> 24:15.002
to provide more opportunities
for your customers?

24:17.502 --> 24:19.168
You spoke last, Erik.

24:19.168 --> 24:21.202
I'm gonna start with you because
you're looking right at me,

24:21.202 --> 24:23.068
and we'll just go down
the line, but feel free-

24:23.068 --> 24:24.502
- I'm not averting my gaze.

24:25.635 --> 24:27.335
You know, sure.

24:27.335 --> 24:30.002
In seven years Plus One's
already on our second

24:30.002 --> 24:32.468
sort of iteration of the core technology.

24:32.468 --> 24:36.668
And initially everything is
based on computer vision, right?

24:36.668 --> 24:41.402
That's the difference between
robots in this line of work

24:41.402 --> 24:42.802
and robots in manufacturing.

24:42.802 --> 24:44.535
In manufacturing everything is repeatable.

24:44.535 --> 24:47.402
You do the same thing 800,000 times

24:47.402 --> 24:49.468
so the robots can be blind.

24:49.468 --> 24:51.868
But in any of the work that we care about,

24:51.868 --> 24:55.568
you have to discover
every item, every cycle.

24:55.568 --> 24:59.135
And so computer vision is really
the fundamental technology.

24:59.135 --> 25:02.335
Computer vision itself
has been revolutionized

25:02.335 --> 25:05.035
just in the last five years through AI.

25:05.035 --> 25:08.235
Initially, you know, our computer vision

25:08.235 --> 25:11.602
was what we'll call
classical computer vision.

25:11.602 --> 25:16.002
And since then we've all adopted AI tools

25:16.002 --> 25:20.502
to sort of make the systems more flexible

25:20.502 --> 25:23.368
and more tolerant of change.

25:23.368 --> 25:26.435
And that's ultimately what
we need is flexibility.

25:26.435 --> 25:30.902
Because what I'm confident
in is, whatever you order

25:30.902 --> 25:33.502
this week, when you order it next week,

25:33.502 --> 25:36.435
it's not gonna be the same thing, right?

25:36.435 --> 25:38.402
We're always changing packaging types,

25:38.402 --> 25:42.102
materials, shipping, et cetera.

25:42.102 --> 25:45.668
Even if it's the same SKU,
as far as the operation

25:45.668 --> 25:49.035
is concerned, it is different in some way.

25:49.035 --> 25:53.135
And so you need to be
able to have AI tools

25:53.135 --> 25:57.435
give you the sort of elbow room necessary

25:57.435 --> 26:02.435
to maintain the systems
operational at a cadence.

26:02.435 --> 26:06.968
That said, I am a human exceptionalist.

26:06.968 --> 26:10.935
And what I mean by that is I love AI.

26:10.935 --> 26:15.135
We use AI in every single
robot we've deployed.

26:15.135 --> 26:20.135
And yet I'm a big believer
that AI has limitations

26:20.435 --> 26:24.368
and people are better
than robots at vision.

26:24.368 --> 26:27.302
And so there will absolutely be occasions

26:27.302 --> 26:32.302
when robots get confused and
the AI is simply not enough

26:33.968 --> 26:35.202
to resolve the issue.

26:36.068 --> 26:39.668
But people are really good
at exception handling.

26:39.668 --> 26:41.268
And so frankly, that's the reason

26:41.268 --> 26:43.268
I called the company Plus
One is because you add

26:43.268 --> 26:45.335
a human being to the control loop

26:45.335 --> 26:48.568
and watch just how much more
reliable the systems become.

26:48.568 --> 26:53.035
And so when the classical
computer vision fails,

26:53.035 --> 26:56.435
and the AI layer fails,
and the robot says,

26:56.435 --> 27:00.101
"I got nothing, I don't
know what I'm looking at,"

27:00.101 --> 27:03.468
a person can see exactly what
that robot is experiencing

27:03.468 --> 27:06.101
and go, "Yep, I understand
why you're having a problem.

27:06.101 --> 27:08.268
I would pick up that one."

27:08.268 --> 27:12.368
And that, of course, gets
the robot going again,

27:12.368 --> 27:15.701
but more importantly feeds
the AI model over time,

27:15.701 --> 27:17.835
and then you don't have
that same situation.

27:17.835 --> 27:22.835
So probably gonna be a theme
that AI plus human supervision

27:23.801 --> 27:26.668
of some kind, some human involvement,

27:26.668 --> 27:30.001
it's that collaboration
where the real value lies.

27:31.301 --> 27:32.368
- We see this as well.

27:32.368 --> 27:34.868
You pointed out these unique products

27:34.868 --> 27:36.468
that really mess stuff up.

27:36.468 --> 27:37.801
And we see this on the store shelf

27:37.801 --> 27:39.235
'cause there's such a variety

27:39.235 --> 27:40.768
of different kinds of products.

27:40.768 --> 27:44.268
And we use the algorithms,
our own especially,

27:44.268 --> 27:46.035
to detect some of these things.

27:46.035 --> 27:48.501
But being able to
differentiate between them,

27:49.801 --> 27:52.835
this is a big piece where
if the algorithm's working

27:52.835 --> 27:55.468
really well and then there's
a piece where we're not sure,

27:55.468 --> 27:57.868
or the can's sideways
or something like that,

27:58.735 --> 28:01.935
it lets us know and then
we can make clarifications

28:01.935 --> 28:05.268
or call it out and it'll
help make an action

28:05.268 --> 28:07.801
that isn't, like, bad data.

28:07.801 --> 28:10.068
So there's this whole
piece where the information

28:10.068 --> 28:12.635
has to be accurate, even
if it's not perfect,

28:12.635 --> 28:15.135
you can at least say this is an anomaly.

28:15.135 --> 28:17.068
'Cause what's happening
in these kinds of spaces,

28:17.068 --> 28:19.468
even with ChatGPT, they can only access

28:19.468 --> 28:22.135
what they know off like
internet and things like that.

28:22.135 --> 28:25.001
But in like our space, we're creating it.

28:25.001 --> 28:28.368
It's this unknown and you're
using your own algorithm

28:28.368 --> 28:31.535
to detect the differences
and figure out like,

28:31.535 --> 28:33.868
what can you work with that's a sure thing

28:33.868 --> 28:37.468
and what can you not, but
include that in the data

28:37.468 --> 28:39.468
so that people can make an action

28:39.468 --> 28:42.301
and then transform, piece by piece,

28:42.301 --> 28:44.501
even if it needs a
little bit of human help.

28:46.135 --> 28:49.768
- So as far as we are
concerned with the concierge

28:49.768 --> 28:52.335
or the mobile information kiosk use case,

28:52.335 --> 28:55.201
a large language model
has been a game changer.

28:55.201 --> 28:59.001
So earlier you would need
to create an entire flow,

28:59.001 --> 29:02.301
pre-program responses,
and then train the model.

29:02.301 --> 29:05.268
Today something that would
take us, like, weeks to do

29:05.268 --> 29:08.701
can be done within a
few minutes using LLM.

29:08.701 --> 29:12.568
And all you need to do
is feed the data set

29:12.568 --> 29:16.768
and set some rules or
a playbook around it.

29:16.768 --> 29:20.968
So we tested a sort of pilot
recently at DC Startup Week,

29:20.968 --> 29:24.935
which is a local event in Washington DC

29:24.935 --> 29:29.101
where we set up a ChatGPT
for conferences and events,

29:29.101 --> 29:33.935
and people could simply come
up and ask a query like,

29:33.935 --> 29:36.435
"What session is Oliver moderating?"

29:36.435 --> 29:38.235
and it would give you a response.

29:38.235 --> 29:41.968
So incorporating that
is definitely a plan.

29:41.968 --> 29:44.368
And I'm very excited about
the shared intelligence.

29:44.368 --> 29:46.735
I think now, of course, if you've seen,

29:47.868 --> 29:52.868
Jensen Wong's keynote, this
idea around taking real world

29:53.301 --> 29:57.268
simulations, this
omniverse, and having robots

29:57.268 --> 30:00.135
learn from each other and
from human beings as well.

30:00.135 --> 30:03.701
So in the future, let's say
there's a early stage startup

30:03.701 --> 30:08.701
that's looking to maybe build
a company that packages food,

30:09.935 --> 30:13.301
and Plus One has already
figured out a lot of things,

30:13.301 --> 30:15.901
maybe that could just be a solution

30:15.901 --> 30:18.268
that can be shared across robots.

30:18.268 --> 30:20.368
So again, as an early stage startup

30:20.368 --> 30:23.635
and you know, working
with businesses to develop

30:23.635 --> 30:26.868
proof of concepts, that's
extremely valuable to us

30:26.868 --> 30:29.901
because it really cuts
through the time development.

30:29.901 --> 30:34.235
- Excellent, you know,
when you all were speaking,

30:34.235 --> 30:36.368
remind me of some
interviews I did in my book,

30:36.368 --> 30:39.335
which I'm sure all of you
have bought by now on Amazon,

30:39.335 --> 30:42.068
and one of them was with Rodney Brooks,

30:42.068 --> 30:44.901
and one of his design
principles was human agency.

30:44.901 --> 30:48.235
That robots will go awry,
and that you need a way to,

30:48.235 --> 30:50.201
that if you have a robot in a hospital,

30:50.201 --> 30:51.468
and someone's having a cardiac arrest,

30:51.468 --> 30:54.268
and the robot's blocking a
gurney from getting to an OR,

30:54.268 --> 30:55.501
everyone's gonna hate the robot.

30:55.501 --> 30:57.235
Or if you have a robot in a store

30:57.235 --> 31:00.135
and it goes into a toddler,

31:00.135 --> 31:01.668
everyone's gonna hate the robot, right?

31:01.668 --> 31:05.068
So you need a way for human
beings to have agency.

31:05.068 --> 31:08.968
And these are like, when you
think about robots working

31:08.968 --> 31:11.468
at retail, you think about
a lot of human beings

31:11.468 --> 31:15.768
around robots, and you think
about those edge cases.

31:15.768 --> 31:18.768
But you also think about
there's a lot of macro factors

31:18.768 --> 31:20.168
for deploying robots, right?

31:20.168 --> 31:21.901
Macroeconomic factors.

31:25.035 --> 31:28.101
You mentioned pandemic and
that during the pandemic

31:29.268 --> 31:30.935
it shifted things.

31:30.935 --> 31:35.935
We're now post-pandemic, and
interest rates have been high,

31:37.835 --> 31:39.401
and so when people are
making new investments

31:39.401 --> 31:41.968
into automation, that
definitely affects things.

31:41.968 --> 31:45.101
Building new fulfillment
centers, that affects things.

31:45.101 --> 31:47.801
And when you think about
macro labor trends,

31:47.801 --> 31:49.868
where that you're talking about Plus One,

31:49.868 --> 31:54.068
and you're talking about,
that there's a shortage

31:54.068 --> 31:55.235
of skilled labor out there

31:55.235 --> 31:56.801
where people are investing in robots.

31:56.801 --> 32:01.801
So tell me, like, as, you know,

32:02.068 --> 32:04.401
people that are deploying
robots within this commercial

32:04.401 --> 32:07.701
world around humans, around
these macro labor trends,

32:07.701 --> 32:10.668
what do you see as sort
of the best cocktail

32:10.668 --> 32:12.701
to being successful if we're starting

32:12.701 --> 32:14.001
a company in this space?

32:14.001 --> 32:15.368
Why don't we start with Jeff?

32:15.368 --> 32:16.901
- Sure. Yeah.

32:16.901 --> 32:19.701
Our customers reveal to
us that they're struggling

32:19.701 --> 32:21.668
to hire for these positions.

32:21.668 --> 32:24.801
They're very mundane, and laborious,

32:24.801 --> 32:27.268
and physically intensive.

32:27.268 --> 32:28.801
So they struggle with this gap.

32:28.801 --> 32:33.201
And we found, and they
tell us, that if you can

32:33.201 --> 32:35.168
replicate this mundane process,

32:35.168 --> 32:38.301
kind of like your calculator,
and have that team

32:38.301 --> 32:40.601
do other things like
customer service and filling,

32:40.601 --> 32:43.634
which they need, desperately,
filling the shelf,

32:44.468 --> 32:47.201
that is a model that seems
to have been working for us,

32:47.201 --> 32:50.668
and is growing, I think
more now than ever.

32:50.668 --> 32:53.668
You know, with the loss we
discussed, it's a lot easier

32:53.668 --> 32:56.134
for shoppers with the
information at their fingertips

32:56.134 --> 32:58.934
to say "no" when they're
not getting what they want,

32:58.934 --> 33:03.801
which will maintain and accelerate
this, "I'm not buying it"

33:03.801 --> 33:05.234
when you're getting lost sales.

33:05.234 --> 33:08.501
This is the the whole point
we're trying to curb, right?

33:08.501 --> 33:11.268
It's in the trillions
globally in lost sales.

33:11.268 --> 33:13.501
So there's a huge opportunity here.

33:13.501 --> 33:17.401
For decades retail never
really had the technology

33:17.401 --> 33:20.901
available, I think, to curb this problem.

33:24.968 --> 33:28.601
- So I think the perfect cocktail

33:28.601 --> 33:31.068
is a complex concoction, right?

33:31.068 --> 33:32.301
Like for any business to succeed-

33:32.301 --> 33:33.801
- We're making success cocktails

33:33.801 --> 33:36.334
(Ujjwala laughing)

33:36.334 --> 33:38.634
- You know, you need a product market fit,

33:38.634 --> 33:42.234
you need the right team,
access to capital, cash flow.

33:42.234 --> 33:46.368
Adaptability, I would say,
especially for any robots

33:46.368 --> 33:48.101
that are in the retail space.

33:48.101 --> 33:50.768
I mean, of course retail
has been through so much

33:50.768 --> 33:54.168
over the last five or or six years.

33:54.168 --> 33:57.134
I would say since the
pandemic, a lot of, like,

33:57.134 --> 33:59.168
brick and mortar stores
have shown resilience.

33:59.168 --> 34:02.101
You're also seeing e-commerce stores

34:02.101 --> 34:03.934
sort of open brick and mortar stores.

34:03.934 --> 34:08.934
So a lot of opportunities
for us as a company.

34:09.634 --> 34:12.634
What's interesting is we're also seeing

34:12.634 --> 34:15.568
sort of omni-channel strategies in play.

34:15.568 --> 34:18.968
So buy online, pickup in
store is one example of that.

34:18.968 --> 34:22.301
And there are a lot of robots
that are beneficiaries of it.

34:22.301 --> 34:24.368
I think Cleveron Robotics
is sort of a click

34:24.368 --> 34:25.501
and collect model.

34:27.601 --> 34:32.601
I would say the opportunity
here is to look at fulfillment,

34:35.034 --> 34:36.868
sorry, brick and mortar stores is also

34:36.868 --> 34:39.668
like fulfillment stores in some ways.

34:39.668 --> 34:42.634
So yeah, I mean again, sort of looking

34:42.634 --> 34:46.034
at both the e-commerce and
the the fulfillment side.

34:46.034 --> 34:46.868
- Yeah, we've seen that.

34:46.868 --> 34:50.368
Like even like Instacarts
have approached us before,

34:50.368 --> 34:52.734
and said hey, you know,
like out of a shopping list

34:52.734 --> 34:54.868
of 13 things, one or
two items ain't there,

34:55.734 --> 34:58.001
and that's like their biggest pain point.

34:58.001 --> 34:59.868
- Yeah, you know, you talk about

34:59.868 --> 35:03.568
just sort of the macros
here, I would argue

35:03.568 --> 35:07.768
that no robot ever deployed
in a warehouse context

35:07.768 --> 35:09.168
has resulted in a pink slip.

35:10.268 --> 35:14.334
There's just not enough labor
available, period, right?

35:14.334 --> 35:18.268
And so the first thing you do is you try

35:18.268 --> 35:20.068
to make the labor more efficient.

35:20.068 --> 35:23.168
And that's why you see so many of the AMR

35:24.934 --> 35:27.068
sort of applications
where you're just trying

35:27.068 --> 35:31.468
to make the picker more
productive, reduce their walk time,

35:31.468 --> 35:34.034
give them more picks per hour.

35:34.034 --> 35:37.034
It's all in the sake of

35:37.034 --> 35:40.468
we don't have sufficient labor available.

35:40.468 --> 35:45.468
That said, I do caution my
users, or potential clients,

35:45.968 --> 35:49.234
make sure you're evaluating,
do you have a labor problem

35:49.234 --> 35:50.734
or do you have a labor hassle?

35:51.601 --> 35:53.668
'Cause those are two different things.

35:53.668 --> 35:56.868
A labor hassle is, "I have a lot of churn,

35:56.868 --> 35:58.468
I'm always onboarding people,

35:58.468 --> 36:00.134
I'm always having to train folks.

36:00.134 --> 36:02.234
I hate doing it."

36:02.234 --> 36:04.468
A labor problem is beyond that.

36:04.468 --> 36:07.068
Nobody is showing up at
the door to take the job.

36:08.068 --> 36:10.001
If you have a labor hassle,

36:11.368 --> 36:14.301
you're gonna have a different ROI struggle

36:14.301 --> 36:16.434
than you are with a labor problem.

36:16.434 --> 36:19.134
The finance officer is interested

36:19.134 --> 36:21.068
in solving a labor problem.

36:21.068 --> 36:22.701
He may not fund your project

36:22.701 --> 36:25.101
if you have a labor hassle, right?

36:25.968 --> 36:26.868
- Yeah, well said.

36:28.868 --> 36:31.168
- Erik is always so articulate.

36:31.168 --> 36:34.134
And he's also featured my book,
so another shameless plug.

36:34.134 --> 36:38.234
But so, you know, in my presentation

36:39.601 --> 36:41.301
I ended with humanoids,

36:41.301 --> 36:43.901
and I think it's on everyone's minds.

36:43.901 --> 36:45.901
There's lots of cool videos out there,

36:46.968 --> 36:50.968
and I focused on Optimist
because I didn't want to pick any

36:50.968 --> 36:54.868
one private robot company out there.

36:54.868 --> 36:55.701
But there's a lot out there,

36:55.701 --> 36:58.101
there's a lot of capital being raised.

36:58.101 --> 37:02.268
And that the investor
sort of value proposition

37:02.268 --> 37:05.334
is that everywhere there's
human hands, you know,

37:05.334 --> 37:07.568
that can't be on a conveyor belt,

37:07.568 --> 37:12.568
that can't be serviced by a
co-bot, a humanoid could do.

37:12.801 --> 37:15.801
And I wanna know, you know...

37:15.801 --> 37:17.368
And walking around the show floor,

37:17.368 --> 37:20.001
I don't know if you've
had the opportunity,

37:20.001 --> 37:22.268
I think Agility is just downstairs.

37:24.201 --> 37:28.434
And so what's your thoughts regarding,

37:28.434 --> 37:31.468
with your solutions, you're
talking about augmenting

37:31.468 --> 37:36.468
human labor, is there a Plus
1.5 with humanoid out there?

37:37.601 --> 37:38.868
Is there, you know...

37:38.868 --> 37:43.334
Do you see humanoids going
and serving Coke bottles

37:43.334 --> 37:44.968
to people and so forth like that?

37:49.067 --> 37:54.067
- I'm a big believer in anytime
you have this much capital

37:55.367 --> 37:59.534
flowing to this many smart
people, good things will happen.

37:59.534 --> 38:02.967
Now, are we in a humanoid hype cycle?

38:02.967 --> 38:03.867
- There's never been a trough

38:03.867 --> 38:05.067
and disillusionment after that.

38:05.067 --> 38:05.901
- Right? No.

38:07.467 --> 38:09.167
But you are going to...

38:09.167 --> 38:12.601
The definition of a hype
cycle is the expectations

38:12.601 --> 38:16.167
have outpaced the realities.

38:16.167 --> 38:19.034
And so, you know, are we in
a hype cycle for humanoids?

38:19.034 --> 38:19.901
Of course we are.

38:19.901 --> 38:22.601
There's that much money,
you're not going to be able

38:22.601 --> 38:24.967
to meet all of that demand.

38:24.967 --> 38:28.567
That said, good things are going to come

38:28.567 --> 38:31.567
from the humanoid exercise.

38:31.567 --> 38:34.267
And you know, one of the
things that I'm excited about

38:34.267 --> 38:38.067
is you saw in that video,
those were two robots.

38:38.067 --> 38:40.567
But those two robots were
acting independently.

38:40.567 --> 38:44.101
They could not collaborate and
work on something together.

38:44.101 --> 38:47.601
Maybe a big package showed up
that was too heavy for one,

38:47.601 --> 38:48.434
but what would you do?

38:48.434 --> 38:50.701
You'd use two hands and pick it up.

38:50.701 --> 38:52.934
Robots don't do that today.

38:52.934 --> 38:55.534
But humanoids, and some
of the developments

38:55.534 --> 38:57.967
and the techniques that
come from that effort,

38:57.967 --> 39:01.234
are absolutely going
to have sway in the way

39:01.234 --> 39:04.767
that we perform work in
the warehouse, for sure.

39:04.767 --> 39:08.067
- We get asked, "When is
Tally gonna grow arms?"

39:08.067 --> 39:10.767
And I don't think the answer

39:10.767 --> 39:12.601
is not for a very long time, or wherever.

39:12.601 --> 39:15.434
We don't know, but there's
a place for every type

39:15.434 --> 39:18.067
of hardware platform, and
you really have to design

39:18.067 --> 39:20.167
for that job or that task.

39:20.167 --> 39:24.834
And for us, like, ground
mobile you can do a lot with.

39:24.834 --> 39:28.167
It doesn't necessarily have to
have that level of dexterity.

39:28.167 --> 39:29.034
Depends on what it is.

39:29.034 --> 39:31.234
There are things that can
be considered, you know,

39:31.234 --> 39:35.334
when you automate, can you
change the automation path

39:35.334 --> 39:38.901
that would require less manipulation?

39:38.901 --> 39:40.601
I think those are pieces of a puzzle

39:40.601 --> 39:43.567
that may not happen, like, overnight.

39:43.567 --> 39:44.967
Some of it's transitional.

39:44.967 --> 39:48.867
Maybe humanoids will
start to fill this gap

39:48.867 --> 39:52.034
and then evolve into, instead
of two arms, the one arm.

39:52.034 --> 39:53.867
And then maybe it doesn't have any arms,

39:53.867 --> 39:56.601
and just has like, a
conveyor that comes out of it

39:56.601 --> 39:57.934
or something like that.

39:57.934 --> 40:00.034
So I would even challenge the industry

40:00.034 --> 40:03.534
to think more openly about
how could you best solve

40:03.534 --> 40:06.067
the problem and it doesn't have,

40:06.067 --> 40:09.201
not to fix your mind to
humanoid necessarily.

40:09.201 --> 40:10.034
- Yeah.

40:10.034 --> 40:11.367
I would say it's really exciting.

40:11.367 --> 40:13.401
And you mentioned Agility Robotics.

40:13.401 --> 40:18.401
The CEO, Peggy Johnson, said
the world was built for humans.

40:18.434 --> 40:20.501
So I think there's definitely room

40:20.501 --> 40:22.067
for humanoids to thrive here.

40:23.801 --> 40:28.167
- You know, we're at 0, 0, 0 here,

40:28.167 --> 40:32.501
so I predicted we would only
get through three questions.

40:32.501 --> 40:34.601
But you know, everybody in the room,

40:34.601 --> 40:37.067
you have a chance
afterwards to really speak

40:37.067 --> 40:41.001
to the leading minds here of robotics.

40:41.001 --> 40:42.534
And if you don't get an
opportunity to speak to them,

40:42.534 --> 40:43.767
you can always buy my book.

40:43.767 --> 40:45.567
And so...

40:45.567 --> 40:49.767
But I really wanna thank you
guys for coming out early.

40:49.767 --> 40:52.367
It's Vegas, and early is
really tough in Vegas.

40:52.367 --> 40:54.734
And I wanna thank the
audience, and thank Robin,

40:54.734 --> 40:55.567
our producer here.

40:55.567 --> 40:58.367
So I hope everyone has a good show.

40:58.367 --> 40:59.534
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

40:59.534 --> 41:01.634
(audience clapping)

41:01.634 --> 41:04.467
(energetic music)
