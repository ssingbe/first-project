1
00:00.293 --> 00:03.460
(snappy upbeat music)

2
00:10.560 --> 00:12.900
<v Jennifer>Okay, we're very excited to get started</v>

3
00:12.900 --> 00:16.530
with our next session of the day.

4
00:16.530 --> 00:20.640
So if you'd like to find an open seat, make a friend.

5
00:20.640 --> 00:24.930
So exciting to see so many of you here today.

6
00:24.930 --> 00:28.710
This session is all about smart home standards

7
00:28.710 --> 00:29.790
and platforms,

8
00:29.790 --> 00:33.660
and we have a really diverse set of perspectives

9
00:33.660 --> 00:34.890
on the topic

10
00:34.890 --> 00:36.480
to really flush out this conversation,

11
00:36.480 --> 00:37.313
very excited about it.

12
00:37.313 --> 00:39.420
Thank you again to our sponsors

13
00:39.420 --> 00:41.040
for your support in putting

14
00:41.040 --> 00:44.760
on our 19th Annual Connection Summit at CES.

15
00:44.760 --> 00:47.760
We really, really appreciate your investment

16
00:47.760 --> 00:50.280
and having these great industry conversations

17
00:50.280 --> 00:52.050
and learning from peers.

18
00:52.050 --> 00:54.917
So again, we're talking smart home standards and platforms.

19
00:54.917 --> 00:59.917
We also have lunch sponsored by ADT, next door light lunch,

20
01:00.180 --> 01:01.410
first come, first serve.

21
01:01.410 --> 01:04.920
So if you don't have anything else to scatter onto,

22
01:04.920 --> 01:06.540
that'll be just right down the hall

23
01:06.540 --> 01:07.710
and then we're back at one o'clock

24
01:07.710 --> 01:12.063
for discussion about demand for energy management at home.

25
01:12.930 --> 01:15.450
And we invite you all to our networking reception tonight,

26
01:15.450 --> 01:16.350
if you haven't already,

27
01:16.350 --> 01:19.350
please RSVP for that, it's complimentary.

28
01:19.350 --> 01:20.183
We invite you all.

29
01:20.183 --> 01:21.360
We would love to see you there.

30
01:21.360 --> 01:23.170
I'd love to hear what it is that you're working on

31
01:23.170 --> 01:25.530
that is over in Treasure Island

32
01:25.530 --> 01:27.300
and when you RSVP,

33
01:27.300 --> 01:29.898
all that information about where to find it,

34
01:29.898 --> 01:32.193
will come through to your email.

35
01:33.090 --> 01:35.040
Thinking about this topic,

36
01:35.040 --> 01:37.470
I think it's really helpful to understand

37
01:37.470 --> 01:42.470
that there is a long history of home automation standards.

38
01:42.600 --> 01:46.583
Trying to make the devices

39
01:46.583 --> 01:50.190
communicate with each other,

40
01:50.190 --> 01:53.640
with the user, with the cloud,

41
01:53.640 --> 01:56.490
with the various ecosystem players.

42
01:56.490 --> 01:59.130
Going back to X10 in the 1970s,

43
01:59.130 --> 02:01.140
we're gonna hear about Z-Wave today,

44
02:01.140 --> 02:05.296
of course, Matter over Thread, Apple HomeKit type standards.

45
02:05.296 --> 02:10.296
You know, really trying to take this market

46
02:10.350 --> 02:12.030
to the next level

47
02:12.030 --> 02:16.419
and make that experience for the customer at home easier

48
02:16.419 --> 02:18.526
and simpler and take some jobs off

49
02:18.526 --> 02:21.633
of the players in this room as well.

50
02:22.650 --> 02:24.702
It's not a new effort, right,

51
02:24.702 --> 02:28.080
there's a long history that really the folks today

52
02:28.080 --> 02:32.010
are building on top of and continuously trying to improve.

53
02:32.010 --> 02:33.668
What's interesting when we think about

54
02:33.668 --> 02:36.217
where the smart home is today is

55
02:36.217 --> 02:40.620
that there are a phenomenal number of choices

56
02:40.620 --> 02:45.022
that consumers have in the brands with which they may want

57
02:45.022 --> 02:47.610
to control the devices that are in their home.

58
02:47.610 --> 02:52.610
They may have devices from many of these different players

59
02:52.680 --> 02:54.574
and they're maybe using it to control one device

60
02:54.574 --> 02:55.920
or several devices.

61
02:55.920 --> 02:57.879
The more devices you have at home,

62
02:57.879 --> 03:01.218
the more platforms you are using to control those devices.

63
03:01.218 --> 03:04.710
We are very much in a multi-agent

64
03:04.710 --> 03:07.740
or multi-control point state

65
03:07.740 --> 03:09.870
in the smart home for sure

66
03:09.870 --> 03:11.640
and a lot of the work that you're seeing happening

67
03:11.640 --> 03:15.150
behind the scenes is meant to give consumers that choice

68
03:15.150 --> 03:18.390
in what brands they most wanna interact with.

69
03:18.390 --> 03:22.290
So we're gonna be talking today about how we get

70
03:22.290 --> 03:27.290
to that vision of coordinated intelligent home experiences.

71
03:27.540 --> 03:29.547
What's the progress and standards today

72
03:29.547 --> 03:31.290
and the pain points that they're solving,

73
03:31.290 --> 03:32.610
as well as the pain points perhaps,

74
03:32.610 --> 03:33.900
and the process

75
03:33.900 --> 03:37.380
and what those standards efforts are focusing on this year?

76
03:37.380 --> 03:40.560
And where's the real competitive edge in platforms today?

77
03:40.560 --> 03:43.115
What's really defining the different experiences

78
03:43.115 --> 03:47.010
for the platform choices that consumers have?

79
03:47.010 --> 03:48.672
So I'd love to start by asking each

80
03:48.672 --> 03:51.990
of our phenomenal panelists to introduce themselves

81
03:51.990 --> 03:55.080
and their organizations and then we will dive in.

82
03:55.080 --> 03:56.340
So I'm gonna start with Nick Millette,

83
03:56.340 --> 03:58.830
who's the product development merchant

84
03:58.830 --> 04:01.560
with for smart home at the Home Depot.

85
04:01.560 --> 04:03.570
<v Nick>Yeah, hey everybody, Nick Millette.</v>

86
04:03.570 --> 04:06.520
I lead Home Depot's smart home product development efforts.

87
04:07.795 --> 04:10.380
So the Hubspace platform, that is what I've been leading

88
04:10.380 --> 04:11.787
for the past couple years.

89
04:11.787 --> 04:13.230
<v Jennifer>All right, fantastic,</v>

90
04:13.230 --> 04:15.660
and I love, we have limited time,

91
04:15.660 --> 04:17.520
so that is concise and I love it.

92
04:17.520 --> 04:19.137
Thank you, Nick.

93
04:19.137 --> 04:19.970
Michelle Mindala-Freeman,

94
04:19.970 --> 04:22.380
chief Operating Officer of Connectivity Standards Alliance.

95
04:22.380 --> 04:24.240
<v Michelle>Okay, my name took up too much time.</v>

96
04:24.240 --> 04:25.140
(Jennifer Laughs)

97
04:25.140 --> 04:26.640
<v Michelle>So, Hi everybody,</v>

98
04:26.640 --> 04:29.610
Michelle here with the Connectivity Standards Alliance.

99
04:29.610 --> 04:33.690
We are the home of over 720 member companies

100
04:33.690 --> 04:36.210
who are working together to develop standards like Matter,

101
04:36.210 --> 04:38.220
maintain and grow standards like ZigBee

102
04:38.220 --> 04:40.320
and work on new things like product security

103
04:40.320 --> 04:43.350
and access control with our newest standard Aliro.

104
04:43.350 --> 04:45.690
<v Jennifer>Thanks, fantastic, thank you Michelle.</v>

105
04:45.690 --> 04:48.240
Avi Rosenthal, managing partner with BlueConnect Partners

106
04:48.240 --> 04:49.920
and chairman of the Z-Wave Alliance.

107
04:49.920 --> 04:52.230
<v Avi>Thank you very much, I'm very happy to be here.</v>

108
04:52.230 --> 04:54.390
Avi Rosenthal, my day job is

109
04:54.390 --> 04:56.010
with a group called BlueConnect Partners,

110
04:56.010 --> 04:57.810
but my volunteer position, I'm the chair

111
04:57.810 --> 04:59.220
of the Z-Wave Alliance.

112
04:59.220 --> 05:00.300
We are also a coalition

113
05:00.300 --> 05:01.710
of a few hundred companies

114
05:01.710 --> 05:03.510
that all adhere to a specific standard

115
05:03.510 --> 05:06.120
that standard's coming up on 25 years old.

116
05:06.120 --> 05:08.760
We've got thousands of products that have been certified

117
05:08.760 --> 05:10.080
and literally millions of products

118
05:10.080 --> 05:12.240
around the world that have been deployed.

119
05:12.240 --> 05:16.020
<v ->Okay, wonderful, Stefan Witkamp CEO of Homey,</v>

120
05:16.020 --> 05:19.200
now part of the LG Electronics family.

121
05:19.200 --> 05:20.430
<v Stefan>Yes, hello, I'm Stefan.</v>

122
05:20.430 --> 05:23.880
I am indeed the founder of Homey,

123
05:23.880 --> 05:25.116
recently been acquired by LG.

124
05:25.116 --> 05:28.290
We make a universal smart home platform

125
05:28.290 --> 05:30.480
and also universal smart home hubs

126
05:30.480 --> 05:33.811
that basically incorporate all relevant standards

127
05:33.811 --> 05:35.370
in smart home today.

128
05:35.370 --> 05:37.650
So that includes all the standards of Michelle

129
05:37.650 --> 05:39.420
and of Avi, of course.

130
05:39.420 --> 05:41.070
And because of

131
05:41.070 --> 05:43.783
that we have a very unique view on what's happening

132
05:43.783 --> 05:45.477
and how users are actually using

133
05:45.477 --> 05:48.600
the different standards that are in the markets.

134
05:48.600 --> 05:49.680
<v ->Okay, fantastic,</v>

135
05:49.680 --> 05:51.870
and also Yoon Ho Choi, who's the president

136
05:51.870 --> 05:54.223
of the Home Connectivity Alliance,

137
05:54.223 --> 05:56.086
<v ->Very nice to meet everyone.</v>

138
05:56.086 --> 05:59.940
So HCA in a nutshell is an alliance that's focused

139
05:59.940 --> 06:04.940
on long life, lemme say long life,

140
06:05.130 --> 06:08.850
big ticket items like appliances and HVAC.

141
06:08.850 --> 06:11.837
and we are focusing on interoperating

142
06:11.837 --> 06:13.530
both within ourselves

143
06:13.530 --> 06:15.120
but with all of the other platforms

144
06:15.120 --> 06:17.880
that are out here, nice to meet everyone.

145
06:17.880 --> 06:18.960
<v Jennifer>Okay, fantastic,</v>

146
06:18.960 --> 06:20.787
so I'd love to start.

147
06:20.787 --> 06:22.320
I'm Jennifer Kent, vice president

148
06:22.320 --> 06:23.670
of research at Parks Associates.

149
06:23.670 --> 06:25.500
Should have introduced myself, but there we are.

150
06:25.500 --> 06:27.500
Hello, if I haven't met you already,

151
06:27.500 --> 06:31.230
I'd love to hear what it is that you're up to, so fantastic.

152
06:31.230 --> 06:33.780
So I'd love to start with talking about the fact

153
06:33.780 --> 06:35.910
that when you think about this long history

154
06:35.910 --> 06:37.890
of the smart home and the developments of standards

155
06:37.890 --> 06:39.003
and platforms,

156
06:40.050 --> 06:44.280
the way in which consumers really acquire devices

157
06:44.280 --> 06:46.920
tends to be very kind of device-led,

158
06:46.920 --> 06:48.120
single device, single app.

159
06:48.120 --> 06:50.460
Melissa in the last panel was talking about that

160
06:50.460 --> 06:52.800
a little bit, security systems,

161
06:52.800 --> 06:55.740
some hub devices being perhaps the most widespread way

162
06:55.740 --> 06:59.250
that consumers are able to put together a more kind

163
06:59.250 --> 07:00.949
of coordinated home.

164
07:00.949 --> 07:03.300
Broadly speaking, Stefan,

165
07:03.300 --> 07:04.900
I'd love to start with you here

166
07:04.900 --> 07:05.733
and then, and then go to Nick.

167
07:05.733 --> 07:08.315
How would you describe where we're at

168
07:08.315 --> 07:11.250
as an industry today in making a more integrated,

169
07:11.250 --> 07:14.790
coordinated home experience possible?

170
07:14.790 --> 07:17.130
<v ->Yeah, so that's a very interesting question</v>

171
07:17.130 --> 07:18.900
because there are these standards

172
07:18.900 --> 07:20.850
and a lot of the products on these standards

173
07:20.850 --> 07:24.180
are interoperable with other products on the standard,

174
07:24.180 --> 07:28.830
but people they don't very much choose a standard,

175
07:28.830 --> 07:30.630
they choose a product, they choose a brand,

176
07:30.630 --> 07:32.640
they choose a single application

177
07:32.640 --> 07:35.040
that they wanna start out their smart home with.

178
07:35.040 --> 07:39.000
So that's what we did as a sort of universal remote control

179
07:39.000 --> 07:40.350
for the entire home.

180
07:40.350 --> 07:42.346
We decided not to focus on a single standard

181
07:42.346 --> 07:45.030
because in practice a lot of standards,

182
07:45.030 --> 07:47.307
different standards are used by different popular brands

183
07:47.307 --> 07:49.320
and people might wanna mix and match

184
07:49.320 --> 07:52.458
and some of them might only have a proprietary API,

185
07:52.458 --> 07:56.550
another sort of way of connecting.

186
07:56.550 --> 08:00.071
So our approaches are really to offer users later on.

187
08:00.071 --> 08:02.739
So not by design the first step,

188
08:02.739 --> 08:06.420
but later on they can add on Homey, it would connect

189
08:06.420 --> 08:09.390
with either ZigBee device Z-Wave device

190
08:09.390 --> 08:14.390
or proprietary API an open API or or a Meta device

191
08:14.400 --> 08:16.500
and it would make sure that they can,

192
08:16.500 --> 08:19.328
after that choose to expand to different,

193
08:19.328 --> 08:22.026
to to different standards and to different products

194
08:22.026 --> 08:23.537
and different brands

195
08:23.537 --> 08:26.950
because it's relatively hard for consumer to understand

196
08:26.950 --> 08:29.460
that you're not just buying a product,

197
08:29.460 --> 08:31.920
you're also buying into a certain technology,

198
08:31.920 --> 08:34.770
a certain ecosystem and what all entails.

199
08:34.770 --> 08:36.579
So our solution to that is just to

200
08:36.579 --> 08:39.390
make sure it doesn't matter later on

201
08:39.390 --> 08:40.455
to really unify it at all

202
08:40.455 --> 08:42.434
And I think it's a sign

203
08:42.434 --> 08:47.340
of those different standards, all of them being mature

204
08:47.340 --> 08:50.040
and integrated into popular products.

205
08:50.040 --> 08:52.475
<v Jennifer>You make a good point about later on, right.</v>

206
08:52.475 --> 08:56.730
About how many devices do see customers having

207
08:56.730 --> 08:59.717
before they go for a Homey, for instance, right,

208
08:59.717 --> 09:03.540
how far into their device collection do they?

209
09:03.540 --> 09:04.373
<v ->Yeah, that's the difference,</v>

210
09:04.373 --> 09:05.880
so typically people will start

211
09:05.880 --> 09:08.580
to have a couple of devices, a couple of brands mostly

212
09:08.580 --> 09:10.440
because if you have 20 devices,

213
09:10.440 --> 09:11.700
but they're all the same brand

214
09:11.700 --> 09:13.500
and there's no real pain point

215
09:13.500 --> 09:15.090
because it's all the Philips Hue app

216
09:15.090 --> 09:17.649
or this all Ikea or, I dunno.

217
09:17.649 --> 09:20.670
But as soon as people start to collect two or three brands,

218
09:20.670 --> 09:23.670
then you see them purposefully looking for a platform

219
09:23.670 --> 09:26.640
because you know, a smart home doesn't really feel smart

220
09:26.640 --> 09:29.100
if it's a collection of 20 apps on your phone

221
09:29.100 --> 09:31.860
and if you leave home, you have to open five of them

222
09:31.860 --> 09:34.230
to make sure that they're all in a way mode

223
09:34.230 --> 09:36.220
or that they're all set to the right level

224
09:36.220 --> 09:37.740
or this right setting.

225
09:37.740 --> 09:40.110
So you would wanna have an automation system,

226
09:40.110 --> 09:41.781
not just for control,

227
09:41.781 --> 09:44.105
what it's firstly focused on,

228
09:44.105 --> 09:47.280
but also for automation so that things happen automatically

229
09:47.280 --> 09:49.470
and it really becomes a smart home

230
09:49.470 --> 09:53.400
and not just buttons on your phone in scattered apps.

231
09:53.400 --> 09:55.980
<v ->Yep, okay, Nick, I'd love to get your point</v>

232
09:55.980 --> 09:57.119
of view in watching--

233
09:57.119 --> 09:57.952
<v ->Yeah.</v>

234
09:57.952 --> 09:59.506
<v ->You know, you've been in Smart Home</v>

235
09:59.506 --> 10:00.339
for a while now too right, where are we at?

236
10:00.339 --> 10:01.710
<v ->Yeah, so for those of you who are not familiar</v>

237
10:01.710 --> 10:03.780
with Hubspace, Hubspace is a smart home platform

238
10:03.780 --> 10:05.280
that exclusive to Home Depot.

239
10:05.280 --> 10:06.660
So one of the challenges

240
10:06.660 --> 10:09.673
and the unique things about Home Depot is,

241
10:09.673 --> 10:12.630
that's where the mass market consumer is shopping

242
10:12.630 --> 10:14.280
for their DIY,

243
10:14.280 --> 10:15.960
their home good products.

244
10:15.960 --> 10:17.760
One of the challenges with that

245
10:17.760 --> 10:20.310
is selling smart home products to

246
10:20.310 --> 10:21.870
that mass market consumer

247
10:21.870 --> 10:24.990
is a very challenging problem to solve,

248
10:24.990 --> 10:27.990
especially when you have different brands, different apps.

249
10:27.990 --> 10:30.000
So there has been a lot of progress made

250
10:30.000 --> 10:31.500
in getting the price points down.

251
10:31.500 --> 10:35.340
So if I'm going to buy a product from a Home Depot,

252
10:35.340 --> 10:38.439
typically a customer's coming in to solve an issue

253
10:38.439 --> 10:39.300
in their house.

254
10:39.300 --> 10:42.000
I have a sprinkler system

255
10:42.000 --> 10:44.700
and I want to automate my host so that it turns on,

256
10:44.700 --> 10:46.440
it turns off at a specific time.

257
10:46.440 --> 10:49.770
If you can get to the point where you have a $10 trade up

258
10:49.770 --> 10:52.680
to get to a smart hose timer where it automatically turns,

259
10:52.680 --> 10:54.780
you can customize it instead away from home.

260
10:54.780 --> 10:56.100
A customer is much more likely

261
10:56.100 --> 10:58.780
to adopt a smart home product at a lower price point

262
10:59.640 --> 11:02.665
and then getting to the point where you have the automations

263
11:02.665 --> 11:04.263
and the jets

264
11:04.263 --> 11:07.800
and smart house where everything runs off of itself.

265
11:07.800 --> 11:10.770
I think the building blocks are coming into place,

266
11:10.770 --> 11:14.550
but I have concerns of selling that

267
11:14.550 --> 11:16.110
to the mass market consumer

268
11:16.110 --> 11:19.440
because I'm not sure that that is necessarily there today

269
11:19.440 --> 11:20.850
for that mass market consumer.

270
11:20.850 --> 11:24.606
If you're an enthusiast who is passionate about it,

271
11:24.606 --> 11:26.610
wants to put in the time to really, really, really do that

272
11:26.610 --> 11:28.980
and maintain it and do the upkeep that comes with this

273
11:28.980 --> 11:29.813
'cause, you know,

274
11:29.813 --> 11:33.420
those automations over time require a lot of maintenance.

275
11:33.420 --> 11:35.670
I think that is there for that consumer,

276
11:35.670 --> 11:37.320
but for the mass market consumer,

277
11:37.320 --> 11:39.690
we've getting the building blocks in place

278
11:39.690 --> 11:41.820
in order to allow them to do it.

279
11:41.820 --> 11:42.960
<v Jennifer>Yeah, and our data shows</v>

280
11:42.960 --> 11:45.030
that there's definitely two big,

281
11:45.030 --> 11:47.190
very different groups of users right now.

282
11:47.190 --> 11:49.440
There's the people that are on their 10th device

283
11:49.440 --> 11:51.810
and have been in smart home for a while

284
11:51.810 --> 11:55.294
and because really post Covid there's been quite a bit

285
11:55.294 --> 11:57.510
of people coming into the market

286
11:57.510 --> 12:00.300
about 45% of all US internet households now have at least

287
12:00.300 --> 12:02.010
one core smart home device,

288
12:02.010 --> 12:03.153
they're on their first or second device.

289
12:03.153 --> 12:07.019
So very kind of divergent sets of user groups using these.

290
12:07.019 --> 12:10.383
So can you share a little bit more about, again,

291
12:10.383 --> 12:13.050
kind of who's using Hubspace

292
12:13.050 --> 12:15.930
and like how they kind of get onto the platform

293
12:15.930 --> 12:17.790
and then do they stay in the platform

294
12:17.790 --> 12:18.623
or how does that work?

295
12:18.623 --> 12:20.130
<v ->So yeah, I can share a little bit.</v>

296
12:20.130 --> 12:23.490
So we have over 200 products.

297
12:23.490 --> 12:25.440
So one of the great parts of Home Depot,

298
12:25.440 --> 12:28.740
we cross every product category that Singer House minus TVs

299
12:28.740 --> 12:31.800
and mattresses I think we only sell online.

300
12:31.800 --> 12:36.300
So we have customers across Hubspace products

301
12:36.300 --> 12:39.030
across a lot of those product categories.

302
12:39.030 --> 12:40.219
The main customer

303
12:40.219 --> 12:42.540
that we're targeting we're getting is

304
12:42.540 --> 12:45.360
that first time coming into smart home consumers.

305
12:45.360 --> 12:46.740
So one of the things

306
12:46.740 --> 12:48.950
that I've always found an interesting stat to look at

307
12:48.950 --> 12:52.080
is the number of people buying mechanical and digital timers

308
12:52.080 --> 12:55.530
around the holiday season every year versus smart plugs

309
12:55.530 --> 12:58.650
and our Hubspace Smart Plug was the only smart plug,

310
12:58.650 --> 12:59.520
defiant smart plug,

311
12:59.520 --> 13:01.800
powered by Hubspace is the only smart plugs we sold in store

312
13:01.800 --> 13:03.150
for the past couple years.

313
13:03.150 --> 13:06.609
Seeing the rate at which customers are adopting the smart

314
13:06.609 --> 13:09.712
versus the non-smart has definitely grown as consumers

315
13:09.712 --> 13:10.920
through the Covid years of,

316
13:10.920 --> 13:13.140
everybody's just more comfortable with

317
13:13.140 --> 13:14.370
controlling things from their phone

318
13:14.370 --> 13:15.270
and how they are on their phones.

319
13:15.270 --> 13:17.910
And not to mention, I think that the industry

320
13:17.910 --> 13:19.950
as a whole has taken a large step forward in terms

321
13:19.950 --> 13:21.540
of cybersecurity and data privacy

322
13:21.540 --> 13:25.050
and making sure we're doing things right for our consumers.

323
13:25.050 --> 13:26.610
<v ->Yeah, yeah, that's great, great to hear,</v>

324
13:26.610 --> 13:27.990
thanks for sharing that.

325
13:27.990 --> 13:30.060
Okay, let's jump over to the standard side.

326
13:30.060 --> 13:32.490
I want to go kind of deep on the, on the standard side

327
13:32.490 --> 13:35.483
and give you Michelle to start a moment

328
13:35.483 --> 13:39.510
to explain in the room, again,

329
13:39.510 --> 13:42.000
for those who aren't following closely, right,

330
13:42.000 --> 13:44.845
what's happening with Matter in particular.

331
13:44.845 --> 13:46.845
And then you mentioned Aliro, of course,

332
13:48.426 --> 13:51.300
but what is Matter again and what is it not?

333
13:51.300 --> 13:56.300
<v ->Okay, so Matter is a global open,</v>

334
13:56.370 --> 14:00.450
smart home standard that is developing a common language

335
14:00.450 --> 14:02.220
for the Internet of Things.

336
14:02.220 --> 14:04.260
I put emphasis on the word language

337
14:04.260 --> 14:07.830
because what it is not is a full stack solution.

338
14:07.830 --> 14:11.520
Doesn't include a radio layer like say for instance ZigBee

339
14:11.520 --> 14:14.370
or Z-Wave, but it's designed

340
14:14.370 --> 14:17.510
to allow a manufacturer and a developer to create a product

341
14:17.510 --> 14:21.574
that will talk to as, Stefan pointed out, multiple brands

342
14:21.574 --> 14:22.890
of platforms

343
14:22.890 --> 14:27.390
and to other products on different radio layers.

344
14:27.390 --> 14:29.971
So you can build Matter on top of wifi,

345
14:29.971 --> 14:33.630
you can build Matter on top of thread on ethernet

346
14:33.630 --> 14:37.420
and Matter also includes bridging capabilities

347
14:37.420 --> 14:41.040
because there are so many embedded based devices out there,

348
14:41.040 --> 14:43.923
whether it's appliances or other platforms

349
14:43.923 --> 14:46.950
or these various products on other standards.

350
14:46.950 --> 14:49.650
So Matter also creates a facility, if you will,

351
14:49.650 --> 14:53.670
to allow those to come into a Matter fabric

352
14:53.670 --> 14:56.070
and talk with each other.

353
14:56.070 --> 14:59.040
<v ->Okay, so a couple big things have been announced</v>

354
14:59.040 --> 15:00.030
pretty recently

355
15:00.030 --> 15:02.520
and I'd love to just kind of get quick hits on,

356
15:02.520 --> 15:05.452
on why they Matter, particularly, you know,

357
15:05.452 --> 15:08.490
for these folks in the room developing these great products.

358
15:08.490 --> 15:11.416
So Apple announced that it was putting, you know,

359
15:11.416 --> 15:15.533
thread border routers and the Apple 15 Pro.

360
15:15.533 --> 15:18.441
Why and why does that matter?

361
15:18.441 --> 15:20.762
How does that impact, you know,

362
15:20.762 --> 15:22.959
how the users might be able

363
15:22.959 --> 15:27.959
to experience Matter-enabled ecosystem differently?

364
15:28.110 --> 15:29.755
<v ->Right, and I think I'll build a little bit on</v>

365
15:29.755 --> 15:32.700
what Nick was talking about relative to infrastructure

366
15:32.700 --> 15:34.163
and building platforms,

367
15:34.163 --> 15:36.390
the infrastructure for the smart home.

368
15:36.390 --> 15:39.282
So again, as a language kind of that sits

369
15:39.282 --> 15:41.007
at the application layer,

370
15:41.007 --> 15:43.883
there is a need for this infrastructure

371
15:43.883 --> 15:46.399
to allow devices to talk to each other.

372
15:46.399 --> 15:50.070
Thread as a local connectivity solution is something

373
15:50.070 --> 15:52.448
that allows devices to talk at a radio level

374
15:52.448 --> 15:54.870
with Matter on top.

375
15:54.870 --> 15:57.000
So including more thread radios

376
15:57.000 --> 15:59.490
and products including thread border routers

377
15:59.490 --> 16:02.436
to allow home networks to be successfully built

378
16:02.436 --> 16:04.020
and allow all those devices

379
16:04.020 --> 16:06.870
to talk together in a very active mesh

380
16:06.870 --> 16:11.040
is a way to build out the infrastructure of the smart home.

381
16:11.040 --> 16:13.290
And so in addition to things like Apple,

382
16:13.290 --> 16:14.220
putting border routers,

383
16:14.220 --> 16:15.720
thread border routers in iPhones,

384
16:15.720 --> 16:20.720
we also saw with the release of Matter 1.4 home routers

385
16:20.820 --> 16:24.240
and access points, which we lovingly call HRAP.

386
16:24.240 --> 16:26.673
For those of you following along with acronyms.

387
16:28.560 --> 16:31.590
We also announced HRAP products that will have,

388
16:31.590 --> 16:33.930
again, that infrastructure of wifi

389
16:33.930 --> 16:38.520
and Thread built in as manufacturers adopt the specification

390
16:38.520 --> 16:40.410
to help flesh out that infrastructure.

391
16:40.410 --> 16:41.850
So it's simpler for people

392
16:41.850 --> 16:43.207
to bring new devices into their homes.

393
16:43.207 --> 16:45.447
<v Jennifer>Okay, last quick hit one</v>

394
16:45.447 --> 16:47.190
and then I'd love to go to Avi

395
16:47.190 --> 16:48.535
to talk about Z-Wave a little bit.

396
16:48.535 --> 16:50.280
One announcement I saw,

397
16:50.280 --> 16:54.000
I think just maybe yesterday was around Apple

398
16:54.000 --> 16:55.260
and Samsung and Google,

399
16:55.260 --> 16:58.230
I believe, allowing for Matter attestation

400
16:58.230 --> 17:01.590
or certification to also apply to their works with programs,

401
17:01.590 --> 17:03.960
sort of simplifying those processes.

402
17:03.960 --> 17:05.100
If you could just explain a little bit

403
17:05.100 --> 17:06.510
about what that means.

404
17:06.510 --> 17:07.380
<v ->Sure, sure</v>

405
17:07.380 --> 17:10.698
and I'll try to be a little bit more precise about that.

406
17:10.698 --> 17:15.698
In short, you know, today companies bring products

407
17:15.750 --> 17:18.963
through a Matter certification process

408
17:18.963 --> 17:22.380
that involves ensuring compliance with the specification.

409
17:22.380 --> 17:26.370
We also developed as a member service a lab

410
17:26.370 --> 17:28.770
in Portland, Oregon, our interoperability lab,

411
17:28.770 --> 17:30.120
that lab tests,

412
17:30.120 --> 17:32.490
I'll say beyond the specification

413
17:32.490 --> 17:34.590
and the certification components,

414
17:34.590 --> 17:36.150
allowing a product manufacturer

415
17:36.150 --> 17:38.340
to test in a more real world environment

416
17:38.340 --> 17:42.900
against various smart home platforms and ecosystems,

417
17:42.900 --> 17:44.425
again, proving out interoperability

418
17:44.425 --> 17:47.130
and performance in more of a real world way.

419
17:47.130 --> 17:50.940
So this announcement, it not only speaks to the value

420
17:50.940 --> 17:52.020
of the interoperability lab,

421
17:52.020 --> 17:54.690
but also that companies like Apple

422
17:54.690 --> 17:57.510
and then as you pointed out also Google and Samsung

423
17:57.510 --> 18:00.360
will be accepting results from our interop lab

424
18:00.360 --> 18:03.600
as inputs into their own works with programs

425
18:03.600 --> 18:06.780
that should help manufacturers kind of speed up the process

426
18:06.780 --> 18:09.979
of securing works with badges, which will, you know,

427
18:09.979 --> 18:11.520
continue to have value

428
18:11.520 --> 18:12.960
and there are many other things

429
18:12.960 --> 18:14.340
that those platform providers seek

430
18:14.340 --> 18:16.170
from their device partners.

431
18:16.170 --> 18:18.872
So this is a way to speed up development,

432
18:18.872 --> 18:20.460
speed up time to market

433
18:20.460 --> 18:22.380
and improve performance for consumers.

434
18:22.380 --> 18:25.470
<v ->Great, everybody loves efficiency in the process,</v>

435
18:25.470 --> 18:27.420
so thank you for that.

436
18:27.420 --> 18:31.680
Okay, Avi, love to, you know, turn to you.

437
18:31.680 --> 18:33.510
Michelle really explained eloquently

438
18:33.510 --> 18:35.100
about Matter being a language,

439
18:35.100 --> 18:36.330
not necessarily the full stack.

440
18:36.330 --> 18:38.550
We've got all these great standards

441
18:38.550 --> 18:40.800
of how different devices can communicate

442
18:40.800 --> 18:43.020
that have different advantages to them.

443
18:43.020 --> 18:46.025
Tell us a little bit about how Z-Wave, you know,

444
18:46.025 --> 18:49.140
fits into the larger ecosystem

445
18:49.140 --> 18:51.930
and how we should be thinking about Z-Wave

446
18:51.930 --> 18:54.240
alongside Matter development.

447
18:54.240 --> 18:56.520
<v ->So it's a really interesting question,</v>

448
18:56.520 --> 18:58.830
obviously one that we get very, very often

449
18:58.830 --> 19:00.000
at the Z-Wave Alliance, right.

450
19:00.000 --> 19:02.970
Why, where is the Z-Wave relevancy in this world

451
19:02.970 --> 19:04.436
of interoperability?

452
19:04.436 --> 19:07.860
We don't see Matter as a competitor, right.

453
19:07.860 --> 19:11.190
We don't see it as a us and them situation.

454
19:11.190 --> 19:14.190
There are great opportunities within the marketplace

455
19:14.190 --> 19:16.530
for when Z-Wave is the right solution for the problem

456
19:16.530 --> 19:18.960
and there are great opportunities when the marketplace,

457
19:18.960 --> 19:20.550
when ZigBee or LoRa

458
19:20.550 --> 19:22.290
or any of the other standards out there

459
19:22.290 --> 19:24.210
are the right solution for the problem.

460
19:24.210 --> 19:26.820
Z-Wave in and of itself being a full stack

461
19:26.820 --> 19:28.530
means that the developers

462
19:28.530 --> 19:30.840
have complete control from the radio level all the way up

463
19:30.840 --> 19:32.610
to the application layer

464
19:32.610 --> 19:37.610
and be able to control all of the elements of that to fit

465
19:37.830 --> 19:41.340
for their designs and for their solutions,

466
19:41.340 --> 19:42.930
that's not to take away from anything else

467
19:42.930 --> 19:45.840
that's interoperable and there's no practical

468
19:45.840 --> 19:48.150
nor any technical reason why

469
19:48.150 --> 19:51.802
at some point Z-Wave won't also play in the same sandbox

470
19:51.802 --> 19:53.940
as lots of other standards.

471
19:53.940 --> 19:55.380
There are organizations

472
19:55.380 --> 19:58.140
and companies out there today, Nabu Casa

473
19:58.140 --> 19:59.430
and the home assistant guys

474
19:59.430 --> 20:01.851
that allow for bridging of various types of networks

475
20:01.851 --> 20:04.320
within from Z-Wave to LoRa

476
20:04.320 --> 20:05.337
and LoRa, Matter

477
20:05.337 --> 20:08.010
and Matter to Z-Wave and all kinds of things.

478
20:08.010 --> 20:10.590
Whether or not we've gotten to the point where all

479
20:10.590 --> 20:14.910
of the technical issues have been fixed, accounted for,

480
20:14.910 --> 20:17.430
evolved into, we're not there yet,

481
20:17.430 --> 20:19.860
but all of these are evolving standards.

482
20:19.860 --> 20:22.857
Z-Wave in and of itself is looking at ways of solving lots

483
20:22.857 --> 20:27.000
of communication problems within various industries.

484
20:27.000 --> 20:29.910
We've always been sort of centered on residential

485
20:29.910 --> 20:31.200
and now we're branching out.

486
20:31.200 --> 20:33.900
Our new Z-Wave long range allows

487
20:33.900 --> 20:37.080
for different solutions for different industries

488
20:37.080 --> 20:39.540
that we've never been able to take advantage of before.

489
20:39.540 --> 20:41.790
And so as each of these standards evolve,

490
20:41.790 --> 20:45.990
they get to take advantage of those problem solvers.

491
20:45.990 --> 20:47.520
When the engineers sit back

492
20:47.520 --> 20:49.620
and they go, all right, I gotta get this signal from point A

493
20:49.620 --> 20:52.170
to point B and it's gotta be interoperable with this.

494
20:52.170 --> 20:54.720
They get to choose what the right standard is

495
20:54.720 --> 20:56.460
for their application

496
20:56.460 --> 20:58.860
<v Jennifer>You mentioned kind of expanding</v>

497
20:58.860 --> 20:59.693
beyond residential.

498
20:59.693 --> 21:02.820
Z-Wave has had a really strong presence

499
21:02.820 --> 21:04.740
within like home security for instance,

500
21:04.740 --> 21:06.750
use those types of systems.

501
21:06.750 --> 21:07.950
I believe there's also announcement

502
21:07.950 --> 21:10.260
with Smart Rent looking at multifamily.

503
21:10.260 --> 21:13.260
Is that kind of one of those next areas expansion

504
21:13.260 --> 21:15.660
that you're looking at or are there other verticals?

505
21:15.660 --> 21:17.640
<v ->No, you know, and it's funny</v>

506
21:17.640 --> 21:19.889
because Z-Wave has been used in lots

507
21:19.889 --> 21:22.320
of different verticals for a long time.

508
21:22.320 --> 21:25.500
I, myself, did a very large hotel installation

509
21:25.500 --> 21:27.510
using Z-Wave many years ago

510
21:27.510 --> 21:29.162
and so multifamily is a great extension

511
21:29.162 --> 21:31.170
of where Z-Wave is going.

512
21:31.170 --> 21:33.595
Z-Wave long range actually gives more opportunity

513
21:33.595 --> 21:35.160
in those kinds of environments

514
21:35.160 --> 21:37.230
because now we can network together

515
21:37.230 --> 21:38.610
two different mesh networks

516
21:38.610 --> 21:40.110
with three different mesh networks.

517
21:40.110 --> 21:42.570
So now you can have campus-wide environments,

518
21:42.570 --> 21:44.130
so smart city

519
21:44.130 --> 21:46.020
and then industrial applications.

520
21:46.020 --> 21:48.000
Just yesterday I was having a conversation,

521
21:48.000 --> 21:50.640
there's a big problem in the drone world

522
21:50.640 --> 21:55.350
where drones end up breaking their electronic leash

523
21:55.350 --> 21:58.050
because they rely on things like wifi and cellular

524
21:58.050 --> 21:59.970
and there's some latency built into cellular

525
21:59.970 --> 22:02.790
and wifi sometimes can be interfered with.

526
22:02.790 --> 22:05.280
Z-Wave long range is a really great opportunity

527
22:05.280 --> 22:07.904
to do command and control, right.

528
22:07.904 --> 22:09.150
It's not gonna do the video, it's not gonna be backup,

529
22:09.150 --> 22:10.980
but it's backup for the command and control

530
22:10.980 --> 22:12.090
of a drone, for instance.

531
22:12.090 --> 22:14.640
So the drone could be a mile and a half away

532
22:14.640 --> 22:18.090
and Z-Wave long range will still give you full bandwidth

533
22:18.090 --> 22:19.680
to be able to communicate with that drone,

534
22:19.680 --> 22:21.796
bring it back to its home base,

535
22:21.796 --> 22:24.360
and make sure that you don't lose communication with it.

536
22:24.360 --> 22:26.100
So there's lots of cool applications

537
22:26.100 --> 22:28.290
that we're just starting to scratch the surface on.

538
22:28.290 --> 22:30.300
<v ->Awesome, drones also have a new PR problem</v>

539
22:30.300 --> 22:31.470
in New Jersey, I hear

540
22:31.470 --> 22:32.303
<v ->It's a whole other issue that we--</v>

541
22:32.303 --> 22:37.303
<v ->Yeah, okay, you know, I love to give you an opportunity</v>

542
22:37.650 --> 22:39.600
to tell us more about the standard.

543
22:39.600 --> 22:40.650
You mentioned, of course,

544
22:40.650 --> 22:43.110
talking about those larger appliances,

545
22:43.110 --> 22:45.483
long lifetime appliances.

546
22:46.440 --> 22:48.720
Tell us a little bit about why you felt like a standard was

547
22:48.720 --> 22:51.660
needed for sharing energy consumption data

548
22:51.660 --> 22:56.010
and sharing data for these types of appliances specifically.

549
22:56.010 --> 22:58.910
<v ->Very good, so HCA, as I mentioned</v>

550
22:58.910 --> 23:03.030
before, was focused on the long life items.

551
23:03.030 --> 23:05.970
And what I'm talking about is these are your washers,

552
23:05.970 --> 23:09.120
your ovens, your refrigerators, the devices

553
23:09.120 --> 23:12.589
that basically stay in our homes for decades.

554
23:12.589 --> 23:14.808
The reason why we had created.

555
23:14.808 --> 23:18.930
We did spend a lot of time, you know, thinking,

556
23:18.930 --> 23:21.147
do we need to create an actual new standard

557
23:21.147 --> 23:24.210
and a new alliance to actually tackle this?

558
23:24.210 --> 23:27.734
Should we be part of Matter or CSA?

559
23:27.734 --> 23:30.017
And what we decided was that we do actually need

560
23:30.017 --> 23:32.790
to have a separate alliance

561
23:32.790 --> 23:37.790
to focus specifically on this decade-long approach.

562
23:38.700 --> 23:42.390
I think as manufacturers we've seen standards come and go.

563
23:42.390 --> 23:44.640
We've seen even platforms come and go, right,

564
23:44.640 --> 23:47.910
and so I think what we do is we wanna make sure that this,

565
23:47.910 --> 23:50.819
whatever we end up with is meaningful

566
23:50.819 --> 23:54.030
and there's a path to transition for our consumers

567
23:54.030 --> 23:57.240
who own these devices for over 10 years, right,

568
23:57.240 --> 23:59.064
or 15, 20 years.

569
23:59.064 --> 24:02.202
I think the second part I wanted to make sure is

570
24:02.202 --> 24:04.928
that we, HCA focus on is one is, you know,

571
24:04.928 --> 24:08.494
the interoperability and kind of the communication

572
24:08.494 --> 24:12.090
between the manufacturer and the the consumer.

573
24:12.090 --> 24:13.770
The other important piece is

574
24:13.770 --> 24:15.903
that all of this interoperability

575
24:15.903 --> 24:19.860
and connection, it actually leads to somewhere, right.

576
24:19.860 --> 24:21.690
And the somewhere what I'm talking about is

577
24:21.690 --> 24:23.730
there's services

578
24:23.730 --> 24:26.760
and there's additional sort of business models

579
24:26.760 --> 24:28.470
that actually come from this, right.

580
24:28.470 --> 24:31.530
And we wanna make sure that for the manufacturers,

581
24:31.530 --> 24:33.186
for the consumers, right,

582
24:33.186 --> 24:35.769
and for the service providers, whether it's retailer

583
24:35.769 --> 24:40.769
or energy, utility insurance, home security,

584
24:40.890 --> 24:45.060
that there's actual a path to make that service happen

585
24:45.060 --> 24:48.210
and in the end return that benefit to the consumer, right.

586
24:48.210 --> 24:52.980
So I think that's what keeps these initiatives sustainable

587
24:52.980 --> 24:54.840
and we will keep it going, right,

588
24:54.840 --> 24:58.500
and so we spend a lot of energy focusing on that, yeah.

589
24:58.500 --> 25:01.650
<v Jennifer>Can can you tell us a little bit more about,</v>

590
25:01.650 --> 25:03.600
you know, sharing of energy consumption data?

591
25:03.600 --> 25:05.130
Because I think this is one thing

592
25:05.130 --> 25:07.350
that when we think about the energy conversation,

593
25:07.350 --> 25:09.390
we have a panel leader all about energy.

594
25:09.390 --> 25:11.490
You know, utilities are definitely interested

595
25:11.490 --> 25:15.060
in seeing more information behind the meter.

596
25:15.060 --> 25:18.561
Consumers right now often don't have very granular access

597
25:18.561 --> 25:23.130
to what devices in their home are, you know,

598
25:23.130 --> 25:26.130
consuming what types of of energy, you know.

599
25:26.130 --> 25:27.990
What does, what you're working on mean

600
25:27.990 --> 25:31.650
for other ecosystem players and for consumers?

601
25:31.650 --> 25:33.660
<v ->Yeah, I think the energy,</v>

602
25:33.660 --> 25:36.210
you know, there's so many different actual ways

603
25:36.210 --> 25:38.684
to reach that granular data.

604
25:38.684 --> 25:40.947
There's not one path to get there, right.

605
25:40.947 --> 25:44.130
If you have an appliance that's five years old,

606
25:44.130 --> 25:46.890
that's may or may not be part of the meter,

607
25:46.890 --> 25:50.460
there's al alternative ways to get to that granular data.

608
25:50.460 --> 25:53.554
I think in the end what we focus on is

609
25:53.554 --> 25:55.560
for the utility companies,

610
25:55.560 --> 25:59.918
what information do they need in order to provide efficiency

611
25:59.918 --> 26:02.340
and cost savings back to the consumer, right?

612
26:02.340 --> 26:04.620
Because in the end, all of this effort,

613
26:04.620 --> 26:07.817
if it actually doesn't net out to savings for consumers

614
26:07.817 --> 26:09.409
or savings on kind

615
26:09.409 --> 26:11.730
of the pressure on the grid,

616
26:11.730 --> 26:13.170
doesn't really mean anything, right.

617
26:13.170 --> 26:15.030
So what we do is we try to take

618
26:15.030 --> 26:20.030
a non-agnostic approach in terms of the many different ways

619
26:20.610 --> 26:22.110
to get to that.

620
26:22.110 --> 26:22.943
For example,

621
26:22.943 --> 26:26.010
the HCA first specification on energy

622
26:26.010 --> 26:30.300
focuses squarely on demand response and that only, right.

623
26:30.300 --> 26:33.960
And so what we don't think there's a one solution

624
26:33.960 --> 26:35.160
to fit everything.

625
26:35.160 --> 26:37.500
We're almost taking it

626
26:37.500 --> 26:40.140
as chapters in these types of approaches.

627
26:40.140 --> 26:43.230
Same thing for home security or insurance, right,

628
26:43.230 --> 26:45.300
there's multiple data points

629
26:45.300 --> 26:48.270
that would actually help make these businesses

630
26:48.270 --> 26:49.590
more efficient,

631
26:49.590 --> 26:52.410
therefore returning the savings back to the consumer.

632
26:52.410 --> 26:55.530
And I think for, you know, our relationship,

633
26:55.530 --> 26:56.413
many of our members

634
26:56.413 --> 26:58.526
, the relationship with our consumers is,

635
26:58.526 --> 27:03.526
you may buy a refrigerator from me,

636
27:04.530 --> 27:07.020
maybe two or three times in the whole life

637
27:07.020 --> 27:08.310
of our relationship, right.

638
27:08.310 --> 27:10.500
So it's pretty important the trust

639
27:10.500 --> 27:12.515
and the continuity, right,

640
27:12.515 --> 27:15.180
so we really focus on that.

641
27:15.180 --> 27:17.250
<v Jennifer>I love your description of chapters</v>

642
27:17.250 --> 27:18.960
that's a great way to think about it.

643
27:18.960 --> 27:20.070
Final follow up here

644
27:20.070 --> 27:22.140
and then I'd love to get back over to the platform side

645
27:22.140 --> 27:23.253
to Stefan and Nick,

646
27:25.560 --> 27:28.377
can you explain a little bit how, I know, you know,

647
27:28.377 --> 27:31.830
the CSA is also working on energy consumption sharing,

648
27:31.830 --> 27:35.310
you know, efforts, how the HCA's effort is different.

649
27:35.310 --> 27:37.290
Is it that focus that real, you know,

650
27:37.290 --> 27:38.848
special focus on demand response?

651
27:38.848 --> 27:40.740
Or can you describe a little bit about

652
27:40.740 --> 27:43.380
how those two efforts are different or complimentary?

653
27:43.380 --> 27:45.720
<v ->I think in the bigger picture of things,</v>

654
27:45.720 --> 27:48.150
it's all headed in the same direction for sure.

655
27:48.150 --> 27:49.245
I think right now

656
27:49.245 --> 27:52.320
it's just almost different swim lanes, right.

657
27:52.320 --> 27:57.320
So HCA is focused on HVAC, long life items,

658
27:57.990 --> 28:01.613
you know, appliances, these items that have long life.

659
28:01.613 --> 28:05.340
We actually do focus, not exclusively,

660
28:05.340 --> 28:09.510
but very primarily focus on C-to-C interaction

661
28:09.510 --> 28:13.460
because many of our utility service providers, many of our,

662
28:13.460 --> 28:14.849
you know, security,

663
28:14.849 --> 28:16.807
it's an easier path to get

664
28:16.807 --> 28:21.807
to connecting these older products

665
28:22.080 --> 28:23.400
that are already in our home

666
28:23.400 --> 28:26.160
and so that's sort of where our focus is.

667
28:26.160 --> 28:29.040
I think what we, you know, I know that

668
28:29.040 --> 28:34.040
for CSA and Matter, there's a much larger perspective

669
28:34.080 --> 28:37.260
that's kind of defining the overall sort of industry,

670
28:37.260 --> 28:40.053
but I do believe it's in the same direction,

671
28:40.053 --> 28:42.390
just different swim lanes for now.

672
28:42.390 --> 28:44.069
<v Jennifer>Okay, great, Michelle did you--</v>

673
28:44.069 --> 28:44.925
<v ->Totally agree, totally agree</v>

674
28:44.925 --> 28:49.320
and I think, you know, stated it well in that

675
28:49.320 --> 28:52.830
there is so much embedded base equipment out there,

676
28:52.830 --> 28:55.922
there is such a need to be able to collect the information

677
28:55.922 --> 28:57.466
that is out there today

678
28:57.466 --> 29:00.330
to do that cloud-to-cloud connectivity

679
29:00.330 --> 29:04.050
and then as people buy the next new thing

680
29:04.050 --> 29:07.830
and add other high load equipment to their household,

681
29:07.830 --> 29:09.900
whether it's a heat pump or a water pump

682
29:09.900 --> 29:13.170
or a pool pump, that all of that data can start

683
29:13.170 --> 29:16.080
to be integrated both locally and then also in the cloud.

684
29:16.080 --> 29:18.082
So I think they're very complimentary efforts.

685
29:18.082 --> 29:18.915
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

686
29:18.915 --> 29:19.748
<v ->Okay, all right, great.</v>

687
29:19.748 --> 29:22.321
So Stephan and Nick, I wanna come back to you guys

688
29:22.321 --> 29:25.162
and get your thoughts as more platform players

689
29:25.162 --> 29:28.032
of how do you think about the various standards that are,

690
29:28.032 --> 29:32.430
you know, available, how you make use of them or don't?

691
29:32.430 --> 29:34.710
Or how you enable your users, you know,

692
29:34.710 --> 29:36.733
to make use of 'em and how you track the efforts

693
29:36.733 --> 29:38.460
that are happening in the industry?

694
29:38.460 --> 29:40.273
<v ->It's great that there's so many different standards.</v>

695
29:40.273 --> 29:42.360
I mean, who else would buy our hubs?

696
29:42.360 --> 29:43.897
No, I'm just kidding, but I think,

697
29:43.897 --> 29:45.550
and that's also already

698
29:45.550 --> 29:48.087
what came out the last conversations.

699
29:48.087 --> 29:49.537
A lot of these standards

700
29:49.537 --> 29:52.170
they serve slightly different purposes

701
29:52.170 --> 29:53.940
and you see that everywhere in the market, right.

702
29:53.940 --> 29:57.030
Some standards provide exceptionally long range

703
29:57.030 --> 29:58.800
and good reliability,

704
29:58.800 --> 30:01.680
but there may be a little bit more expensive to integrate.

705
30:01.680 --> 30:03.660
Others are more on the cheaper side,

706
30:03.660 --> 30:06.087
but they come with other disadvantages either in bandwidth

707
30:06.087 --> 30:11.087
or in in range for instance, or in requirements for a hub.

708
30:11.220 --> 30:13.525
And you see that a lot of the devices

709
30:13.525 --> 30:17.010
and a lot of the engineers, they look at their application,

710
30:17.010 --> 30:18.240
they look at what's best

711
30:18.240 --> 30:20.150
for their ecosystem and their brand

712
30:20.150 --> 30:23.370
and I think in the end, all of these standards

713
30:23.370 --> 30:24.810
and all of these standards progressing,

714
30:24.810 --> 30:26.940
I mean it tremendously helps the consumers

715
30:26.940 --> 30:29.550
because even though if there's different standards,

716
30:29.550 --> 30:31.839
having standards is always better than having, you know,

717
30:31.839 --> 30:33.592
a thousands of proprietary systems

718
30:33.592 --> 30:37.350
because with standards at least it's a handful or maybe 10.

719
30:37.350 --> 30:40.830
And then to make it really a win for consumer,

720
30:40.830 --> 30:43.480
I do believe that there should be proper user interfaces,

721
30:43.480 --> 30:46.585
proper platforms like Homey to integrate multiple

722
30:46.585 --> 30:51.210
of those standards into a single real user application.

723
30:51.210 --> 30:54.000
Because otherwise you still have 10 ecosystems

724
30:54.000 --> 30:56.760
and this is a user you don't want a thousand ecosystems

725
30:56.760 --> 30:59.010
to choose from that are all proprietary,

726
30:59.010 --> 31:02.268
but you also don't want to have 10,

727
31:02.268 --> 31:04.897
ideally you would have one application,

728
31:04.897 --> 31:06.990
one platform that you know combines it all.

729
31:06.990 --> 31:09.420
So that's the vision and the way that we look at it

730
31:09.420 --> 31:11.910
and we also don't wanna, you know, steer the market

731
31:11.910 --> 31:15.480
or whatever, if there's a very popular product

732
31:15.480 --> 31:17.714
that's based on a certain standard that apparently,

733
31:17.714 --> 31:21.090
you know, has selected that standard for a good reason

734
31:21.090 --> 31:23.730
and is doing well, then you know, we'll follow that

735
31:23.730 --> 31:25.345
and we'll make sure that the consumer

736
31:25.345 --> 31:28.140
can use that interoperable with other standards

737
31:28.140 --> 31:31.260
no matter what the standard is or ends up to be.

738
31:31.260 --> 31:33.780
And I think that sort of,

739
31:33.780 --> 31:36.205
yeah enabler role has given us a very nice

740
31:36.205 --> 31:40.650
and unique position to actually realize this vision

741
31:40.650 --> 31:42.930
of the whole smart home working together

742
31:42.930 --> 31:45.900
based on, of course, the shoulders of giants

743
31:45.900 --> 31:47.220
of the standards that are there

744
31:47.220 --> 31:50.190
because it's easier to implement 10 standards than,

745
31:50.190 --> 31:53.190
like I said, a thousand proprietary APIs.

746
31:53.190 --> 31:54.060
In real life,

747
31:54.060 --> 31:55.350
You end up doing both

748
31:55.350 --> 31:57.600
because there's still a lot of proprietary APIs,

749
31:57.600 --> 32:00.750
but that's okay as an open platform you can do both.

750
32:00.750 --> 32:02.220
<v ->Well and just as a follow up to that,</v>

751
32:02.220 --> 32:05.700
obviously with the acquisition of LG who has thinQ, right.

752
32:05.700 --> 32:08.820
So they have an interesting kind of dual strategy now.

753
32:08.820 --> 32:13.350
So you all coming in as a open part of their play

754
32:13.350 --> 32:15.060
and then there's the ThinQ play.

755
32:15.060 --> 32:17.640
<v ->Yeah, so they're opening up their ThinQ part as well.</v>

756
32:17.640 --> 32:19.080
I mean, that's not our effort,

757
32:19.080 --> 32:20.323
that's the guy in Korea doing that.

758
32:20.323 --> 32:23.686
As you might see, I'm not super Korean,

759
32:23.686 --> 32:26.353
but indeed they are opening up

760
32:26.353 --> 32:29.700
but it's still proprietary system and a proprietary API.

761
32:29.700 --> 32:33.180
But I do know that they are also moving towards Matter,

762
32:33.180 --> 32:34.380
at least Matter control

763
32:34.380 --> 32:38.190
and I do also assume Matter recipients

764
32:38.190 --> 32:42.120
and I do believe they're part of the ADA as well.

765
32:42.120 --> 32:44.580
So probably LG appliance will become compatible

766
32:44.580 --> 32:45.413
with that as well.

767
32:45.413 --> 32:46.560
It's just sometimes

768
32:46.560 --> 32:48.705
for a larger corporate it takes a little bit longer

769
32:48.705 --> 32:52.260
to get on the board and it allows us,

770
32:52.260 --> 32:53.310
and that's what we're here for,

771
32:53.310 --> 32:55.140
to help them accelerate their efforts

772
32:55.140 --> 32:56.694
and to make sure that, you know, we play

773
32:56.694 --> 32:59.040
and keep playing that front runner role

774
32:59.040 --> 33:00.090
under the Homey brand

775
33:00.090 --> 33:02.970
and they can take more and more of our technology

776
33:02.970 --> 33:05.451
and make it available across their great appliances

777
33:05.451 --> 33:08.160
and devices as well.

778
33:08.160 --> 33:10.830
<v ->So Nick, coming from more of a proprietary play, right.</v>

779
33:10.830 --> 33:12.990
How you think about what standards are right

780
33:12.990 --> 33:14.970
for your experience?

781
33:14.970 --> 33:17.730
<v ->So we are the advocates for the customer,</v>

782
33:17.730 --> 33:19.380
the mass market consumer

783
33:19.380 --> 33:21.060
and we take that very, very personally.

784
33:21.060 --> 33:23.460
Like I have to work in a Home Depot store

785
33:23.460 --> 33:24.660
at least four days a year.

786
33:24.660 --> 33:26.010
I'm usually in a store every Thursday

787
33:26.010 --> 33:27.480
with an apron on

788
33:27.480 --> 33:30.720
talking to a consumer selling customers products.

789
33:30.720 --> 33:32.370
Once you have to start explaining

790
33:32.370 --> 33:34.500
what the difference between, you know,

791
33:34.500 --> 33:37.800
to go back to the 2017 days of ZigBee, Z-Wave,

792
33:37.800 --> 33:39.120
this one works on this platform,

793
33:39.120 --> 33:42.510
this one works on that platform, you've lost the consumer.

794
33:42.510 --> 33:46.050
So where we focused our efforts on was a customer needs

795
33:46.050 --> 33:49.050
to be able to buy any one of our products.

796
33:49.050 --> 33:52.500
Again over 200 products categories across the store.

797
33:52.500 --> 33:54.360
If you buy any single one of those products

798
33:54.360 --> 33:57.270
and you take it home, you'll be able to set it up,

799
33:57.270 --> 33:59.980
get it connected in under 60 seconds or less

800
34:01.020 --> 34:03.540
without another product being needed in your home.

801
34:03.540 --> 34:06.360
So we focused on the technologies that we knew all

802
34:06.360 --> 34:08.876
of our customers had in their homes today.

803
34:08.876 --> 34:12.510
So everybody has at that point that had a cell phone,

804
34:12.510 --> 34:13.680
had Bluetooth.

805
34:13.680 --> 34:15.750
If you were buying a smart product, you had wifi.

806
34:15.750 --> 34:17.213
So all of our products are wifi and Bluetooth.

807
34:17.213 --> 34:19.649
You don't need product B

808
34:19.649 --> 34:22.274
in order to buy product A when you get it home.

809
34:22.274 --> 34:25.170
And you don't have to explain, you just tell the customer,

810
34:25.170 --> 34:26.700
if you buy this, you take it home,

811
34:26.700 --> 34:29.250
you download the Hubspace app, it will work.

812
34:29.250 --> 34:32.223
Now from a proprietary platform point-of-view,

813
34:33.180 --> 34:35.820
yeah I would love it if you know everybody were like me

814
34:35.820 --> 34:38.070
and had a hundred Hubspace products in their house.

815
34:38.070 --> 34:41.040
But we want our customers to be able to.

816
34:41.040 --> 34:43.620
We're in the business of selling products to our customers

817
34:43.620 --> 34:45.150
and our customers buying products from Home Depot.

818
34:45.150 --> 34:46.980
I want them to be able to control the products

819
34:46.980 --> 34:48.691
from whatever area or surface that they want

820
34:48.691 --> 34:51.544
to be able to control it from.

821
34:51.544 --> 34:54.173
You know, we can do anything we do, can do everything.

822
34:54.173 --> 34:55.800
You just can't do everything all at once.

823
34:55.800 --> 34:57.120
We started with the platforms

824
34:57.120 --> 34:58.770
that had the majority of the market share.

825
34:58.770 --> 35:00.780
Amazon, Alexa and Google Home

826
35:00.780 --> 35:02.910
had a large portion of the market share

827
35:02.910 --> 35:05.220
as Parks data shows us.

828
35:05.220 --> 35:06.900
So that's where we folks our efforts

829
35:06.900 --> 35:09.270
and making sure that we had the best value products

830
35:09.270 --> 35:12.000
that we could get to market that were as simple as possible

831
35:12.000 --> 35:14.700
for customers to explain or to understand

832
35:14.700 --> 35:16.290
and get set up in their homes

833
35:16.290 --> 35:17.730
to help our store.

834
35:17.730 --> 35:19.680
Associates be able to just have confidence

835
35:19.680 --> 35:20.820
in selling smart home

836
35:20.820 --> 35:23.730
and getting smart home products into that mass market.

837
35:23.730 --> 35:26.640
So for me the standards are fantastic.

838
35:26.640 --> 35:29.670
I have nothing but support for Matter

839
35:29.670 --> 35:32.640
and all the other alliances pushing the industry forward

840
35:32.640 --> 35:33.990
and we support them.

841
35:33.990 --> 35:34.980
For today,

842
35:34.980 --> 35:38.100
we are focused on what is the easiest for our customers

843
35:38.100 --> 35:41.010
to understand and get adopted in their homes.

844
35:41.010 --> 35:43.770
<v ->Okay, so looking forward, what do you think.</v>

845
35:43.770 --> 35:46.110
And then Stefan, I'm gonna pose the same thing to you.

846
35:46.110 --> 35:51.060
What do you think is the next really layer

847
35:51.060 --> 35:54.451
of differentiation for the platform experience, right,

848
35:54.451 --> 35:57.120
that makes consumers choose to stick

849
35:57.120 --> 35:58.800
with one platform versus the other?

850
35:58.800 --> 36:01.710
I think we're getting a lot more kind of tighter competition

851
36:02.824 --> 36:05.583
among what platforms have really emerged as as leaders

852
36:05.583 --> 36:06.416
and really at the table.

853
36:06.416 --> 36:07.249
Is it the intelligence?

854
36:07.249 --> 36:11.160
Is it the, the spread of the product portfolio support it,

855
36:11.160 --> 36:13.330
is it the trust they have with you as a brand, right?

856
36:13.330 --> 36:15.570
And they know that they can come into the store

857
36:15.570 --> 36:16.973
and talk to the apron guys

858
36:16.973 --> 36:19.545
and who can help them with their problem, right.

859
36:19.545 --> 36:23.818
What's gonna differentiate the next platform

860
36:23.818 --> 36:26.093
kind of level there?

861
36:26.093 --> 36:28.410
<v ->I think that that's a hard question to answer</v>

862
36:28.410 --> 36:30.210
'cause there are a lot of different types of customers.

863
36:30.210 --> 36:31.852
But I think for the mass market customer,

864
36:31.852 --> 36:34.655
it's going to be what is the simplest platform

865
36:34.655 --> 36:39.013
that provides the most value to the customer.

866
36:39.013 --> 36:43.029
Am I able to tie together my ceiling fan

867
36:43.029 --> 36:46.890
and my window air conditioner

868
36:46.890 --> 36:48.824
to more efficiently cool my house?

869
36:48.824 --> 36:51.496
Very easy value add things

870
36:51.496 --> 36:53.520
for the mass market consumer

871
36:53.520 --> 36:56.580
that are given to and dev in a very easy way.

872
36:56.580 --> 36:58.306
I'll speak for the mass market consumer.

873
36:58.306 --> 37:01.785
I think there are, I'll let Homey go for their answer.

874
37:01.785 --> 37:05.400
<v ->No, I agree that actually saving money</v>

875
37:05.400 --> 37:10.290
or like the HCA also mentioned like having a cost first

876
37:10.290 --> 37:12.720
or a price first reason really helps

877
37:12.720 --> 37:15.420
with mass market adoption because not everyone just buys it

878
37:15.420 --> 37:17.190
because they're interested in tech.

879
37:17.190 --> 37:19.350
Some people just want a real life application

880
37:19.350 --> 37:21.600
like saving money, like saving energy.

881
37:21.600 --> 37:23.340
And luckily because mainly

882
37:23.340 --> 37:25.320
because of this, the work of these standards,

883
37:25.320 --> 37:27.660
I think the first differentiator of having

884
37:27.660 --> 37:30.613
that broad product range supported I think has been covered

885
37:30.613 --> 37:32.801
by most mature platforms.

886
37:32.801 --> 37:35.070
Also as platforms matured,

887
37:35.070 --> 37:37.110
obviously we came from like a hundred

888
37:37.110 --> 37:41.610
and consolidated into five, maybe 10 really relevant ones.

889
37:41.610 --> 37:45.060
I think future-looking it will be towards providing value,

890
37:45.060 --> 37:47.280
for instance through energy, energy monitoring,

891
37:47.280 --> 37:50.917
energy saving energy timings with dynamic energy prices.

892
37:50.917 --> 37:52.415
I think that's an important one.

893
37:52.415 --> 37:56.220
Automation, you know, making sure that you get more out

894
37:56.220 --> 37:58.590
of your devices by having them really work together

895
37:58.590 --> 38:00.420
because it started out with control,

896
38:00.420 --> 38:03.000
but control at a certain point is a given

897
38:03.000 --> 38:04.710
and automation is next.

898
38:04.710 --> 38:06.750
And I think people will become a little bit more,

899
38:06.750 --> 38:09.831
at some people, not everyone will become a little bit more

900
38:09.831 --> 38:12.687
aware of, you know, what kind of privacy policy

901
38:12.687 --> 38:15.870
and if they're really converging towards a single platform,

902
38:15.870 --> 38:17.520
who do they trust their data with?

903
38:17.520 --> 38:21.030
Do they want it cloud operated or locally operated?

904
38:21.030 --> 38:23.700
Do they want it spend a little bit more

905
38:23.700 --> 38:25.860
but have it not with an advertising company

906
38:25.860 --> 38:27.210
or they don't wanna spend less

907
38:27.210 --> 38:29.880
and have your data hosted by an advertising company?

908
38:29.880 --> 38:32.524
It's those sort of choices that people will be able to make,

909
38:32.524 --> 38:35.689
but only because that first hygiene layer

910
38:35.689 --> 38:38.370
of having connectivity,

911
38:38.370 --> 38:40.503
being able to connect all those devices

912
38:40.503 --> 38:43.740
and I'm super happy to hear that you're opening a Hubspace

913
38:43.740 --> 38:44.970
to more platforms as well

914
38:44.970 --> 38:47.770
because of course we would love to integrate it as well.

915
38:48.840 --> 38:51.758
Is there, and we can build on towards the real value

916
38:51.758 --> 38:54.660
of smart home because connectivity

917
38:54.660 --> 38:56.190
and controls a hygiene factor,

918
38:56.190 --> 38:59.335
but the real value is in automation, it's in energy savings,

919
38:59.335 --> 39:03.090
it's in real life monetary things

920
39:03.090 --> 39:06.006
and then of course it's a personal choice

921
39:06.006 --> 39:08.880
on privacy, local or cloud.

922
39:08.880 --> 39:11.580
<v ->Okay, great, love to see partnerships happening on stage.</v>

923
39:11.580 --> 39:12.416
Just have a minute or so left,

924
39:12.416 --> 39:14.208
I'd love to do just a again,

925
39:14.208 --> 39:17.030
like a quick hit of on the standard side,

926
39:17.030 --> 39:18.780
what are you focusing on?

927
39:18.780 --> 39:22.140
What's next for standards development for Z-Wave

928
39:22.140 --> 39:24.450
for Matter and for HCA that we can kind

929
39:24.450 --> 39:26.610
of expect coming down the pipe here?

930
39:26.610 --> 39:28.080
<v ->So for us, our three initiatives</v>

931
39:28.080 --> 39:31.033
for 2025 are the expansion of Z-Wave long range.

932
39:31.033 --> 39:35.820
The addition of S2-V2, our new encryption methodology

933
39:35.820 --> 39:38.550
to make us even more compliant with the Cyber Trust Mark

934
39:38.550 --> 39:39.990
that's coming out later this year

935
39:39.990 --> 39:42.000
and third is batteryless technology.

936
39:42.000 --> 39:45.720
So we're actually adding an environment within Z-Wave

937
39:45.720 --> 39:48.690
that will allow for the use of batteryless sensors

938
39:48.690 --> 39:51.720
and things within the Z-Wave environment.

939
39:51.720 --> 39:52.570
<v ->Okay, Michelle.</v>

940
39:53.920 --> 39:58.920
<v ->Okay, I'll try to be that brief as well, very good.</v>

941
39:58.950 --> 40:01.260
So from a Matter perspective this year,

942
40:01.260 --> 40:02.430
we are gonna continue forward

943
40:02.430 --> 40:06.090
with our release cadence as the market has continued to see,

944
40:06.090 --> 40:08.940
focus continues to be on making sure

945
40:08.940 --> 40:11.910
that we've got a very robust software development kit

946
40:11.910 --> 40:13.290
that's open sourced, available

947
40:13.290 --> 40:15.150
for everyone to get access to.

948
40:15.150 --> 40:16.800
We're gonna continue to evolve

949
40:16.800 --> 40:19.137
and I think there's already been some news out there,

950
40:19.137 --> 40:22.528
our device portfolio adding some new devices

951
40:22.528 --> 40:25.590
as the year progresses and continue to progress things

952
40:25.590 --> 40:27.097
like our energy management features,

953
40:27.097 --> 40:31.983
et cetera, that were so well developed in in Matter 1.4.

954
40:32.988 --> 40:34.546
<v ->Okay, fantastic, Yoon Ho.</v>

955
40:34.546 --> 40:37.530
<v ->Yeah, I think for HCA, there's so much good work</v>

956
40:37.530 --> 40:39.595
that's being done in the industry.

957
40:39.595 --> 40:42.240
You know, 2025 and beyond,

958
40:42.240 --> 40:46.140
we're gonna focus on how do we take what we do

959
40:46.140 --> 40:50.400
and make this actually connectable to the larger ecosystem

960
40:50.400 --> 40:52.050
of home services

961
40:52.050 --> 40:54.270
and home ecosystems that's out there, right?

962
40:54.270 --> 40:57.487
So that means what we do, how do we connect this

963
40:57.487 --> 40:59.068
to other businesses

964
40:59.068 --> 41:02.130
and industry sectors that are out there to,

965
41:02.130 --> 41:04.320
in fact, create business models

966
41:04.320 --> 41:07.740
that will provide benefit back to the consumer.

967
41:07.740 --> 41:11.711
I think that's gonna be our core focus for going forward

968
41:11.711 --> 41:14.220
and we look forward to that.

969
41:14.220 --> 41:15.960
<v ->Okay, fantastic, well, you're out of time.</v>

970
41:15.960 --> 41:17.759
Please join me in thanking our panelists

971
41:17.759 --> 41:20.261
for their great insights today.

972
41:20.261 --> 41:21.246
(audience clapping)

973
41:21.246 --> 41:23.829
(bright music)
