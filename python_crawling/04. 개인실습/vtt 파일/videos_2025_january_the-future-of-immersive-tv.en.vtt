2
00:10.650 --> 00:11.580
<v ->All right.</v>

3
00:11.580 --> 00:13.350
Welcome, everyone.

4
00:13.350 --> 00:17.070
We are here at The Future of Immersive TV.

5
00:17.070 --> 00:19.050
Thanks for joining us.

6
00:19.050 --> 00:21.330
I'm your moderator today, Rick Kowalski,

10
00:31.470 --> 00:36.270
So thanks for joining us and diving into all the great ideas

11
00:36.270 --> 00:38.040
and innovation here this week.

12
00:38.040 --> 00:39.960
Glad to have you here.

13
00:39.960 --> 00:43.470
So today I have a few panelists here.

14
00:43.470 --> 00:46.890
We're gonna talk about some of the emerging TV trends,

15
00:46.890 --> 00:48.150
some of the technologies

16
00:48.150 --> 00:50.610
that are coming up in the next several years,

17
00:50.610 --> 00:53.970
and really, you know, pushing the envelope

18
00:53.970 --> 00:57.630
and figuring out what's gonna make the TV experience

19
00:57.630 --> 00:59.490
more immersive, more engaging.

20
00:59.490 --> 01:03.180
So it's really gonna touch on anything that's, you know,

21
01:03.180 --> 01:06.990
pulling in the consumer in new and exciting ways.

22
01:06.990 --> 01:11.610
So let me introduce my guest here,

23
01:11.610 --> 01:16.560
and I'll start with Matt Brantley from 6P Color,

24
01:16.560 --> 01:19.500
and if you could introduce yourself as I introduce you.

25
01:19.500 --> 01:21.300
<v ->Sure, yeah. So Matt Brantley.</v>

26
01:21.300 --> 01:22.710
Thanks, everyone, for coming out.

27
01:22.710 --> 01:26.580
I'm Chief Technology Officer at 6P Color Incorporated,

28
01:26.580 --> 01:29.640
and we make color management solutions for kind

29
01:29.640 --> 01:31.590
of the new age of consumer media,

30
01:31.590 --> 01:34.470
as well as dipping our toes into industrial

31
01:34.470 --> 01:36.930
and healthcare aerospace applications as well.

32
01:36.930 --> 01:37.800
Thanks for having us.

33
01:37.800 --> 01:41.640
<v ->Great, and Sasha McCune is Vice President</v>

34
01:41.640 --> 01:45.450
of Media Entertainment and Culture at CMB.

35
01:45.450 --> 01:47.040
Tell us a little bit about yourself.

36
01:47.040 --> 01:48.990
<v ->Yeah, thanks so much for having me.</v>

37
01:48.990 --> 01:50.220
I run the media entertainment

38
01:50.220 --> 01:52.230
and culture practice at CMB,

39
01:52.230 --> 01:55.110
a top insights and research consulting company,

40
01:55.110 --> 01:59.820
and that means I'm studying fandom, viewer experiences,

41
01:59.820 --> 02:01.740
the adoption of innovations

42
02:01.740 --> 02:04.020
that are on the show floor here today

43
02:04.020 --> 02:07.860
in consumer marketplace, and have a lot of fun doing it.

44
02:07.860 --> 02:08.693
Thanks for having us.

45
02:08.693 --> 02:13.680
<v ->Great, and to the far right is Dan Mouradian,</v>

46
02:13.680 --> 02:17.190
SVP of Global Client Solutions at Innovid.

47
02:17.190 --> 02:18.840
<v ->Yeah, thank you again for having us.</v>

48
02:18.840 --> 02:21.300
We're really, really happy to be here.

49
02:21.300 --> 02:22.680
My name is Dan Mouradian, I'm the SVP

50
02:22.680 --> 02:25.170
of Global Client Solutions at Innovid, which is a company

51
02:25.170 --> 02:29.610
that enables advertisers to deliver, measure, personalize,

52
02:29.610 --> 02:31.860
and create interactive experiences for the TV,

53
02:31.860 --> 02:35.430
which means I represent the dark side, (laughs)

54
02:35.430 --> 02:37.290
and happy to be here.

55
02:37.290 --> 02:40.830
<v ->So yeah, we've got the light side and the dark side.</v>

56
02:40.830 --> 02:42.653
We've got the technology, we've got the ads (Dan laughs)

57
02:42.653 --> 02:45.210
and marketing, all that, so, yeah.

58
02:45.210 --> 02:50.190
So I think a good way to start this is just to think about,

59
02:50.190 --> 02:52.747
you know, how do you define immersive TV now?

60
02:52.747 --> 02:54.060
You know, we've got a lot

61
02:54.060 --> 02:55.890
of different immersive experiences out there

62
02:55.890 --> 02:59.100
in the world, but when you pull it into the home,

63
02:59.100 --> 03:02.640
and to the consumer, what does that mean to you?

64
03:02.640 --> 03:06.240
And I guess I can start off with Matt here.

65
03:06.240 --> 03:09.090
<v ->So the way that I see immersive TV is anything</v>

66
03:09.090 --> 03:11.580
that allows us to suspend disbelief for where we are,

67
03:11.580 --> 03:14.040
and what we're doing in that exact moment.

68
03:14.040 --> 03:16.620
A lot of it's really personalized to the individual

69
03:16.620 --> 03:18.510
and what they're trying to accomplish with that.

70
03:18.510 --> 03:21.060
But with the amazing technology advancements,

71
03:21.060 --> 03:23.250
and man, some of the stuff we've seen on the floor,

72
03:23.250 --> 03:26.970
it's amazing, just the ability for them

73
03:26.970 --> 03:29.580
to be somewhere, do something

74
03:29.580 --> 03:31.650
that is not physically with them there.

75
03:31.650 --> 03:33.810
That's, I think, to us, immersion,

76
03:33.810 --> 03:36.270
and there's a lot of things to feed into that.

77
03:36.270 --> 03:38.610
<v ->Yeah, that's great. Sasha, how about you?</v>

78
03:38.610 --> 03:40.950
<v ->You know, I always think about the consumer first</v>

79
03:40.950 --> 03:42.600
in a lot of these moments.

80
03:42.600 --> 03:46.980
The future of immersive TV being, how do you bring

81
03:46.980 --> 03:49.710
to their homes, in their everyday lives,

82
03:49.710 --> 03:52.830
experiences that are high quality and immersive,

83
03:52.830 --> 03:54.240
and surround them,

84
03:54.240 --> 03:57.090
and give them that lean back experience

85
03:57.090 --> 03:59.640
that perhaps they used to get in theaters

86
03:59.640 --> 04:01.800
that they're looking to bring into their home,

87
04:01.800 --> 04:05.160
and really engage with content in new ways,

88
04:05.160 --> 04:08.490
whether that's 360 viewing experiences,

89
04:08.490 --> 04:11.100
viewing things on four screens at once,

90
04:11.100 --> 04:13.350
or viewing things across platforms

91
04:13.350 --> 04:15.510
and engaging with many things at once

92
04:15.510 --> 04:17.580
or even, you know, surround sound

93
04:17.580 --> 04:19.260
and kind of bringing things

94
04:19.260 --> 04:21.453
to life in their living room in new ways.

95
04:22.560 --> 04:23.880
<v ->Great, great. And Dan?</v>

96
04:23.880 --> 04:26.220
<v ->Yeah, I mean, as we think about immersive TV</v>

97
04:26.220 --> 04:27.840
from an advertising perspective,

98
04:27.840 --> 04:30.810
I think it's really important to bear in mind

99
04:30.810 --> 04:32.910
what my other two panelists have have mentioned here.

100
04:32.910 --> 04:36.060
And it's about not disrupting the experience

101
04:36.060 --> 04:39.330
that somebody has in that immersive state of mind.

102
04:39.330 --> 04:42.240
So it's about, for the advertising world,

103
04:42.240 --> 04:45.030
immersive TV, I think, is defined

104
04:45.030 --> 04:47.370
as personalized creative.

105
04:47.370 --> 04:48.930
It's interactive creative,

106
04:48.930 --> 04:51.060
it's creative that you can engage with.

107
04:51.060 --> 04:56.060
It's one that allows the consumer to continue to explore

108
04:56.220 --> 05:00.570
and invest in the experiences that they're taking part of.

109
05:00.570 --> 05:03.180
You know, one of the questions that I like to ask,

110
05:03.180 --> 05:07.770
and as it relates to this topic is, how do you all watch TV?

111
05:07.770 --> 05:09.150
And I think as you answer that,

112
05:09.150 --> 05:11.910
and as you survey a room of folks who answer that question,

113
05:11.910 --> 05:14.910
you're gonna find that TV has become, you know,

114
05:14.910 --> 05:17.160
not this sort of laid-back experience.

115
05:17.160 --> 05:19.710
I'm gonna sit down and I'm gonna watch.

116
05:19.710 --> 05:22.200
My 94-year-old grandfather watches Fox News

117
05:22.200 --> 05:24.000
at 7:00 PM every night.

118
05:24.000 --> 05:25.440
That is TV to him,

119
05:25.440 --> 05:30.440
but my 23-year-old daughter, TV is in bed on my phone.

120
05:30.840 --> 05:34.107
And so the definition there is around the content

121
05:34.107 --> 05:35.760
and the type of content that we get.

122
05:35.760 --> 05:38.190
And as that becomes more immersive,

123
05:38.190 --> 05:39.840
you know, it's really critical

124
05:39.840 --> 05:42.000
that we don't disrupt those experiences

125
05:42.000 --> 05:46.290
with ads that are not personalized.

126
05:46.290 --> 05:47.700
People are used to personalized experiences

127
05:47.700 --> 05:50.970
that allow the user to engage, to interact, you know,

128
05:50.970 --> 05:53.430
and that's, I think we don't wanna break things

129
05:53.430 --> 05:55.110
as they're getting better

130
05:55.110 --> 05:57.240
and better and more immersive.

131
05:57.240 --> 05:58.073
<v ->Yeah. And you're right.</v>

132
05:58.073 --> 05:59.910
You know, what we're seeing in consumer behaviors

133
05:59.910 --> 06:01.710
when we go study people's living rooms

134
06:01.710 --> 06:05.160
is no one is watching TV the same way.

135
06:05.160 --> 06:08.340
Everyone's viewing systems, their ecosystems

136
06:08.340 --> 06:10.890
of how they're using all the different platforms,

137
06:10.890 --> 06:12.660
all the different devices to get

138
06:12.660 --> 06:15.450
to the content they wanna watch where they wanna watch it,

139
06:15.450 --> 06:18.420
when they wanna watch it, have become so complicated

140
06:18.420 --> 06:22.140
that you have this intricate web of systems and workarounds

141
06:22.140 --> 06:24.690
and access points that consumers are going through

142
06:24.690 --> 06:26.250
to get to their content.

143
06:26.250 --> 06:27.810
And you know, we've equated it

144
06:27.810 --> 06:29.880
in some recent research we've done

145
06:29.880 --> 06:32.340
as every single consumer out there in the world

146
06:32.340 --> 06:34.650
has this unique snowflake

147
06:34.650 --> 06:36.510
of how they're interacting
(Dan laughs)

148
06:36.510 --> 06:37.530
with their content,

149
06:37.530 --> 06:40.170
and creating a media universe in their home.

150
06:40.170 --> 06:42.360
And a lot of them are going to extreme lengths

151
06:42.360 --> 06:45.000
to create immersive experiences

152
06:45.000 --> 06:48.180
that maybe they're seeing products not delivered to them.

153
06:48.180 --> 06:51.930
You know, one of the most viral gifts I saw trending

154
06:51.930 --> 06:55.650
on TikTok over the Christmas was projectors for bedrooms

155
06:55.650 --> 06:58.410
and little gadgets to make viewing

156
06:58.410 --> 06:59.880
and listening to music

157
06:59.880 --> 07:01.060
more fun in the home.
<v ->Guilty.</v>

158
07:01.060 --> 07:02.022
I bought my 10-year-old

159
07:02.022 --> 07:03.510
daughter a projector.
(Sasha laughs)

160
07:03.510 --> 07:06.570
<v ->I did, I also bought my nephew a projector,</v>

161
07:06.570 --> 07:10.770
and I bought this really cool little sound visualizer

162
07:10.770 --> 07:12.751
that has ferro fluid in it.

163
07:12.751 --> 07:13.584
(Dan laughs)

164
07:13.584 --> 07:14.880
It was definitely influenced,

165
07:14.880 --> 07:18.150
and it became the hot gift of the holiday.

166
07:18.150 --> 07:20.843
All the guys wanted one, why didn't I get one of those?

167
07:20.843 --> 07:23.700
Now I'm like, alright, now I have to go buy five more.

168
07:23.700 --> 07:24.900
<v ->I just have one question.</v>

169
07:24.900 --> 07:26.100
<v ->Yeah.</v>

170
07:26.100 --> 07:28.517
<v ->Were you targeted with a really well placed ad</v>

171
07:28.517 --> 07:31.500
in order to buy that product?
(all laugh)

172
07:31.500 --> 07:34.800
<v ->So speaking of immersive experiences and ads,</v>

173
07:34.800 --> 07:38.130
TikTok Shop is absolutely changing

174
07:38.130 --> 07:40.050
the entire landscape right now.

175
07:40.050 --> 07:41.520
We were joking the other day

176
07:41.520 --> 07:45.150
that TikTok Shop has become the QVC

177
07:45.150 --> 07:46.710
of this generation,
(Dan laughs)

178
07:46.710 --> 07:49.830
and it happened overnight, and it's so interesting

179
07:49.830 --> 07:52.950
and fascinating, but it's also short form content.

180
07:52.950 --> 07:55.080
It's portrait, not landscape.

181
07:55.080 --> 07:56.970
Our TVs and our viewing experiences

182
07:56.970 --> 07:58.260
aren't designed for that.

183
07:58.260 --> 07:59.220
So we were joking,

184
07:59.220 --> 08:02.430
at what point are TVs gonna to shift on their side?

185
08:02.430 --> 08:04.200
Is there gonna be a button to rotate them

186
08:04.200 --> 08:07.027
so you can TikTok Shop on your big screen?

187
08:07.027 --> 08:09.960
You know, we were kind of riffing with that the other day.

188
08:09.960 --> 08:12.030
<v ->Well, I think the immersion,</v>

189
08:12.030 --> 08:14.070
what's interesting is we've known for a long time

190
08:14.070 --> 08:15.750
that the choice in media

191
08:15.750 --> 08:17.640
has always been a personal experience, but now,

192
08:17.640 --> 08:20.520
it's becoming consumers expect choice

193
08:20.520 --> 08:22.560
in how they consume that media.

194
08:22.560 --> 08:25.080
And it's really transcending technology.

195
08:25.080 --> 08:27.060
It's going into, it's a personal experience.

196
08:27.060 --> 08:28.710
Like you were saying, your daughter consuming.

197
08:28.710 --> 08:29.790
Mine do the same thing.

198
08:29.790 --> 08:31.500
It drives me nuts.
(audience laughs)

199
08:31.500 --> 08:34.440
But you know, they're watching TV on their phone

200
08:34.440 --> 08:36.150
with a TV in front of them that's off.

201
08:36.150 --> 08:36.983
<v ->Yes.</v>

202
08:36.983 --> 08:38.130
<v ->And I'm like, that was an expensive TV,</v>

203
08:38.130 --> 08:40.860
why are you watching your phone? "Eh, I can just click it.

204
08:40.860 --> 08:41.910
I don't have to grab a remote."

205
08:41.910 --> 08:43.680
But I mean, to everybody, it's unique.

206
08:43.680 --> 08:45.213
So it's not just the media.

207
08:45.213 --> 08:46.560
It's how they consume it,

208
08:46.560 --> 08:49.230
which is a fascinating kind of new landscape.

209
08:49.230 --> 08:51.660
<v ->And I have this unique purview in my world</v>

210
08:51.660 --> 08:53.820
where I research both the consumer side,

211
08:53.820 --> 08:56.160
but I also get to hear the perspective

212
08:56.160 --> 08:58.710
of traditional media executives.

213
08:58.710 --> 08:59.880
And let me tell you,

214
08:59.880 --> 09:03.330
traditional media executives are so concerned about the fact

215
09:03.330 --> 09:06.600
that their TV shows exist on the television

216
09:06.600 --> 09:08.310
surrounded in a black box.

217
09:08.310 --> 09:11.220
And there's all this other activity happening around it.

218
09:11.220 --> 09:13.980
There's social media while they're watching on the phone.

219
09:13.980 --> 09:17.610
I've watched people juggle three phones to keep up

220
09:17.610 --> 09:20.460
with a conversation while watching a sports game.

221
09:20.460 --> 09:22.950
And the traditional media executives acknowledge

222
09:22.950 --> 09:25.920
that they have not done a good job bridging the gap

223
09:25.920 --> 09:27.900
between what's on the television,

224
09:27.900 --> 09:30.180
the true traditional television,

225
09:30.180 --> 09:33.030
and what's happening in this other universe with devices.

226
09:33.030 --> 09:36.480
So there's a lot of cross-platform device interactivity

227
09:36.480 --> 09:39.270
at play that hasn't really been cracked

228
09:39.270 --> 09:41.490
as a cohesive, immersive experience.

229
09:41.490 --> 09:43.290
<v ->Yeah. Let's talk about that a little bit more.</v>

230
09:43.290 --> 09:44.820
What are the solutions to this?

231
09:44.820 --> 09:46.830
You know, we talked a little bit about fragmentation

232
09:46.830 --> 09:49.560
and kind of the fragmentation of experience.

233
09:49.560 --> 09:51.930
What are some solutions you're seeing to kind

234
09:51.930 --> 09:54.810
of tie all those devices together into something

235
09:54.810 --> 09:56.043
that's more cohesive?

236
09:57.030 --> 09:59.100
<v ->So from a fragmentation perspective,</v>

237
09:59.100 --> 10:01.110
I'll just give a little bit of background.

238
10:01.110 --> 10:03.510
So Innovid, the company that I work for, is an ad server.

239
10:03.510 --> 10:05.400
For those who are unfamiliar with an ad server,

240
10:05.400 --> 10:07.140
we're basically a counter.

241
10:07.140 --> 10:10.680
We deliver the creative ad when the publisher

242
10:10.680 --> 10:14.190
or the platform or the television service calls us

243
10:14.190 --> 10:17.040
and says, "Hey, this advertiser bought media from us.

244
10:17.040 --> 10:19.650
We wanna see an ad, or we need to show an ad."

245
10:19.650 --> 10:21.420
And so whoever has purchased that media

246
10:21.420 --> 10:22.500
will give us their creative,

247
10:22.500 --> 10:23.670
and we'll serve that creative.

248
10:23.670 --> 10:25.683
And we count the whole chain.

249
10:26.640 --> 10:30.693
We deliver about 1.4 billion ads a day.

250
10:31.740 --> 10:34.770
We're one of the largest video ad servers on the planet.

251
10:34.770 --> 10:37.440
We operate in every country.

252
10:37.440 --> 10:41.550
So we have an enormous scale.

253
10:41.550 --> 10:44.670
The company's been in business for about 17 years now.

254
10:44.670 --> 10:47.580
We originally started as an online video ad server,

255
10:47.580 --> 10:48.600
which means, you know,

256
10:48.600 --> 10:50.730
you're scrolling on your mobile device,

257
10:50.730 --> 10:51.840
or this is pre-mobile,

258
10:51.840 --> 10:53.460
you're scrolling on your desktop computer,

259
10:53.460 --> 10:55.350
and you get that pre-roll ad that shows up,

260
10:55.350 --> 10:56.310
and you hit the Skip button.

261
10:56.310 --> 10:57.300
Thanks. You're welcome.

262
10:57.300 --> 10:58.170
That was us.

263
10:58.170 --> 10:59.400
(audience laughs)

264
10:59.400 --> 11:01.050
<v ->Thank you, thank you.</v>
<v ->Yes, thank you, but now,</v>

265
11:01.050 --> 11:02.850
more and more of that is happening on CTV.

266
11:02.850 --> 11:06.063
So again, 1.4 billion ads we deliver every single day.

267
11:06.990 --> 11:10.710
58% of those end up on television screens,

268
11:10.710 --> 11:14.250
what we define as a TV screen in the home.

269
11:14.250 --> 11:17.100
So it's not a laptop, it's not a mobile device,

270
11:17.100 --> 11:18.333
it's not a mobile app.

271
11:19.320 --> 11:20.550
In that group,

272
11:20.550 --> 11:22.890
what we see from a fragmentation perspective

273
11:22.890 --> 11:25.440
is all the different screen sizes, the resolutions,

274
11:26.782 --> 11:28.590
the connection speed

275
11:28.590 --> 11:30.840
of the consumer while they're streaming.

276
11:30.840 --> 11:34.140
We get the publisher, the platform, the device.

277
11:34.140 --> 11:35.640
Are they viewing through a dongle?

278
11:35.640 --> 11:38.970
Like all of the metadata associated with that ad call

279
11:38.970 --> 11:40.440
and delivery is stuff that we warehouse

280
11:40.440 --> 11:42.750
and we look at every single day.

281
11:42.750 --> 11:45.780
And so what we see from a, you know, when we get a piece

282
11:45.780 --> 11:48.780
of creative from an advertiser who has, you know,

283
11:48.780 --> 11:50.730
hired that company, the agency,

284
11:50.730 --> 11:51.870
and they've bought that media

285
11:51.870 --> 11:54.273
because of the target that's there,

286
11:55.350 --> 11:57.630
we receive the asset that's been produced.

287
11:57.630 --> 11:59.820
And what we do is we encode that asset,

288
11:59.820 --> 12:03.270
and we encode that asset over 90 times

289
12:03.270 --> 12:05.880
to satisfy all the different needs

290
12:05.880 --> 12:07.620
of the fragmentation that exists.

291
12:07.620 --> 12:11.190
And I know Matt has an even more interesting perspective

292
12:11.190 --> 12:13.560
on the fragmentation from the production side of things,

293
12:13.560 --> 12:14.490
and Sasha as well.

294
12:14.490 --> 12:18.240
<v ->I cannot imagine, Matt, how you manage color perfection</v>

295
12:18.240 --> 12:20.946
across all these infinite screens.

296
12:20.946 --> 12:21.779
<v ->It's interesting.</v>

297
12:21.779 --> 12:24.810
So as you know, you go back not too long ago,

298
12:24.810 --> 12:26.220
you watched movies in a theater,

299
12:26.220 --> 12:28.620
you watched TV at your home television,

300
12:28.620 --> 12:31.170
your computer was for a certain type of media.

301
12:31.170 --> 12:34.440
The modality of the media were intricately related.

302
12:34.440 --> 12:36.300
And as we're seeing now with the personalization

303
12:36.300 --> 12:38.047
of how people consume media, it's the,

304
12:38.047 --> 12:41.910
"No, I wanna watch the new Disney movie on my phone

305
12:41.910 --> 12:43.620
at the airport," right?

306
12:43.620 --> 12:45.600
Or wherever it's convenient for me.

307
12:45.600 --> 12:46.890
And I do agree with you.

308
12:46.890 --> 12:49.500
Some of the, let's say, more old-school perspectives

309
12:49.500 --> 12:51.543
are definitely not happy about that,

310
12:51.543 --> 12:52.380
(Sasha laughs)
'cause it does introduce

311
12:52.380 --> 12:53.430
new complexities-

312
12:53.430 --> 12:55.080
<v ->Oh, yeah.</v>
<v ->into, just as you</v>

313
12:55.080 --> 12:57.660
were talking about, not only on the ad size,

314
12:57.660 --> 13:00.210
but also just in the general media industry together.

315
13:00.210 --> 13:02.520
And so, you know, what we focus on is, actually,

316
13:02.520 --> 13:04.260
how do you provide the same experience

317
13:04.260 --> 13:06.330
that transcends the technology?

318
13:06.330 --> 13:09.450
'Cause the modality is intricately tied to the type

319
13:09.450 --> 13:11.610
of technology that's used to deliver that.

320
13:11.610 --> 13:15.180
And so our color management systems are directly, you know,

321
13:15.180 --> 13:17.760
that's why we're creating them is to try to address that.

322
13:17.760 --> 13:21.990
And you know, we are addressing one issue in the spectrum

323
13:21.990 --> 13:24.300
of issues that introduces of, you know,

324
13:24.300 --> 13:26.400
people want the same experience,

325
13:26.400 --> 13:28.800
but it's a completely different delivery mechanism,

326
13:28.800 --> 13:30.270
which means that now you have to understand

327
13:30.270 --> 13:32.100
how do I ensure the same experience?

328
13:32.100 --> 13:33.570
So you have to start thinking about things,

329
13:33.570 --> 13:34.620
and this is how we approach it

330
13:34.620 --> 13:36.750
in terms of what is the experience,

331
13:36.750 --> 13:39.360
and then how do we leverage the technology to deliver that?

332
13:39.360 --> 13:42.000
Not let the experience be described

333
13:42.000 --> 13:44.340
by the technology itself.

334
13:44.340 --> 13:46.110
<v ->And on the other side of things,</v>

335
13:46.110 --> 13:49.230
you have big topics changing the landscape,

336
13:49.230 --> 13:50.640
like generative AI.

337
13:50.640 --> 13:51.690
You know, just walking

338
13:51.690 --> 13:53.880
around the show floor here at here at CES,

339
13:53.880 --> 13:55.650
I already see solutions

340
13:55.650 --> 13:58.020
that would make consumers' lives better

341
13:58.020 --> 14:00.180
with integrating all of the crazy things

342
14:00.180 --> 14:01.920
that are trying to manage in their home.

343
14:01.920 --> 14:04.170
Sometimes I am in an interview with someone,

344
14:04.170 --> 14:06.870
and I wish I could just buy them a universal remote

345
14:06.870 --> 14:08.400
and solve all their problems,

346
14:08.400 --> 14:11.040
or tell them they really should replace

347
14:11.040 --> 14:13.740
their $10 20-year-old Roku

348
14:13.740 --> 14:15.900
that is causing all their buffering issues,

349
14:15.900 --> 14:18.060
and maybe use their brand new smart TV

350
14:18.060 --> 14:20.130
instead of bypassing it.

351
14:20.130 --> 14:22.440
There's all these weird things that people are doing.

352
14:22.440 --> 14:27.090
But, you know, thinking about the future of the solutions,

353
14:27.090 --> 14:30.900
newer tech, updating dated technology,

354
14:30.900 --> 14:32.610
so that people have the latest

355
14:32.610 --> 14:34.110
and the greatest in their home,

356
14:34.110 --> 14:36.930
and are inspired to upgrade their technology in their home,

357
14:36.930 --> 14:39.450
so they can have good immersive experiences.

358
14:39.450 --> 14:42.420
And another thing we are seeing here on the show floor

359
14:42.420 --> 14:46.470
is interacting with your television in a completely new way.

360
14:46.470 --> 14:48.060
It's going to be possible now,

361
14:48.060 --> 14:50.700
and in the future, as the tech gets adopted,

362
14:50.700 --> 14:53.280
to have conversations with your TV,

363
14:53.280 --> 14:55.710
to ask your TV for recommendations,

364
14:55.710 --> 14:58.950
and to have a dialogue about what you're in the mood

365
14:58.950 --> 15:01.650
to watch, which is very organic way

366
15:01.650 --> 15:03.210
of interacting with content.

367
15:03.210 --> 15:06.780
And it's not gonna be just play X,

368
15:06.780 --> 15:09.390
and a kind of transactional command.

369
15:09.390 --> 15:10.710
It's gonna be a back and forth

370
15:10.710 --> 15:13.530
and a conversation that people are gonna be able to have.

371
15:13.530 --> 15:14.363
<v ->Yeah, I think,</v>

372
15:14.363 --> 15:16.890
and you mentioned what's gonna inspire them,

373
15:16.890 --> 15:18.600
and you know, I can definitely see that.

374
15:18.600 --> 15:21.840
Are there other things we can do for consumers to kind

375
15:21.840 --> 15:23.310
of inspire them to engage in that way

376
15:23.310 --> 15:26.280
or raise awareness of some of the experiences?

377
15:26.280 --> 15:29.220
'Cause I think, Dan, you might have brought it up

378
15:29.220 --> 15:31.020
when we talked before about, you know,

379
15:31.020 --> 15:34.620
consumers just not really being aware of all the stuff

380
15:34.620 --> 15:37.800
that TVs can do and all the experiences they can have.

381
15:37.800 --> 15:40.140
<v ->Yeah, so I mean, consumers have certainly chosen</v>

382
15:40.140 --> 15:41.760
how they wanna watch TV,

383
15:41.760 --> 15:43.410
and that's one of the things that we've seen

384
15:43.410 --> 15:45.900
with the shift from linear viewership,

385
15:45.900 --> 15:49.290
like the average age of a linear viewer is 65 years old.

386
15:49.290 --> 15:51.393
The average American is 39 years old.

387
15:52.230 --> 15:55.200
We've seen this shift to I know how to get

388
15:55.200 --> 15:56.670
what I want when I wanna watch it.

389
15:56.670 --> 15:58.590
And that's through connected televisions,

390
15:58.590 --> 16:01.140
or you know, apps that are connected to television,

391
16:01.140 --> 16:03.990
like apps on phones and desktops.

392
16:03.990 --> 16:06.570
And with connected television, by connecting the TV

393
16:06.570 --> 16:08.850
to the internet, you unlock a whole new set

394
16:08.850 --> 16:10.260
of capabilities that,

395
16:10.260 --> 16:12.000
at least in the digital advertising space,

396
16:12.000 --> 16:13.740
we have been doing for decades now,

397
16:13.740 --> 16:15.450
personalization, you know,

398
16:15.450 --> 16:17.730
taking a signal that we get on an ad call,

399
16:17.730 --> 16:19.080
like an IP address,

400
16:19.080 --> 16:21.060
or that tells us the location,

401
16:21.060 --> 16:23.400
that can tell us the weather outside,

402
16:23.400 --> 16:26.430
or if somebody's streaming on a service like Disney.

403
16:26.430 --> 16:27.480
I don't know if anybody made it

404
16:27.480 --> 16:29.340
to the Cosmo a couple days ago,

405
16:29.340 --> 16:32.490
but Disney made an announcement with us in partnership

406
16:32.490 --> 16:35.040
where we were enabling a contextual targeting product

407
16:35.040 --> 16:36.690
they call Disney Magic Words.

408
16:36.690 --> 16:40.110
So an advertiser can buy context and mood,

409
16:40.110 --> 16:42.180
and then we can deliver an experience

410
16:42.180 --> 16:44.850
or an ad that relates back to that signal.

411
16:44.850 --> 16:46.230
Mechanically, we've been able to do this

412
16:46.230 --> 16:47.580
for a really long time.

413
16:47.580 --> 16:49.170
It also introduces interactivity,

414
16:49.170 --> 16:52.200
and, you know, interactive formats do perform better

415
16:52.200 --> 16:54.030
in an ad space than standard,

416
16:54.030 --> 16:56.580
you know, sort of delivered ads.

417
16:56.580 --> 16:57.900
But there is that, you know,

418
16:57.900 --> 17:00.390
just like the consumer has chosen how they wanna watch TV,

419
17:00.390 --> 17:02.610
and that's very clearly ad supported,

420
17:02.610 --> 17:04.575
connected television, hi.

421
17:04.575 --> 17:07.200
(all laugh)

422
17:07.200 --> 17:08.370
They're also learning,

423
17:08.370 --> 17:12.360
and every new thing that comes out, whether it's voice,

424
17:12.360 --> 17:14.370
you know, consumers are still learning how to interact

425
17:14.370 --> 17:16.500
with TVs through voice remotes,

426
17:16.500 --> 17:17.850
like that's relatively new,

427
17:17.850 --> 17:20.160
even though televisions have been able to do that

428
17:20.160 --> 17:22.200
for the last five, six years.

429
17:22.200 --> 17:25.530
Look at the QR code, you know, 10 years ago,

430
17:25.530 --> 17:27.540
you had to have a special app,

431
17:27.540 --> 17:30.150
and you had to enable permissions to scan it.

432
17:30.150 --> 17:31.020
And no one did.

433
17:31.020 --> 17:32.588
No one did it,

434
17:32.588 --> 17:36.480
(laughs) despite how many ads had QR codes a decade ago.

435
17:36.480 --> 17:39.270
Now we've got QR codes that can add things straight

436
17:39.270 --> 17:41.703
to your target.com shopping cart.

437
17:43.080 --> 17:45.690
Buying things on TV is another one of those,

438
17:45.690 --> 17:49.470
like shoppable TV is one of those new technologies

439
17:49.470 --> 17:52.770
that we're starting to see the market introduce,

440
17:52.770 --> 17:55.350
and what's gonna, you know, again,

441
17:55.350 --> 17:58.440
we're still very much in these like consumer adoption curves

442
17:58.440 --> 18:02.430
of early adopters, early majorities, late majorities,

443
18:02.430 --> 18:03.660
depending on the tech.

444
18:03.660 --> 18:07.170
And I just think it's a wide open place.

445
18:07.170 --> 18:08.340
Forget about the ads,

446
18:08.340 --> 18:11.820
but like, when you start thinking about how people interact

447
18:11.820 --> 18:14.010
with their own devices,

448
18:14.010 --> 18:15.600
advertisers are gonna glom onto that,

449
18:15.600 --> 18:17.400
and they're gonna figure out how to use that in an ad

450
18:17.400 --> 18:18.360
so that they can, you know,

451
18:18.360 --> 18:20.460
capitalize on the way people are engaging.

452
18:20.460 --> 18:23.580
But you know, that, to me, is the exciting thing,

453
18:23.580 --> 18:26.460
like having a conversation in my room organically

454
18:26.460 --> 18:29.490
about what I wanna watch, and then it just starts playing.

455
18:29.490 --> 18:31.590
That sounds delightful. (laughs)

456
18:31.590 --> 18:32.940
<v ->You mentioned the adoption curve,</v>

457
18:32.940 --> 18:35.940
and I think that's something to really pay attention to

458
18:35.940 --> 18:38.940
of all of these technologies as they evolve and grow.

459
18:38.940 --> 18:42.150
We need to keep a really close eye on the adoption

460
18:42.150 --> 18:45.780
when it's tipping over to what we call, at CMB,

461
18:45.780 --> 18:47.580
a chasm-crossing moment.

462
18:47.580 --> 18:50.040
And we did a study this a few months ago

463
18:50.040 --> 18:53.550
on the consumer adoption of generative AI,

464
18:53.550 --> 18:57.840
and we found that we were very, very close

465
18:57.840 --> 19:02.760
to overtaking smart speakers in adoption of generative AI.

466
19:02.760 --> 19:05.640
So we're at 36% adoption

467
19:05.640 --> 19:07.980
of generative AI features in the gen pop,

468
19:07.980 --> 19:11.520
and 52% with media and tech workers alone.

469
19:11.520 --> 19:13.740
So you see how big that jumps

470
19:13.740 --> 19:15.090
when you just zoom in on people

471
19:15.090 --> 19:16.740
who work in the industry.

472
19:16.740 --> 19:21.210
And then we looked at, smart speakers are at 51% penetration

473
19:21.210 --> 19:24.390
and adoption within the US, so that tells you

474
19:24.390 --> 19:28.320
we're already fast approaching that milestone.

475
19:28.320 --> 19:29.970
And then for context,

476
19:29.970 --> 19:33.900
I think we also measured the adoption of AR and VR,

477
19:33.900 --> 19:35.610
which has also been in market,

478
19:35.610 --> 19:36.660
and that was in the 20s.

479
19:36.660 --> 19:37.770
<v ->29.</v>

480
19:37.770 --> 19:38.730
<v ->The low percent.</v>

481
19:38.730 --> 19:42.000
So we're already surpassed wit that one.

482
19:42.000 --> 19:43.590
And we're seeing that happen,

483
19:43.590 --> 19:47.610
because there's so much more democratized access

484
19:47.610 --> 19:48.810
to these features.

485
19:48.810 --> 19:52.230
There's use cases that go beyond a niche space.

486
19:52.230 --> 19:54.060
And in the TV space,

487
19:54.060 --> 19:56.010
you're gonna have people in sports

488
19:56.010 --> 19:59.970
and gaming really adopt these things at an even higher rate,

489
19:59.970 --> 20:01.020
and pressure test them

490
20:01.020 --> 20:02.730
and bring them into their living rooms and homes,

491
20:02.730 --> 20:05.040
because they're really, really hungry

492
20:05.040 --> 20:08.340
for customizing their media setups in their space.

493
20:08.340 --> 20:09.570
<v ->And I take no credit for this,</v>

494
20:09.570 --> 20:10.709
'cause this was your research,

495
20:10.709 --> 20:11.542
(Sasha laughs)
but I just found

496
20:11.542 --> 20:12.780
it so fascinating.

497
20:12.780 --> 20:16.320
You know, Sasha did some research a while ago about,

498
20:16.320 --> 20:17.340
you know, and one of the questions

499
20:17.340 --> 20:18.720
in her research thesis was,

500
20:18.720 --> 20:20.760
would you ever buy something on your phone?

501
20:20.760 --> 20:23.710
And how many people would've said yes to that a decade ago?

502
20:24.600 --> 20:26.881
I bought stuff on my phone like this morning,

503
20:26.881 --> 20:27.750
(all laugh)

504
20:27.750 --> 20:32.010
on my way over here in a cab, like it's everywhere.

505
20:32.010 --> 20:33.030
<v ->Six months ago, a year ago,</v>

506
20:33.030 --> 20:35.250
how many of you would've bought something on TikTok Shop?

507
20:35.250 --> 20:36.150
TikTok Shop.

508
20:36.150 --> 20:38.340
Now it's growing and going really crazy.

509
20:38.340 --> 20:40.320
So yeah, it evolves all the time.

510
20:40.320 --> 20:44.400
So now how many people would buy something on your TV

511
20:44.400 --> 20:47.490
by scanning a QR code straight from your streaming app?

512
20:47.490 --> 20:48.750
It's going to be happening.

513
20:48.750 --> 20:52.110
It's going to kind of inch its way into the zeitgeist.

514
20:52.110 --> 20:54.450
<v ->So I think a thing that adds to the complexity</v>

515
20:54.450 --> 20:57.630
that this introduces is, you know, one of the things

516
20:57.630 --> 21:01.230
that I find fascinating kind of in nature that we are in is,

517
21:01.230 --> 21:03.450
you know, as advertising is starting

518
21:03.450 --> 21:05.520
to transcend specific types of media as well,

519
21:05.520 --> 21:07.380
and non-linear television as well.

520
21:07.380 --> 21:09.900
And you've got some things that are even, you know,

521
21:09.900 --> 21:12.298
a little bit of generative going into the ad itself.

522
21:12.298 --> 21:13.290
<v ->Oh yeah.</v>

523
21:13.290 --> 21:16.111
<v ->I've seen a few cameos from my favorite TV shows</v>

524
21:16.111 --> 21:16.944
(panel members laugh)
telling me I

525
21:16.944 --> 21:19.800
should buy something, but you know, for brand managers-

526
21:19.800 --> 21:20.820
<v ->You're welcome.</v>

527
21:20.820 --> 21:22.470
<v ->Yeah, yeah, it was fun.</v>

528
21:22.470 --> 21:24.900
It was very personal, very immersive.

529
21:24.900 --> 21:27.630
But you know, I'm fascinated in how,

530
21:27.630 --> 21:30.570
for you guys as you're delivering that,

531
21:30.570 --> 21:32.670
how do you maintain brand standards as you're starting

532
21:32.670 --> 21:35.280
to get content that is going to, you know,

533
21:35.280 --> 21:36.480
they don't know where it's gonna end up.

534
21:36.480 --> 21:37.740
They don't know if that's gonna be able

535
21:37.740 --> 21:40.500
to show the right brand colors.

536
21:40.500 --> 21:44.250
<v ->Yeah, I think this is a problem regardless of brand</v>

537
21:44.250 --> 21:48.570
is the state of fragmentation is a little unhinged,

538
21:48.570 --> 21:50.460
and it's also not getting better,

539
21:50.460 --> 21:53.340
and it's just going to get more fragmented.

540
21:53.340 --> 21:55.830
And that leaves everyone in this room

541
21:55.830 --> 21:58.590
and everyone at CES, the people that work on products,

542
21:58.590 --> 22:02.250
and technology, and the intersection of these experiences,

543
22:02.250 --> 22:04.530
it means we're constantly designing

544
22:04.530 --> 22:07.110
for infinite potential option.

545
22:07.110 --> 22:08.550
Allocate, maybe.
<v ->Absolutely, absolutely.</v>

546
22:08.550 --> 22:10.320
<v ->And it drives all of us nuts</v>

547
22:10.320 --> 22:11.880
all the time, I'm sure.
(Dan laughs)

548
22:11.880 --> 22:14.220
And unfortunately I don't see a path

549
22:14.220 --> 22:15.630
where that changes to you.

550
22:15.630 --> 22:16.463
<v ->No.</v>

551
22:16.463 --> 22:18.129
(Sasha laughs) We might as well accept it.

552
22:18.129 --> 22:19.320
<v ->I know.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

553
22:19.320 --> 22:20.880
The interesting thing about the fragmentation

554
22:20.880 --> 22:22.380
is when you look at the sort of companies

555
22:22.380 --> 22:24.870
that are driving some of this, like, you know,

556
22:24.870 --> 22:26.370
legally there's not a whole lot of merger

557
22:26.370 --> 22:28.950
and acquisition that's gonna happen on that chart.

558
22:28.950 --> 22:32.040
So, you know, the fragmentation is very, very well

559
22:32.040 --> 22:33.660
and truly clearly here to stay.

560
22:33.660 --> 22:35.310
We look at our delivery data,

561
22:35.310 --> 22:37.830
it's like over a dozen different companies,

562
22:37.830 --> 22:39.630
and they're the Amazons of the world.

563
22:39.630 --> 22:43.260
They're the, you know, Facebooks, YouTubes, Google,

564
22:43.260 --> 22:47.880
like Samsung, Roku, Hulu, those are the top platforms

565
22:47.880 --> 22:49.320
that we're delivering into.

566
22:49.320 --> 22:53.067
And you're just not gonna, you won't see the, you know,

567
22:53.067 --> 22:56.220
the acquisition space begin to collapse that.

568
22:56.220 --> 22:59.130
When you look at like the last two revolutions

569
22:59.130 --> 23:01.020
that we've had from a consumer perspective,

570
23:01.020 --> 23:02.760
whether that's the mobile revolution

571
23:02.760 --> 23:05.970
or the personal computer revolution

572
23:05.970 --> 23:09.000
before that, the winners in those spaces were the owners

573
23:09.000 --> 23:10.770
of the operating systems.

574
23:10.770 --> 23:13.380
And that's the, you know, with the PC,

575
23:13.380 --> 23:15.180
it was very clearly Windows.

576
23:15.180 --> 23:17.880
And then with mobile it was Apple, and Google,

577
23:17.880 --> 23:21.630
and now in the TV space, the operating system manufacturers,

578
23:21.630 --> 23:23.310
I mean, we were joking backstage about it,

579
23:23.310 --> 23:27.180
but like, that's why the fragmentation isn't going anywhere

580
23:27.180 --> 23:30.390
because the OS makers know that that's the key

581
23:30.390 --> 23:32.460
to the whole puzzle.

582
23:32.460 --> 23:36.570
And again, you just won't see it from an M&amp;A perspective.

583
23:36.570 --> 23:40.620
<v ->And also, the other problem is that consumers almost ask</v>

584
23:40.620 --> 23:41.547
for the fragmentation,

585
23:41.547 --> 23:42.380
(panel members laugh)

586
23:42.380 --> 23:45.300
because they want infinite choice.

587
23:45.300 --> 23:48.150
And that infinite choice just adds the complexity.

588
23:48.150 --> 23:51.450
We joked, I had a participant in a study recently,

589
23:51.450 --> 23:54.120
and he had advocated for fragmentation.

590
23:54.120 --> 23:56.520
He couldn't imagine one app serving his needs,

591
23:56.520 --> 23:58.800
and he was kind of like leaning into it.

592
23:58.800 --> 24:01.350
But at the same time he had so many blind spots

593
24:01.350 --> 24:05.040
about what fragmentation was doing to him as a consumer

594
24:05.040 --> 24:07.950
that he actually was paying for Paramount twice,

595
24:07.950 --> 24:10.890
because he subscribed to it through Amazon,

596
24:10.890 --> 24:13.590
and then bought another standalone subscription

597
24:13.590 --> 24:16.590
to access it through his app, and he had no idea.

598
24:16.590 --> 24:18.577
And being a researcher, you just have to be like,

599
24:18.577 --> 24:20.256
"I am not gonna tell him."

600
24:20.256 --> 24:21.089
(panel members laugh)

601
24:21.089 --> 24:23.223
You can't intervene. This is his world.

602
24:23.223 --> 24:24.810
<v ->I think that, you know,</v>

603
24:24.810 --> 24:26.340
just talking about fragmentation there,

604
24:26.340 --> 24:27.930
but you know, it doesn't help

605
24:27.930 --> 24:29.610
that the consumer technology industry

606
24:29.610 --> 24:31.770
keeps adding more screens on everything.

607
24:31.770 --> 24:33.310
You've got it on your fridge now,

608
24:33.310 --> 24:35.520
and you know, I've seen wearable, essentially-

609
24:35.520 --> 24:36.353
<v Sasha>Glasses?</v>

610
24:36.353 --> 24:37.490
<v ->Wearable displays.</v>

611
24:37.490 --> 24:38.850
So now you know,

612
24:38.850 --> 24:41.490
are all your screens just gonna live on your face,

613
24:41.490 --> 24:42.630
you know, (laughs)

614
24:42.630 --> 24:44.220
and what do you do in that environment?

615
24:44.220 --> 24:47.280
So, you know, it's certainly changing.

616
24:47.280 --> 24:48.900
Are there any other, you know,

617
24:48.900 --> 24:51.360
screen technologies you're seeing on the show floor

618
24:51.360 --> 24:53.700
that you think are especially immersive,

619
24:53.700 --> 24:56.400
or that will will change things in years ahead?

620
24:56.400 --> 24:58.470
<v ->I mean, we've been talking a lot about the home,</v>

621
24:58.470 --> 25:01.320
but walking the CES floor, what's really cool

622
25:01.320 --> 25:04.320
is you see how screens can be transformed

623
25:04.320 --> 25:05.970
to be floors and walls,

624
25:05.970 --> 25:10.620
and create spaces and be the boundaries of a space.

625
25:10.620 --> 25:12.450
That's a really cool thing to think about.

626
25:12.450 --> 25:15.180
And I also look to the sphere here,

627
25:15.180 --> 25:18.090
and I wonder how far are we from a future

628
25:18.090 --> 25:22.710
where consumers can recreate an experience like the sphere

629
25:22.710 --> 25:25.140
in their own space, and have that be a part

630
25:25.140 --> 25:27.420
of their own entertainment experience,

631
25:27.420 --> 25:30.090
or be an experience they seek out locally.

632
25:30.090 --> 25:32.250
It's gonna really start to change the standards

633
25:32.250 --> 25:34.350
for what quality is.

634
25:34.350 --> 25:38.850
And there might be more of a surround visual experience

635
25:38.850 --> 25:40.410
that people are looking for

636
25:40.410 --> 25:42.660
to mirror the surround sound era.

637
25:42.660 --> 25:45.750
<v ->Well, if you think about what does that enable, right?</v>

638
25:45.750 --> 25:46.920
I mean, in a perfect world,

639
25:46.920 --> 25:48.810
you could take any surface anywhere,

640
25:48.810 --> 25:50.100
and you could make that surface

641
25:50.100 --> 25:52.500
into anything you wanted it to be.

642
25:52.500 --> 25:54.030
You know, I mean, we still have a lot

643
25:54.030 --> 25:56.400
of perspectives going back to the days of, oh yeah,

644
25:56.400 --> 25:58.050
a screen is a big discreet thing,

645
25:58.050 --> 26:00.480
and it lives in its own little spot,

646
26:00.480 --> 26:02.370
and then you bring the people to the screen.

647
26:02.370 --> 26:03.630
But you know, in a perfect world,

648
26:03.630 --> 26:04.740
especially for advertisers,

649
26:04.740 --> 26:07.200
like if you could push an ad in front of me anywhere,

650
26:07.200 --> 26:08.033
right?
(Sasha laughs)

651
26:08.033 --> 26:08.866
<v ->I will.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

652
26:08.866 --> 26:09.699
<v ->You will.</v>

653
26:09.699 --> 26:11.670
<v ->Is it gonna have a skip button</v>

654
26:11.670 --> 26:13.290
when it's projected on my ceiling?

655
26:13.290 --> 26:14.310
<v ->Right? Yeah.</v>

656
26:14.310 --> 26:15.150
<v ->Exactly.</v>

657
26:15.150 --> 26:16.290
<v ->So we're even seeing with some</v>

658
26:16.290 --> 26:18.180
of like the immersive like art galleries

659
26:18.180 --> 26:21.060
and things like that, 'cause now that screens no longer have

660
26:21.060 --> 26:22.620
to look like a screen.

661
26:22.620 --> 26:24.240
Right, I mean, there's some stuff on the show form,

662
26:24.240 --> 26:25.650
especially with like displays,

663
26:25.650 --> 26:28.083
that are meant to look like printed artwork.

664
26:29.070 --> 26:31.590
You know, the more canvas that we can give

665
26:31.590 --> 26:34.350
to the advertiser, we can give to the creative that's trying

666
26:34.350 --> 26:35.700
to create an immersive experience

667
26:35.700 --> 26:38.220
or we can just make it look, I saw some amazing things,

668
26:38.220 --> 26:39.720
one physically moving tiles,

669
26:39.720 --> 26:42.690
and then one booth over, there's an emulation

670
26:42.690 --> 26:46.350
of a physically moving tile, that similar effect.

671
26:46.350 --> 26:47.940
So I think what it is,

672
26:47.940 --> 26:51.360
it's really about just increasing the visual canvas

673
26:51.360 --> 26:56.360
to relay experience, relay data to that user.

674
26:56.370 --> 26:58.350
I mean, imagine a world where you're late for a flight,

675
26:58.350 --> 26:59.850
and then you're running down the hallway

676
26:59.850 --> 27:02.370
and then you're like this way, now turn this way,

677
27:02.370 --> 27:04.200
and it's just popping up in front of you.

678
27:04.200 --> 27:06.450
But that is now. That's available now.

679
27:06.450 --> 27:08.520
So I think that's why we're seeing it

680
27:08.520 --> 27:10.830
is because it's a tool that we can use

681
27:10.830 --> 27:12.930
to accomplish an infinite number of jobs.

682
27:12.930 --> 27:14.610
<v ->And we don't even need the screen now,</v>

683
27:14.610 --> 27:16.320
because we have holographic images.

684
27:16.320 --> 27:19.230
So I was trying to meet up with a friend yesterday,

685
27:19.230 --> 27:21.330
walking through, navigating the halls,

686
27:21.330 --> 27:22.860
and he said, "I'm by the holograph."

687
27:22.860 --> 27:25.410
And I was like, "We're at CES."

688
27:25.410 --> 27:28.950
It's really not that helpful anymore. But they're real now.

689
27:28.950 --> 27:30.300
They're very vivid,

690
27:30.300 --> 27:33.300
and it's really cool to think about 10 years ago,

691
27:33.300 --> 27:35.820
not really thinking that would be accessible.

692
27:35.820 --> 27:38.820
<v ->Yeah, so I was gonna bring up, you know,</v>

693
27:38.820 --> 27:41.490
looking five, 10 years out now,

694
27:41.490 --> 27:44.160
and thinking about, you know, where things are headed,

695
27:44.160 --> 27:46.410
and we talk about, you know, some of the, you know,

696
27:46.410 --> 27:48.690
trying to tackle some of these fragmentation issues.

697
27:48.690 --> 27:51.090
But, you know, thinking five, 10 years out,

698
27:51.090 --> 27:54.450
what does immersive TV look like?

699
27:54.450 --> 27:57.750
<v ->So again, I don't think it's any surprise,</v>

700
27:57.750 --> 28:02.550
the largest television event in the year is the Super Bowl.

701
28:02.550 --> 28:03.810
We all talk about the Super Bowl.

702
28:03.810 --> 28:06.840
It had 127 million viewers this year,

703
28:06.840 --> 28:08.910
if memory serves me correctly,

704
28:08.910 --> 28:13.470
of the top 100 television broadcasts this year,

705
28:13.470 --> 28:16.179
98 of them were NFL.

706
28:16.179 --> 28:19.050
(laughs) So we wanna think about the future of TV.

707
28:19.050 --> 28:21.960
The Super Bowl rights expire in 2029.

708
28:21.960 --> 28:22.793
Do you think?

709
28:22.793 --> 28:24.960
You're the NFL, do you think you start negotiating

710
28:24.960 --> 28:26.400
with traditional media companies,

711
28:26.400 --> 28:28.950
or do you go to people like Facebook, and Amazon,

712
28:28.950 --> 28:31.890
and Disney, and folks like that to figure out

713
28:31.890 --> 28:33.630
what those experiences look like?

714
28:33.630 --> 28:35.910
Amazon two years ago took a loss leader,

715
28:35.910 --> 28:37.890
and created Thursday Night Football.

716
28:37.890 --> 28:41.010
They created a brand new football viewing event

717
28:41.010 --> 28:43.140
and had to educate the market on,

718
28:43.140 --> 28:46.530
you can watch football on Amazon on Thursday night.

719
28:46.530 --> 28:49.170
And they did so at the entirety of their homepage

720
28:49.170 --> 28:51.540
for weeks on end, but now-

721
28:51.540 --> 28:52.373
<v ->Still doing it.</v>

722
28:52.373 --> 28:54.180
(Sasha laughs)
<v ->Yeah, still, but now,</v>

723
28:54.180 --> 28:56.970
that is a regular viewing event

724
28:56.970 --> 28:58.980
for consumers who enjoy football.

725
28:58.980 --> 29:02.760
So I think there's some really exciting things

726
29:02.760 --> 29:06.780
around live sports delivery and immersive TV.

727
29:06.780 --> 29:08.520
I mean, how cool would it be, like AR,

728
29:08.520 --> 29:12.270
to your point, like 29% adoption rate

729
29:12.270 --> 29:14.760
in the United States right now in terms of households

730
29:14.760 --> 29:16.320
that have AR devices in them.

731
29:16.320 --> 29:18.750
How cool would it be to like plop an Oculus camera

732
29:18.750 --> 29:20.940
on the 50-yard line of the Super Bowl,

733
29:20.940 --> 29:23.940
and then stick, I've never put one on my face before.

734
29:23.940 --> 29:24.773
I would put it on

735
29:24.773 --> 29:26.610
to watch the Super Bowl from the 50-yard line,

736
29:26.610 --> 29:30.120
'cause that's a experience that I will never have in life.

737
29:30.120 --> 29:31.920
But if the cameras are good enough,

738
29:31.920 --> 29:33.210
and the color is good enough,

739
29:33.210 --> 29:34.530
and the screens are good enough,

740
29:34.530 --> 29:37.500
and I can suspend disbelief for long enough,

741
29:37.500 --> 29:39.990
now I'm sitting, you know, court side at the Knicks,

742
29:39.990 --> 29:43.650
or I'm sitting, you know, a 50-yard line at the Super Bowl,

743
29:43.650 --> 29:44.790
and why do I have to be static?

744
29:44.790 --> 29:46.740
Why can't I just get on the field with them?

745
29:46.740 --> 29:49.920
Like, those are other things that like become new

746
29:49.920 --> 29:51.660
and like multi-screen viewing,

747
29:51.660 --> 29:54.480
and there's just, I think it's so bright

748
29:54.480 --> 29:55.313
when you start thinking

749
29:55.313 --> 29:57.270
about what immersive TV can look like.

750
29:57.270 --> 30:00.930
And I think we'll see that inflection point as some

751
30:00.930 --> 30:04.890
of these big media bastions start thinking the same way we

752
30:04.890 --> 30:06.330
are all talking today.

753
30:06.330 --> 30:07.410
<v ->And I also think we heard a lot</v>

754
30:07.410 --> 30:09.990
about personalization in your future,

755
30:09.990 --> 30:12.300
which I'm now gonna jump on and build on.

756
30:12.300 --> 30:15.210
We already see fans, sports fans wanting

757
30:15.210 --> 30:17.580
to customize their sports experiences.

758
30:17.580 --> 30:21.300
They will curate four games on a screen, mute all of them,

759
30:21.300 --> 30:25.320
and pull in their own commentary from radio

760
30:25.320 --> 30:28.140
to make their experience their own.

761
30:28.140 --> 30:30.090
And we can imagine a world

762
30:30.090 --> 30:33.390
where they're doing that within new ecosystems

763
30:33.390 --> 30:36.465
that they're creating their ideal fan experience,

764
30:36.465 --> 30:38.190
so they can access all

765
30:38.190 --> 30:39.840
of the content they want at once,

766
30:39.840 --> 30:42.113
instead of having to choose A or B.

767
30:42.113 --> 30:45.600
<v ->I think the, and I call it the tapas approach</v>

768
30:45.600 --> 30:46.433
to media consumption.

769
30:46.433 --> 30:47.266
<v ->Tapas.</v>

770
30:47.266 --> 30:48.200
(all laugh)

771
30:48.200 --> 30:50.310
<v ->We also talk about is as an all-you-can-eat buffet.</v>

772
30:50.310 --> 30:51.143
<v ->There you go.</v>

773
30:51.990 --> 30:54.442
I think it's been an interesting thing seeing with,

774
30:54.442 --> 30:57.120
you know, like the six second of stimuli that's become,

775
30:57.120 --> 30:58.950
you know, for Gen Alpha,

776
30:58.950 --> 31:02.550
almost the only way that they can consume anything anymore.

777
31:02.550 --> 31:04.320
But it's becoming very much a rapid fire.

778
31:04.320 --> 31:06.300
I'm looking for a specific type of stimuli.

779
31:06.300 --> 31:07.500
I can't describe it,

780
31:07.500 --> 31:09.720
so I'm just gonna scroll till I find it.

781
31:09.720 --> 31:11.160
But I think the big thing, you know,

782
31:11.160 --> 31:13.170
if we wanna look out 2030, I think

783
31:13.170 --> 31:17.100
that the generative experience is gonna be a key in there.

784
31:17.100 --> 31:20.550
And I will say, you know, I've been in the Sora betas

785
31:20.550 --> 31:21.780
and stuff like that, and it's great.

786
31:21.780 --> 31:22.680
It's amazing technology.

787
31:22.680 --> 31:25.530
It's not there yet, but it is in our future

788
31:25.530 --> 31:28.680
that it's gonna be, I wanna watch a episode of "Seinfeld,"

789
31:28.680 --> 31:30.510
and this is the script I wanna watch it in.

790
31:30.510 --> 31:31.530
And it's possible.

791
31:31.530 --> 31:33.270
<v ->And you know, that's an interesting point</v>

792
31:33.270 --> 31:35.070
when you start talking about generative AI

793
31:35.070 --> 31:36.090
is there's, you know,

794
31:36.090 --> 31:37.800
we all talk about it from a creative lens,

795
31:37.800 --> 31:42.800
creative perspective, generative AI is really, really good

796
31:43.020 --> 31:46.620
at democratization and inclusion.

797
31:46.620 --> 31:49.620
You know, no affiliation here,

798
31:49.620 --> 31:51.570
but there's a platform called HeyGen.ai.

799
31:51.570 --> 31:52.560
You can record a video

800
31:52.560 --> 31:54.630
of yourself in your own natural language,

801
31:54.630 --> 31:56.430
and it will translate it to any language,

802
31:56.430 --> 31:57.510
and it will re-dub your lips

803
31:57.510 --> 31:59.400
to make it look like you're a natural speaker.

804
31:59.400 --> 32:02.100
It's wild. It does it in seconds.

805
32:02.100 --> 32:04.320
Imagine like, to your point, I wanna watch "Seinfeld,"

806
32:04.320 --> 32:06.693
but I am a native Russian speaker.

807
32:07.560 --> 32:09.630
Fine, now I can watch "Seinfeld" all in Russian

808
32:09.630 --> 32:11.790
and it doesn't look weird, and it doesn't feel weird.

809
32:11.790 --> 32:13.290
And it allows me to like connect

810
32:13.290 --> 32:15.480
with that content just a little bit more,

811
32:15.480 --> 32:17.730
'cause it's not the traditional like dubbing

812
32:17.730 --> 32:20.910
that you're used to seeing, or live subtitles.

813
32:20.910 --> 32:23.970
Kids just watch subtitles.

814
32:23.970 --> 32:25.110
Maybe it's TikTok,

815
32:25.110 --> 32:29.580
and they're used to seeing captions go along

816
32:29.580 --> 32:30.900
with the content they're reading.

817
32:30.900 --> 32:35.190
But when you are with someone from Gen A or Gen Z

818
32:35.190 --> 32:38.809
or even now Gen B, I guess we're in as of officially 2025.

819
32:38.809 --> 32:41.700
<v ->Betas, oh, yes, are the next gen.</v>

820
32:41.700 --> 32:43.650
<v ->Any kid who's been born in the last eight days</v>

821
32:43.650 --> 32:45.360
is now officially Gen B.

822
32:45.360 --> 32:50.250
But you know, they're watching screens with captions on,

823
32:50.250 --> 32:51.870
which originally was something that we did

824
32:51.870 --> 32:53.880
from like an ADA compliance perspective,

825
32:53.880 --> 32:55.410
like we gotta have it so that people

826
32:55.410 --> 32:58.470
who have difficulty hearing

827
32:58.470 --> 33:00.300
or able to still have the content,

828
33:00.300 --> 33:01.740
but now they're just doing it as a part

829
33:01.740 --> 33:02.790
of like reading through.

830
33:02.790 --> 33:04.812
I'm being captioned right now

831
33:04.812 --> 33:06.471
as we speak live.
<v ->Oh my gosh.</v>

832
33:06.471 --> 33:07.304
And you know,

833
33:07.304 --> 33:09.960
it's really just because we become too distracted.

834
33:09.960 --> 33:13.603
And we lose track. And that's really interesting.

835
33:13.603 --> 33:16.290
And to your point, we're also gonna probably see

836
33:16.290 --> 33:18.990
some convergence of the creator economy

837
33:18.990 --> 33:22.080
and short form content with traditional media,

838
33:22.080 --> 33:25.200
because these worlds are so separate right now,

839
33:25.200 --> 33:28.080
but they're all talking about the same content.

840
33:28.080 --> 33:31.620
They're all involved in the same social conversation,

841
33:31.620 --> 33:34.650
and people wanna flip back and forth from these short

842
33:34.650 --> 33:36.120
and long form engagements

843
33:36.120 --> 33:38.550
from these landscape and portrait moments.

844
33:38.550 --> 33:41.010
And we need experiences that kind of bring those together

845
33:41.010 --> 33:43.440
and create a universe where people can engage

846
33:43.440 --> 33:45.390
with their fandom across both of those.

847
33:46.320 --> 33:48.573
<v ->Yeah, it's ever expanding, isn't it?</v>

848
33:49.590 --> 33:52.340
Yeah, any other technologies you're seeing

849
33:52.340 --> 33:53.430
at the show you think

850
33:53.430 --> 33:56.220
are gonna push the envelope with immersion?

851
33:56.220 --> 33:57.660
<v ->Lasers in the home.</v>

852
33:57.660 --> 33:58.493
<v ->Lasers?</v>

853
33:58.493 --> 33:59.326
<v ->That's huge.</v>

854
33:59.326 --> 34:00.330
<v ->Okay.</v>

855
34:00.330 --> 34:02.190
<v ->What that unlocks for the consumer,</v>

856
34:02.190 --> 34:03.900
which I will say there are,

857
34:03.900 --> 34:07.680
and close to me, close to heart for me, you know,

858
34:07.680 --> 34:08.880
content's not there for it,

859
34:08.880 --> 34:11.820
but the technologies that we are bringing into the home

860
34:11.820 --> 34:14.580
that were not previously available to the home

861
34:14.580 --> 34:19.230
is there is a whole new palette of artistic expression

862
34:19.230 --> 34:21.660
that's becoming available today.

863
34:21.660 --> 34:24.570
And that, to me, is something that I'm just really excited

864
34:24.570 --> 34:26.070
to see how that develops as people.

865
34:26.070 --> 34:27.780
You know, we have the benefit now

866
34:27.780 --> 34:29.550
of we have display technologies

867
34:29.550 --> 34:31.650
that can show things that we can't, we don't know how

868
34:31.650 --> 34:32.763
to create for now.

869
34:34.050 --> 34:37.800
That is a new experience for this industry as I see it,

870
34:37.800 --> 34:40.350
of it's always been the display technology

871
34:40.350 --> 34:43.860
has been the rate limiter, and now, it's no longer that.

872
34:43.860 --> 34:46.980
So I'm curious to see over the next, you know, I think one

873
34:46.980 --> 34:51.240
to five years, how people learn to leverage that.

874
34:51.240 --> 34:52.390
<v ->Yeah, that's amazing.</v>

875
34:53.910 --> 34:56.670
Well, I think any other comments

876
34:56.670 --> 34:59.133
on where this is headed?

877
35:01.479 --> 35:04.080
<v ->Yeah, in terms of the show floor</v>

878
35:04.080 --> 35:05.670
and things that I'm seeing that are exciting,

879
35:05.670 --> 35:08.970
I love all of the health tech that's out there.

880
35:08.970 --> 35:11.910
I mean just, you know, I know I joke

881
35:11.910 --> 35:14.160
and I kid about being in the advertising space

882
35:14.160 --> 35:15.870
and all of those things, but at the end of the day,

883
35:15.870 --> 35:18.450
I'm a dad too, and I have children,

884
35:18.450 --> 35:19.740
and I have a wife who has an illness,

885
35:19.740 --> 35:22.860
and like, these are some of the things where I love to see

886
35:22.860 --> 35:25.605
how consumer technology is, you know, democratizing

887
35:25.605 --> 35:28.140
and normalizing and helping people live better lives.

888
35:28.140 --> 35:29.760
And from a television

889
35:29.760 --> 35:33.063
and an immersive television perspective, like this is where,

890
35:33.063 --> 35:35.130
you know, we get to talk about the cool, wonderful things

891
35:35.130 --> 35:37.530
that people are creating and doing every single day,

892
35:37.530 --> 35:40.380
and how those are gonna, you know, impact engagement

893
35:40.380 --> 35:42.870
and performance, and all of that.

894
35:42.870 --> 35:44.580
But like at the end of the day, like those are the things

895
35:44.580 --> 35:48.240
that I really enjoy looking at when I'm at shows like this

896
35:48.240 --> 35:49.620
for the human reasons.

897
35:49.620 --> 35:51.450
And I think that's some of what we've all been kind

898
35:51.450 --> 35:55.230
of talking about is like how we engage, how we interact,

899
35:55.230 --> 35:57.300
what's on the frontier, what's on the horizon.

900
35:57.300 --> 35:59.580
Yes, we will have experiences,

901
35:59.580 --> 36:01.960
and TV is certainly going to get more immersive

902
36:02.820 --> 36:04.530
over the next few years as a result of some

903
36:04.530 --> 36:05.880
of the things that we're talking about today.

904
36:05.880 --> 36:07.110
<v ->And Dan will figure out how</v>

905
36:07.110 --> 36:09.480
to serve us ads on all those other places too.

906
36:09.480 --> 36:10.313
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

907
36:10.313 --> 36:11.146
<v ->Right?</v>

908
36:11.146 --> 36:12.330
(Sasha laughs)
<v ->Yes, exactly.</v>

909
36:12.330 --> 36:13.530
I think to your point too,

910
36:13.530 --> 36:15.930
just thinking about, in CTAs research,

911
36:15.930 --> 36:18.390
that average Gen Z'er

912
36:18.390 --> 36:22.650
has something like 13 consumer technology products.

913
36:22.650 --> 36:24.015
<v Dan>Only? (laughs)</v>

914
36:24.015 --> 36:24.848
<v ->Right?</v>

915
36:24.848 --> 36:26.040
<v Dan>That's shocking.</v>

916
36:26.040 --> 36:28.410
<v ->I wanna know what the, I wanna count them.</v>

917
36:28.410 --> 36:29.656
<v ->What's the panel size?</v>

918
36:29.656 --> 36:31.890
(panel members laugh)

919
36:31.890 --> 36:32.853
<v ->Researchers. Okay.</v>

920
36:32.853 --> 36:33.900
(panel members laugh)

921
36:33.900 --> 36:36.150
So but consider all these, you know,

922
36:36.150 --> 36:38.280
products that they're engaging with every day.

923
36:38.280 --> 36:40.527
It's all part of their full experience.

924
36:40.527 --> 36:42.120
And I think there's still that tie in,

925
36:42.120 --> 36:46.050
because, you know, we talked about fragmentation

926
36:46.050 --> 36:47.220
and all the different devices,

927
36:47.220 --> 36:48.720
and trying to make that cohesive,

928
36:48.720 --> 36:51.180
and TV does become a part of that, you know,

929
36:51.180 --> 36:52.680
as an entertainment medium.

930
36:52.680 --> 36:54.810
<v ->I do have a question.</v>

931
36:54.810 --> 36:57.940
Is there ever a point where TV's become too big?

932
36:57.940 --> 36:58.773
(Rick laughs)

933
36:58.773 --> 36:59.845
<v ->Not so far.</v>

934
36:59.845 --> 37:00.678
(panel members laugh)

935
37:00.678 --> 37:02.471
<v ->'Cause this year's show floor proved-</v>

936
37:02.471 --> 37:03.304
<v ->It was big.</v>

937
37:03.304 --> 37:07.073
<v ->That 163 inch micro-LED.</v>
<v ->But isn't that what AR is?</v>

938
37:07.073 --> 37:07.906
<v ->It's the one</v>

939
37:07.906 --> 37:09.295
that looks like a pool.
<v ->It's just as big.</v>

940
37:09.295 --> 37:11.040
(panel members laugh)

941
37:11.040 --> 37:12.690
<v ->And when you put those glasses on,</v>

942
37:12.690 --> 37:14.610
and it's simulating a, you know,

943
37:14.610 --> 37:16.530
300-inch screen or something.

944
37:16.530 --> 37:19.530
<v ->It's incredible when you have to ask the question,</v>

945
37:19.530 --> 37:22.744
do I have a door tall enough for this to fit through?

946
37:22.744 --> 37:23.577
(Sasha laughs)

947
37:23.577 --> 37:24.410
<v ->That's amazing.</v>
<v ->That's when you buy</v>

948
37:24.410 --> 37:26.190
the projector, right?

949
37:26.190 --> 37:28.080
<v ->Yeah. (laughs)</v>

950
37:28.080 --> 37:30.600
<v ->Well, I wanna thank my guests here.</v>

951
37:30.600 --> 37:31.950
It was a great conversation,

952
37:31.950 --> 37:34.100
and I hope you all got something out of it.

953
37:35.439 --> 37:38.880
And please dive into the rest of CES.

954
37:38.880 --> 37:41.550
Get out there, explore, be curious,

955
37:41.550 --> 37:45.147
and yeah, make it a great CES.

956
37:45.147 --> 37:45.980
<v ->Thank you all.</v>

957
37:45.980 --> 37:48.160
<v Sasha And Matt>Thank you.</v>
(audience applauds)

958
37:48.160 --> 37:50.827
(upbeat music)
