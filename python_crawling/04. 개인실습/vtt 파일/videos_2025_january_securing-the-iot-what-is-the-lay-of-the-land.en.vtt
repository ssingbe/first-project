1
00:00.152 --> 00:02.735
(upbeat music)

2
00:10.530 --> 00:11.363
<v ->All right.</v>

3
00:11.363 --> 00:12.483
Good morning everyone.

4
00:13.440 --> 00:15.573
Welcome to this next session.

5
00:16.654 --> 00:17.610
So my name is Ellen Boehm,

6
00:17.610 --> 00:19.920
and I'm the SVP of IoT strategy

7
00:19.920 --> 00:21.570
at a company called Keyfactor.

8
00:21.570 --> 00:23.460
We're a cybersecurity software company.

9
00:23.460 --> 00:26.433
We specialize in certificates and certificate management.

10
00:27.390 --> 00:29.580
But I'm really excited to be here

11
00:29.580 --> 00:33.540
with these fellow panelists who are experts in their fields

12
00:33.540 --> 00:35.130
and the focus of our talk today,

13
00:35.130 --> 00:37.623
which is cybersecurity and IoT.

14
00:38.940 --> 00:40.740
So we have, again, 40 minutes

15
00:40.740 --> 00:43.591
and a lot of things to talk about.

16
00:43.591 --> 00:45.900
So not sure if we'll have time for Q &amp; A,

17
00:45.900 --> 00:49.110
but if we do, we can entertain that.

18
00:49.110 --> 00:50.790
Otherwise, find us afterwards.

19
00:50.790 --> 00:52.143
We're happy to talk.

20
00:54.085 --> 00:54.918
So with that,

21
00:54.918 --> 00:55.950
actually I would like everyone just say your name

22
00:55.950 --> 00:57.180
and say your company very quickly.

23
00:57.180 --> 00:59.200
We'll just go down the line for intros

24
01:00.186 --> 01:01.019
and then we're just gonna get right

25
01:01.019 --> 01:02.007
into the questions, so.

26
01:02.007 --> 01:04.860
<v ->Hi, Eric Greenwald, general counsel of Finite State.</v>

27
01:04.860 --> 01:05.910
<v ->Hi, Erik Brenneis.</v>

28
01:05.910 --> 01:08.463
I'm the CEO of Vodafone's, IoT business.

29
01:09.390 --> 01:10.470
<v ->Hi, Gregory Laloy.</v>

30
01:10.470 --> 01:13.070
I'm responsible for the product and IoT with Thales.

31
01:13.980 --> 01:17.013
<v ->Sri Ramachandran CTO of Somos.</v>

32
01:17.880 --> 01:19.230
<v ->Trish Reilly, Senior director</v>

33
01:19.230 --> 01:22.290
of Product Marketing at Aeris Communications.

34
01:22.290 --> 01:23.123
<v ->Awesome.</v>

35
01:23.123 --> 01:24.090
Thank you all for joining me.

36
01:24.090 --> 01:26.010
And then lastly, just wanna say thank you

37
01:26.010 --> 01:29.640
to the IMC for sponsoring, this panel.

38
01:29.640 --> 01:31.710
So we are members of the IMC,

39
01:31.710 --> 01:33.060
which is an organization

40
01:33.060 --> 01:36.040
that brings together several different companies

41
01:37.101 --> 01:38.910
and people from around the space

42
01:38.910 --> 01:41.670
to talk about best practices around IoT.

43
01:41.670 --> 01:42.960
Specifically, the initiative

44
01:42.960 --> 01:44.730
that we've been taking on this year

45
01:44.730 --> 01:46.740
in partnership with the GCF,

46
01:46.740 --> 01:49.290
is taking a look at the cybersecurity standards

47
01:49.290 --> 01:52.290
and guidelines that are emerging

48
01:52.290 --> 01:55.580
and trying to have some practical advice

49
01:55.580 --> 01:57.360
for companies to be able to adopt

50
01:57.360 --> 02:00.390
and implement those across the multiple

51
02:00.390 --> 02:01.590
layers of the IoT stack.

52
02:01.590 --> 02:03.150
So not just a device perspective,

53
02:03.150 --> 02:04.980
but from the network and the connectivity

54
02:04.980 --> 02:06.330
and then the cloud and the apps.

55
02:06.330 --> 02:07.380
So that's a little side note

56
02:07.380 --> 02:08.340
about some of the things that we're doing.

57
02:08.340 --> 02:10.260
We'll talk a little bit more about that today.

58
02:10.260 --> 02:12.510
But without further ado, let's jump into the questions,

59
02:12.510 --> 02:15.060
'cause I really wanna hear from the experts.

60
02:15.060 --> 02:17.130
So we're going to start with Sri

61
02:17.130 --> 02:18.810
and setting the stage about just

62
02:18.810 --> 02:20.670
generally the IoT landscape.

63
02:20.670 --> 02:21.503
What are you seeing?

64
02:21.503 --> 02:22.500
Obviously a lot of IoT

65
02:22.500 --> 02:24.150
that we've seen here at at CES,

66
02:24.150 --> 02:26.130
but from your perspective,

67
02:26.130 --> 02:27.150
what do you think are the hot trends?

68
02:27.150 --> 02:30.100
<v ->Yeah, so that's a great question to get started off with.</v>

69
02:31.281 --> 02:32.114
So we talk of IoT

70
02:32.114 --> 02:34.740
and then in general people think IoT needs

71
02:34.740 --> 02:37.593
to be like small devices, small sensors and so on.

72
02:39.037 --> 02:40.770
But when you look at it realistically,

73
02:40.770 --> 02:42.488
any connected device is essentially part

74
02:42.488 --> 02:44.460
of that ecosystem, right?

75
02:44.460 --> 02:48.270
So it can be an airliner, a Boeing or Airbus airliner,

76
02:48.270 --> 02:50.100
that's a connected device, really,

77
02:50.100 --> 02:51.650
you know, multiple connections.

78
02:52.729 --> 02:55.293
And it could be like a coffee,

79
02:56.520 --> 02:59.940
coffee maker with an alarm clock

80
02:59.940 --> 03:01.770
that you can actually program remotely, right?

81
03:01.770 --> 03:04.570
So that essentially is, again, another connected device.

82
03:06.072 --> 03:08.220
So connected devices have a pretty broad range

83
03:08.220 --> 03:10.920
of applications and typically there is a device

84
03:10.920 --> 03:15.030
that has some way of connecting through a network

85
03:15.030 --> 03:17.250
to a backend app or application and so on.

86
03:17.250 --> 03:19.980
So this is in general what the IoT is.

87
03:19.980 --> 03:22.030
And what we are actually seeing

88
03:23.484 --> 03:25.800
is that based on analyst research and so on,

89
03:25.800 --> 03:28.213
the consensus estimate is that there

90
03:28.213 --> 03:31.290
are 18 billion devices already deployed.

91
03:31.290 --> 03:32.943
So that's a significant number.

92
03:34.731 --> 03:36.300
And when we look at the growth rate of this,

93
03:36.300 --> 03:37.320
the consensus system,

94
03:37.320 --> 03:40.800
it is also 18.8% compound annual growth rate.

95
03:40.800 --> 03:45.180
So it's a very significantly growing market.

96
03:45.180 --> 03:47.040
And pretty much when you look at

97
03:47.040 --> 03:49.740
what is actually driving this growth,

98
03:49.740 --> 03:51.360
obviously the different types

99
03:51.360 --> 03:53.580
of network modalities are actually increasing.

100
03:53.580 --> 03:56.220
So originally it was just Wi-Fi and cellular

101
03:56.220 --> 03:57.390
and then there was LoRa.

102
03:57.390 --> 03:59.010
And then there are so many new ways

103
03:59.010 --> 04:01.143
to actually connect devices to a network.

104
04:02.775 --> 04:04.140
And there are two key areas

105
04:04.140 --> 04:05.940
that are actually driving a lot of this expansion.

106
04:05.940 --> 04:08.040
Obviously there's industrial automation

107
04:08.040 --> 04:11.343
that is a huge part of the growth of IoT.

108
04:13.212 --> 04:14.590
And I think the thing

109
04:14.590 --> 04:18.420
that we all probably experience on a daily basis is that any

110
04:18.420 --> 04:22.143
device that we buy for the home now comes connected.

111
04:24.176 --> 04:27.120
So we just had a refrigerator that went bad.

112
04:27.120 --> 04:29.520
It was a 25-year-old refrigerator

113
04:29.520 --> 04:31.743
and had to buy a new one over the,

114
04:32.911 --> 04:33.744
on the 24th of December.

115
04:33.744 --> 04:35.940
Fortunately there was a great sale at Lowe's,

116
04:35.940 --> 04:37.590
so I said, yes, let me go get it.

117
04:39.033 --> 04:41.403
And every refrigerator had a Wi-Fi connection.

118
04:42.555 --> 04:44.310
So you cannot find

119
04:44.310 --> 04:46.830
an appliance without a connection these days, right?

120
04:46.830 --> 04:47.910
So connected devices,

121
04:47.910 --> 04:50.970
especially smart home based connected devices,

122
04:50.970 --> 04:55.110
is another area that's actually driving this growth.

123
04:55.110 --> 04:57.930
So it's really an expanding market.

124
04:57.930 --> 04:59.910
It's very relevant to all of us

125
04:59.910 --> 05:01.890
and it's going to be something that we need

126
05:01.890 --> 05:04.800
to be all be much more in tune with.

127
05:04.800 --> 05:05.790
<v ->Yes, awesome.</v>

128
05:05.790 --> 05:06.960
Thanks. Sri.

129
05:06.960 --> 05:09.060
So Erik, I wanna go to you now to talk a little bit

130
05:09.060 --> 05:10.380
about the connectivity

131
05:10.380 --> 05:11.640
and the networking part of it.

132
05:11.640 --> 05:13.320
So obviously Vodafone,

133
05:13.320 --> 05:14.940
I'm sure you have some expertise here,

134
05:14.940 --> 05:17.610
but how do we support then connecting all of these millions

135
05:17.610 --> 05:19.920
of things globally wherever they are,

136
05:19.920 --> 05:21.810
as Sri was mentioning, the volumes.

137
05:21.810 --> 05:24.080
<v ->I think there are three points to this.</v>

138
05:24.080 --> 05:27.390
On one hand it's the network technology itself.

139
05:27.390 --> 05:32.010
10 years ago everything was on 2G and 2G, of course,

140
05:32.010 --> 05:34.375
was and is a good technology.

141
05:34.375 --> 05:36.390
But for a smart meter, the new technology,

142
05:36.390 --> 05:39.900
narrowband IoT is better for a super fast device.

143
05:39.900 --> 05:42.570
Or if you want to download big amounts of data,

144
05:42.570 --> 05:43.470
5G is better.

145
05:43.470 --> 05:47.100
So we've gone to a point where we have lots

146
05:47.100 --> 05:49.493
of network technologies,

147
05:49.493 --> 05:52.410
LTEM, 2G, 3G 4G, 5G,

148
05:52.410 --> 05:53.880
red cap and so on.

149
05:53.880 --> 05:57.150
So you can now select the right network technology

150
05:57.150 --> 05:58.800
for your connection.

151
05:58.800 --> 06:03.240
Number two, 10 years ago, IoT was more a technology,

152
06:03.240 --> 06:04.650
you know, which was used.

153
06:04.650 --> 06:07.560
And now in our opinion it's an operational asset.

154
06:07.560 --> 06:09.900
There are so many customers now already

155
06:09.900 --> 06:12.630
who depend completely on the IoT connections

156
06:12.630 --> 06:14.550
for their business model,

157
06:14.550 --> 06:16.380
that it's an operational asset which needs

158
06:16.380 --> 06:18.870
to be available a hundred percent of the time,

159
06:18.870 --> 06:21.360
99% is not good enough.

160
06:21.360 --> 06:23.620
And number three, there have also been

161
06:24.480 --> 06:26.460
technological developments with regards

162
06:26.460 --> 06:28.050
to how you access the networks.

163
06:28.050 --> 06:29.700
It used to be a physical SIM,

164
06:29.700 --> 06:31.050
which you need to put in there.

165
06:31.050 --> 06:33.390
Now you have eSIM

166
06:33.390 --> 06:35.640
where you can switch the SIM over the air.

167
06:35.640 --> 06:38.726
You have iSIM where it's embedded in the silicon

168
06:38.726 --> 06:41.580
of a communication module.

169
06:41.580 --> 06:43.920
And of course, these new technologies

170
06:43.920 --> 06:45.630
make everything more flexible,

171
06:45.630 --> 06:48.570
but also post new security risks,

172
06:48.570 --> 06:51.720
because obviously if you can switch a network over the air,

173
06:51.720 --> 06:56.070
there's more room for fraud than if it's hard coded

174
06:56.070 --> 06:58.080
and you can never change it.

175
06:58.080 --> 06:59.163
<v ->Awesome, thank you.</v>

176
07:00.624 --> 07:03.450
So Greg, let's dive a little bit into security.

177
07:03.450 --> 07:06.510
So what are you seeing from the general cybersecurity

178
07:06.510 --> 07:09.330
landscape that we should be aware of today?

179
07:09.330 --> 07:12.690
<v ->So there is a lot when we talk about IoT security.</v>

180
07:12.690 --> 07:16.020
Most of the time, as Sri was mentioning, IoT is growing.

181
07:16.020 --> 07:18.630
There is more and more connected devices independently

182
07:18.630 --> 07:22.140
of the type of connectivity, serial connectivity, Wi-Fi,

183
07:22.140 --> 07:23.550
BLE and all this.

184
07:23.550 --> 07:27.000
We need to find a way to protect those IoT devices.

185
07:27.000 --> 07:28.620
When we talk about IoT security,

186
07:28.620 --> 07:30.120
as we were mentioning also in the beginning,

187
07:30.120 --> 07:31.950
it's not only on the hardware side,

188
07:31.950 --> 07:34.740
but we need to see the full value chain

189
07:34.740 --> 07:36.450
from the production of the device,

190
07:36.450 --> 07:38.070
when the device will be manufactured

191
07:38.070 --> 07:40.950
and when the device will be running during the lifetime.

192
07:40.950 --> 07:43.500
And we need to take care of that since the beginning

193
07:43.500 --> 07:45.630
of the design of the devices.

194
07:45.630 --> 07:46.710
Then the device is one thing.

195
07:46.710 --> 07:48.270
You need to have a secure device.

196
07:48.270 --> 07:49.797
That's something that is important.

197
07:49.797 --> 07:52.151
I think Eric was mentioning the eSIM and iSIM

198
07:52.151 --> 07:54.120
and that in the end is a kind of root of trust,

199
07:54.120 --> 07:56.550
an hardware root of trust where we can put,

200
07:56.550 --> 07:59.490
let's say the foundations of the security inside.

201
07:59.490 --> 08:02.430
But then we have also all, let's say the technology

202
08:02.430 --> 08:04.680
to exchange the data that needs to be secure.

203
08:04.680 --> 08:07.080
All the data that will transit from the device

204
08:07.080 --> 08:09.750
to the application server needs to be secure as well.

205
08:09.750 --> 08:12.480
And you need also to have the capability

206
08:12.480 --> 08:15.150
to manage the secure lifecycle of your device

207
08:15.150 --> 08:17.580
through framework signing service

208
08:17.580 --> 08:19.943
and different things like that.

209
08:19.943 --> 08:22.710
So IoT security is big

210
08:22.710 --> 08:24.720
and it depends also on the type of applications.

211
08:24.720 --> 08:26.160
What you do with the smart metering

212
08:26.160 --> 08:28.350
or grid is not the same as a pet tracker.

213
08:28.350 --> 08:29.610
It's not the same when we are talking about

214
08:29.610 --> 08:31.380
healthcare or automotive.

215
08:31.380 --> 08:33.000
That can be linked also to safety.

216
08:33.000 --> 08:34.170
So there is a lot of things that needs

217
08:34.170 --> 08:35.720
to be taken into consideration.

218
08:36.793 --> 08:37.626
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

219
08:37.626 --> 08:39.480
And I think hopefully we can get a little bit

220
08:39.480 --> 08:43.050
more into that in the future questions.

221
08:43.050 --> 08:44.550
'Cause I do think that there's things

222
08:44.550 --> 08:46.980
that we can learn cross industry, right?

223
08:46.980 --> 08:49.200
Especially if we're looking at the framework

224
08:49.200 --> 08:52.800
of end-to-end cybersecurity and looking at an endpoint

225
08:52.800 --> 08:55.140
or an operating system or how do you encrypt

226
08:55.140 --> 08:56.310
and secure the channels.

227
08:56.310 --> 08:59.325
So I think finding similarities

228
08:59.325 --> 09:02.430
and helping to share that across verticals is important.

229
09:02.430 --> 09:03.510
But yeah, let's get a little bit

230
09:03.510 --> 09:04.830
more into that in a bit.

231
09:04.830 --> 09:08.070
So Trish, last thing in terms of setting the stage

232
09:08.070 --> 09:10.920
from a perspective, from you.

233
09:10.920 --> 09:14.400
You have experience across FinTech, across healthcare.

234
09:14.400 --> 09:16.020
So what are you seeing in terms

235
09:16.020 --> 09:19.200
of cybersecurity in these areas that we should be aware of?

236
09:19.200 --> 09:22.260
<v ->Yeah, sorry, no, that's a really great question.</v>

237
09:22.260 --> 09:24.420
You know, even based on things that Sri was saying,

238
09:24.420 --> 09:26.010
and Greg was saying, a lot of this,

239
09:26.010 --> 09:28.320
if you think of it from a security perspective,

240
09:28.320 --> 09:29.640
the industry itself,

241
09:29.640 --> 09:32.130
security we have to think of it as being more horizontal.

242
09:32.130 --> 09:33.690
It is not a vertical play.

243
09:33.690 --> 09:36.660
Yes, there are differences within the vertical arenas

244
09:36.660 --> 09:37.980
as to how things are used,

245
09:37.980 --> 09:39.030
what you need to protect,

246
09:39.030 --> 09:40.680
what type of data and stuff is critical

247
09:40.680 --> 09:44.700
to your organization from both an operational and a revenue

248
09:44.700 --> 09:46.500
and a business perspective.

249
09:46.500 --> 09:47.460
But at the same point,

250
09:47.460 --> 09:48.870
you need to think about the fact

251
09:48.870 --> 09:50.730
that different industries

252
09:50.730 --> 09:54.060
or different verticals are gonna latch onto security

253
09:54.060 --> 09:55.290
faster than others will.

254
09:55.290 --> 09:57.360
I mean, financial services is always

255
09:57.360 --> 09:59.760
an early adapter from a security perspective.

256
09:59.760 --> 10:00.870
However, the issues

257
10:00.870 --> 10:03.150
and the challenges that you see within healthcare

258
10:03.150 --> 10:04.590
that you see in manufacturing,

259
10:04.590 --> 10:07.200
that you see in in consumer business,

260
10:07.200 --> 10:09.240
it's very, very similar.

261
10:09.240 --> 10:10.500
So you need to think about

262
10:10.500 --> 10:13.593
how you wanna protect this from a holistic perspective.

263
10:14.909 --> 10:17.940
And even though you may have a business that has, you know,

264
10:17.940 --> 10:21.150
multiple different types of security parameters,

265
10:21.150 --> 10:22.500
you know, you could be a holding company

266
10:22.500 --> 10:23.760
and you have things in consumer,

267
10:23.760 --> 10:26.760
you have things in maybe in travel and logistics,

268
10:26.760 --> 10:28.590
or you know, the different areas,

269
10:28.590 --> 10:29.640
the threats you need

270
10:29.640 --> 10:32.220
to also think about are, you know,

271
10:32.220 --> 10:34.320
how can anybody or what can be used

272
10:34.320 --> 10:36.660
to potentially get into my infrastructure.

273
10:36.660 --> 10:40.380
We see a lot of changes right now with zero day attacks.

274
10:40.380 --> 10:42.930
You know, people don't know how do I, what do I do?

275
10:42.930 --> 10:44.160
How do I start to do this?

276
10:44.160 --> 10:47.220
And you feel a lot of people that get this instant,

277
10:47.220 --> 10:50.010
oh my gosh, how am I gonna handle this scenario

278
10:50.010 --> 10:52.020
in which you just need to think about it, okay,

279
10:52.020 --> 10:54.210
you're zero day, things are gonna happen.

280
10:54.210 --> 10:57.360
Everybody to some extent is going to be attacked

281
10:57.360 --> 11:00.300
or probably has been and may or may not know it.

282
11:00.300 --> 11:02.220
You need to think about the fact that, you know what,

283
11:02.220 --> 11:05.190
we need to put something in place that can start to traverse

284
11:05.190 --> 11:07.290
and start to understand what's going on

285
11:07.290 --> 11:10.590
within the infrastructure from the security perspective,

286
11:10.590 --> 11:12.960
regardless of the type of device.

287
11:12.960 --> 11:15.270
IoT is a huge threat right now.

288
11:15.270 --> 11:17.490
It is a big security gap.

289
11:17.490 --> 11:19.560
Everybody's been talking about the fact

290
11:19.560 --> 11:22.770
that these devices have kind of grown, you know,

291
11:22.770 --> 11:24.750
as Sri and everybody said, exponentially.

292
11:24.750 --> 11:26.370
It's kind of become the wild west

293
11:26.370 --> 11:29.070
and then everybody's kind of thinking about now going,

294
11:29.940 --> 11:32.070
I need to build security into this,

295
11:32.070 --> 11:33.660
but what do I do about those devices

296
11:33.660 --> 11:36.000
that have sat out there for years?

297
11:36.000 --> 11:38.610
You know, 'cause IoT devices were put, were, you know,

298
11:38.610 --> 11:41.460
originally designed to be in areas where you didn't have

299
11:41.460 --> 11:43.020
to have a person go out to them

300
11:43.020 --> 11:45.150
or you didn't have to have accessibility.

301
11:45.150 --> 11:49.440
And it really, you know, was kind of a lone wolf out there.

302
11:49.440 --> 11:51.870
But now you need to start to think, it's got old hardware,

303
11:51.870 --> 11:53.340
it may have old firmware,

304
11:53.340 --> 11:55.440
there may be things hard coded in this.

305
11:55.440 --> 11:58.380
These are potential threats into your infrastructure.

306
11:58.380 --> 12:01.350
So regardless of the vertical, you know,

307
12:01.350 --> 12:04.590
a lot of the challenges are still the same.

308
12:04.590 --> 12:05.670
It's how you handle those

309
12:05.670 --> 12:08.850
and think of really what your business priorities are.

310
12:08.850 --> 12:10.410
<v ->Yeah, thank you Trish.</v>

311
12:10.410 --> 12:12.360
That was a great lead into this next section,

312
12:12.360 --> 12:14.610
which I really do wanna have focused on

313
12:14.610 --> 12:15.870
threats and challenges.

314
12:15.870 --> 12:18.660
And actually as I was walking over here this morning,

315
12:18.660 --> 12:20.280
you know, I was thinking about this story

316
12:20.280 --> 12:21.810
and now it's seven years old,

317
12:21.810 --> 12:23.940
but when the casino was hacked

318
12:23.940 --> 12:26.700
because there was a fish tank with a smart thermostat,

319
12:26.700 --> 12:27.840
had no security on it.

320
12:27.840 --> 12:30.330
So as we go into this next section,

321
12:30.330 --> 12:33.120
if anyone else has other stories that they'd like to share,

322
12:33.120 --> 12:34.770
let's come up with some more relevant ones.

323
12:34.770 --> 12:37.350
I know there's recently, I think, what is this,

324
12:37.350 --> 12:39.900
the salt typhoon talking about telecom attacks.

325
12:39.900 --> 12:40.733
So maybe,

326
12:41.850 --> 12:43.110
I think there's,

327
12:43.110 --> 12:44.670
people are,

328
12:44.670 --> 12:45.810
we're getting a lot better.

329
12:45.810 --> 12:48.570
We've gotten a lot better at securing enterprise networks,

330
12:48.570 --> 12:50.730
enterprise devices, servers, laptops,

331
12:50.730 --> 12:52.530
even within companies.

332
12:52.530 --> 12:55.080
But then what's the next front that attackers

333
12:55.080 --> 12:56.760
and bad actors are going after?

334
12:56.760 --> 12:59.377
It's these, again, maybe smaller devices

335
12:59.377 --> 13:03.210
that can be turned into to like bot attacks

336
13:03.210 --> 13:06.150
or just entry ways to get into a corporate network

337
13:06.150 --> 13:08.400
or into this casino network for example.

338
13:08.400 --> 13:12.150
Or get into, you know, into a retail facility

339
13:12.150 --> 13:15.000
because you hacked into the HVAC system.

340
13:15.000 --> 13:16.830
So let's talk a little bit about some

341
13:16.830 --> 13:17.970
of those threats and challenges.

342
13:17.970 --> 13:20.610
And Eric, I would like to go over to you.

343
13:20.610 --> 13:22.320
So what are come some of the top challenges

344
13:22.320 --> 13:25.290
that you've heard companies are facing today?

345
13:25.290 --> 13:27.300
<v ->Well, I'll start by echoing what Trish was saying</v>

346
13:27.300 --> 13:29.010
is that, you know, depending upon your vertical,

347
13:29.010 --> 13:31.440
depending upon the services you provide,

348
13:31.440 --> 13:33.450
depending upon the kind of data you traffic in,

349
13:33.450 --> 13:34.950
depending upon your geography,

350
13:36.330 --> 13:38.460
the challenges are going to vary considerably

351
13:38.460 --> 13:41.070
from company to company, from vertical to vertical.

352
13:41.070 --> 13:44.130
But there are some practical considerations

353
13:44.130 --> 13:46.590
that are, if not universal, near universal.

354
13:46.590 --> 13:50.760
And the way I would shorthand it is resource constraints.

355
13:50.760 --> 13:52.620
That there is so much that needs

356
13:52.620 --> 13:54.540
to be done that can be done.

357
13:54.540 --> 13:56.730
That where there are customer pressures, market pressures,

358
13:56.730 --> 13:59.730
regulatory pressures that you are under

359
13:59.730 --> 14:03.870
as a company, especially in the IoT space, to do.

360
14:03.870 --> 14:06.360
But you have limited resources with which to do it.

361
14:06.360 --> 14:08.160
And Gregory and I were talking about this

362
14:08.160 --> 14:11.400
before the panel that a good way to describe that

363
14:11.400 --> 14:14.190
or to to think about that is as a cost constraint

364
14:14.190 --> 14:17.310
or the economic pressures in the IoT space.

365
14:17.310 --> 14:19.110
It's not true for all IoT companies,

366
14:19.110 --> 14:22.080
but for many they are,

367
14:22.080 --> 14:24.180
the marketplace competition is fierce

368
14:24.180 --> 14:25.440
and they are under a lot of pressure

369
14:25.440 --> 14:27.510
to keep their prices very low.

370
14:27.510 --> 14:28.770
When your prices are very low,

371
14:28.770 --> 14:30.060
you have limited resources

372
14:30.060 --> 14:32.580
with which to address various needs.

373
14:32.580 --> 14:34.440
Cybersecurity is gonna be chief among those.

374
14:34.440 --> 14:37.260
And there are lots of companies that, you know,

375
14:37.260 --> 14:39.120
as Trish said, you said you bolted on afterwards

376
14:39.120 --> 14:40.680
because when you're first starting out,

377
14:40.680 --> 14:41.550
you're worried about building it,

378
14:41.550 --> 14:42.690
you're worried about getting it to market

379
14:42.690 --> 14:43.770
and you're worried about actually

380
14:43.770 --> 14:46.020
selling it at a competitive price.

381
14:46.020 --> 14:51.020
And so a lot of companies are coming late to cybersecurity

382
14:51.240 --> 14:53.820
in their products, in their space in their services,

383
14:53.820 --> 14:56.370
not necessarily out of either ignorance

384
14:56.370 --> 14:59.130
or, you know, disdain for security practices,

385
14:59.130 --> 15:01.680
but just because they have other priorities there.

386
15:01.680 --> 15:03.930
The incentive structure

387
15:03.930 --> 15:07.920
and the risks in the marketplace are structured around

388
15:07.920 --> 15:10.170
a narrow focus on delivering

389
15:10.170 --> 15:12.300
and delivering at low price points.

390
15:12.300 --> 15:13.920
And you know, while this is certainly true

391
15:13.920 --> 15:16.650
for inexpensive consumer electronics,

392
15:16.650 --> 15:18.450
it also applies to areas

393
15:18.450 --> 15:21.030
where there are components going into automobiles

394
15:21.030 --> 15:23.400
and airplanes where there's still a lot of pressure

395
15:23.400 --> 15:26.010
to keep prices low and there's a lot of competition

396
15:26.010 --> 15:27.630
and it's a dynamic marketplace.

397
15:27.630 --> 15:31.650
So it is, again, sort of this lack of resources,

398
15:31.650 --> 15:34.980
economic resources to be able to devote to a complex problem

399
15:34.980 --> 15:38.160
where there isn't one single, you know, biggest challenge.

400
15:38.160 --> 15:40.680
It really just depends upon what you're doing,

401
15:40.680 --> 15:44.040
where you are and what sort of threats you face.

402
15:44.040 --> 15:45.150
<v ->Yeah, yeah, great points.</v>

403
15:45.150 --> 15:46.500
I think a lot of it is about,

404
15:46.500 --> 15:48.720
it's an ROI decision too,

405
15:48.720 --> 15:50.340
designing and security

406
15:50.340 --> 15:53.310
and also sometimes taking a risk of a breach.

407
15:53.310 --> 15:55.913
So I know at a key factor we've done a study

408
15:55.913 --> 15:56.746
where it's, you know,

409
15:56.746 --> 15:58.980
the cost of a breach could be $2 million.

410
15:58.980 --> 16:01.260
So do you wanna just pay that

411
16:01.260 --> 16:02.880
or do you wanna be more prescriptive

412
16:02.880 --> 16:04.050
upfront for preventative?

413
16:04.050 --> 16:05.100
<v ->Well, and it's worth noting that,</v>

414
16:05.100 --> 16:05.933
and we're gonna talk, I'm sure,

415
16:05.933 --> 16:07.830
a little bit later about

416
16:07.830 --> 16:09.930
the regulatory schemes that are now entering

417
16:09.930 --> 16:12.300
into the marketplace globally.

418
16:12.300 --> 16:14.580
But you know, leading up to this point,

419
16:14.580 --> 16:17.310
it was really that cost risk calculus,

420
16:17.310 --> 16:19.110
cost benefit analysis of,

421
16:19.110 --> 16:21.600
okay, if I don't really go do everything

422
16:21.600 --> 16:23.670
that I should be doing with respect to cybersecurity,

423
16:23.670 --> 16:24.990
what's the impact?

424
16:24.990 --> 16:26.700
And part of it depends on how likely

425
16:26.700 --> 16:28.860
am I to suffer a breach.

426
16:28.860 --> 16:31.260
And a lot of companies are willing to roll the dice

427
16:31.260 --> 16:33.240
and just say, you know,

428
16:33.240 --> 16:36.120
it's hard to internalize a cost

429
16:36.120 --> 16:39.210
that hasn't happened and that might not.

430
16:39.210 --> 16:40.680
<v ->Right. Yeah. Yes.</v>

431
16:40.680 --> 16:41.513
Yeah, but yeah,

432
16:41.513 --> 16:43.380
let's talk about the certifications in a bit.

433
16:43.380 --> 16:44.520
So next question.

434
16:44.520 --> 16:46.170
So Trish and maybe also Erik,

435
16:46.170 --> 16:48.330
about connectivity and risks

436
16:48.330 --> 16:50.700
around connectivity and infrastructure.

437
16:50.700 --> 16:53.100
So what challenges, I think if we go specifically

438
16:53.100 --> 16:56.160
into that sort of network layer, are you guys seeing?

439
16:56.160 --> 16:57.690
<v ->Yeah, so I mean if you think about it</v>

440
16:57.690 --> 16:59.400
from the connectivity perspective,

441
16:59.400 --> 17:00.780
from the cellular side of the house,

442
17:00.780 --> 17:02.190
I mean your cellular traffic runs

443
17:02.190 --> 17:03.750
through your existing, you know,

444
17:03.750 --> 17:05.490
infrastructure and everything.

445
17:05.490 --> 17:07.440
But the challenge that you have is you start

446
17:07.440 --> 17:09.450
to think about it not just from connectivity.

447
17:09.450 --> 17:12.090
And of course I'm gonna bend more toward the security

448
17:12.090 --> 17:14.040
side because that is my background.

449
17:14.040 --> 17:16.920
You have to think about the fact that a lot of that data

450
17:16.920 --> 17:19.200
that's brought in from the connectivity

451
17:19.200 --> 17:20.790
is very much aggregated.

452
17:20.790 --> 17:21.720
So you don't know.

453
17:21.720 --> 17:24.240
And what happens if you have one device that's going awry

454
17:24.240 --> 17:27.030
or if you have one device that has been,

455
17:27.030 --> 17:29.610
has really opened an attack surface for you,

456
17:29.610 --> 17:32.610
how do you figure out which device it is versus selling

457
17:32.610 --> 17:34.950
or setting off everything, okay, this business unit,

458
17:34.950 --> 17:36.540
'cause that's part of that's gotta be shut down

459
17:36.540 --> 17:37.920
or you know, no connectivity

460
17:37.920 --> 17:39.720
till we figure out what's going on.

461
17:39.720 --> 17:41.969
What's really important to think about from the connectivity

462
17:41.969 --> 17:44.580
side of the house is how do you start

463
17:44.580 --> 17:45.780
to bring all this together

464
17:45.780 --> 17:48.480
and really understand it from a device perspective?

465
17:48.480 --> 17:52.680
You know, 'cause you wanna be able to frame that one device,

466
17:52.680 --> 17:54.690
look at what it's interacting with,

467
17:54.690 --> 17:56.280
what it's potentially dialing out,

468
17:56.280 --> 17:58.680
is it going out to a command and control center?

469
17:58.680 --> 18:01.350
Is there malware threats associated with it?

470
18:01.350 --> 18:02.580
All of these, you know,

471
18:02.580 --> 18:04.098
and I'm, like I said, gonna bring in this back

472
18:04.098 --> 18:06.120
to the security side.

473
18:06.120 --> 18:07.830
It's very similar to what you've done

474
18:07.830 --> 18:09.270
from a network side of the house,

475
18:09.270 --> 18:10.103
but you also need

476
18:10.103 --> 18:13.560
to think about it from the connectivity side of the house.

477
18:13.560 --> 18:15.990
Do you have things to add to that, Erik, or?

478
18:15.990 --> 18:18.033
<v ->Look, yeah, I totally agree</v>

479
18:18.033 --> 18:20.280
with everything you've been saying.

480
18:20.280 --> 18:21.300
Regarding your question,

481
18:21.300 --> 18:23.340
how important is it on connectivity?

482
18:23.340 --> 18:24.173
Think about it.

483
18:24.173 --> 18:26.830
Connectivity, something that is not connected

484
18:27.930 --> 18:31.290
can only be attacked if you go physically there, right?

485
18:31.290 --> 18:34.080
A computer which doesn't have an internet connection.

486
18:34.080 --> 18:34.913
<v Ellen>Yeah.</v>

487
18:34.913 --> 18:36.330
<v ->You need to physically go there to manipulate.</v>

488
18:36.330 --> 18:40.980
So therefore connectivity is actually the entry point

489
18:40.980 --> 18:43.170
for any remote attacker

490
18:43.170 --> 18:46.470
and therefore you need to secure it appropriately.

491
18:46.470 --> 18:48.780
And I think we'll talk,

492
18:48.780 --> 18:50.910
the next questions about how we do that, right?

493
18:50.910 --> 18:51.840
<v ->Okay, great.</v>

494
18:51.840 --> 18:52.673
Thank you.

495
18:53.584 --> 18:56.260
Okay, so Greg, let's talk a little bit about

496
18:57.876 --> 19:01.170
how do you see companies managing IoT security

497
19:01.170 --> 19:03.480
when it's massive deployments?

498
19:03.480 --> 19:04.710
<v ->That's a very good question</v>

499
19:04.710 --> 19:06.810
because I think as Sri was mentioning,

500
19:06.810 --> 19:09.570
we see there are more and more IoT devices

501
19:09.570 --> 19:12.357
and when you manage those type of devices

502
19:12.357 --> 19:15.120
and a million of devices that will be connected,

503
19:15.120 --> 19:16.920
you need to start from the beginning.

504
19:16.920 --> 19:19.980
If in terms of company you don't have a mindset

505
19:19.980 --> 19:23.700
of security by design, then it's a little bit too late.

506
19:23.700 --> 19:25.740
There are things that can be done, you can patch,

507
19:25.740 --> 19:26.820
there are things that can be done.

508
19:26.820 --> 19:28.260
But once the device is in the field,

509
19:28.260 --> 19:29.370
if you don't have remotely,

510
19:29.370 --> 19:32.580
the capacity to do something is gonna be very complex.

511
19:32.580 --> 19:33.413
So the way to do it,

512
19:33.413 --> 19:36.030
there are different steps that you need to do.

513
19:36.030 --> 19:38.400
And it's the same as some organization has done in the past.

514
19:38.400 --> 19:40.800
We're talking about the IT, IT has done it.

515
19:40.800 --> 19:43.170
The OT monitoring, we managed security services,

516
19:43.170 --> 19:44.100
they're doing it.

517
19:44.100 --> 19:46.110
But it takes time, it's a process.

518
19:46.110 --> 19:50.910
And every actors on the IoT must be part of this journey.

519
19:50.910 --> 19:53.130
It's coming from the silicon vendor

520
19:53.130 --> 19:56.130
who are bridging a little bit more and more security inside.

521
19:56.130 --> 19:59.580
It's the device maker who need also to pro,

522
19:59.580 --> 20:02.280
let's say to program and to help the end user

523
20:02.280 --> 20:03.870
to have some secret mechanism on it.

524
20:03.870 --> 20:05.190
It's also the service provider,

525
20:05.190 --> 20:06.990
the one who will deploy the device

526
20:06.990 --> 20:08.880
to also have the capability to do things.

527
20:08.880 --> 20:11.529
So we really need to think as a kind

528
20:11.529 --> 20:14.040
of a 360 offering from the design

529
20:14.040 --> 20:15.270
up to the devices in the field

530
20:15.270 --> 20:16.620
and then the refurbish as well,

531
20:16.620 --> 20:18.180
because this is where it is gonna be key.

532
20:18.180 --> 20:20.550
You need to think globally to that.

533
20:20.550 --> 20:22.470
<v ->Yeah, that's a great answer, thank you.</v>

534
20:22.470 --> 20:24.540
Okay, so we're gonna start

535
20:24.540 --> 20:26.640
to shift into the solutions.

536
20:26.640 --> 20:29.220
So, but before we do that, so Sri maybe one last question

537
20:29.220 --> 20:30.820
to kinda help lead us into that.

538
20:31.822 --> 20:35.280
So how is the cybersecurity community developing

539
20:35.280 --> 20:37.680
best practices and guidelines

540
20:37.680 --> 20:39.690
to help companies navigate these challenges

541
20:39.690 --> 20:41.665
that we've just been talking about?

542
20:41.665 --> 20:44.820
So what are you seeing in from that space?

543
20:44.820 --> 20:48.480
<v ->Well, so it's been kind of interesting</v>

544
20:48.480 --> 20:51.420
because people look at it, mean if you took,

545
20:51.420 --> 20:53.040
if you take a typical IoT system,

546
20:53.040 --> 20:56.700
there's a device, there's a network, there's an application.

547
20:56.700 --> 20:59.310
And so when they come up with standards

548
20:59.310 --> 21:00.330
and regulations around,

549
21:00.330 --> 21:02.670
or come up with standards to say how to secure this,

550
21:02.670 --> 21:04.680
they're looking at it from network and application,

551
21:04.680 --> 21:07.110
which are easy.

552
21:07.110 --> 21:08.100
I shouldn't say easy.

553
21:08.100 --> 21:11.550
There are existing best practices that they can bring to it

554
21:11.550 --> 21:15.270
to make it all happen like from the IT side, right?

555
21:15.270 --> 21:16.710
But devices are very unique.

556
21:16.710 --> 21:19.890
It's not a laptop, it's not something like router

557
21:19.890 --> 21:20.970
or something that's known.

558
21:20.970 --> 21:24.870
So now device ecosystems are very fragmented,

559
21:24.870 --> 21:26.820
because it's where you create a device

560
21:26.820 --> 21:28.560
for a particular use case.

561
21:28.560 --> 21:31.560
So which means it may have its own operating system

562
21:31.560 --> 21:34.020
or maybe even a proprietary operating system.

563
21:34.020 --> 21:36.780
And the skillset to manage those devices

564
21:36.780 --> 21:39.450
to make sure that those devices are secure,

565
21:39.450 --> 21:40.283
are really hard.

566
21:40.283 --> 21:42.153
That's a big challenge, right?

567
21:43.885 --> 21:45.360
So companies cannot hire enough people

568
21:45.360 --> 21:47.220
that understand all of that.

569
21:47.220 --> 21:50.790
So just as you were talking about the whole life cycle,

570
21:50.790 --> 21:53.250
it's almost like the device manufacturers to make sure

571
21:53.250 --> 21:55.290
that the skill sets translate,

572
21:55.290 --> 21:57.600
get sold along with those devices to make sure

573
21:57.600 --> 22:00.630
that enterprises understand those challenges

574
22:00.630 --> 22:02.400
of managing those devices.

575
22:02.400 --> 22:03.720
<v ->Yeah, good, okay.</v>

576
22:03.720 --> 22:05.130
So let's get into some of the specifics

577
22:05.130 --> 22:06.060
and thank you Sri.

578
22:06.060 --> 22:07.452
So Eric, we'll go to you first.

579
22:07.452 --> 22:08.285
<v ->Sure.</v>

580
22:08.285 --> 22:12.120
<v ->What key standards are IoT companies needing</v>

581
22:12.120 --> 22:13.650
to be aware of these days?

582
22:13.650 --> 22:15.480
'Cause I know there's a lot of 'em.

583
22:15.480 --> 22:18.510
There's regional ones, there's vertical based ones.

584
22:18.510 --> 22:20.460
So, but let's just talk about a couple here

585
22:20.460 --> 22:22.299
that might be very relevant for the group.

586
22:22.299 --> 22:23.970
<v ->Well, yeah, and I'll,</v>

587
22:23.970 --> 22:25.410
there's obviously there's a lot to say here,

588
22:25.410 --> 22:27.803
so feel free to cut me off if we need to move on.

589
22:29.385 --> 22:31.050
But as we were discussing earlier, you know,

590
22:31.050 --> 22:33.630
it has historically principally been just a question

591
22:33.630 --> 22:37.140
of what's the risk, what's the risk of breach,

592
22:37.140 --> 22:39.840
or you know, some sort of catastrophic loss

593
22:39.840 --> 22:41.460
and the, you know, potential lawsuits

594
22:41.460 --> 22:42.870
that might result from that.

595
22:42.870 --> 22:46.410
Now things have shifted a bit more to the question

596
22:46.410 --> 22:49.260
of what sort of penalties might I face

597
22:49.260 --> 22:50.850
if I do end up having a breach

598
22:50.850 --> 22:52.950
or some operating problem with my system

599
22:52.950 --> 22:54.870
as a result of cybersecurity.

600
22:54.870 --> 22:57.340
And I would say that the dominant

601
22:58.200 --> 23:02.640
force in this arena is the EU Cybersecurity Resilience Act,

602
23:02.640 --> 23:06.720
which just got finalized at the end of 2024.

603
23:06.720 --> 23:09.843
You know, it'll begin coming into force in 2026,

604
23:10.852 --> 23:13.620
but even, and fully enforced in 2027.

605
23:13.620 --> 23:16.743
But now, you know, well before then, now,

606
23:17.700 --> 23:19.380
you are seeing companies

607
23:19.380 --> 23:21.690
that are requiring their vendors

608
23:21.690 --> 23:24.390
to demonstrate their compliance with the CRA,

609
23:24.390 --> 23:27.060
because design cycles are long enough that, you know,

610
23:27.060 --> 23:29.610
you can't say, oh, I'll wait until 2026

611
23:29.610 --> 23:34.080
and then see whether I or my vendors are in compliance.

612
23:34.080 --> 23:36.330
You have to be much more proactive than that.

613
23:37.300 --> 23:38.640
And you know, with the CRA,

614
23:38.640 --> 23:41.370
the potential penalties are significant,

615
23:41.370 --> 23:46.143
from massive fines to denial of market access to the EU.

616
23:47.382 --> 23:48.360
And you know, this is something,

617
23:48.360 --> 23:49.980
in the same way that California

618
23:49.980 --> 23:53.490
vehicle emission standards end up, you know,

619
23:53.490 --> 23:55.050
driving vehicle emission standards

620
23:55.050 --> 23:56.820
for the entirety of the United States,

621
23:56.820 --> 24:00.840
the standards that that the EU is setting will

622
24:00.840 --> 24:03.300
end up driving global cybersecurity standards.

623
24:03.300 --> 24:05.760
Because as long as you are selling into the EU

624
24:05.760 --> 24:08.460
or you sell to a company that sells into the EU,

625
24:08.460 --> 24:10.080
you're going to be subject in one way

626
24:10.080 --> 24:13.620
or another to the Cyber Resilience Act.

627
24:13.620 --> 24:15.600
And so this is the conversation

628
24:15.600 --> 24:17.100
that we are having over and over again.

629
24:17.100 --> 24:19.200
And it's interesting to note that we've sort

630
24:19.200 --> 24:23.190
of seen this ratcheting up slowly the awareness

631
24:23.190 --> 24:24.510
in the United States, I should say,

632
24:24.510 --> 24:27.510
because, you know, in Europe I think there's been,

633
24:27.510 --> 24:28.710
whether because of the GDPR

634
24:28.710 --> 24:30.510
or because, you know, it's obvious

635
24:30.510 --> 24:33.959
that there's been this strong move in the direction

636
24:33.959 --> 24:34.950
of cybersecurity regulations

637
24:34.950 --> 24:37.500
that will carry significant penalties.

638
24:37.500 --> 24:40.080
There's been, I think higher level of awareness

639
24:40.080 --> 24:42.048
among European companies

640
24:42.048 --> 24:44.190
of what is out there now and what is coming.

641
24:44.190 --> 24:47.010
That awareness is just starting to shift

642
24:47.010 --> 24:48.180
dramatically in the United States.

643
24:48.180 --> 24:49.920
We've seen it go gradually shifting,

644
24:49.920 --> 24:52.320
but it is becoming more pronounced.

645
24:52.320 --> 24:55.620
Now, and as you mentioned, there are all sorts of standards,

646
24:55.620 --> 24:59.490
international, regional, vertical specific,

647
24:59.490 --> 25:01.800
and it's a complicated environment.

648
25:01.800 --> 25:04.053
But one thing that is,

649
25:05.353 --> 25:06.186
and the idea of the,

650
25:06.186 --> 25:07.019
I'm sure that the idea of trying

651
25:07.019 --> 25:08.400
to figure out how do I comply with all this,

652
25:08.400 --> 25:10.200
is daunting for most companies,

653
25:10.200 --> 25:12.510
but the one significant piece

654
25:12.510 --> 25:15.720
of good news is that these standards, these certifications,

655
25:15.720 --> 25:18.150
the requirements, they're all borrowing from one another

656
25:18.150 --> 25:20.070
and they're based on, you know,

657
25:20.070 --> 25:23.490
a fairly robust set of common criteria.

658
25:23.490 --> 25:25.290
And it is possible, you know,

659
25:25.290 --> 25:27.540
to focus on those common criteria.

660
25:27.540 --> 25:30.840
Once you make sure that your company is aligned with those,

661
25:30.840 --> 25:33.360
then it's the effort to obtain, you know,

662
25:33.360 --> 25:34.440
the Singapore certification

663
25:34.440 --> 25:36.190
or ensure that you're in compliance

664
25:37.028 --> 25:39.030
with the CRA is not as big of a step.

665
25:39.030 --> 25:40.890
I don't want to trivialize it,

666
25:40.890 --> 25:41.910
because it's still,

667
25:41.910 --> 25:43.620
there are a lot of specifics

668
25:43.620 --> 25:46.270
in the different regional standards and requirements.

669
25:48.510 --> 25:51.450
But once you look at those core common requirements,

670
25:51.450 --> 25:53.400
that are a lot of the very basic blocking

671
25:53.400 --> 25:55.320
and tackling of cybersecurity.

672
25:55.320 --> 25:57.150
If you can cross that bar,

673
25:57.150 --> 25:59.730
you've come a long way towards meeting

674
25:59.730 --> 26:02.820
the broader and multifaceted requirements

675
26:02.820 --> 26:04.770
that you see internationally.

676
26:04.770 --> 26:05.970
<v ->That was great advice.</v>

677
26:05.970 --> 26:07.890
And I do agree, I feel like the,

678
26:07.890 --> 26:12.540
I've heard the CRA talked about in the light of GDPR,

679
26:12.540 --> 26:14.280
but bigger and more impactful.

680
26:14.280 --> 26:17.610
So it is something that I think is a big deal

681
26:17.610 --> 26:19.530
and a good point about being a vendor

682
26:19.530 --> 26:22.390
or a supplier to a larger maybe operator

683
26:23.410 --> 26:25.020
or OEM machine builder, right?

684
26:25.020 --> 26:27.060
That you're gonna need to be responsible, so.

685
26:27.060 --> 26:28.292
<v ->Right.</v>

686
26:28.292 --> 26:29.940
And this, you know, that construct is one

687
26:29.940 --> 26:31.440
that you saw play out in the United States

688
26:31.440 --> 26:35.160
when the US government dating from my time

689
26:35.160 --> 26:36.750
at the White House in the Obama administration,

690
26:36.750 --> 26:38.040
there was still high level

691
26:38.040 --> 26:40.710
of fear about imposing mandatory

692
26:40.710 --> 26:43.770
cybersecurity regulations on industry, you know,

693
26:43.770 --> 26:44.880
except with some exceptions.

694
26:44.880 --> 26:47.790
One being Department of Defense procurement

695
26:47.790 --> 26:48.810
where Department of Defense

696
26:48.810 --> 26:50.310
was willing to impose certain requirements

697
26:50.310 --> 26:52.920
on DOD contractors selling directly into the government.

698
26:52.920 --> 26:54.000
But those trickle down

699
26:54.000 --> 26:58.560
and out to all the companies that supply DOD contractors.

700
26:58.560 --> 27:01.170
And you see the same thing happening with CRA,

701
27:01.170 --> 27:03.180
with other other cybersecurity regulations.

702
27:03.180 --> 27:04.013
<v Ellen>Yeah.</v>

703
27:04.013 --> 27:04.846
Awesome, thank you.

704
27:04.846 --> 27:06.060
<v ->I think, can I add a little bit to that?</v>

705
27:06.060 --> 27:07.980
'Cause I think something that's also really important

706
27:07.980 --> 27:09.420
to think about is,

707
27:09.420 --> 27:11.700
if you think about it from an organizational perspective,

708
27:11.700 --> 27:13.710
you've got all of these different regulations

709
27:13.710 --> 27:15.630
that are coming at you, you're like, what do I do?

710
27:15.630 --> 27:18.150
And you talked a great deal about the commonalities

711
27:18.150 --> 27:20.130
between all of 'em, which is important,

712
27:20.130 --> 27:21.420
but in order to think back

713
27:21.420 --> 27:22.890
as to how you wanna really protect that,

714
27:22.890 --> 27:24.180
you've gotta think about the data

715
27:24.180 --> 27:26.280
and how the data is going to be used

716
27:26.280 --> 27:30.570
and where the data is of utmost importance.

717
27:30.570 --> 27:33.060
You know, so you wanna figure out something,

718
27:33.060 --> 27:35.130
you wanna figure out a way to really,

719
27:35.130 --> 27:37.080
if you're a global organization,

720
27:37.080 --> 27:40.050
you have to be able to unify the user experience.

721
27:40.050 --> 27:42.212
You have to be able to make this work

722
27:42.212 --> 27:47.212
throughout all of your, you know, organizations globally.

723
27:47.310 --> 27:48.810
And that's also another part

724
27:48.810 --> 27:50.040
that I think the regulations

725
27:50.040 --> 27:52.290
are kind of trying to get there,

726
27:52.290 --> 27:53.700
but I don't think they quite know how,

727
27:53.700 --> 27:55.020
because it's really difficult.

728
27:55.020 --> 27:56.970
I mean, you've got the different verticals,

729
27:56.970 --> 27:58.770
you've got everything else that's going on.

730
27:58.770 --> 28:01.740
So, you know, don't panic I guess

731
28:01.740 --> 28:04.350
is the best thing that I'm trying to lay out here.

732
28:04.350 --> 28:06.570
You know, just think about what's the core

733
28:06.570 --> 28:08.340
and what's most important

734
28:08.340 --> 28:10.020
and gradually get there, you know.

735
28:10.020 --> 28:10.950
It's like everything else,

736
28:10.950 --> 28:12.570
it's like putting on one shoe at a time,

737
28:12.570 --> 28:14.100
dressing in the morning, putting on, you know,

738
28:14.100 --> 28:15.720
one pant leg at a time.

739
28:15.720 --> 28:16.860
<v ->Yeah, and I think that's also</v>

740
28:16.860 --> 28:19.740
why we are here as partners

741
28:19.740 --> 28:22.923
and cybersecurity experts to sort of help there as well.

742
28:23.820 --> 28:24.653
So thank you.

743
28:24.653 --> 28:28.590
So Greg, let's go to your perspective.

744
28:28.590 --> 28:30.900
How are these regulations driving behavior?

745
28:30.900 --> 28:33.060
Are you seeing different customers coming to you?

746
28:33.060 --> 28:34.950
Obviously, Thales has a lot of expertise

747
28:34.950 --> 28:36.270
around this area,

748
28:36.270 --> 28:38.310
but what are you seeing from behavior

749
28:38.310 --> 28:39.810
changes as a result of this?

750
28:39.810 --> 28:42.510
<v ->So the first is, I think one thing that was said</v>

751
28:42.510 --> 28:44.700
is that when you are looking at IoT devices,

752
28:44.700 --> 28:45.570
it's always,

753
28:45.570 --> 28:47.520
there are IoT devices that are expensive,

754
28:47.520 --> 28:50.850
but most of them it's, they're very cost sensitive.

755
28:50.850 --> 28:53.430
So when you are talking about security,

756
28:53.430 --> 28:54.963
always there is a price.

757
28:55.808 --> 28:57.177
And in the past it was difficult for people to say,

758
28:57.177 --> 28:59.250
ah, should I put that on top?

759
28:59.250 --> 29:00.401
How can I manage it?

760
29:00.401 --> 29:01.234
And so on.

761
29:01.234 --> 29:02.067
It's complex.

762
29:02.067 --> 29:03.360
I already have my IT, so they say, okay,

763
29:03.360 --> 29:05.460
from the IT infrastructure, maybe I can do something.

764
29:05.460 --> 29:07.293
But it was limited and that

765
29:07.293 --> 29:08.823
that was the real difficulty.

766
29:09.743 --> 29:12.750
Now, when the CRA will impose fines,

767
29:12.750 --> 29:14.684
the red was already there.

768
29:14.684 --> 29:16.650
The US trustmark also in the US will come.

769
29:16.650 --> 29:18.627
I think it's changing completely the mindset

770
29:18.627 --> 29:20.640
of the overall ecosystem

771
29:20.640 --> 29:22.860
or the overall value chain on the IoT.

772
29:22.860 --> 29:24.990
People know, say I have to do something,

773
29:24.990 --> 29:28.230
I have to protect my device and they will be proactive.

774
29:28.230 --> 29:29.700
The main difficulty that they have

775
29:29.700 --> 29:32.010
is that it's not the same when you're talking about security

776
29:32.010 --> 29:33.840
for the IT or the IT monitoring.,

777
29:33.840 --> 29:36.150
IoT is completely different and it's new.

778
29:36.150 --> 29:37.860
And I think with the way we see it,

779
29:37.860 --> 29:38.850
we see a lot of companies

780
29:38.850 --> 29:41.903
that are a little bit lost on the regulation,

781
29:41.903 --> 29:45.385
exactly what it means for them, what they have to do.

782
29:45.385 --> 29:46.260
If they have to go inside, it means,

783
29:46.260 --> 29:47.250
I think that was the point of Sri,

784
29:47.250 --> 29:48.660
they need to have experts

785
29:48.660 --> 29:50.370
to understand exactly the way to do it.

786
29:50.370 --> 29:51.780
So they should turn to companies

787
29:51.780 --> 29:55.170
who can help them on understanding what it means for them.

788
29:55.170 --> 29:58.260
Making kind of threat assessment, consultancy services,

789
29:58.260 --> 29:59.670
review all the architecture

790
29:59.670 --> 30:01.230
just to help them to understand

791
30:01.230 --> 30:02.580
what are the different things

792
30:02.580 --> 30:05.910
that they will have to put in place to be compliant

793
30:05.910 --> 30:07.980
to those regulations and new standards.

794
30:07.980 --> 30:10.620
So for us and for everyone I think here,

795
30:10.620 --> 30:12.690
it's a benefit because at least all the things

796
30:12.690 --> 30:13.523
that we have done,

797
30:13.523 --> 30:14.520
all the investment that we have done

798
30:14.520 --> 30:16.770
on cybersecurity will lead

799
30:16.770 --> 30:20.520
and will path the way to help customer on those engagements.

800
30:20.520 --> 30:22.800
And we need to support them on making the right

801
30:22.800 --> 30:24.480
implementation on what they have to do

802
30:24.480 --> 30:26.010
to be compliant to that.

803
30:26.010 --> 30:28.860
And I think today we're only talking about compliancy.

804
30:28.860 --> 30:31.290
If in the future there will be a need also

805
30:31.290 --> 30:33.870
to certify those products that will come

806
30:33.870 --> 30:35.580
and that's another step that will come

807
30:35.580 --> 30:37.230
and when you go for certification,

808
30:37.230 --> 30:39.990
that's another level of what needs to be done.

809
30:39.990 --> 30:40.920
<v Eric>Can I just add one thing?</v>

810
30:40.920 --> 30:42.540
<v Ellen>Yes, please.</v>
<v ->Quickly on,</v>

811
30:42.540 --> 30:44.372
because you were asking about behavior changes.

812
30:44.372 --> 30:45.205
<v Ellen>Yep.</v>

813
30:45.205 --> 30:46.038
<v ->And one of the questions</v>

814
30:46.038 --> 30:46.871
we're getting a lot and questions,

815
30:46.871 --> 30:48.750
internal questions that companies are asking

816
30:48.750 --> 30:50.370
is about supply chain.

817
30:50.370 --> 30:53.190
And if you look at, you know, the focus of some

818
30:53.190 --> 30:56.100
of the bigger movements in the United States regulation

819
30:56.100 --> 30:59.250
of cybersecurity focus around China and supply chain.

820
30:59.250 --> 31:01.170
And so we get a lot of questions about do I need

821
31:01.170 --> 31:03.240
to stop using Chinese components?

822
31:03.240 --> 31:06.390
Do I need to stop having R &amp; D done in China?

823
31:06.390 --> 31:09.240
And to echo what Gregory was saying,

824
31:09.240 --> 31:11.460
there's a lot of ambiguity.

825
31:11.460 --> 31:12.720
It's hard to know exactly

826
31:12.720 --> 31:14.340
how some of the regulations

827
31:14.340 --> 31:16.350
and some of the work that Department of Commerce is doing,

828
31:16.350 --> 31:17.970
whether the connected vehicle rule,

829
31:17.970 --> 31:19.980
whether they're proposed drone rule,

830
31:19.980 --> 31:21.540
data centers are next,

831
31:21.540 --> 31:23.730
there's investigations of wireless routers.

832
31:23.730 --> 31:25.860
Like, it's hard to know exactly

833
31:25.860 --> 31:27.090
how this is gonna be enforced

834
31:27.090 --> 31:29.310
and what limits the US government is going

835
31:29.310 --> 31:32.610
to impose on supply chain going through China.

836
31:32.610 --> 31:35.460
Which is an incredibly challenging question,

837
31:35.460 --> 31:38.520
because the supply chain is inherently global

838
31:38.520 --> 31:41.430
and most roads go through China on the way

839
31:41.430 --> 31:43.290
to delivering an IoT product.

840
31:43.290 --> 31:45.300
And that is a behavioral question that a lot

841
31:45.300 --> 31:47.913
of companies have been coming to us to ask about.

842
31:49.080 --> 31:50.130
What do we need to do

843
31:50.130 --> 31:53.250
with respect to supply chain in order to address

844
31:53.250 --> 31:56.325
this question about restrictions on supply chain?

845
31:56.325 --> 31:58.020
<v ->Yeah, that's a great point.</v>

846
31:58.020 --> 32:00.780
Yeah, I know from my perspective, we, at my company,

847
32:00.780 --> 32:03.060
we're all about authentication, encryption,

848
32:03.060 --> 32:04.650
secure connections

849
32:04.650 --> 32:07.743
and identity based, you know,

850
32:07.743 --> 32:10.470
with certificates in order to connect to a device

851
32:10.470 --> 32:14.010
and then be able to push firmware that you have signed

852
32:14.010 --> 32:15.540
and that you know the origin of that.

853
32:15.540 --> 32:17.040
So a lot of it is about trust

854
32:17.040 --> 32:18.280
and establishing trust

855
32:19.530 --> 32:20.610
at all the layers.

856
32:20.610 --> 32:22.740
So trusting the hardware and the components

857
32:22.740 --> 32:24.600
and the chip sets that you're using

858
32:24.600 --> 32:25.620
and then being able to trust

859
32:25.620 --> 32:27.210
all the software that runs on it.

860
32:27.210 --> 32:28.650
So doing the full risk assessments

861
32:28.650 --> 32:30.300
and understanding are there any open source.

862
32:30.300 --> 32:32.160
And we've been doing this for years now,

863
32:32.160 --> 32:34.830
but I think it's becoming more and more important to be able

864
32:34.830 --> 32:38.070
to know that, you know, what sort of code is running inside

865
32:38.070 --> 32:39.750
of your devices and inside of the system.

866
32:39.750 --> 32:42.150
So there's some basic things around, again,

867
32:42.150 --> 32:44.940
secure firmware updates and update ability

868
32:44.940 --> 32:46.860
and all of that that I think we're seeing coming out

869
32:46.860 --> 32:48.540
in these standards that's important

870
32:48.540 --> 32:49.770
to have processes around.

871
32:49.770 --> 32:51.870
And it's not just, to Trisha's point earlier,

872
32:51.870 --> 32:55.980
it's not just once and done, it's an evolution.

873
32:55.980 --> 32:58.350
And because we've deployed these devices,

874
32:58.350 --> 32:59.790
whether in a connected vehicle,

875
32:59.790 --> 33:02.010
whether they're connected smart meters

876
33:02.010 --> 33:03.270
and they're deployed everywhere

877
33:03.270 --> 33:06.090
and they're, it's you physically,

878
33:06.090 --> 33:08.160
it's a big pain to go out to them.

879
33:08.160 --> 33:10.680
We have to be able to connect them remotely, securely,

880
33:10.680 --> 33:12.540
to be able to maintain this over time.

881
33:12.540 --> 33:15.420
So anyway, just a little bit of my side there.

882
33:15.420 --> 33:19.743
So let's go Erik, from a Vodafone perspective,

883
33:20.667 --> 33:21.870
what do you guys do

884
33:21.870 --> 33:24.840
to help your customers navigate this?

885
33:24.840 --> 33:26.190
<v ->Yep.</v>
<v ->Specifically solution wise?</v>

886
33:26.190 --> 33:27.960
<v ->Yep, and I think that fits in very well</v>

887
33:27.960 --> 33:30.720
with what the colleagues here have been saying

888
33:30.720 --> 33:32.340
also including standards.

889
33:32.340 --> 33:35.850
So first of all, what we do is for any customer,

890
33:35.850 --> 33:38.940
we do not just make our own system,

891
33:38.940 --> 33:40.440
which is the connectivity secure.

892
33:40.440 --> 33:42.600
We really look from the customer's device

893
33:42.600 --> 33:45.030
all the way into the customer system,

894
33:45.030 --> 33:47.820
the transport of data, that needs to be secure.

895
33:47.820 --> 33:48.930
And we are the specialists

896
33:48.930 --> 33:50.970
for the connectivity part of this.

897
33:50.970 --> 33:54.390
And at the same time we also consult the customer

898
33:54.390 --> 33:56.700
on how to secure their hardware

899
33:56.700 --> 33:58.950
and how to secure the interfaces we have.

900
33:58.950 --> 34:00.420
You mentioned it yourself,

901
34:00.420 --> 34:03.990
our connectivity service is secure by design.

902
34:03.990 --> 34:06.450
From the beginning we've always watched out

903
34:06.450 --> 34:08.970
that all the potential entry points

904
34:08.970 --> 34:12.210
such as entering the data tunnel

905
34:12.210 --> 34:15.660
or addressing a device is impossible

906
34:15.660 --> 34:17.790
with our IoT connectivity service.

907
34:17.790 --> 34:19.920
In previous times, 10 years ago,

908
34:19.920 --> 34:23.100
lots of IoT companies still put a consumer SIM

909
34:23.100 --> 34:24.420
into their device.

910
34:24.420 --> 34:26.640
If you knew the phone number of that consumer SIM,

911
34:26.640 --> 34:27.963
you could just call it,

912
34:28.989 --> 34:30.090
reverse engineer some commands

913
34:30.090 --> 34:32.430
and you're inside the system, that's impossible.

914
34:32.430 --> 34:35.580
We have authentication mechanisms, we have encryption,

915
34:35.580 --> 34:37.590
we monitor the data tunnel

916
34:37.590 --> 34:40.950
and recently we've also started to use AI

917
34:40.950 --> 34:43.530
in order to understand the specific behavior

918
34:43.530 --> 34:45.750
of each device, which is out there.

919
34:45.750 --> 34:48.180
And if a device behaves differently

920
34:48.180 --> 34:49.650
from the expectation.

921
34:49.650 --> 34:52.350
If for example, a meter starts sending loads

922
34:52.350 --> 34:53.370
and loads of data,

923
34:53.370 --> 34:55.860
even though you only expect the register value,

924
34:55.860 --> 34:58.350
then we look deeper into that

925
34:58.350 --> 35:00.240
and see is that a problem?

926
35:00.240 --> 35:04.080
Finally, we also build on all the investments

927
35:04.080 --> 35:08.250
into the security systems that Vodafone has done

928
35:08.250 --> 35:10.440
and we also consult our customers

929
35:10.440 --> 35:14.670
and we stick to all the standards that you mentioned before

930
35:14.670 --> 35:16.620
and you also mentioned.

931
35:16.620 --> 35:17.703
<v ->Okay, thank you.</v>

932
35:18.990 --> 35:20.490
So Trish, maybe one more for you,

933
35:20.490 --> 35:24.120
anything else to add about what Aeris does specifically

934
35:24.120 --> 35:26.190
to help your customers with this?

935
35:26.190 --> 35:29.160
<v ->Yes, I mean very, very similar.</v>

936
35:29.160 --> 35:32.370
We, because of the way that Aeris was originally, you know,

937
35:32.370 --> 35:34.380
brought up and and developed in the industry,

938
35:34.380 --> 35:36.510
we've been around for more than 30 years,

939
35:36.510 --> 35:38.190
and the fact that we were originally built

940
35:38.190 --> 35:40.950
on a connectivity, we have our own core network.

941
35:40.950 --> 35:43.923
We partner with all of the big MNOs, MVNOs,

942
35:45.030 --> 35:47.550
or I shouldn't say all, almost all of them,

943
35:47.550 --> 35:49.290
in which we help them, you know,

944
35:49.290 --> 35:51.330
as they're protecting the infrastructure

945
35:51.330 --> 35:52.380
and those types of things,

946
35:52.380 --> 35:55.950
we look at it from a perspective of our,

947
35:55.950 --> 35:57.150
it's a new product we're getting ready

948
35:57.150 --> 35:59.940
to launch out called our watchtower solution,

949
35:59.940 --> 36:01.380
in which we can sit there

950
36:01.380 --> 36:05.520
and look at suspicious, malicious,

951
36:05.520 --> 36:09.420
abnormal activity that is occurring within the devices.

952
36:09.420 --> 36:10.770
We allow you to turn around

953
36:10.770 --> 36:13.950
and think about it from a per device perspective.

954
36:13.950 --> 36:15.270
Like I'd mentioned earlier,

955
36:15.270 --> 36:16.350
if I'm seeing some type

956
36:16.350 --> 36:19.230
of anomaly or if I'm seeing the device all

957
36:19.230 --> 36:21.480
of a sudden calling out, I might wanna say, you know what?

958
36:21.480 --> 36:23.580
I need to sequester this one device

959
36:23.580 --> 36:25.500
without taking the whole infrastructure down

960
36:25.500 --> 36:27.313
or without taking the whole group down,

961
36:27.313 --> 36:28.920
because you need to maintain

962
36:28.920 --> 36:33.240
some of this interaction that's going on.

963
36:33.240 --> 36:37.168
But our solution itself allows you to really look at it

964
36:37.168 --> 36:40.020
and start to put together policies and programs.

965
36:40.020 --> 36:42.540
And because of the fact that we have done this

966
36:42.540 --> 36:44.850
from what we classified as as the core network

967
36:44.850 --> 36:48.884
and working with all the big partners out there,

968
36:48.884 --> 36:49.980
the carrier partners,

969
36:49.980 --> 36:54.980
it allows us to really create a unified user experience.

970
36:55.892 --> 36:58.276
So what you can create from policies,

971
36:58.276 --> 37:01.380
regardless of which carrier you're using under the covers,

972
37:01.380 --> 37:03.510
really allows us to, you know,

973
37:03.510 --> 37:04.620
or you as the vendor,

974
37:04.620 --> 37:06.870
the company to turn around and say, hey,

975
37:06.870 --> 37:08.910
I'm gonna have this type of user experience

976
37:08.910 --> 37:11.550
regardless if I'm, you know,

977
37:11.550 --> 37:14.880
working throughout from a global perspective.

978
37:14.880 --> 37:17.160
You also need to think about, you know, there's a lot

979
37:17.160 --> 37:19.890
of great technology that has been put into play.

980
37:19.890 --> 37:21.540
We just depend to an add on.

981
37:21.540 --> 37:23.636
We're not telling you to get rid

982
37:23.636 --> 37:24.660
of your existing infrastructures.

983
37:24.660 --> 37:27.570
It's not something that you want to,

984
37:27.570 --> 37:30.150
because you're always gonna harden your infrastructure.

985
37:30.150 --> 37:32.010
You're gonna harden what's what's happening,

986
37:32.010 --> 37:33.480
you know, and what's going on.

987
37:33.480 --> 37:35.100
But you wanna be able to add to it

988
37:35.100 --> 37:38.160
and really think more from the device perspective.

989
37:38.160 --> 37:39.960
And that's one of the key areas

990
37:39.960 --> 37:44.280
that Aeris has been able to really focus on lately.

991
37:44.280 --> 37:45.243
<v ->Okay, thank you.</v>

992
37:46.410 --> 37:47.610
Okay, so just looking at time,

993
37:47.610 --> 37:49.530
I think this will probably be our last question.

994
37:49.530 --> 37:53.130
So Sri like to get your thoughts on this.

995
37:53.130 --> 37:54.330
I mentioned it in the beginning

996
37:54.330 --> 37:57.180
and obviously we've had a lot of conversation here,

997
37:57.180 --> 38:00.930
good advice from some very experts in this space,

998
38:00.930 --> 38:01.880
thought leadership,

999
38:02.762 --> 38:04.830
what is IMC as an organization doing

1000
38:04.830 --> 38:07.410
to help make and drive awareness?

1001
38:07.410 --> 38:10.380
And then also maybe more practical advice

1002
38:10.380 --> 38:13.470
about what to do, really, like where do you put your money

1003
38:13.470 --> 38:16.140
and your budgets in 2025 to help start

1004
38:16.140 --> 38:18.270
to tackle some of these things?

1005
38:18.270 --> 38:19.950
<v ->Yeah, I think that's a great question.</v>

1006
38:19.950 --> 38:22.860
So till now, all of the good chunk

1007
38:22.860 --> 38:25.050
of the standards have been very vertical oriented.

1008
38:25.050 --> 38:27.120
They've been per industry and so on.

1009
38:27.120 --> 38:29.430
But what we've seen from the regulatory side

1010
38:29.430 --> 38:32.790
is that with the CRA and so on, it's very horizontal.

1011
38:32.790 --> 38:34.641
And so now,

1012
38:34.641 --> 38:36.150
and just as you were mentioning, right?

1013
38:36.150 --> 38:38.700
There are some core standards like NIST2

1014
38:38.700 --> 38:40.680
and the NIST that have been added into that.

1015
38:40.680 --> 38:43.140
So there's a lot of commonality

1016
38:43.140 --> 38:47.220
that we can actually take and we can make it practical.

1017
38:47.220 --> 38:49.560
So IMC is partnering with GCF,

1018
38:49.560 --> 38:51.610
which is a global certification forum

1019
38:52.950 --> 38:56.430
and we've created a joint task force to actually explore

1020
38:56.430 --> 38:59.490
how we can create practical guidelines to make sure

1021
38:59.490 --> 39:02.116
that we can have the IoT ecosystem

1022
39:02.116 --> 39:04.050
adopt those practical guidelines

1023
39:04.050 --> 39:07.257
to be secure and also be compliant with CRA

1024
39:07.257 --> 39:10.383
and all the other emerging regulations on it.

1025
39:11.250 --> 39:13.009
<v Ellen>Awesome, thank you.</v>

1026
39:13.009 --> 39:15.330
<v ->And this joint task force is open</v>

1027
39:15.330 --> 39:18.120
to the membership and so we would welcome more members

1028
39:18.120 --> 39:20.400
to actually come in and participate in that,

1029
39:20.400 --> 39:24.030
so you can contribute your ideas

1030
39:24.030 --> 39:27.810
and see how we can take existing standards

1031
39:27.810 --> 39:30.513
and make it more tailored to what we want to do.

1032
39:31.410 --> 39:33.150
<v ->Great, thank you.</v>

1033
39:33.150 --> 39:36.390
Well, as I mentioned, this was a very quick session

1034
39:36.390 --> 39:38.880
with a lot of topics to cover.

1035
39:38.880 --> 39:40.950
So first of all I'd like to say thank you

1036
39:40.950 --> 39:43.260
to all the panelists for coming here,

1037
39:43.260 --> 39:44.770
for sharing your expertise

1038
39:45.810 --> 39:47.970
and bringing the conversation to light a bit more.

1039
39:47.970 --> 39:49.770
So we'll be here staying after.

1040
39:49.770 --> 39:52.650
I think the next session starts in about 20 minutes.

1041
39:52.650 --> 39:54.270
So feel free to come up to us

1042
39:54.270 --> 39:56.730
and ask any more questions or feedback.

1043
39:56.730 --> 39:58.113
Always welcome to that.

1044
39:58.980 --> 40:00.690
And again, here's a list of some

1045
40:00.690 --> 40:02.400
of the member companies of the IMC.

1046
40:02.400 --> 40:05.070
If you have questions about IMC, happy to answer that too.

1047
40:05.070 --> 40:06.570
Love to have more people in the conversation.

1048
40:06.570 --> 40:09.203
So thank you everyone and enjoy the rest of the show.

1049
40:10.448 --> 40:13.031
