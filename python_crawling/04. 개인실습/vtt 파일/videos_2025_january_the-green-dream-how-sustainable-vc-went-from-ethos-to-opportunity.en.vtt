00:00.315 --> 00:02.898
(upbeat music)

00:10.710 --> 00:13.140
<v ->Well, I wanna thank you all so much for coming out</v>

00:13.140 --> 00:15.000
here to CES 2025

00:15.000 --> 00:17.490
participating in some of our excellent conference,

00:17.490 --> 00:18.390
panel sessions.

00:18.390 --> 00:21.870
I am really excited to be here today for this panel,

00:21.870 --> 00:22.920
which is The Green Dream,

00:22.920 --> 00:27.900
how sustainable VC went from ethos to opportunity.

00:27.900 --> 00:29.430
Opportunity is gonna be the operating word

00:29.430 --> 00:30.467
that we're gonna focus on today, right?

00:30.467 --> 00:32.550
'Cause when we think about what innovation

00:32.550 --> 00:35.880
and what technology is designed for, it's designed to,

00:35.880 --> 00:39.660
we designed it to address conflict, challenge, obstacles.

00:39.660 --> 00:41.520
And many times when we think about our changing world,

00:41.520 --> 00:44.850
whether that's climate change or the sustainability story,

00:44.850 --> 00:47.760
it's an opportunity for technology, innovation

00:47.760 --> 00:49.470
to really drive home some of those solutions

00:49.470 --> 00:51.927
to make a better world, a greener world, and just a,

00:51.927 --> 00:53.340
and a better tomorrow.

00:53.340 --> 00:55.710
So the panelists we're gonna have up here today

00:55.710 --> 00:57.720
are gonna walk through some of those opportunities

00:57.720 --> 00:58.980
from the venture capital side

00:58.980 --> 01:02.460
and how that really translates into action overall.

01:02.460 --> 01:04.980
So to kick things off, I'll just quickly introduce myself

01:04.980 --> 01:07.800
and I'm gonna turn it over to our panelists

01:07.800 --> 01:09.780
and let them introduce who they work for

01:09.780 --> 01:10.800
and their background.

01:10.800 --> 01:12.030
I'm Brian Comiskey,

01:12.030 --> 01:14.220
the senior director of innovation and trends in futurists

01:14.220 --> 01:16.380
at the Consumer Technology Association

01:16.380 --> 01:18.420
owners and producers of CES.

01:18.420 --> 01:20.040
And I'm quite excited to be here.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.080
I help manage our NASDAQ partnership,

01:22.080 --> 01:24.480
which includes thematic indexes

01:24.480 --> 01:26.940
that are licensed out for thematic ETFs,

01:26.940 --> 01:30.150
including a climate technology ETF.

01:30.150 --> 01:32.880
So this is something that's very passionate to me

01:32.880 --> 01:35.490
and I'm really excited to introduce our panelists.

01:35.490 --> 01:37.230
And I'll start to my left with Corinna.

01:37.230 --> 01:39.780
<v ->Hi everybody, my name is Corinna.</v>

01:39.780 --> 01:42.570
I work at Material Impact, I'm a partner there.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.640
We are a VC firm that focuses

01:44.640 --> 01:47.130
on deep tech early stage investments.

01:47.130 --> 01:49.140
So when we're thinking about investments

01:49.140 --> 01:50.880
in the space of sustainability,

01:50.880 --> 01:53.400
at a minimum what we always do is look for opportunities

01:53.400 --> 01:55.110
that's better than what we're doing today.

01:55.110 --> 01:57.090
So that's ingrained in what we're doing.

01:57.090 --> 01:58.890
My background is in electrical engineering,

01:58.890 --> 02:01.470
so I really focus more on the high science, high tech

02:01.470 --> 02:04.200
type of investing at Material Impact.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.650
<v Brain>Excellent. Thank you. Tito. Awesome.</v>

02:05.650 --> 02:08.340
<v ->Hey everybody. Tito Jankowski.</v>

02:08.340 --> 02:10.500
Last year was the highest year on record

02:10.500 --> 02:14.340
to balance the climate, we need to both reduce emissions

02:14.340 --> 02:16.740
and actually take carbon dioxide and pollution

02:16.740 --> 02:19.110
that's in the air, we have to take it back out.

02:19.110 --> 02:22.050
This has been modeled as a trillion dollar opportunity.

02:22.050 --> 02:25.740
AirMiners is a ecosystem and accelerator

02:25.740 --> 02:26.850
for startup companies.

02:26.850 --> 02:31.850
We've accelerated 147 companies or 187 companies

02:32.790 --> 02:35.220
and they've raised $147 million.

02:35.220 --> 02:36.840
And we're explicitly focused

02:36.840 --> 02:39.660
on people taking carbon dioxide out of the air.

02:39.660 --> 02:40.560
Maybe they're storing it,

02:40.560 --> 02:42.900
maybe they're turning it into bricks or materials

02:42.900 --> 02:43.890
or things like that.

02:43.890 --> 02:46.814
And that's why I'm here to here to share about today.

02:46.814 --> 02:47.880
Limor.

02:47.880 --> 02:50.070
<v ->Thank you. Great to see all of you here.</v>

02:50.070 --> 02:51.240
Thank you so much for making time

02:51.240 --> 02:54.000
in today's hectic schedule.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.970
So, Limor Schafman and I'm with LG NOVA.

02:56.970 --> 03:00.150
Very briefly, my background from corporate attorney to tech

03:00.150 --> 03:02.370
to most recently, most relevant,

03:02.370 --> 03:04.620
working with the Telecommunications Industry Association

03:04.620 --> 03:06.810
to create a Smart buildings assessment and standard,

03:06.810 --> 03:09.420
which is now managed by Underwriter Laboratories.

03:09.420 --> 03:11.220
After that joined LG NOVA.

03:11.220 --> 03:14.550
And LG NOVA is an innovation unit for LG Electronics.

03:14.550 --> 03:18.690
We worked specifically with startups to create new ventures

03:18.690 --> 03:23.627
in climate tech as well as digital health and AI for LG.

03:25.350 --> 03:27.300
And so that's what we're doing here.

03:27.300 --> 03:29.280
I'm focused on one of the new ventures

03:29.280 --> 03:32.343
that we're gonna be hopefully launching soon,

03:33.240 --> 03:34.830
later on this year

03:34.830 --> 03:36.360
that is focused on climate tech.

03:36.360 --> 03:38.400
And I'm delighted to be here with the panel.

03:38.400 --> 03:39.390
<v ->Well, thank you all so much.</v>

03:39.390 --> 03:41.160
And as you can tell from our panelists,

03:41.160 --> 03:42.330
a variety of different backgrounds,

03:42.330 --> 03:43.740
a variety of different expertise

03:43.740 --> 03:45.810
because it's gonna take a lot of different solutions,

03:45.810 --> 03:47.070
a lot of different technologies

03:47.070 --> 03:49.410
to really build that sustainable future.

03:49.410 --> 03:50.243
But when we're thinking

03:50.243 --> 03:52.260
about all these complex different technologies,

03:52.260 --> 03:54.630
different roles, I think you actually get,

03:54.630 --> 03:57.230
have to go back to a core definition.

03:57.230 --> 03:58.440
So I would ask each of you,

03:58.440 --> 04:00.180
how would you define sustainability?

04:00.180 --> 04:02.100
'Cause it might vary.

04:02.100 --> 04:04.320
<v ->Yeah. You know, for us, what we're,</v>

04:04.320 --> 04:06.900
when we think about sustainability, and

04:06.900 --> 04:09.000
because we're a VC firm

04:09.000 --> 04:10.620
that's focused on material innovation,

04:10.620 --> 04:12.450
we touch a lot of industries.

04:12.450 --> 04:14.070
And so what we're looking for

04:14.070 --> 04:16.740
is things to kind of clean up the process

04:16.740 --> 04:18.690
that we know is better for the planet.

04:18.690 --> 04:19.800
And now a lot of times

04:19.800 --> 04:22.140
it could be focused on downstream waste.

04:22.140 --> 04:24.570
So for example, in advanced manufacturing,

04:24.570 --> 04:26.490
we're talking about CNC parts

04:26.490 --> 04:29.640
that we're talking about a lot of oil spray,

04:29.640 --> 04:32.370
we're talking about debris in,

04:32.370 --> 04:35.370
you know, debris in our water and so forth.

04:35.370 --> 04:37.680
And looking for ways to better manufacture

04:37.680 --> 04:39.360
and to perhaps cut down

04:39.360 --> 04:41.850
on a lot of the chemicals and solvents used today.

04:41.850 --> 04:43.080
So that's kind of one facet.

04:43.080 --> 04:46.020
So what we're looking at is really can we do that

04:46.020 --> 04:47.375
and also maintain that performance

04:47.375 --> 04:49.560
that the industry is expecting

04:49.560 --> 04:52.350
and able to make sure that we can drive adoption

04:52.350 --> 04:54.030
because it has some sort of

04:54.030 --> 04:56.130
either cost parity or superiority

04:56.130 --> 04:58.260
that can command a premium price.

04:58.260 --> 04:59.820
One of the things we really struggle with

04:59.820 --> 05:02.370
is being able to provide a, or invest in opportunities

05:02.370 --> 05:03.960
that can be more sustainable,

05:03.960 --> 05:06.480
but that it can also meet market demands

05:06.480 --> 05:08.763
and be able to drive adoption.

05:10.620 --> 05:11.733
<v Brain>Who wants to build and elaborate on that?</v>

05:11.733 --> 05:13.620
<v ->Tito, you go.</v>
<v ->Yeah, totally.</v>

05:13.620 --> 05:14.640
When I think about sustainability,

05:14.640 --> 05:19.350
I think about better, faster, stronger, forever.

05:19.350 --> 05:20.183
That's what we're really talking about.

05:20.183 --> 05:22.290
I saw a quote from, from Bill Gates that said, you know,

05:22.290 --> 05:25.260
how can we make these technologies quicker and faster?

05:25.260 --> 05:26.670
That's really what we're talking about

05:26.670 --> 05:28.743
when we talk about sustainability,

05:29.610 --> 05:31.320
<v ->And I'll say, so I'm gonna add,</v>

05:31.320 --> 05:33.240
answer this from a couple of different perspectives.

05:33.240 --> 05:35.700
One, from an LG perspective, from sustainability,

05:35.700 --> 05:37.920
we're very committed to GHG,

05:37.920 --> 05:41.580
we have incredible zero emissions by 2030,

05:41.580 --> 05:43.950
and we're well on our way to achieving that.

05:43.950 --> 05:46.500
All our appliances are sustainable,

05:46.500 --> 05:49.560
we are using renewable plastics, recycled plastics,

05:49.560 --> 05:52.110
et cetera, et cetera, and packaging, et cetera.

05:52.110 --> 05:53.970
From an LG NOVA perspective,

05:53.970 --> 05:57.150
we're looking for going beyond LG,

05:57.150 --> 05:58.590
going beyond the appliances,

05:58.590 --> 06:00.930
looking at the software solutions that we can create.

06:00.930 --> 06:03.570
And so, we're looking at a number of different sectors there

06:03.570 --> 06:05.310
and very open to different ideas,

06:05.310 --> 06:06.810
whether it's energy management

06:06.810 --> 06:09.450
to how do you handle the home more efficiently,

06:09.450 --> 06:12.390
or how do you make something better for that experience?

06:12.390 --> 06:14.883
With whatever kind of climate tech product it is.

06:15.840 --> 06:18.240
Now, in terms of sustainability,

06:18.240 --> 06:20.430
I think that's actually an interesting word

06:20.430 --> 06:22.890
because the question I have for everyone is,

06:22.890 --> 06:24.630
do we actually wanna sustain

06:24.630 --> 06:26.700
or do we wanna make something better?

06:26.700 --> 06:27.540
Are we actually looking

06:27.540 --> 06:30.630
to actually create a better built environment for ourselves?

06:30.630 --> 06:33.390
And whatever way, whether it's from the construction,

06:33.390 --> 06:36.300
all the way to how we're creating our overall environment

06:36.300 --> 06:38.070
and also our natural environment.

06:38.070 --> 06:40.470
So I'm gonna say that also given what we,

06:40.470 --> 06:42.483
I would see happening in the future,

06:43.740 --> 06:46.290
that actually to include in that definition,

06:46.290 --> 06:47.490
I would say resilience.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.560
Because there's gonna be so much change.

06:49.560 --> 06:52.140
We're going to need to be able to be flexible enough

06:52.140 --> 06:53.520
to be able to handle the changes

06:53.520 --> 06:55.170
that are gonna be happening in the very,

06:55.170 --> 06:56.220
they are happening right now.

06:56.220 --> 06:58.350
We can see what's happening in California.

06:58.350 --> 07:01.260
And so are we gonna be actually able

07:01.260 --> 07:03.990
to be flexible enough to be resilient,

07:03.990 --> 07:05.220
and are we gonna be ready?

07:05.220 --> 07:08.070
So I think there's a readiness question also for us

07:08.070 --> 07:10.440
in terms of are we ready for the future is going to bring,

07:10.440 --> 07:12.900
and we can discuss further what that might need.

07:12.900 --> 07:13.733
<v ->Of course.</v>

07:13.733 --> 07:15.697
And we're starting to really see in many ways that,

07:15.697 --> 07:18.630
you know, I, I've been working on our index side,

07:18.630 --> 07:20.070
we've had ESG screens

07:20.070 --> 07:22.440
added to our thematic ETFs over the years,

07:22.440 --> 07:24.360
and the definition has started to change,

07:24.360 --> 07:25.740
which means there's evolution,

07:25.740 --> 07:28.200
the roles of venture capitalists in particular.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.880
So I guess the question is,

07:29.880 --> 07:31.761
you know, the concept of sustainable vesting

07:31.761 --> 07:33.060
has evolved over the past decade,

07:33.060 --> 07:34.530
especially in tech industry.

07:34.530 --> 07:38.850
Can you share how it's evolved from your perspective?

07:38.850 --> 07:41.610
<v ->Yeah, well, going back to what Limor said,</v>

07:41.610 --> 07:44.162
you know, if you've been around long enough,

07:44.162 --> 07:45.420
whether it be clean tech, green tech,

07:45.420 --> 07:46.980
sustainability climate tech,

07:46.980 --> 07:50.580
I think fundamentally they're thematically the same.

07:50.580 --> 07:53.940
I think now with a greater emphasis on carbon removal.

07:53.940 --> 07:56.040
So, you know, from our perspective,

07:56.040 --> 07:58.140
when we're thinking about investing,

07:58.140 --> 08:01.076
especially from a VC investing kind of years ahead,

08:01.076 --> 08:03.420
what are the things that we want to be mature

08:03.420 --> 08:05.370
in the three to five year timeframe?

08:05.370 --> 08:06.570
That we're looking at things

08:06.570 --> 08:09.090
that may not necessarily be at the forefront now

08:09.090 --> 08:10.470
and what that means.

08:10.470 --> 08:12.930
So for us, we don't really put a label

08:12.930 --> 08:14.520
on whether or not it's climate tech.

08:14.520 --> 08:17.940
We really kind of see it as a label for the times.

08:17.940 --> 08:19.650
But that when we're thinking about,

08:19.650 --> 08:21.706
you know, what can we do better?

08:21.706 --> 08:25.320
And for example, today, you know, one of our key goals

08:25.320 --> 08:28.710
is to be less dependent on petrochemicals

08:28.710 --> 08:30.450
and there's a lot of alternatives.

08:30.450 --> 08:34.380
You could try to make it reusable and they're recycled.

08:34.380 --> 08:36.690
And as VC, at least with Material Impact,

08:36.690 --> 08:39.360
we also focused on alternative material

08:39.360 --> 08:41.190
like biomaterials and so forth,

08:41.190 --> 08:43.410
so that we're not really talking about,

08:43.410 --> 08:44.910
you know, going through the same process

08:44.910 --> 08:46.680
and reusing downstream,

08:46.680 --> 08:48.690
but to start at the top at upstream

08:48.690 --> 08:50.850
and kind of solving it right then and there.

08:50.850 --> 08:52.560
So I think from our perspective,

08:52.560 --> 08:53.580
we're talking about innovation,

08:53.580 --> 08:54.450
we're kind of more,

08:54.450 --> 08:57.930
I would say more forward facing or frontier tech oriented,

08:57.930 --> 09:01.380
rather than focus only on recyclable, reusable,

09:01.380 --> 09:03.360
because we want to, we want to be able

09:03.360 --> 09:05.223
to have alternatives at the source.

09:06.908 --> 09:09.540
<v Attendee>Do we have a QnA opportunity after the session?</v>

09:09.540 --> 09:10.620
<v Brain>Yes, after the session.</v>

09:10.620 --> 09:12.570
So keep the conversation going.

09:12.570 --> 09:13.403
<v Attendee>Yes, please go.</v>

09:13.403 --> 09:14.250
<v Brian>Yeah, well afterwards</v>

09:14.250 --> 09:17.370
we'll go off stage and ask questions, thank you. Yeah.

09:17.370 --> 09:22.370
<v ->So I'll say that one of the things that,</v>

09:23.610 --> 09:26.760
so, infrastructure and the shifts in infrastructure

09:26.760 --> 09:28.830
are gonna be absolutely massive, we can see that

09:28.830 --> 09:30.780
because we know the population

09:30.780 --> 09:33.900
is going to be moving a lot already.

09:33.900 --> 09:36.150
Like a third of the population in the United States

09:36.150 --> 09:39.120
is claiming climate as a reason that they are,

09:39.120 --> 09:43.410
that they had to move their, where they lived in 2024,

09:43.410 --> 09:44.730
that's just the United States.

09:44.730 --> 09:46.110
And that's going to be a third

09:46.110 --> 09:48.750
of the global population by 2100,

09:48.750 --> 09:50.220
if not already a billion dollar,

09:50.220 --> 09:53.640
a billion people by another five or 10 years.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.980
So the question for us is what is the infrastructure?

09:55.980 --> 09:58.410
That's what is, are we ready for that?

09:58.410 --> 10:00.720
And so what we're looking at is,

10:00.720 --> 10:02.010
yes, we're looking at infrastructure,

10:02.010 --> 10:03.750
but we're looking at the software.

10:03.750 --> 10:06.030
We, LG NOVA, I'm just gonna speak,

10:06.030 --> 10:08.220
looking very much at the software side of this.

10:08.220 --> 10:10.454
So the software side of how do we make these,

10:10.454 --> 10:14.110
these hardware systems that much more efficient to address

10:15.175 --> 10:16.350
and pushing them to the edge

10:16.350 --> 10:19.260
of how the energy could be more efficient and resilient.

10:19.260 --> 10:23.400
And also how can we take most advantage of AI

10:23.400 --> 10:26.940
and the data that is now surrounding us in the world

10:26.940 --> 10:29.220
so that people can live in a more safe

10:29.220 --> 10:31.980
and holistic and healthy environment.

10:31.980 --> 10:33.810
So we're looking from all those elements,

10:33.810 --> 10:34.680
but we're very much looking

10:34.680 --> 10:36.057
from the software and the data side of it.

10:36.057 --> 10:37.620
And I think there's great richness

10:37.620 --> 10:39.120
in that environment for there.

10:42.030 --> 10:43.380
<v Brian>Tito, what would you say?</v>

10:43.380 --> 10:45.630
<v ->Yeah, I really like what everybody's introduced here.</v>

10:45.630 --> 10:47.730
Just this, I'm getting this sense like

10:47.730 --> 10:50.310
sustainability is something that lets us go further, right?

10:50.310 --> 10:54.300
You kind of bring up the efficiency, bring up the speed,

10:54.300 --> 10:55.142
and enables you to,

10:55.142 --> 10:57.030
we were talking about data centers before this, right?

10:57.030 --> 10:58.170
And more efficient data center

10:58.170 --> 11:01.650
is a data center that can handle more data at lower cost,

11:01.650 --> 11:04.320
like that allows us to go further

11:04.320 --> 11:06.600
than we otherwise couldn't see.

11:06.600 --> 11:07.433
<v Brian>Yeah, of course.</v>

11:07.433 --> 11:08.910
And I think we started to touch on

11:08.910 --> 11:10.950
some of this idea of the energy transition

11:10.950 --> 11:12.760
that's occurring and the technology

11:13.980 --> 11:14.940
constraints that we're hitting.

11:14.940 --> 11:17.220
So energy transition might sound like a new phrase.

11:17.220 --> 11:20.010
It's actually a new category at the show here at CES.

11:20.010 --> 11:21.750
And we've lived through two as society,

11:21.750 --> 11:23.010
we've gone from firewood to coal,

11:23.010 --> 11:24.480
we've gone from coal to fossil fuels.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.590
We're in the midst of a third one,

11:25.590 --> 11:28.470
which is from those fossil fuels to zero carbon energy.

11:28.470 --> 11:30.480
And you're starting to see, but we have much,

11:30.480 --> 11:33.630
a lot of power demand from AI in particular in data centers.

11:33.630 --> 11:35.610
We're seeing some data center cooling technology

11:35.610 --> 11:36.540
here at CES.

11:36.540 --> 11:38.310
So I guess what emerging technologies

11:38.310 --> 11:40.860
are you guys really maybe seeing on the show floor

11:40.860 --> 11:44.310
or maybe just tracking in general as part of your roles?

11:44.310 --> 11:46.740
<v ->Yeah, actually this is a big segment for us</v>

11:46.740 --> 11:49.650
where generally I see it as next gen compute.

11:49.650 --> 11:52.920
You know, what we're talking about today is, you know,

11:52.920 --> 11:56.670
and everyone probably saw NVIDIA's presentation yesterday

11:56.670 --> 11:59.070
where we're working off of a older architecture

11:59.070 --> 12:02.160
and trying to move and move into cloud and enterprise

12:02.160 --> 12:05.010
and now AI driven applications

12:05.010 --> 12:07.110
that's requiring more demanding compute.

12:07.110 --> 12:07.943
And what that means

12:07.943 --> 12:10.890
is we need to have more energy efficient electronics

12:10.890 --> 12:11.940
that's built from,

12:11.940 --> 12:14.220
if you really think about it, reimagine from,

12:14.220 --> 12:15.540
you know, and moving away or,

12:15.540 --> 12:17.370
or augmenting the Von Neumann principle

12:17.370 --> 12:20.070
when we're talking about how are we connecting these chips

12:20.070 --> 12:22.230
with the chip lips, with the interconnects

12:22.230 --> 12:25.710
and how to reduce energy but also maintain performance.

12:25.710 --> 12:27.600
You know, we're already at that point

12:27.600 --> 12:29.490
where everything is dense

12:29.490 --> 12:32.340
and we're taking to the point where silicon is going

12:32.340 --> 12:33.630
as far as it can go.

12:33.630 --> 12:35.610
And now we're working on heat management,

12:35.610 --> 12:38.550
throughput management, and just perhaps size management.

12:38.550 --> 12:40.770
So I really see next gen compute

12:40.770 --> 12:42.420
in terms of investment opportunities

12:42.420 --> 12:45.780
as a way to reduce energy consumption.

12:45.780 --> 12:49.260
And that comes from basically the efficiency of the chips

12:49.260 --> 12:52.320
as we go to bigger and bigger architectures

12:52.320 --> 12:54.720
to handle AI driven enterprise,

12:54.720 --> 12:57.843
AI driven cloud and AI driven applications.

12:59.010 --> 13:00.180
<v Brian>Tito, one more.</v>

13:00.180 --> 13:01.140
<v ->Yeah, AirMiners,</v>

13:01.140 --> 13:05.070
we specialize in taking carbon dioxide out of atmosphere.

13:05.070 --> 13:07.620
So I mentioned those 187 companies,

13:07.620 --> 13:09.480
some of them are taking farm waste

13:09.480 --> 13:10.860
and turning into stable carbon.

13:10.860 --> 13:12.030
Other people are making bricks

13:12.030 --> 13:13.850
out of carbon dioxide from the air.

13:13.850 --> 13:16.170
So there's all sorts of things you can do.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.610
I think what I'm excited about is,

13:17.610 --> 13:19.320
you know, when I think about decarbonization

13:19.320 --> 13:21.330
and improving efficiency,

13:21.330 --> 13:24.150
there's a lot of things that people have tried,

13:24.150 --> 13:25.170
people have worked on.

13:25.170 --> 13:27.510
And a lot of gains that we've had from that

13:27.510 --> 13:30.420
that carbon removal is a piece of the climate equation

13:30.420 --> 13:33.420
that kind of just recently became something that we need.

13:33.420 --> 13:37.590
It was that there's no climate model for a stable climate

13:37.590 --> 13:39.273
only reducing emissions.

13:40.410 --> 13:41.820
Decade ago maybe that would've worked,

13:41.820 --> 13:44.250
but at this point you could, you have to reduce emissions

13:44.250 --> 13:46.257
and actually pull out what's there.

13:46.257 --> 13:48.030
And so, I'm particularly excited about,

13:48.030 --> 13:49.590
look, there's this whole new

13:49.590 --> 13:51.480
piece of the equation that's needed.

13:51.480 --> 13:54.750
What are all the technologies, all the approaches

13:54.750 --> 13:57.393
that we'll need in order to make that succeed too?

13:59.370 --> 14:01.290
<v ->To build on what Corinna said,</v>

14:01.290 --> 14:06.150
just to continue for a second, is it's also gonna be,

14:06.150 --> 14:08.070
the compute is also gonna be at the edge.

14:08.070 --> 14:10.200
So we're going to be basically looking maybe

14:10.200 --> 14:12.060
at quantum compute at the edge.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.980
So, if you're looking at,

14:13.980 --> 14:15.720
yes, we can look at what the power is

14:15.720 --> 14:17.130
that's gonna be necessary there,

14:17.130 --> 14:20.580
but also what we're looking at is then how do you manage?

14:20.580 --> 14:23.460
'Cause it is all about, it's about profitability,

14:23.460 --> 14:24.960
it's about business,

14:24.960 --> 14:27.780
and we need to make sure that the customers that we are,

14:27.780 --> 14:28.613
excuse me,

14:28.613 --> 14:29.640
that the customers that we're serving

14:29.640 --> 14:32.640
are gonna be able to make money and so,

14:32.640 --> 14:35.100
and that the consumer is going to be in a good position

14:35.100 --> 14:35.933
to do whatever

14:35.933 --> 14:38.940
and live whatever life that person wants to live.

14:38.940 --> 14:41.880
So there, and then meanwhile we have these chip sets

14:41.880 --> 14:43.350
that are gonna possibly increase in heat,

14:43.350 --> 14:45.990
but hopefully not because they're gonna be re-engineered.

14:45.990 --> 14:49.050
But also we're dealing with a very distributed environment,

14:49.050 --> 14:50.640
both in terms of the compute,

14:50.640 --> 14:53.940
but also in terms of the energy gen and energy management

14:53.940 --> 14:55.860
because we're looking at distributed energy resources,

14:55.860 --> 14:57.360
the DERs right?

14:57.360 --> 14:59.880
So the question is how do we manage all of that?

14:59.880 --> 15:02.610
And how do we manage that with a level of visibility

15:02.610 --> 15:04.230
of information of the data,

15:04.230 --> 15:06.990
not only in terms of what is being produced,

15:06.990 --> 15:09.390
whatever that is, a bitcoin being crunched,

15:09.390 --> 15:11.400
a widget being produced, et cetera,

15:11.400 --> 15:14.943
a piece of data, a chat bot, a chat,

15:16.200 --> 15:19.020
agentic, an agent, what are they gonna be doing?

15:19.020 --> 15:21.480
What, how much energy is that agent going to be using?

15:21.480 --> 15:23.940
Which by the way, Chat GPT already

15:23.940 --> 15:26.400
uses three times more energy than a regular search.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.563
So you can imagine what an agent and what a phys,

15:28.563 --> 15:31.770
what the physical AI is also going to be doing,

15:31.770 --> 15:33.330
what the demand is gonna be,

15:33.330 --> 15:35.490
what the heat is gonna be that's gonna be generated,

15:35.490 --> 15:38.040
how are we going to manage that combination

15:38.040 --> 15:39.810
of both knowing what kind of revenue

15:39.810 --> 15:41.250
is gonna be able to be generated

15:41.250 --> 15:43.560
while we know what our expenses are regarding the energy.

15:43.560 --> 15:44.700
And we're also managing

15:44.700 --> 15:46.650
all of that distributed energy systems

15:46.650 --> 15:48.840
and interfacing it with a grid.

15:48.840 --> 15:50.250
That's what we're looking at.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.830
So you can just imagine now the level of compute

15:52.830 --> 15:55.530
that also just needs to be done to manage that,

15:55.530 --> 15:58.920
let alone what everybody's going to be doing

15:58.920 --> 15:59.910
because the facilities

15:59.910 --> 16:02.670
are gonna be able to be happening at that point.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.980
So just to paint a picture, that's the,

16:04.980 --> 16:06.630
those are the kinds of things that we're looking at.

16:06.630 --> 16:07.560
<v ->Well, I think that's important too,</v>

16:07.560 --> 16:08.580
especially when you're considering,

16:08.580 --> 16:09.780
again, artificial intelligence,

16:09.780 --> 16:11.820
we're in a massive revolution in that space.

16:11.820 --> 16:13.860
There is that data center component,

16:13.860 --> 16:16.200
and we were talking backstage about data center emissions,

16:16.200 --> 16:19.380
you know, it takes 40 to 60% of the emissions comes

16:19.380 --> 16:21.270
from just cooling them.

16:21.270 --> 16:22.620
And that's, again, the area I would imagine

16:22.620 --> 16:23.850
would be quite close to watch is

16:23.850 --> 16:26.070
some of those cooling technologies.

16:26.070 --> 16:27.690
You started to touch on something Limor

16:27.690 --> 16:29.100
that starts to get into,

16:29.100 --> 16:30.510
there's a lot of headwinds when we come,

16:30.510 --> 16:33.150
we think about sustainable investing, right?

16:33.150 --> 16:34.650
There's, it is a massive opportunity,

16:34.650 --> 16:36.210
but there are challenges that I want,

16:36.210 --> 16:37.920
and you're starting to get into this idea

16:37.920 --> 16:40.320
of how do you balance profitability

16:40.320 --> 16:42.300
with what is purpose driven investing

16:42.300 --> 16:43.200
at the end of the day.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.150
It's, we're looking at, we think about tangible assets,

16:45.150 --> 16:48.390
innovation in its first class is an intangible asset.

16:48.390 --> 16:50.910
Well so are sustainability values in many ways.

16:50.910 --> 16:52.650
How do you make, how do we make that tangible?

16:52.650 --> 16:54.900
So, how, I would love to hear from each of you,

16:54.900 --> 16:58.680
how do you ensure that sustainability remains a priority

16:58.680 --> 17:01.320
while also meeting the financial expectations

17:01.320 --> 17:02.373
of your stakeholders?

17:04.080 --> 17:04.913
<v Limor>Do you wanna go first?</v>

17:04.913 --> 17:06.240
<v ->I'm happy to go first.</v>

17:06.240 --> 17:07.860
You know, at the end of the day

17:07.860 --> 17:09.840
you can have a technology and you can have a patent,

17:09.840 --> 17:11.550
but it doesn't make a business.

17:11.550 --> 17:14.190
And part of it here is what we're really looking at,

17:14.190 --> 17:17.190
especially when I talk about materiel innovation,

17:17.190 --> 17:19.110
is really to be able to have a business model

17:19.110 --> 17:20.640
that makes sense

17:20.640 --> 17:22.380
because otherwise, you know, that's,

17:22.380 --> 17:25.080
you know, we're, it's not going to drive adoption

17:25.080 --> 17:27.090
and then we can't make the impact that we want to make

17:27.090 --> 17:29.730
and it can't become a real alternative in the marketplace.

17:29.730 --> 17:31.950
So we do look really closely at,

17:31.950 --> 17:34.020
especially when we're doing early investments,

17:34.020 --> 17:35.160
you know, do we understand

17:35.160 --> 17:37.590
what the current industry is like?

17:37.590 --> 17:41.490
Whether it be supply chain, whether it be the process,

17:41.490 --> 17:43.620
you know, what are the hurdles for adoption

17:43.620 --> 17:45.960
and what is the monetary business model, you know?

17:45.960 --> 17:48.150
And what are our expectations

17:48.150 --> 17:51.280
of whatever product that we're looking to invest in

17:52.140 --> 17:55.320
can get to the point of commercialization and scale.

17:55.320 --> 17:57.420
Because sustainability,

17:57.420 --> 17:59.460
climate tech can be very broad ranging,

17:59.460 --> 18:02.730
it could come down to electrolyzer for green input.

18:02.730 --> 18:04.290
It can come down to,

18:04.290 --> 18:06.450
you know, these days the infrastructure required

18:06.450 --> 18:09.030
for EV charging.

18:09.030 --> 18:10.740
You know, when's the last time we really thought

18:10.740 --> 18:12.360
about AC to DC conversion

18:12.360 --> 18:14.880
and wanted to really know the efficiency of that?

18:14.880 --> 18:17.370
Now that's really important because all that energy makes

18:17.370 --> 18:19.620
is something that we really, really want to capture.

18:19.620 --> 18:22.050
And so we're really looking at these schemes,

18:22.050 --> 18:25.920
and fundamentally their business models on what makes sense.

18:25.920 --> 18:28.440
Otherwise as driven as we are

18:28.440 --> 18:31.110
and wanting to have some sort of green change,

18:31.110 --> 18:33.930
we know that in the end the market wins out.

18:33.930 --> 18:37.123
So we also look very closely on green premium

18:37.123 --> 18:38.760
and does that make sense?

18:38.760 --> 18:39.810
But in the end of the day,

18:39.810 --> 18:41.730
we generally think that it's gotta meet

18:41.730 --> 18:44.100
at least current market performance,

18:44.100 --> 18:45.540
but ultimately better.

18:45.540 --> 18:47.610
But we have to be careful with that

18:47.610 --> 18:50.700
because it takes a lot of work to get to better

18:50.700 --> 18:55.080
and we want to grow into that scale, especially as a VC side

18:55.080 --> 18:57.750
where it's early, it's likely a new segment

18:57.750 --> 18:58.920
or a new innovation.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.470
So we look at the business model and monetization

19:01.470 --> 19:02.303
very closely.

19:04.110 --> 19:06.510
<v ->Yeah, we saw this happening in carbon removal, right?</v>

19:06.510 --> 19:09.330
You're going out and what you're effectively pitching is

19:09.330 --> 19:13.170
we're going to be selling invisible gas, nobody really wants

19:13.170 --> 19:15.270
and we want people to pay us a lot of money for it, right?

19:15.270 --> 19:19.080
So that pitch kind of wasn't all that working really well.

19:19.080 --> 19:20.610
On the other side of it though was

19:20.610 --> 19:22.500
look, we're gonna need to be removing

19:22.500 --> 19:27.090
billions of tons of carbon dioxide from the air every year

19:27.090 --> 19:28.710
starting in the next couple decades, right?

19:28.710 --> 19:31.680
So there is this effectively trillion dollar market

19:31.680 --> 19:32.640
on the horizon.

19:32.640 --> 19:34.680
What we found talking with investors was

19:34.680 --> 19:37.410
I went and I talked to, I interviewed 30 different investors

19:37.410 --> 19:39.330
and I said, look, what's your biggest concern

19:39.330 --> 19:41.550
about investing in carbon removal?

19:41.550 --> 19:42.383
And they all said,

19:42.383 --> 19:44.100
look, we're here for that long-term vision.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.570
We're here 'cause we get

19:45.570 --> 19:48.030
that there's gonna be this trillion dollar opportunity,

19:48.030 --> 19:50.940
but we're not investing now as much as we could

19:50.940 --> 19:51.990
because we're not sure if it's,

19:51.990 --> 19:54.030
is it right now or is it five years from now

19:54.030 --> 19:55.500
or is it 10 years from now?

19:55.500 --> 19:59.400
And so that led us to creating a new fund

19:59.400 --> 20:01.890
where instead of investing in equity in the company,

20:01.890 --> 20:04.350
so actually owning pieces of the companies,

20:04.350 --> 20:07.440
instead we have a fund that makes money

20:07.440 --> 20:09.900
when the companies remove carbon from the sky.

20:09.900 --> 20:11.220
And so this was something actually

20:11.220 --> 20:13.770
that worked better for certain investors

20:13.770 --> 20:16.770
because they said, look, as long as there's customers,

20:16.770 --> 20:19.020
we can have this fund, this fund work.

20:19.020 --> 20:20.610
And believe me, we didn't wake up one day

20:20.610 --> 20:23.280
and I wasn't like, hey, like I'm gonna be a fund manager.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.830
But it really came from, well how do we unlock this?

20:25.830 --> 20:29.970
How do we get from here to this trillion dollar market,

20:29.970 --> 20:31.650
to this stable climate?

20:31.650 --> 20:35.160
And that involved creating what we call the Kiloton Fund

20:35.160 --> 20:37.930
where we've made 20 investments out of that

20:37.930 --> 20:40.050
where we invest in the, in the companies.

20:40.050 --> 20:41.370
And then Shopify announced

20:41.370 --> 20:43.530
that they were purchasing a hundred thousand dollars

20:43.530 --> 20:46.470
of carbon removal credits from every single company

20:46.470 --> 20:48.870
in the Kiloton Fund.

20:48.870 --> 20:51.780
So we're able to demonstrate that, you know, investing

20:51.780 --> 20:54.057
and having a customer come along with it.

20:54.057 --> 20:56.196
And so that's what we've seen as kind of,

20:56.196 --> 20:58.920
you know, what's needed in terms of how discovering,

20:58.920 --> 21:03.420
how do we get to a balanced planet, how do we get to these,

21:03.420 --> 21:06.330
you know, this market being something on a spreadsheet

21:06.330 --> 21:07.800
or in a climate model

21:07.800 --> 21:10.410
to being something that's actually being built out

21:10.410 --> 21:11.733
and alive.

21:13.020 --> 21:13.853
<v ->Fascinating.</v>

21:13.853 --> 21:17.370
And, you know, there someone was saying to me earlier, ROI,

21:17.370 --> 21:20.370
let's redefine it as return on impact.

21:20.370 --> 21:21.810
And I love that. I think it's-

21:21.810 --> 21:22.643
<v Brian>That's a great phrase. Sorry, I love that.</v>

21:23.640 --> 21:26.340
<v ->It's fascinating and it's fantastic</v>

21:26.340 --> 21:29.040
and I think it really reframes our minds

21:29.040 --> 21:31.050
and I will say and yet.

21:31.050 --> 21:33.990
So we need to make sure that there is a business there.

21:33.990 --> 21:37.650
And so now speaking also as LG as well as LG NOVA,

21:37.650 --> 21:39.150
so as LG we are committed.

21:39.150 --> 21:40.860
I think also it's really important

21:40.860 --> 21:44.730
for the corporate on the highest levels, the chairman level

21:44.730 --> 21:46.470
as well as the CEO level

21:46.470 --> 21:50.490
on down to be committed to sustainability and GHG reduction,

21:50.490 --> 21:51.323
et cetera, et cetera.

21:51.323 --> 21:53.340
It must come from there.

21:53.340 --> 21:55.260
And at the same time we're paying attention

21:55.260 --> 21:58.386
to our customers, our consumers, especially the next gen

21:58.386 --> 22:02.550
that is growing in terms of its capacity to purchase,

22:02.550 --> 22:05.910
the gen Zs and the Alphas that are coming,

22:05.910 --> 22:07.290
there are demanding,

22:07.290 --> 22:10.770
they will not work with a brand that is not sustainable.

22:10.770 --> 22:12.690
We must listen to our consumer.

22:12.690 --> 22:14.790
So we're also going to be driven by that.

22:14.790 --> 22:16.050
And, of course, the SEC

22:16.050 --> 22:18.150
is coming down with GHG requirements.

22:18.150 --> 22:20.310
So there is the regulatory aspect.

22:20.310 --> 22:23.400
Now I would say that regulatory can be quite interesting.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.890
It can be the carrot and the stick, right?

22:25.890 --> 22:29.670
Because it could modify some behavior and at the same time,

22:29.670 --> 22:31.800
and we can continue to mining-

22:31.800 --> 22:33.362
<v Brian>Oh, we'll definitely be talking more about that</v>

22:33.362 --> 22:34.310
in a moment.
<v ->Okay, okay.</v>

22:34.310 --> 22:35.143
<v Brain>Yeah, yeah.</v>

22:35.143 --> 22:36.510
<v ->So then, so I'll just say that.</v>

22:36.510 --> 22:38.490
So, but, and yet beyond that

22:38.490 --> 22:41.760
we need to make sure that it's still a good business.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.110
It still makes good business sense

22:43.110 --> 22:45.720
because you don't wanna be beholden necessarily

22:45.720 --> 22:48.750
to the external powers that be, except for the marketplace.

22:48.750 --> 22:49.583
You wanna make sure

22:49.583 --> 22:51.180
that you're addressing a marketplace need, I would say.

22:51.180 --> 22:54.720
So it's that balance of ROI and ROI maybe.

22:54.720 --> 22:55.680
<v Brian>Yeah, I really like that,</v>

22:55.680 --> 22:57.930
this idea of, there's two ROIs now to think about.

22:57.930 --> 22:59.580
You started to touch upon value

22:59.580 --> 23:02.460
and I think this is a value sets of consumers

23:02.460 --> 23:04.800
and this will transition us to this idea

23:04.800 --> 23:05.970
of how do you measure impact,

23:05.970 --> 23:07.890
but I find it fascinating 'cause we,

23:07.890 --> 23:10.440
gen Z and gen Alpha are very much interested

23:10.440 --> 23:11.520
in sustainable values.

23:11.520 --> 23:12.353
But we've actually,

23:12.353 --> 23:14.310
we've been looking at some secondary researches

23:14.310 --> 23:16.830
there's sometimes the action gap between values.

23:16.830 --> 23:20.370
So, gen Z tends to say, oh, we love sustainability,

23:20.370 --> 23:23.310
but then they go and they get, they do fast fashion

23:23.310 --> 23:25.080
and they buy things directly offline,

23:25.080 --> 23:26.550
that's not very sustainable.

23:26.550 --> 23:29.340
And so we actually have seen some great secondary research

23:29.340 --> 23:30.450
from NIQ and World Data Lab

23:30.450 --> 23:33.090
that shows that if you have multiple sustainability values,

23:33.090 --> 23:35.460
so if you are energy efficient and you recycle

23:35.460 --> 23:36.450
and you do these,

23:36.450 --> 23:39.180
basically, if you are to your point,

23:39.180 --> 23:40.800
showcasing that this is a value set

23:40.800 --> 23:41.910
that we actually hold as a company,

23:41.910 --> 23:43.080
it's not just lip service,

23:43.080 --> 23:44.550
they're two and a half times more likely

23:44.550 --> 23:46.020
to purchase a multiple sustainability,

23:46.020 --> 23:49.680
so that's a good point and this gets into impact.

23:49.680 --> 23:54.030
This is, this ROI, how, what metrics or frameworks do you,

23:54.030 --> 23:54.930
each of you use really

23:54.930 --> 23:57.840
to assess whether a company or a technology

23:57.840 --> 24:00.930
or an investment that you're making is truly contributing

24:00.930 --> 24:03.723
to the environmental and social progress that you,

24:03.723 --> 24:05.700
that we're striving to achieve here?

24:05.700 --> 24:07.170
So I throw that to you guys.

24:07.170 --> 24:10.410
<v ->Sure. I'm happy to take that first.</v>

24:10.410 --> 24:13.500
So, you know, we have, in the VC industry we also have,

24:13.500 --> 24:15.720
you know, I would say dedicated climate tech funds.

24:15.720 --> 24:16.553
And a lot of times

24:16.553 --> 24:18.600
we really are looking at the size of the impact

24:18.600 --> 24:21.990
in terms of, you know, greenhouse gases that you can remove,

24:21.990 --> 24:23.280
GHG, in general.

24:23.280 --> 24:25.867
And so what we're really thinking about is where,

24:25.867 --> 24:28.470
you know, we have these kind of analysis

24:28.470 --> 24:31.230
where we're looking at once commercialized,

24:31.230 --> 24:32.850
what is the impact of that?

24:32.850 --> 24:35.280
And general metrics, there can be many,

24:35.280 --> 24:37.500
but we're talking about basically carbon removal.

24:37.500 --> 24:38.700
We're talking about

24:38.700 --> 24:43.320
either it be water reduction or chemical reduction,

24:43.320 --> 24:44.153
you know, clean water.

24:44.153 --> 24:47.550
So I would say generally we're really talking about that.

24:47.550 --> 24:49.110
And within industry sectors,

24:49.110 --> 24:51.750
let's say for like ag, like agtech,

24:51.750 --> 24:52.860
then it's really talking about

24:52.860 --> 24:54.300
perhaps reduction of pesticides

24:54.300 --> 24:56.640
or reduction of particular chemicals.

24:56.640 --> 24:58.860
And to Limor's point, you know, regulation is kind of,

24:58.860 --> 25:00.810
it's a push pull right now.

25:00.810 --> 25:03.990
The EU has also, I would say interesting components

25:03.990 --> 25:05.940
in being able to drive that mandate.

25:05.940 --> 25:07.170
So in the end of the day,

25:07.170 --> 25:08.610
you know, we really go back and saying,

25:08.610 --> 25:11.340
well, we wanna basically do better for the planet.

25:11.340 --> 25:13.920
And so right now, even though there may be a lot of focus

25:13.920 --> 25:17.520
on carbon itself, which we must reduce

25:17.520 --> 25:20.250
that along the way, when you really think about

25:20.250 --> 25:24.090
how many chemicals are going into the ground for our food,

25:24.090 --> 25:27.450
for our textiles and cotton and so forth,

25:27.450 --> 25:29.580
that all right there is also,

25:29.580 --> 25:32.340
you know, helpful as well in terms of reduction of that.

25:32.340 --> 25:33.390
To kinda give you an idea,

25:33.390 --> 25:36.150
in agtech, you know, if you're looking at a chemical label,

25:36.150 --> 25:39.060
they have it as gallons per acre.

25:39.060 --> 25:42.240
And well, a typical plant has hydrophilic leaves

25:42.240 --> 25:44.340
where water just bounces off.

25:44.340 --> 25:45.870
So where's it bouncing into?

25:45.870 --> 25:48.210
And how much of it actually got to the plant?

25:48.210 --> 25:49.950
And so what we do is we douse it

25:49.950 --> 25:52.110
because we don't have the technology today

25:52.110 --> 25:55.260
to really know how much is there getting to the plant.

25:55.260 --> 25:57.600
Those are a type of innovations that we're talking about

25:57.600 --> 25:58.890
and that we're looking in

25:58.890 --> 26:00.990
where if you guys just, you know, really thought

26:00.990 --> 26:03.780
about how many gallons of pesticides are going in,

26:03.780 --> 26:05.760
going into our groundwater

26:05.760 --> 26:08.520
and other things in terms of soil health and stuff,

26:08.520 --> 26:09.450
it all feeds itself.

26:09.450 --> 26:11.370
So we really think of it as a holistic module.

26:11.370 --> 26:15.960
But those metrics, water, land, chemicals, carbon,

26:15.960 --> 26:18.150
those are like, you know, the big four or five.

26:18.150 --> 26:19.320
<v Brian>Tito.</v>

26:19.320 --> 26:20.153
<v ->Yeah, ours is easy.</v>

26:20.153 --> 26:22.350
We're just counting molecules of carbon dioxide

26:22.350 --> 26:24.840
that they're in the air and you grab them out.

26:24.840 --> 26:27.330
And that's what makes it really this free space

26:27.330 --> 26:29.040
for people to innovate and invent.

26:29.040 --> 26:30.540
It's, if you've got a way

26:30.540 --> 26:33.720
or an idea for a way to grab onto carbon,

26:33.720 --> 26:36.840
I can tell you that we're falling far short of,

26:36.840 --> 26:39.090
of what's needed from a climate model standpoint.

26:39.090 --> 26:42.120
Effectively carbon removal needs to grow 40%

26:42.120 --> 26:45.420
year over year over year over year through 2050,

26:45.420 --> 26:48.300
which means it needs to grow as fast as biotechnology,

26:48.300 --> 26:51.033
as fast as Moore's law, as fast as computing.

26:51.960 --> 26:55.080
And it's for removing invisible gas from the sky.

26:55.080 --> 26:58.290
And it's an area where we've really just started to,

26:58.290 --> 27:00.060
just started to innovate and discover.

27:00.060 --> 27:01.770
So there's plenty of space for,

27:01.770 --> 27:06.660
if you have some new way to grab onto molecules of carbon,

27:06.660 --> 27:08.220
that's something that we can figure out how to count

27:08.220 --> 27:11.610
and something we can figure out how to turn into a business

27:11.610 --> 27:15.660
and a contribution to how do we get to a stable climate

27:15.660 --> 27:18.390
and a thriving human civilization.

27:18.390 --> 27:19.800
That's what it's all about.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.720
<v Brian>Yeah. Thank you. And Limor?</v>

27:21.720 --> 27:22.770
<v ->So we're looking at it,</v>

27:22.770 --> 27:26.610
I would say LG is counting very much it's carbon emissions,

27:26.610 --> 27:29.610
what percentage of renewables it is using

27:29.610 --> 27:31.410
in terms of recycled product,

27:31.410 --> 27:33.150
how much of its product and its packaging

27:33.150 --> 27:34.320
is being recycled, et cetera.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.330
So it's looking very much at that.

27:36.330 --> 27:37.800
As LG NOVA we're looking,

27:37.800 --> 27:41.400
I would say we're looking very much at the business itself.

27:41.400 --> 27:44.550
I was, we have a couple of different ways of looking at it.

27:44.550 --> 27:47.820
One, how many startups are we supporting

27:47.820 --> 27:49.800
in terms of developing new businesses?

27:49.800 --> 27:51.750
How many startups are we launching

27:51.750 --> 27:53.070
in terms of these new sectors?

27:53.070 --> 27:56.160
'Cause our mission is to actually launch new startups

27:56.160 --> 27:58.080
and we're hoping to launch again, as I said,

27:58.080 --> 28:01.530
one, at least one this coming year in the sector.

28:01.530 --> 28:03.390
So we're looking at it much very much

28:03.390 --> 28:05.700
from the innovation aspect

28:05.700 --> 28:08.220
of how we're supporting innovation in the sector.

28:08.220 --> 28:09.510
I would say that's what we're looking those

28:09.510 --> 28:11.220
in some of the metrics that we're looking.

28:11.220 --> 28:13.380
Also how much we're investing in the startups,

28:13.380 --> 28:14.970
literally like from a dollar amount

28:14.970 --> 28:16.110
in terms of how much we're investing

28:16.110 --> 28:17.610
and then how well those companies

28:17.610 --> 28:19.380
are gonna con do continue doing?

28:19.380 --> 28:20.640
What impact they're gonna have?

28:20.640 --> 28:22.650
So we're sort of feeding it forward a little bit

28:22.650 --> 28:24.300
and that's what we're looking at as well.

28:24.300 --> 28:25.133
<v ->Excellent.</v>

28:25.133 --> 28:27.240
And so, over the course of the last few answers,

28:27.240 --> 28:30.180
we started touching upon this idea of government regulation.

28:30.180 --> 28:33.780
We are in the midst right now of some change

28:33.780 --> 28:35.700
and with a new incoming admin,

28:35.700 --> 28:38.100
and globally, we're seeing a lot of change across the board.

28:38.100 --> 28:41.280
So, how do you all see government regulations

28:41.280 --> 28:42.450
and incentives?

28:42.450 --> 28:44.280
It's not always just regulation, it can be incentives

28:44.280 --> 28:46.440
shaping the future of sustainable innovation.

28:46.440 --> 28:48.060
Do you think there's enough support

28:48.060 --> 28:50.550
or do you think that there needs to be more done

28:50.550 --> 28:53.520
to align the goals of sustainable venture

28:53.520 --> 28:56.280
with environmental objectives and government policy?

28:56.280 --> 28:58.560
<v ->Yeah, we actually started looking at this very closely</v>

28:58.560 --> 29:01.320
because when we're talk thinking about investing

29:01.320 --> 29:03.780
in early stage startups, there's,

29:03.780 --> 29:05.220
we really focus on also

29:05.220 --> 29:07.650
what's the available non-diluted funding.

29:07.650 --> 29:09.660
And a lot of times these are grants,

29:09.660 --> 29:13.560
you know, whether it be from NIH, DOE, DOD and whatnot.

29:13.560 --> 29:16.560
And so this is something that we do expect this

29:16.560 --> 29:18.060
as the VC industry as a whole

29:18.060 --> 29:21.330
to be greatly shaped by the incoming administration.

29:21.330 --> 29:23.820
Maybe less DOE, maybe more DOD,

29:23.820 --> 29:25.200
you know, if you had to guess.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.700
And so, but part of that here,

29:26.700 --> 29:29.430
when we're talking about making this type of big impact

29:29.430 --> 29:32.370
and we compare where we are today to perhaps,

29:32.370 --> 29:33.210
you know, decades ago

29:33.210 --> 29:35.790
when there were more infrastructure investments

29:35.790 --> 29:38.280
that it really kind of takes a village

29:38.280 --> 29:40.080
to make the impact that we're talking about.

29:40.080 --> 29:41.970
So we look at this very closely

29:41.970 --> 29:44.760
in terms of non-diluted funding for the startups

29:44.760 --> 29:47.160
to being able to get a little further.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.320
For example, a good example

29:49.320 --> 29:52.050
is really the EV charging infrastructure.

29:52.050 --> 29:54.270
You know, back in the day, you know, they built,

29:54.270 --> 29:55.920
you know, funny enough they built highways

29:55.920 --> 30:00.120
because tire manufacturers wanted people to get out and go.

30:00.120 --> 30:02.280
And because of that then there was these gas stations,

30:02.280 --> 30:06.120
but a lot of it was subsidized by, you know, by government

30:06.120 --> 30:08.640
and being able to do that same thing with transportation.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.590
And so, you know, where we are

30:10.590 --> 30:12.750
in terms of new sustainable investments

30:12.750 --> 30:15.480
and how that plays, I think is TBD.

30:15.480 --> 30:18.276
So, you know, in California there's a lot of tax credits

30:18.276 --> 30:20.580
to make EV more affordable

30:20.580 --> 30:22.890
and that definitely drives change.

30:22.890 --> 30:26.040
That's not, that's not VC money, that's not industry money,

30:26.040 --> 30:28.770
you know, that's a grant in some ways or in others.

30:28.770 --> 30:30.900
So we look at this very specifically

30:30.900 --> 30:33.973
within the incoming administration, what the focus is on

30:33.973 --> 30:38.310
and really help startups understand

30:38.310 --> 30:41.310
what are some options outside of just straight VC money.

30:41.310 --> 30:42.750
<v Brian >So you don't think it's going anywhere</v>

30:42.750 --> 30:44.114
with this incoming?

30:44.114 --> 30:48.960
<v ->I think the three letter acronym agencies will switch</v>

30:48.960 --> 30:50.940
and that there's gonna be some focus we like,

30:50.940 --> 30:55.350
as we know, biosecurity was kind of a big thing, you know?

30:55.350 --> 30:57.960
And perhaps less DOD.

30:57.960 --> 30:59.520
And so we do think

30:59.520 --> 31:01.920
that national security oriented type grants

31:01.920 --> 31:03.780
are going to increase,

31:03.780 --> 31:06.030
but I think, you know, it's anyone's guess,

31:06.030 --> 31:07.410
but that's kind of the trend.

31:07.410 --> 31:10.380
<v Brian >Perfect. I want to hear more from you two.</v>

31:10.380 --> 31:13.073
<v ->Yeah, sure. So from a carbon removal standpoint,</v>

31:13.073 --> 31:17.850
in fact there's an existing industry for reducing emissions.

31:17.850 --> 31:20.610
For example, the EU has their emission trading scheme,

31:20.610 --> 31:23.430
which is many hundreds of billions of dollars per year

31:23.430 --> 31:24.270
traded around,

31:24.270 --> 31:26.370
well how do we reduce emissions?

31:26.370 --> 31:30.630
That framework is there for carbon removal,

31:30.630 --> 31:33.240
but it's not yet applied to carbon removal,

31:33.240 --> 31:34.170
but that's coming online.

31:34.170 --> 31:37.080
Japan has just recently announced that carbon removal

31:37.080 --> 31:42.080
can be a part of its existing decarbonization market.

31:42.810 --> 31:44.880
The EU is working on adding it.

31:44.880 --> 31:48.660
The United States already has the 45Q tax policy,

31:48.660 --> 31:51.570
which really expanded during the first Trump administration

31:51.570 --> 31:54.780
to provide up to $180 per ton

31:54.780 --> 31:57.210
for taking invisible gas out of the sky

31:57.210 --> 31:59.660
and either storing it or doing something with it.

32:00.570 --> 32:01.403
So I can see that,

32:01.403 --> 32:04.080
you know, the world is moving in the right direction.

32:04.080 --> 32:09.080
I think the size of it is, there's plenty more room.

32:09.600 --> 32:12.270
The US Department of Energy has invested

32:12.270 --> 32:15.360
more than $3 billion into carbon removal,

32:15.360 --> 32:18.390
mostly in a method called direct air capture

32:18.390 --> 32:21.810
that uses machines to grab onto molecules of carbon,

32:21.810 --> 32:24.930
but it's also going into other methods

32:24.930 --> 32:29.620
that use farming techniques or oceans or rocks mining

32:30.750 --> 32:35.750
and clearly like a, a lot more of that is needed.

32:35.760 --> 32:36.840
<v Brian >Limor.</v>

32:36.840 --> 32:40.470
<v ->So we're definitely in an interesting time</v>

32:40.470 --> 32:42.370
with the new administration coming in.

32:43.410 --> 32:45.420
Forbes wrote a fantastic article

32:45.420 --> 32:46.680
that really mapped things out.

32:46.680 --> 32:49.710
A lot of the IRA funding actually went to Republican states.

32:49.710 --> 32:51.270
So it's unlikely that the governors

32:51.270 --> 32:53.460
are going to want to denounce

32:53.460 --> 32:56.550
or the senators are going to want to give that money back.

32:56.550 --> 32:59.400
So does that, what does that mean? We'll have to see.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.320
So all of everything I'm gonna say is it'll,

33:01.320 --> 33:03.420
we'll have to see, but I think that's one thing

33:03.420 --> 33:04.950
that's important to keep in mind.

33:04.950 --> 33:07.710
Another thing that's important to keep in mind is,

33:07.710 --> 33:09.840
you know, who is the chief advisor

33:09.840 --> 33:13.800
to the president-elect at this point in time,

33:13.800 --> 33:15.390
it's Elon Musk.

33:15.390 --> 33:17.250
He is in battery storage,

33:17.250 --> 33:19.530
that is one of the multi-billion dollar businesses

33:19.530 --> 33:20.363
that he has,

33:20.363 --> 33:21.270
and is actually making more money

33:21.270 --> 33:22.860
than the EV charging business right now

33:22.860 --> 33:26.160
or the EV car business for him right now.

33:26.160 --> 33:29.160
So, you know, as you look at it, and that means he's,

33:29.160 --> 33:30.960
and that's they're selling it to the grid,

33:30.960 --> 33:31.980
through the utilities.

33:31.980 --> 33:34.710
Why? Because the utilities need to become more resilient.

33:34.710 --> 33:36.480
They need to be more sustainable.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.463
And so I think that

33:38.463 --> 33:41.940
that we have to pay attention to that as well.

33:41.940 --> 33:43.620
Also, from the people that I'm speaking to,

33:43.620 --> 33:46.530
they think that things have gone too far down the path

33:46.530 --> 33:49.050
where we can't dial it back completely.

33:49.050 --> 33:51.330
So, okay, so there's something to that.

33:51.330 --> 33:53.460
I think there's also one things that have noticed

33:53.460 --> 33:54.600
is that in different states,

33:54.600 --> 33:57.120
because we talk to different states and they're not all,

33:57.120 --> 33:58.860
let's say sustainability oriented.

33:58.860 --> 34:00.570
So sometimes it's the language.

34:00.570 --> 34:03.600
So they may not want to be talking about sustainability,

34:03.600 --> 34:05.520
but they will want to talk about resilience

34:05.520 --> 34:08.460
of their energy grid for their citizens.

34:08.460 --> 34:10.140
So sometimes it's wording,

34:10.140 --> 34:12.390
sometimes it's nuancing the message

34:12.390 --> 34:13.860
and then you're like, oh, got it.

34:13.860 --> 34:16.830
And also then going back to our business conversation,

34:16.830 --> 34:20.220
if you can show that there is good business in this,

34:20.220 --> 34:22.380
then they will be supportive.

34:22.380 --> 34:24.810
And so, I think, and the governments would be supportive.

34:24.810 --> 34:27.720
So I think it's all about how you are packaging it.

34:27.720 --> 34:29.130
And I'll add one more thing.

34:29.130 --> 34:31.920
In addition to VC, what we're seeing

34:31.920 --> 34:33.630
is that there's tremendous opportunity

34:33.630 --> 34:37.590
to work with family funds to work with nonprofits

34:37.590 --> 34:39.660
such as elemental impact,

34:39.660 --> 34:42.210
that they are sourcing funding from different resources

34:42.210 --> 34:43.650
and you can stack the capital.

34:43.650 --> 34:45.510
So everyone's talking about stacking the capital.

34:45.510 --> 34:47.190
So you might get something from VC,

34:47.190 --> 34:52.190
you might get some loans, i.e., Bank of America is,

34:52.500 --> 34:55.140
has a whole program in sustainability.

34:55.140 --> 34:57.510
Climate First Bank has, is dedicated

34:57.510 --> 35:00.150
to supporting and loan supporting sustainability.

35:00.150 --> 35:01.680
A lot of the banks have this.

35:01.680 --> 35:04.150
So you can actually, and they will work with

35:05.700 --> 35:09.060
different kind of state funding agencies

35:09.060 --> 35:11.310
that will de-risk their loan.

35:11.310 --> 35:14.070
So there are ways of packaging together the funding

35:14.070 --> 35:15.780
so that you can get a loan,

35:15.780 --> 35:18.840
have a de-risk by a state funding aid entity.

35:18.840 --> 35:20.130
So the bank is more inclined

35:20.130 --> 35:22.350
to then offer a lower interest rate,

35:22.350 --> 35:25.440
which makes it much more accessible to then have that ROI

35:25.440 --> 35:28.260
so you can in fact pay back the loan

35:28.260 --> 35:29.430
much more easily and more quickly.

35:29.430 --> 35:31.800
So let's just say there's creativity out there

35:31.800 --> 35:34.050
and people are willing to have those kind of conversations.

35:34.050 --> 35:35.070
<v ->Yeah, I really like this idea</v>

35:35.070 --> 35:36.990
of essentially it's like how do you package and message it

35:36.990 --> 35:38.760
I think that's why like we're seeing this phrase

35:38.760 --> 35:39.960
energy transition take over.

35:39.960 --> 35:41.430
It reminds me of energy independence

35:41.430 --> 35:44.160
back when I was advising in the energy space

35:44.160 --> 35:46.320
a decade ago in my career, at this point.

35:46.320 --> 35:47.880
But I want to focus it,

35:47.880 --> 35:49.290
we have time for a couple more questions

35:49.290 --> 35:51.720
and I wanna kind of look to the future

35:51.720 --> 35:54.060
in terms of first advice and then we'll go technology.

35:54.060 --> 35:56.520
So the first one I wanted to ask was,

35:56.520 --> 35:58.590
and I wanna make sure we have time for both questions,

35:58.590 --> 36:01.200
which is for startups in the sustainability space

36:01.200 --> 36:04.470
hoping to attract funding or to attract that investment,

36:04.470 --> 36:05.790
what advice would you give them

36:05.790 --> 36:07.470
in terms of aligning their business models

36:07.470 --> 36:10.530
with both market demand and environmental impact?

36:10.530 --> 36:12.930
<v ->Yeah, so you know, we,</v>

36:12.930 --> 36:15.210
there's different sources of VC money

36:15.210 --> 36:17.730
and a lot of times when you kind of get to the point

36:17.730 --> 36:19.680
where you have a product concept

36:19.680 --> 36:21.390
is what we're also advising

36:21.390 --> 36:24.180
is you need a customer that's also your investor.

36:24.180 --> 36:25.410
It's basically an incumbent.

36:25.410 --> 36:26.970
So we call these strategics

36:26.970 --> 36:29.310
or CVCs corporate venture capital

36:29.310 --> 36:31.200
where, you know, they're invested

36:31.200 --> 36:32.940
in making sure that they have a roadmap

36:32.940 --> 36:34.890
to a technology that they want

36:34.890 --> 36:36.630
and that they also become a customer.

36:36.630 --> 36:39.060
We think this is vital, especially in deep tech

36:39.060 --> 36:40.800
'cause we're not talking about something that is,

36:40.800 --> 36:42.690
you know, kind of software

36:42.690 --> 36:45.000
or doesn't require something to be actually built.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.710
When we're talking about sustainability investment,

36:46.710 --> 36:48.865
a lot of times it really is a physical object or it's,

36:48.865 --> 36:51.840
or it, we're measuring something that's actually physical.

36:51.840 --> 36:54.090
And so, we're really talking about making sure

36:54.090 --> 36:57.000
to have a wide investor base of key stakeholders.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.460
And at least in deep tech, especially in sustainability,

36:59.460 --> 37:03.540
what that means is having strategics be invested customers

37:03.540 --> 37:04.706
that helps you mature,

37:04.706 --> 37:07.860
but also to be able to use them as advisors

37:07.860 --> 37:08.730
and sounding boards

37:08.730 --> 37:12.330
to make sure you get that proper product market fit

37:12.330 --> 37:14.460
and that you are really able to understand

37:14.460 --> 37:17.850
what is that customer journey or that market,

37:17.850 --> 37:20.310
you know, whether it be supply chain

37:20.310 --> 37:23.370
or just that road to adoption

37:23.370 --> 37:25.530
and being able to understand the key supplier.

37:25.530 --> 37:27.330
So we really think that

37:27.330 --> 37:29.160
that if that was the one single advice

37:29.160 --> 37:30.480
is to say work to the point

37:30.480 --> 37:32.700
where you can have a strategic investor

37:32.700 --> 37:34.770
that will be a big customer moving forward.

37:34.770 --> 37:36.300
<v Brian >Perfect. Tito.</v>

37:36.300 --> 37:37.170
<v ->Yeah, for carbon removal,</v>

37:37.170 --> 37:39.900
like, you know, like I talked about, it's invisible gas,

37:39.900 --> 37:41.250
how the heck are you gonna sell this stuff?

37:41.250 --> 37:43.860
That's key, just building on what you're saying,

37:43.860 --> 37:46.830
like that's what we see with the 187 companies

37:46.830 --> 37:48.552
that have gone through our accelerator program.

37:48.552 --> 37:50.730
They're able to go out and find somebody

37:50.730 --> 37:53.820
who says that, oh yeah, I'll buy $10,000 of carbon

37:53.820 --> 37:55.140
that gets removed from the sky.

37:55.140 --> 37:56.490
We can, maybe we can account it

37:56.490 --> 37:58.470
for our corporate sustainability goals

37:58.470 --> 38:01.440
or maybe it's something we can just kind of learn about

38:01.440 --> 38:04.710
and then to teach other people about or do consulting

38:04.710 --> 38:07.500
or somehow our company can benefit from this.

38:07.500 --> 38:08.333
So if you can find somebody like that,

38:08.333 --> 38:12.930
it's like a customer for carbon removal, then that's a,

38:12.930 --> 38:15.210
that's a huge win.

38:15.210 --> 38:16.560
<v ->Yeah, I will just second it.</v>

38:16.560 --> 38:19.200
Customer, institution, investor. Absolutely.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.520
<v ->Incredible. Incredible.</v>

38:20.520 --> 38:21.960
All right, and so the last question I wanna ask.

38:21.960 --> 38:24.480
So I'm a futurist, so it's always trying to figure out,

38:24.480 --> 38:27.930
you know, how are today's trends shaping tomorrow

38:27.930 --> 38:29.760
and how that applies sustainability.

38:29.760 --> 38:31.080
So looking ahead,

38:31.080 --> 38:32.400
I want to actually have you all

38:32.400 --> 38:34.260
put on a little bit of a futurist cap right now,

38:34.260 --> 38:38.850
is what do you see as the next big opportunity

38:38.850 --> 38:41.310
for sustainable VC investments?

38:41.310 --> 38:44.160
Like what's that technology, what's that emerging market?

38:46.320 --> 38:47.153
<v ->I'll go first.</v>

38:49.320 --> 38:52.020
I think there's definitely a couple of avenues

38:52.020 --> 38:53.910
and I also see things as a continuum,

38:53.910 --> 38:56.710
you know, because to right now, if I had basically said,

38:57.630 --> 38:59.880
you know, compute to support AI,

38:59.880 --> 39:03.270
part of that is what's kind of like right now

39:03.270 --> 39:05.940
except for the fact that it's not, it's generational.

39:05.940 --> 39:07.980
You know, we wanna take steps towards that.

39:07.980 --> 39:10.440
And I think we're at the very beginning of it

39:10.440 --> 39:13.800
in the sense that we're still working with yesteryear's,

39:13.800 --> 39:15.360
you know, architecture for the most part,

39:15.360 --> 39:17.013
we're trying to make it work.

39:17.850 --> 39:19.260
And so I would say for me,

39:19.260 --> 39:21.060
there'd be kind of two main sectors,

39:21.060 --> 39:22.650
which is energy storage.

39:22.650 --> 39:25.140
In the end of the day, battery can only go so far.

39:25.140 --> 39:28.950
We're already at incremental improvements in lithium

39:28.950 --> 39:31.800
and we really need to figure out what that next big thing is

39:31.800 --> 39:33.810
because it has a lot of pros and cons.

39:33.810 --> 39:36.480
You know, if you go try to drive a EV in the dead of winter,

39:36.480 --> 39:39.519
you'll get a real good sense of your range,

39:39.519 --> 39:40.470
you know, for that.

39:40.470 --> 39:42.390
And it's highly combustible.

39:42.390 --> 39:44.220
So, you know, we have that thing going for us.

39:44.220 --> 39:46.350
So I really think it's energy storage

39:46.350 --> 39:49.260
and also a ways to continue to support,

39:49.260 --> 39:51.570
I would say more aggressive compute power,

39:51.570 --> 39:54.090
but with, with actually needing less energy.

39:54.090 --> 39:55.260
<v Brian >Excellent. Tito.</v>

39:55.260 --> 39:56.760
<v ->Yeah, carbon removal.</v>

39:56.760 --> 40:00.570
It's gotta grow as fast as biotech, as fast as computing.

40:00.570 --> 40:03.270
And it is just in its infancy now.

40:03.270 --> 40:05.730
You're seeing early investors jump in,

40:05.730 --> 40:07.470
you're seeing big corporates

40:07.470 --> 40:11.010
like Microsoft, Mitsubishi, Stripe and Shopify

40:11.010 --> 40:14.431
all seeing this as a market opportunity for them.

40:14.431 --> 40:17.040
And if you can get to the point where you see that too

40:17.040 --> 40:19.430
suddenly a lot of things are gonna look like opportunities.

40:19.430 --> 40:20.263
<v Brian >And Limor.</v>

40:20.263 --> 40:23.730
<v ->So I'll add also energy, the gen side of energy.</v>

40:23.730 --> 40:28.440
So energy generation, we still need to, I'll just say it,

40:28.440 --> 40:31.680
we still need to move away from oil and gas and,

40:31.680 --> 40:33.750
but we need to be, we're looking for that next gen,

40:33.750 --> 40:36.150
what is that? Is it micro nuclear? What's beyond that?

40:36.150 --> 40:39.570
What is going to be addressing that? To go to the storage.

40:39.570 --> 40:41.580
But also, and then the on the other side,

40:41.580 --> 40:43.380
how are we doing the end of life?

40:43.380 --> 40:45.750
How are we managing end of life and recycling

40:45.750 --> 40:48.480
all this technology that we say that we're going green,

40:48.480 --> 40:50.490
but you know what? It's not that green.

40:50.490 --> 40:52.770
So can we get greener with a green technology

40:52.770 --> 40:54.300
that we're actually working?

40:54.300 --> 40:57.240
And the third I would say it's data, data, data, data.

40:57.240 --> 40:59.370
How do we use data to become more efficient?

40:59.370 --> 41:04.080
How do we use data to deliver services more effectively?

41:04.080 --> 41:06.120
So I would say those three.

41:06.120 --> 41:06.953
<v ->Excellent.</v>

41:06.953 --> 41:09.900
Corinna, Tito, Limor, thank you so much for your time today.

41:09.900 --> 41:11.250
Thank you all for attending.

41:11.250 --> 41:13.620
And that takes us to the end of our panel

41:13.620 --> 41:15.000
and we'll step off stage,

41:15.000 --> 41:16.290
and of course if people have questions,

41:16.290 --> 41:17.790
feel free to come up and ask us.

41:17.790 --> 41:20.514
But thank you so much for your time today. Thank you.

41:20.514 --> 41:23.097
(upbeat music)
