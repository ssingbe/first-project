00:00.590 --> 00:03.173
(bright music)

2
00:11.021 --> 00:11.940
<v ->The human connection.</v>

3
00:11.940 --> 00:16.080
How do people fit into technology, really, ultimately.

4
00:16.080 --> 00:19.530
We're fortunate to have really some all star panelists,

5
00:19.530 --> 00:21.510
so I'll take a moment to introduce each one.

6
00:21.510 --> 00:24.690
First, our first panelist is Lilian Coral,

7
00:24.690 --> 00:27.300
Vice President of Technology and Democracy Programs,

8
00:27.300 --> 00:31.950
and head of Open Technology Institute at New America.

9
00:31.950 --> 00:34.800
Lilian is a recognized leader in advancing citizen-centered

10
00:34.800 --> 00:36.690
smart cities strategies,

11
00:36.690 --> 00:39.630
leveraging technology and data to drive transparency

12
00:39.630 --> 00:41.160
and innovation and governance.

13
00:41.160 --> 00:44.250
And she's also served as the Chief Data Officer

14
00:44.250 --> 00:46.050
for the city of Los Angeles,

15
00:46.050 --> 00:48.240
where she transformed how the city used data

16
00:48.240 --> 00:49.290
to serve its residents.

17
00:49.290 --> 00:51.570
So, Lilian, welcome.

18
00:51.570 --> 00:54.480
Next we have Dr. Bettina Experton,

19
00:54.480 --> 00:56.820
the President and CEO of Humetrix.

20
00:56.820 --> 00:59.340
This is a company that empowers healthcare consumers

21
00:59.340 --> 01:02.280
through cutting edge mobile health solutions.

22
01:02.280 --> 01:04.890
Dr. Experton has over 25 years of experience

23
01:04.890 --> 01:07.380
pioneering innovations in population health

24
01:07.380 --> 01:09.420
and chronic care management,

25
01:09.420 --> 01:12.510
with her technologies deployed worldwide.

26
01:12.510 --> 01:15.420
She's also a trained physician and public health expert,

27
01:15.420 --> 01:18.090
bringing a wealth of knowledge to the intersection

28
01:18.090 --> 01:20.820
of healthcare and technology.

29
01:20.820 --> 01:23.250
And finally, we're joined by Kevin Webb,

30
01:23.250 --> 01:25.800
Senior Director of Sustainability and Social Impact

31
01:25.800 --> 01:28.080
for Mitsubishi Electric US.

32
01:28.080 --> 01:31.380
Kevin leads sustainability initiatives across the Americas

33
01:31.380 --> 01:35.100
and directs the Mitsubishi America Foundation,

34
01:35.100 --> 01:38.460
which focuses on inclusion and accessibility.

35
01:38.460 --> 01:39.720
With extensive experience

36
01:39.720 --> 01:41.310
in corporate social responsibility,

37
01:41.310 --> 01:44.250
he is a key advocate for integrating sustainability

38
01:44.250 --> 01:46.380
and digital inclusion into business

39
01:46.380 --> 01:48.300
and community strategies.

40
01:48.300 --> 01:51.060
So awesome to be with the three of you.

41
01:51.060 --> 01:52.650
Glad to have had the chance to really get to know

42
01:52.650 --> 01:55.833
each of you over the past month and past days.

43
01:56.850 --> 01:58.590
So one of the things we were talking about,

44
01:58.590 --> 02:00.600
in advance of this discussion,

45
02:00.600 --> 02:02.790
is really what are we talking about with,

46
02:02.790 --> 02:06.180
you know, digital inclusion and ultimately,

47
02:06.180 --> 02:07.260
I'm gonna turn to each panelist

48
02:07.260 --> 02:09.480
and ask them to share their thoughts.

49
02:09.480 --> 02:12.690
But our goal for this session really is to talk about,

50
02:12.690 --> 02:14.670
you know, the human side of technology.

51
02:14.670 --> 02:17.820
How do we make sure that there is inclusion, that for,

52
02:17.820 --> 02:20.400
you know, we're at a point in time right now where we see,

53
02:20.400 --> 02:23.310
if we went to the Nvidia presentation last night,

54
02:23.310 --> 02:26.340
just the tremendous change that is happening all around us,

55
02:26.340 --> 02:29.733
and how do we make sure that people are included in that,

56
02:29.733 --> 02:32.520
that there's not a divide in terms of accessibility,

57
02:32.520 --> 02:34.380
in fairness and so forth.

58
02:34.380 --> 02:36.240
So, Lilian let me start with you.

59
02:36.240 --> 02:39.480
I mean, the question really is around digital inclusion.

60
02:39.480 --> 02:42.180
I mean, how would you define digital inclusion?

61
02:42.180 --> 02:43.980
What does that mean to you?

62
02:43.980 --> 02:45.900
<v ->Well, at the Open Technology Institute,</v>

63
02:45.900 --> 02:47.400
our mission, as an example,

64
02:47.400 --> 02:50.970
is ensure that every American has access

65
02:50.970 --> 02:52.260
to technology and its benefits.

66
02:52.260 --> 02:55.290
We're a US based organization.

67
02:55.290 --> 02:57.540
And so for us, inclusion means that

68
02:57.540 --> 03:01.560
literally everyone in this country and it need not be,

69
03:01.560 --> 03:02.393
obviously just America.

70
03:02.393 --> 03:05.640
Everyone in this space really has an accessibility,

71
03:05.640 --> 03:07.170
a way to enter the internet,

72
03:07.170 --> 03:11.160
and then has the ability to really maximize that experience

73
03:11.160 --> 03:12.330
to their own benefits.

74
03:12.330 --> 03:15.090
So to ensure that they can access the health resources

75
03:15.090 --> 03:19.005
they need, pursue the education they'd like to pursue,

76
03:19.005 --> 03:21.240
to be able to have the economic opportunities

77
03:21.240 --> 03:24.480
that they envision, or if they are, you know,

78
03:24.480 --> 03:27.090
if they have accessibility issues,

79
03:27.090 --> 03:30.120
that they are able to have the tools to be able

80
03:30.120 --> 03:31.950
to really leverage that technology.

81
03:31.950 --> 03:34.200
So, you know, if you're blind that you can navigate,

82
03:34.200 --> 03:37.140
you can still navigate here, experience the internet.

83
03:37.140 --> 03:38.880
So for us, inclusion really is

84
03:38.880 --> 03:41.100
getting everybody on the internet

85
03:41.100 --> 03:43.350
and being able to maximize that experience.

86
03:43.350 --> 03:44.433
What I would just,

87
03:45.960 --> 03:47.670
where I would leave the definition is just

88
03:47.670 --> 03:52.670
as a grounding context is there's one key data point here.

89
03:52.710 --> 03:54.990
One in every five households in the United States

90
03:54.990 --> 03:56.880
does not have access to the internet,

91
03:56.880 --> 04:00.180
and that is because it's either too expensive

92
04:00.180 --> 04:02.550
or it's not available in that area

93
04:02.550 --> 04:04.890
because there just isn't service coverage in the way

94
04:04.890 --> 04:07.800
that we are structured as a country in terms

95
04:07.800 --> 04:10.470
of service availability and infrastructure.

96
04:10.470 --> 04:11.700
Over the last four years,

97
04:11.700 --> 04:15.240
we have invested as a country over $65 billion

98
04:15.240 --> 04:16.890
to try to make inroads in that.

99
04:16.890 --> 04:19.530
But that number still persists, so one in five households.

100
04:19.530 --> 04:22.800
And that's really where we like to think about

101
04:22.800 --> 04:25.350
like the digital inclusion journey begins.

102
04:25.350 --> 04:27.480
How do we get that one remaining household back online?

103
04:27.480 --> 04:29.729
<v ->It's an incredible number really to think about</v>

104
04:29.729 --> 04:31.530
that in this day and age that there's that kind

105
04:31.530 --> 04:32.640
of a divide still.

106
04:32.640 --> 04:36.060
And one wonders what happens as more and more technology

107
04:36.060 --> 04:38.160
rolls out and the existence of that.

108
04:38.160 --> 04:40.950
So, thank you Lilian. Bettina, what about yourself?

109
04:40.950 --> 04:42.720
And you bring a kinda an international

110
04:42.720 --> 04:43.980
perspective, as well.

111
04:43.980 --> 04:45.900
So when you think about digital inclusion,

112
04:45.900 --> 04:48.183
what does that mean and why does it matter?

113
04:49.140 --> 04:52.230
<v ->So as a physician who became a technologist</v>

114
04:52.230 --> 04:55.710
and as a founder and CEO of my company, Humetrix,

115
04:55.710 --> 04:58.683
which is about software for human beings,

116
04:59.520 --> 05:03.420
for us, technology has to make a difference in our lives.

117
05:03.420 --> 05:05.520
And when it comes to healthcare,

118
05:05.520 --> 05:09.060
sometimes it's a life and death opportunity

119
05:09.060 --> 05:11.283
or missed opportunity to be impactful.

120
05:12.360 --> 05:15.990
And so technology has to be meaningful,

121
05:15.990 --> 05:20.990
it has to be accessible, it has to be user friendly

122
05:21.000 --> 05:24.300
so that with regard to healthcare,

123
05:24.300 --> 05:27.870
we can address the barriers to access healthcare.

124
05:27.870 --> 05:32.310
It's complex. It's multiple point of contact.

125
05:32.310 --> 05:35.070
The information is not available at your fingertip.

126
05:35.070 --> 05:38.310
And as a patient, as a citizen,

127
05:38.310 --> 05:40.740
it's language you don't understand.

128
05:40.740 --> 05:43.620
So we have developed technology globally

129
05:43.620 --> 05:47.550
to address those barriers in communication

130
05:47.550 --> 05:51.510
between a patient and his doctor, his nurse.

131
05:51.510 --> 05:54.843
And so it's medical literacy.

132
05:56.160 --> 05:59.100
It's impossible to converse,

133
05:59.100 --> 06:00.510
because you don't speak the language.

134
06:00.510 --> 06:03.180
We travel the world, disease travel the world,

135
06:03.180 --> 06:06.210
we just came out of a horrific pandemic.

136
06:06.210 --> 06:10.800
So we have to be able to communicate our needs

137
06:10.800 --> 06:14.010
and our technology for us, the technology we provide

138
06:14.010 --> 06:18.010
is a platform of communication across languages

139
06:19.526 --> 06:23.190
and brings that knowledge at your fingertip,

140
06:23.190 --> 06:26.550
both for patients and also the physician receiving

141
06:26.550 --> 06:28.890
or communicating back to those patients.

142
06:28.890 --> 06:31.350
<v ->Yeah, I think you've got really a fantastic</v>

143
06:31.350 --> 06:33.810
real world example of that that we'll wanna get to

144
06:33.810 --> 06:36.300
because it's something that people could relate to,

145
06:36.300 --> 06:37.530
relative to the Olympics.

146
06:37.530 --> 06:39.540
So I'm gonna come back to you in a moment.

147
06:39.540 --> 06:41.660
Kevin, what about yourself?

148
06:41.660 --> 06:44.940
How are you seeing digital inclusion in your world?

149
06:44.940 --> 06:47.280
<v ->Yeah, so Mitsubishi Electric,</v>

150
06:47.280 --> 06:50.190
when we think about the products we make,

151
06:50.190 --> 06:52.050
we really want to contribute to a sustainable,

152
06:52.050 --> 06:53.130
smart society.

153
06:53.130 --> 06:55.257
So society is of course the center of that,

154
06:55.257 --> 06:57.300
the people in the society.

155
06:57.300 --> 07:01.053
And we make infrastructure, factory automation equipment,

156
07:02.070 --> 07:03.960
big screen TVs.

157
07:03.960 --> 07:07.530
And as we think about the products we make,

158
07:07.530 --> 07:09.540
we wanna make sure that people can access them

159
07:09.540 --> 07:10.770
and that they're connected.

160
07:10.770 --> 07:12.330
And so we think about digital inclusion,

161
07:12.330 --> 07:15.720
it's how do we connect hardware and software

162
07:15.720 --> 07:18.750
and bring 'em together as far as the company goes.

163
07:18.750 --> 07:21.780
And our foundation, Mitsubishi Electric America Foundation,

164
07:21.780 --> 07:23.850
35 years ago, we established the foundation

165
07:23.850 --> 07:26.760
to really focus on empowering young people with disabilities

166
07:26.760 --> 07:28.560
to lead productive lives.

167
07:28.560 --> 07:30.630
So when we think about our work

168
07:30.630 --> 07:34.590
helping young people transition from school to work,

169
07:34.590 --> 07:36.990
what does that mean in terms of the new digital age

170
07:36.990 --> 07:39.000
and the job opportunities that are there?

171
07:39.000 --> 07:40.530
How should we be preparing young people with disabilities?

172
07:40.530 --> 07:42.150
So we think about digital inclusion,

173
07:42.150 --> 07:45.170
it's really making sure that the one in four people

174
07:45.170 --> 07:48.450
in the United States, the billion people globally

175
07:48.450 --> 07:51.030
that have some form of disability,

176
07:51.030 --> 07:54.480
can really be truly included in that process.

177
07:54.480 --> 07:57.970
So thinking about how do we make the tech we're creating

178
07:59.010 --> 08:03.030
fully inclusive, starting with inclusion from the beginning,

179
08:03.030 --> 08:07.230
making it accessible and really tying that into

180
08:07.230 --> 08:10.860
the technology, both again, the hardware and the software

181
08:10.860 --> 08:12.450
and creating a whole ecosystem

182
08:12.450 --> 08:16.950
so that people can fully participate and be fully inclusive.

183
08:16.950 --> 08:19.020
<v Joe>Yeah, so Kevin, in your experience, I mean,</v>

184
08:19.020 --> 08:21.240
how big of a an issue is this?

185
08:21.240 --> 08:23.490
I mean, and who is it affecting

186
08:23.490 --> 08:26.400
and can you give some examples of maybe of the scope

187
08:26.400 --> 08:28.830
of the impact, just to make it real for everybody?

188
08:28.830 --> 08:30.930
<v ->Yeah, so as I mentioned, so in the United States,</v>

189
08:30.930 --> 08:33.840
one in four people have some type of disability.

190
08:33.840 --> 08:35.610
Most people find that hard to believe.

191
08:35.610 --> 08:37.890
But if you think about disability broadly

192
08:37.890 --> 08:41.580
and think about chronic illnesses and mental health issues

193
08:41.580 --> 08:44.430
and so forth, it impacts all of us,

194
08:44.430 --> 08:49.050
either personally or someone we love and care for.

195
08:49.050 --> 08:53.933
So we think about healthcare and in the impact

196
08:55.980 --> 08:59.370
of the digital technology in accessing

197
08:59.370 --> 09:00.450
the healthcare system.

198
09:00.450 --> 09:02.760
So yesterday we were actually sponsoring

199
09:02.760 --> 09:06.390
an innovation challenge with a CTA foundation.

200
09:06.390 --> 09:08.910
I happen to serve as a trustee with that organization

201
09:08.910 --> 09:12.600
and thinking about digital health tech

202
09:12.600 --> 09:15.060
for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

203
09:15.060 --> 09:18.750
And how do you really, again, start from the beginning

204
09:18.750 --> 09:22.320
to develop that technology inclusively

205
09:22.320 --> 09:25.500
and thinking about how do we connect

206
09:25.500 --> 09:30.000
the various systems we have and make it interoperable,

207
09:30.000 --> 09:32.100
easy to use so that people with all backgrounds

208
09:32.100 --> 09:34.710
and abilities can fully access and fully participate

209
09:34.710 --> 09:36.060
in their own healthcare decisions

210
09:36.060 --> 09:38.070
and control their technology.

211
09:38.070 --> 09:41.970
So we recognized a company yesterday thinking about that,

212
09:41.970 --> 09:45.090
but these are issues that impact everyone.

213
09:45.090 --> 09:47.670
Again, the person with a disability, their caregivers,

214
09:47.670 --> 09:49.950
their family, the doctors that work with them,

215
09:49.950 --> 09:54.120
the first responders that work with them, their employers.

216
09:54.120 --> 09:56.910
And so it's an issue that is pervasive

217
09:56.910 --> 09:59.130
and if you really want to be fully inclusive,

218
09:59.130 --> 10:00.330
as we develop that technology,

219
10:00.330 --> 10:05.330
making sure that it is available for everyone to use is key.

220
10:05.670 --> 10:06.780
<v ->Awesome, thank you.</v>

221
10:06.780 --> 10:09.150
Now, Bettina, you've had a real example.

222
10:09.150 --> 10:10.950
10 million people came together

223
10:10.950 --> 10:13.620
for the recent Olympics in Paris.

224
10:13.620 --> 10:16.380
All kinds of issues in terms of people who might fall ill

225
10:16.380 --> 10:18.450
or be injured, be able to communicate,

226
10:18.450 --> 10:20.850
talk a little bit about what you saw in terms of

227
10:20.850 --> 10:24.450
how the human connection can bridge the gap

228
10:24.450 --> 10:28.353
between language and technology to help get better results.

229
10:29.400 --> 10:33.540
<v ->So that was a extraordinary example of</v>

230
10:33.540 --> 10:36.153
what we could face at scale.

231
10:37.068 --> 10:38.520
So here in one place,

232
10:38.520 --> 10:41.710
10 million people from all over the world are gathering

233
10:42.630 --> 10:46.470
to watch, to live that extraordinary Olympics experience,

234
10:46.470 --> 10:48.270
but things can happen.

235
10:48.270 --> 10:50.730
You can get hurt, you can fall,

236
10:50.730 --> 10:55.680
you can catch, you know, something of infectious disease.

237
10:55.680 --> 11:00.390
And what the local health authority were concerned about

238
11:00.390 --> 11:05.390
was to adequately care and triage the health needs

239
11:06.060 --> 11:10.230
of those 10 million plus people who came as spectators,

240
11:10.230 --> 11:13.260
the 15,000 athletes and para-athletes

241
11:13.260 --> 11:17.010
who came from all over the world when those physicians

242
11:17.010 --> 11:20.280
and nurses and paramedics didn't speak their language.

243
11:20.280 --> 11:24.660
So the technology we developed to again,

244
11:24.660 --> 11:28.320
resolve that language barriers

245
11:28.320 --> 11:30.540
and also this medical language barrier,

246
11:30.540 --> 11:33.600
which is more complex, is something way beyond

247
11:33.600 --> 11:35.970
what you could get with Google translate.

248
11:35.970 --> 11:38.550
So it's technology which can even speak

249
11:38.550 --> 11:40.900
your medical history, your needs

250
11:41.790 --> 11:44.250
in the language of the person you are seeing.

251
11:44.250 --> 11:45.690
So you travel the world here,

252
11:45.690 --> 11:48.300
you come to Paris for the Olympics.

253
11:48.300 --> 11:51.900
So at every competition site, in the first aid station,

254
11:51.900 --> 11:54.450
they could immediately access our software,

255
11:54.450 --> 11:59.450
global health communicator to say or speak

256
11:59.760 --> 12:03.810
why they were there, any kind of important medical history

257
12:03.810 --> 12:06.930
there to communicate what medication they took.

258
12:06.930 --> 12:10.053
And even if you think of the simple Tylenol here,

259
12:11.040 --> 12:14.580
if you go abroad and look for Tylenol, you'll not find it

260
12:14.580 --> 12:16.950
because it's provided under different names.

261
12:16.950 --> 12:18.930
So it takes complex technology.

262
12:18.930 --> 12:21.330
That's where technology can break those

263
12:21.330 --> 12:25.200
barriers of information, access, and communication.

264
12:25.200 --> 12:27.510
Takes a type of technology we develop

265
12:27.510 --> 12:30.000
to look for the active ingredient of that drug

266
12:30.000 --> 12:32.010
and find the corresponding medication

267
12:32.010 --> 12:35.070
available in the country, you have visit in real time.

268
12:35.070 --> 12:38.520
So at the end of the day, thousands of people

269
12:38.520 --> 12:42.543
benefited from that technology from 97 different countries

270
12:43.590 --> 12:47.190
and region of the world and speaking 22 languages.

271
12:47.190 --> 12:48.147
<v ->I mean, that's incredible.</v>

272
12:48.147 --> 12:50.670
And I can imagine the urgency of the situation,

273
12:50.670 --> 12:53.573
someone has an immediate situation

274
12:53.573 --> 12:55.650
and the technology that can bridge that gap

275
12:55.650 --> 12:56.670
and help people communicate,

276
12:56.670 --> 12:59.070
so clearly a way to bring people together.

277
12:59.070 --> 12:59.940
Lilian, how about yourself?

278
12:59.940 --> 13:03.030
What is an example of where you've seen

279
13:03.030 --> 13:06.930
either a lack of digital inclusion and the adverse impact

280
13:06.930 --> 13:09.360
of that or where you've seen a solution

281
13:09.360 --> 13:10.950
that people have come together to bring

282
13:10.950 --> 13:12.150
to help bridge that gap?

283
13:13.380 --> 13:17.970
<v ->Yeah, so I think, you know, from sort of the</v>

284
13:17.970 --> 13:21.570
deficit perspective, I think we think about examples

285
13:21.570 --> 13:24.210
I shared with you, like for example, diabetes

286
13:24.210 --> 13:27.777
is like one of the most sort of widely..

287
13:31.140 --> 13:35.400
It's one of the most common diseases here in the US.

288
13:35.400 --> 13:38.760
And a lot of information or a lot of access

289
13:38.760 --> 13:42.540
to be able to treat the disease.

290
13:42.540 --> 13:44.520
And it's actually a disease that's also very common,

291
13:44.520 --> 13:47.580
like where your economic background

292
13:47.580 --> 13:50.100
and your socioeconomic background really impacts

293
13:50.100 --> 13:52.500
your ability to manage your disease.

294
13:52.500 --> 13:55.710
A lot of the resources and ability to manage that disease

295
13:55.710 --> 13:59.580
are online and yet, like we discussed earlier, you know,

296
13:59.580 --> 14:02.310
the one in five households are usually the ones

297
14:02.310 --> 14:05.730
who are most likely to have these kinds of chronic diseases

298
14:05.730 --> 14:07.650
and not have access to internet

299
14:07.650 --> 14:09.510
to be able to then manage the disease

300
14:09.510 --> 14:12.630
or manage resources that could help improve,

301
14:12.630 --> 14:14.980
like environmental conditions that can help it.

302
14:15.930 --> 14:18.810
My background is really mostly in smart cities

303
14:18.810 --> 14:20.670
as government implements it.

304
14:20.670 --> 14:22.710
And so from a government background,

305
14:22.710 --> 14:25.290
you can imagine that like mitigating the cost,

306
14:25.290 --> 14:28.650
the prevalence of these kinds of diseases

307
14:28.650 --> 14:31.260
and then trying to manage even environmental conditions

308
14:31.260 --> 14:32.460
to help communities thrive.

309
14:32.460 --> 14:35.700
Like not having access to the internet is a big issue.

310
14:35.700 --> 14:37.950
The other kind of counter example that I would give is

311
14:37.950 --> 14:40.260
around even just something like disaster response.

312
14:40.260 --> 14:42.570
I live in California, we're in the midst right now,

313
14:42.570 --> 14:45.390
one of a huge weather storm alert,

314
14:45.390 --> 14:48.180
and then also just a huge fire that just erupted.

315
14:48.180 --> 14:51.540
In these times, the ability to communicate widely

316
14:51.540 --> 14:53.520
and broadly are just really, really critical.

317
14:53.520 --> 14:57.900
And as we have more and more weather related events,

318
14:57.900 --> 14:59.940
weather related emergencies, you know,

319
14:59.940 --> 15:02.640
the ability of government to communicate to citizens

320
15:02.640 --> 15:04.470
is going to be really critical.

321
15:04.470 --> 15:06.990
On the flip side of that, even to communicate to citizens,

322
15:06.990 --> 15:08.850
things that are happening in their community

323
15:08.850 --> 15:12.180
for community engagement or for civic engagement purposes.

324
15:12.180 --> 15:14.340
These are all reasons that require

325
15:14.340 --> 15:15.630
more and more connectivity.

326
15:15.630 --> 15:19.590
And I think it's, you know, it's also an opportunity

327
15:19.590 --> 15:21.480
not just to access the information,

328
15:21.480 --> 15:22.950
but really to start thinking about

329
15:22.950 --> 15:25.980
when you access the internet and that information,

330
15:25.980 --> 15:27.630
are you able, do you have the skills

331
15:27.630 --> 15:31.770
to really be able to understand what is real information,

332
15:31.770 --> 15:34.680
what is fake or mis or disinformation?

333
15:34.680 --> 15:37.740
So those are really, I think, some concrete examples

334
15:37.740 --> 15:40.260
that we're dealing with on the community front.

335
15:40.260 --> 15:45.260
I think where there are bright stars in some ways

336
15:45.360 --> 15:48.750
on the digital inclusion side, you know,

337
15:48.750 --> 15:52.380
I think it's much more of, the bright spots I would say,

338
15:52.380 --> 15:54.630
and I don't know that there's a solution per se, is that,

339
15:54.630 --> 15:57.510
you know, this is a much more commonly known

340
15:57.510 --> 15:59.850
and I think understood issue, right?

341
15:59.850 --> 16:03.060
There's more of a recognition that we do have to get

342
16:03.060 --> 16:06.210
and ensure that everybody has access to the internet

343
16:06.210 --> 16:08.760
that has access to trustworthy information.

344
16:08.760 --> 16:11.610
But there's still a lot of gaps in terms of understanding

345
16:12.570 --> 16:16.050
the pervasiveness of the divide,

346
16:16.050 --> 16:20.730
the amount of sort of cost that it is to the individual

347
16:20.730 --> 16:22.320
to be able to access the internet.

348
16:22.320 --> 16:23.883
I think there's just not,

349
16:24.847 --> 16:26.640
I don't think we have a common understanding about,

350
16:26.640 --> 16:28.800
you know, like the figure, I said one in five households,

351
16:28.800 --> 16:30.360
how much it costs those households,

352
16:30.360 --> 16:35.040
and then the ability to really understand the competencies.

353
16:35.040 --> 16:37.800
We don't have a real kind of common definition

354
16:37.800 --> 16:40.860
or understanding of digital inclusion to say

355
16:40.860 --> 16:43.380
that there are common competencies that people need to

356
16:43.380 --> 16:45.780
be had, but there is a bright spot in that we understand

357
16:45.780 --> 16:46.830
that this is an issue

358
16:46.830 --> 16:48.510
and that we have to do something about it.

359
16:48.510 --> 16:53.010
So that's sort of how I would kind of frame the opportunity.

360
16:53.010 --> 16:54.300
<v ->So you mentioned skills.</v>

361
16:54.300 --> 16:56.280
I mean, this is something else, like when we think about

362
16:56.280 --> 16:58.110
what are the skills that people are gonna need,

363
16:58.110 --> 17:00.930
I mean, one of the things that we see certainly is AI,

364
17:00.930 --> 17:02.640
which is becoming more and more pervasive,

365
17:02.640 --> 17:03.630
it's gonna affect jobs,

366
17:03.630 --> 17:05.280
many people think it will replace jobs,

367
17:05.280 --> 17:07.200
and maybe over the short term it won't as much

368
17:07.200 --> 17:09.990
as replace parts of jobs,

369
17:09.990 --> 17:11.760
things that might be easy to automate,

370
17:11.760 --> 17:13.500
administrative kinds of things.

371
17:13.500 --> 17:16.560
So certainly there are skills that people are gonna need,

372
17:16.560 --> 17:19.380
resilience and courage and a whole range of other things,

373
17:19.380 --> 17:20.580
emotional intelligence.

374
17:20.580 --> 17:22.740
What are the kinds of skills that you think

375
17:22.740 --> 17:25.080
people are gonna need really to thrive

376
17:25.080 --> 17:27.047
and to ensure that there is this inclusivity,

377
17:27.047 --> 17:30.780
that they're not swept behind, so to speak?

378
17:30.780 --> 17:32.040
<v ->Well, there's a lot of different frameworks</v>

379
17:32.040 --> 17:33.920
and studies across the world.

380
17:33.920 --> 17:35.970
In the US, we don't have a common framework,

381
17:35.970 --> 17:37.560
but I think things, as you've described,

382
17:37.560 --> 17:39.750
things that we think about in terms of core competencies

383
17:39.750 --> 17:43.320
or things on the basic front, like data literacy,

384
17:43.320 --> 17:45.750
but it is also things like problem solving skills.

385
17:45.750 --> 17:47.340
I think the emotional intelligence piece

386
17:47.340 --> 17:49.140
that you talk about is so critical,

387
17:49.140 --> 17:52.950
the ability to go online and understand, one,

388
17:52.950 --> 17:54.810
whether the information you're seeing is true or not,

389
17:54.810 --> 17:56.497
but also to be able to kind of think,

390
17:56.497 --> 17:57.810
"Does this sound truthful?"

391
17:57.810 --> 18:01.290
Where could you, like to be able to investigate more deeply

392
18:01.290 --> 18:03.750
into what you're seeing and not take it as is,

393
18:03.750 --> 18:06.630
all of that kind of emotional intelligence, problem solving,

394
18:06.630 --> 18:09.420
creativity, those are all part of digital skills

395
18:09.420 --> 18:11.760
and competencies, in addition to kind of basic things

396
18:11.760 --> 18:15.090
like data literacy, like being able to turn on a device

397
18:15.090 --> 18:16.893
and know how to navigate the device.

398
18:17.730 --> 18:20.310
So, and then the other, I think there's a couple

399
18:20.310 --> 18:23.160
of other pieces around like privacy and security

400
18:23.160 --> 18:24.300
that we talk about, right?

401
18:24.300 --> 18:26.820
Like a lot of us even, you know,

402
18:26.820 --> 18:28.320
someone who would think of herself

403
18:28.320 --> 18:31.710
as pretty digitally literate.

404
18:31.710 --> 18:34.800
We don't understand the degree to which our devices

405
18:34.800 --> 18:37.230
need to be secure or could be secured, right?

406
18:37.230 --> 18:38.610
I think a lot of times right now

407
18:38.610 --> 18:41.070
we're struggling with a lot of cybersecurity issues

408
18:41.070 --> 18:43.620
that are becoming much more consumer facing.

409
18:43.620 --> 18:47.610
A lot of scams and phishing that will catch even the most,

410
18:47.610 --> 18:50.040
you know, like literate of us, as we're seeing.

411
18:50.040 --> 18:53.310
So there's things, competencies also have to include

412
18:53.310 --> 18:56.950
things like security, like navigating privacy settings

413
18:58.020 --> 19:01.980
and solutions and tools to really keep people private.

414
19:01.980 --> 19:05.040
So I would say there's data literacy, there's security,

415
19:05.040 --> 19:08.310
there's privacy, but there's a lot of emotional, social,

416
19:08.310 --> 19:12.510
emotional, and then also as we were saying,

417
19:12.510 --> 19:15.090
emotional intelligence and problem solving skills

418
19:15.090 --> 19:18.300
that really need to be part of a,

419
19:18.300 --> 19:21.030
almost like a comprehensive set of skills

420
19:21.030 --> 19:22.410
that need to be put together.

421
19:22.410 --> 19:24.030
<v ->It's interesting, you talked about even just</v>

422
19:24.030 --> 19:26.102
the critical thinking skills.
<v ->Critical thinking.</v>

423
19:26.102 --> 19:27.180
<v ->I mean, think about how many times there could be</v>

424
19:27.180 --> 19:30.240
hallucinations in AI and you seek data,

425
19:30.240 --> 19:32.910
you might seek a even a medical type of thing

426
19:32.910 --> 19:35.400
that could be completely wrong or made up and so forth.

427
19:35.400 --> 19:36.960
Bettina or Kevin, what about yourself?

428
19:36.960 --> 19:39.240
What are the skills you think that really

429
19:39.240 --> 19:41.160
are gonna be if we look, you know, a year,

430
19:41.160 --> 19:42.450
five years, 10 years out,

431
19:42.450 --> 19:44.490
but even in the short term, what are some of the skills

432
19:44.490 --> 19:46.080
that you think are really important to ensure

433
19:46.080 --> 19:47.907
that people are included

434
19:47.907 --> 19:51.870
and that they can thrive as technology continues to advance?

435
19:51.870 --> 19:55.410
<v ->So one of the great benefit of AI is that</v>

436
19:55.410 --> 19:56.730
on the receiving end,

437
19:56.730 --> 20:01.730
it will require less skill to understand, you know,

438
20:01.950 --> 20:06.180
our environment and for that technology to be truly useful

439
20:06.180 --> 20:07.890
and personalized for us.

440
20:07.890 --> 20:11.610
So technology fails when it needs to be come

441
20:11.610 --> 20:12.960
with instruction, right?

442
20:12.960 --> 20:15.030
It has to be totally intuitive.

443
20:15.030 --> 20:18.060
So we use a lot of AI in our technology,

444
20:18.060 --> 20:21.390
like the one we are speaking of deployed in the Olympics.

445
20:21.390 --> 20:24.690
We use generative AI to pre-populate

446
20:24.690 --> 20:28.560
all the type of symptoms you could complain from

447
20:28.560 --> 20:30.090
in various languages,

448
20:30.090 --> 20:32.220
according to your cultural differences.

449
20:32.220 --> 20:36.120
The way you talk about, I think in French they talk,

450
20:36.120 --> 20:37.470
I am originally from France,

451
20:37.470 --> 20:39.123
but I've been here for 40 years.

452
20:39.990 --> 20:44.010
When you have a bellyache, you talk about heartache.

453
20:44.010 --> 20:47.250
Well, if you translate that word for word in English,

454
20:47.250 --> 20:48.990
a physician may think that you have some issue

455
20:48.990 --> 20:50.973
with your heart when it is your belly.

456
20:52.507 --> 20:54.730
So generative AI pre-populates

457
20:55.590 --> 20:59.220
over 5,000 symptoms per language in various way.

458
20:59.220 --> 21:03.973
Someone from Brazil, the US or anywhere in the world

459
21:04.950 --> 21:08.010
could communicate and express what's wrong with them

460
21:08.010 --> 21:09.900
and why they need medical care.

461
21:09.900 --> 21:11.880
And so it's pre-populated,

462
21:11.880 --> 21:14.580
it's there for you to pick and choose quickly.

463
21:14.580 --> 21:17.340
So it's right there at your fingertips.

464
21:17.340 --> 21:20.310
You don't have to learn any skills to learn it.

465
21:20.310 --> 21:24.300
And you are a better communicator at the time of urgency

466
21:24.300 --> 21:29.027
where this miscommunication could lead to

467
21:30.000 --> 21:33.003
misdiagnosis and harm.

468
21:33.960 --> 21:38.007
So I see lots of benefits in AI and again,

469
21:38.007 --> 21:41.463
but you know, I've been in technology for 30 plus years.

470
21:42.593 --> 21:47.193
We reach our goal when it's intuitive and easy to use.

471
21:48.150 --> 21:50.190
So AI enables that.

472
21:50.190 --> 21:54.480
It takes human intelligence, in our area of healthcare,

473
21:54.480 --> 21:58.740
clinical intelligence to review the technology,

474
21:58.740 --> 22:01.410
to validate the output.

475
22:01.410 --> 22:04.500
It's not free floating, it's not access the world of data

476
22:04.500 --> 22:09.090
and pulling anything in, or since you talked about privacy,

477
22:09.090 --> 22:12.510
I mean, technology evolves, especially on the mobile side

478
22:12.510 --> 22:15.900
where you can run your AI engines software

479
22:15.900 --> 22:19.260
right there on the edge on your device.

480
22:19.260 --> 22:21.360
For the Olympics, and many of our application,

481
22:21.360 --> 22:24.570
we have a security privacy by design architecture.

482
22:24.570 --> 22:26.880
No personal information is stored in the cloud,

483
22:26.880 --> 22:28.500
no cybersecurity risk.

484
22:28.500 --> 22:31.560
You don't have to figure out privacy setting

485
22:31.560 --> 22:33.210
because your data don't go anywhere.

486
22:33.210 --> 22:38.100
They stay put in your device and encrypt it secure.

487
22:38.100 --> 22:41.940
So there are ways to address those true risk

488
22:41.940 --> 22:45.300
and at the same time benefit from those technology advance

489
22:45.300 --> 22:47.013
AI is bringing to us.

490
22:47.880 --> 22:49.590
<v Joe>Kevin, how about you?</v>

491
22:49.590 --> 22:51.093
<v ->Yeah, so of course working with young people</v>

492
22:51.093 --> 22:53.640
with disabilities to help in the workforce,

493
22:53.640 --> 22:55.200
we're actually excited about the future

494
22:55.200 --> 22:57.480
and the opportunities that present themselves

495
22:57.480 --> 22:59.670
with the adoption of AI.

496
22:59.670 --> 23:03.660
So again, our company makes factory automation equipment.

497
23:03.660 --> 23:06.450
We're trying to automate the manufacturing process

498
23:06.450 --> 23:10.890
and eventually robots are fixing themselves, right?

499
23:10.890 --> 23:14.070
Predictive maintenance and doing work

500
23:14.070 --> 23:16.350
that a human used to have to do.

501
23:16.350 --> 23:20.340
So as we think about that, there are a whole new set of jobs

502
23:20.340 --> 23:23.220
that come in with the manufacturing industry,

503
23:23.220 --> 23:24.390
and this applies to all industries,

504
23:24.390 --> 23:26.670
but if you think about manufacturing jobs,

505
23:26.670 --> 23:29.760
so people can sit in their living rooms

506
23:29.760 --> 23:32.400
and run an assembly line, like that is where we're going

507
23:32.400 --> 23:35.700
to with some of the technology that's coming in,

508
23:35.700 --> 23:38.340
which opens up a whole new world for people

509
23:38.340 --> 23:41.640
that formally couldn't, that one of the biggest barriers

510
23:41.640 --> 23:43.230
of employment for people with disabilities

511
23:43.230 --> 23:47.310
is getting to a job site if there's no public transportation

512
23:47.310 --> 23:48.570
and those types of things.

513
23:48.570 --> 23:52.740
So you have a whole new world of job opportunities available

514
23:52.740 --> 23:55.920
using new technology that we're all learning about, right?

515
23:55.920 --> 23:59.070
And so preparing that workforce for the future,

516
23:59.070 --> 24:00.840
whether you have disabilities or not,

517
24:00.840 --> 24:03.300
helping those young people really gain those skills

518
24:03.300 --> 24:05.640
and what are those new jobs?

519
24:05.640 --> 24:10.200
And, but again, you have to make it accessible

520
24:10.200 --> 24:13.740
from the beginning to really provide those opportunities.

521
24:13.740 --> 24:16.110
If you're managing an assembly line

522
24:16.110 --> 24:20.820
and the computer monitor is up on the second floor

523
24:20.820 --> 24:22.260
with no elevator, right?

524
24:22.260 --> 24:23.370
You've just eliminated a whole group

525
24:23.370 --> 24:25.080
of people who can get those jobs.

526
24:25.080 --> 24:27.120
So with people in wheelchairs.

527
24:27.120 --> 24:29.640
So you need to really think about

528
24:29.640 --> 24:31.470
that accessibility from the beginning

529
24:31.470 --> 24:33.240
and preparing the younger generation,

530
24:33.240 --> 24:36.000
the next generation for that next generation of jobs,

531
24:36.000 --> 24:39.720
making sure they have access to that digital literacy

532
24:39.720 --> 24:42.690
in the schools, in the community colleges,

533
24:42.690 --> 24:44.740
and our foundation's really partnering

534
24:45.887 --> 24:48.720
with community colleges in things like the trades

535
24:48.720 --> 24:50.910
and in things like manufacturing jobs,

536
24:50.910 --> 24:55.170
things like healthcare that you wouldn't typically

537
24:55.170 --> 24:57.840
think about the opportunities for people with disabilities

538
24:57.840 --> 24:59.520
to work in those fields.

539
24:59.520 --> 25:04.520
But with the growth in technology and thinking about, again,

540
25:05.910 --> 25:07.480
things like AI and

541
25:08.520 --> 25:10.620
there's just so many opportunities out there.

542
25:10.620 --> 25:12.120
So we're excited about the future,

543
25:12.120 --> 25:13.890
but we need to make sure everybody's prepared

544
25:13.890 --> 25:17.310
and that the systems are accessible from the beginning.

545
25:17.310 --> 25:19.260
<v ->I mean, it sounds like that's one of the big, big things</v>

546
25:19.260 --> 25:20.093
that we need to think about.

547
25:20.093 --> 25:21.990
I mean, part of what we were talking about ahead of time

548
25:21.990 --> 25:24.440
was just even an awareness of the problem, right?

549
25:25.854 --> 25:26.820
We think the people might be like us,

550
25:26.820 --> 25:28.350
everyone's got access to the system,

551
25:28.350 --> 25:30.240
they understand how to use it and so forth.

552
25:30.240 --> 25:31.437
But the reality is that there are many people

553
25:31.437 --> 25:33.540
who are disenfranchised, they don't have access

554
25:33.540 --> 25:36.207
to the technology, they may not understand how to use it

555
25:36.207 --> 25:37.950
and so forth.

556
25:37.950 --> 25:39.690
So what would the advice be then?

557
25:39.690 --> 25:41.010
I mean, for people who are here

558
25:41.010 --> 25:42.780
and people who might be developing technology

559
25:42.780 --> 25:44.460
or thinking about deployment of it,

560
25:44.460 --> 25:45.630
what would you recommend?

561
25:45.630 --> 25:49.350
I mean, how do we solution for, so to speak,

562
25:49.350 --> 25:51.783
some of these problems that we're seeing?

563
25:53.490 --> 25:57.690
<v ->I'll say my recommendation is to include the users</v>

564
25:57.690 --> 26:00.660
in the development of the products you're developing.

565
26:00.660 --> 26:02.280
We actually did this with this innovation challenge

566
26:02.280 --> 26:03.390
I mentioned.

567
26:03.390 --> 26:05.250
Inviting people with intellectual,

568
26:05.250 --> 26:07.140
developmental disabilities in

569
26:07.140 --> 26:10.740
to provide focus group feedback to startup companies,

570
26:10.740 --> 26:13.350
developing tech for that population,

571
26:13.350 --> 26:16.890
but really making sure that people from all backgrounds

572
26:16.890 --> 26:21.600
are in that test data and really identifying challenges

573
26:21.600 --> 26:25.440
from the beginning so that we can truly have developed,

574
26:25.440 --> 26:29.343
digitally included products from the beginning.

575
26:30.450 --> 26:33.810
So that's one thing is in the disability community,

576
26:33.810 --> 26:36.210
there's a phrase, "Nothing about us without us."

577
26:36.210 --> 26:39.990
So making sure that we're including them in the process

578
26:39.990 --> 26:42.180
of developing that user experience.

579
26:42.180 --> 26:44.700
And then something I mentioned earlier was the idea

580
26:44.700 --> 26:48.390
of that interoperability and connecting, you know,

581
26:48.390 --> 26:50.490
not just making one-off apps,

582
26:50.490 --> 26:53.040
but how does the app operate with another app?

583
26:53.040 --> 26:56.010
How does an app operate with Zoom technology

584
26:56.010 --> 26:57.000
or whatever it is.

585
26:57.000 --> 27:01.380
So that really making sure that we can seamlessly,

586
27:01.380 --> 27:04.650
people can seamlessly interact with the technology

587
27:04.650 --> 27:05.670
we're developing.

588
27:05.670 --> 27:07.520
And that's the human connection part.

589
27:09.270 --> 27:10.197
<v ->And in healthcare,</v>

590
27:10.197 --> 27:12.630
the technology has to be accessible for all.

591
27:12.630 --> 27:16.650
And, you know, healthcare organization

592
27:16.650 --> 27:20.520
have been on the tech side very antiquated for a long time.

593
27:20.520 --> 27:24.900
And introducing new technology is a challenge

594
27:24.900 --> 27:28.650
because you have to disrupt existing workflow

595
27:28.650 --> 27:29.880
and complex workflow.

596
27:29.880 --> 27:32.790
So you have to clearly understand

597
27:32.790 --> 27:35.790
how people conduct their work,

598
27:35.790 --> 27:38.280
where they are, and integrate that technology

599
27:38.280 --> 27:40.050
which makes sense for them.

600
27:40.050 --> 27:42.360
So back to the Olympic story.

601
27:42.360 --> 27:46.590
So on one hand, you had the patient side, visitors,

602
27:46.590 --> 27:47.880
athletes, para-athletes.

603
27:47.880 --> 27:50.220
We had to quickly communicate what they need.

604
27:50.220 --> 27:52.860
On the other hand, you had physician and nurses

605
27:52.860 --> 27:54.030
in the trenches, well,

606
27:54.030 --> 27:56.340
in the first situation in competition side,

607
27:56.340 --> 27:58.140
over 200 of them.

608
27:58.140 --> 28:00.363
And then in hospital emergency room.

609
28:02.460 --> 28:05.730
We couldn't ask them to download an app,

610
28:05.730 --> 28:10.140
to put new software in in their system.

611
28:10.140 --> 28:12.120
We had to find a way to bring that technology

612
28:12.120 --> 28:13.500
right there at the point of care,

613
28:13.500 --> 28:17.910
which will not interrupt the way they were working

614
28:17.910 --> 28:21.510
and it could be immediately usable.

615
28:21.510 --> 28:24.840
So we use QR code technology for that.

616
28:24.840 --> 28:28.380
One scan of the QR code on the patient side.

617
28:28.380 --> 28:31.410
One button to say speak French for me.

618
28:31.410 --> 28:36.410
And using AI again for that voice feature.

619
28:36.720 --> 28:39.540
All of a sudden you spoke French in this instance,

620
28:39.540 --> 28:41.830
or you could speak Arabic elsewhere

621
28:42.870 --> 28:47.160
and you didn't interrupt and disrupt that nurse workflow.

622
28:47.160 --> 28:50.820
You help her understand what you are attempting to use.

623
28:50.820 --> 28:53.670
And then we structure the information

624
28:53.670 --> 28:56.880
so it's in indeed digestible for that clinician

625
28:56.880 --> 28:59.940
who has to quickly make sense of it.

626
28:59.940 --> 29:03.360
So if you present that information in a way

627
29:03.360 --> 29:08.100
which is understandable and immediately ingestible

628
29:08.100 --> 29:09.300
on their side.

629
29:09.300 --> 29:12.240
So it takes also that effort of usability

630
29:12.240 --> 29:13.470
in the receiving side.

631
29:13.470 --> 29:16.323
So we had to work on that as well.

632
29:18.120 --> 29:19.710
<v ->And I would just add, you know,</v>

633
29:19.710 --> 29:22.560
from our perspective, we tend to be

634
29:22.560 --> 29:24.900
more on the sort of advocacy side,

635
29:24.900 --> 29:28.380
promoting these issues of like internet for all.

636
29:28.380 --> 29:31.920
And I would encourage folks here on the industry

637
29:31.920 --> 29:35.460
and the technology side to make that your cause as well.

638
29:35.460 --> 29:38.220
Right, to recognize that in some ways, right,

639
29:38.220 --> 29:40.980
if we want a smart city, an interconnected city,

640
29:40.980 --> 29:43.140
an interconnected world, it will require

641
29:43.140 --> 29:44.760
that everybody be on,

642
29:44.760 --> 29:48.120
that's how all of our products proliferate, et cetera.

643
29:48.120 --> 29:50.910
And so in some ways the ensuring that

644
29:50.910 --> 29:53.850
everybody gets on also pushes your need

645
29:53.850 --> 29:56.850
and is also kind of advancing your vision of the world.

646
29:56.850 --> 30:00.630
And so becoming a champion of that cause is really important

647
30:00.630 --> 30:03.792
so that it doesn't just become something that advocates

648
30:03.792 --> 30:05.880
are solely pushing for.

649
30:05.880 --> 30:08.730
I think a little twist on what Kevin was saying

650
30:08.730 --> 30:10.380
about user testing groups, you know,

651
30:10.380 --> 30:12.870
the technology is a place where there's a lot

652
30:12.870 --> 30:14.670
of user testing that goes on in the early

653
30:14.670 --> 30:15.960
stages of development.

654
30:15.960 --> 30:19.320
And I think yes, including the end users is important.

655
30:19.320 --> 30:20.700
But I'll give you an example.

656
30:20.700 --> 30:23.610
When I was Chief Data Officer of the city of LA

657
30:23.610 --> 30:26.610
which is now feels like a lifetime ago,

658
30:26.610 --> 30:27.933
companies like Uber and Lyft

659
30:27.933 --> 30:29.820
were the ones who were coming out

660
30:29.820 --> 30:33.810
and testing their products in Venice Beach and Silicon Beach

661
30:33.810 --> 30:35.400
and Santa Monica.

662
30:35.400 --> 30:37.800
And they tested for users

663
30:37.800 --> 30:40.290
that they presume would be their clients.

664
30:40.290 --> 30:42.510
But one of the interesting things is we started

665
30:42.510 --> 30:44.490
to see all kinds of demographics,

666
30:44.490 --> 30:47.160
groups that were in like mobility deserts,

667
30:47.160 --> 30:49.770
that didn't have access to transportation easily

668
30:49.770 --> 30:52.320
using their products because they fit that need.

669
30:52.320 --> 30:54.480
So when you are doing your user testing,

670
30:54.480 --> 30:57.750
I would challenge you to question who are those unexpected

671
30:57.750 --> 31:00.990
or unlikely users and include them as well.

672
31:00.990 --> 31:03.780
And then, you know, lastly, I do think it's important

673
31:03.780 --> 31:06.870
to think about what are the digital skills

674
31:06.870 --> 31:09.000
and competencies that are truly needed

675
31:09.000 --> 31:11.040
to be able to use your product.

676
31:11.040 --> 31:13.890
Like think about that expansively and broadly,

677
31:13.890 --> 31:16.230
so that again, you're questioning your design assumptions

678
31:16.230 --> 31:17.730
and then trying to really ensure

679
31:17.730 --> 31:21.150
that your solution can really serve a very, very

680
31:21.150 --> 31:23.739
broad cross section of the population.

681
31:23.739 --> 31:25.097
<v ->Lilian, I think you're making</v>

682
31:25.097 --> 31:25.930
a critically important point,

683
31:25.930 --> 31:30.510
and that is to respond to those real needs.

684
31:30.510 --> 31:34.180
I think part of your development team needs to

685
31:36.330 --> 31:39.690
include people who have worked in that area

686
31:39.690 --> 31:41.580
where you want to address those issues.

687
31:41.580 --> 31:45.720
So we have as many clinician as technologists in our company

688
31:45.720 --> 31:48.510
who have worked for, you know, in the trenches,

689
31:48.510 --> 31:51.570
who know what's our emergency room operates.

690
31:51.570 --> 31:53.943
Who have been nurses or physicians.

691
31:54.900 --> 31:57.060
So I have some of that experience,

692
31:57.060 --> 32:00.660
and then the public health view of things.

693
32:00.660 --> 32:02.280
This is key.

694
32:02.280 --> 32:04.320
You know, providing technology per se

695
32:04.320 --> 32:05.880
for techies is not the point.

696
32:05.880 --> 32:08.220
If you want to make a difference in the lives

697
32:08.220 --> 32:10.803
of individual and globally even more.

698
32:12.210 --> 32:13.260
We have to respond.

699
32:13.260 --> 32:15.810
We have to to be impactful again.

700
32:15.810 --> 32:19.020
With meaningful technology, which everyone can use.

701
32:19.020 --> 32:22.113
And in healthcare, you know, post pandemic,

702
32:24.593 --> 32:27.450
we, in fact, lots of healthcare worker have left the field.

703
32:27.450 --> 32:32.220
So you have staffing issues and technology is here again

704
32:32.220 --> 32:35.760
to address this difficulty to access healthcare.

705
32:35.760 --> 32:38.550
How many of us have difficulties making a

706
32:38.550 --> 32:41.760
doctor's appointment for herself or a loved one?

707
32:41.760 --> 32:44.610
I have an older mom, I cannot wait three weeks for her

708
32:44.610 --> 32:47.610
to see, you know, a physician.

709
32:47.610 --> 32:49.530
So that's how telehealth happened

710
32:49.530 --> 32:52.470
and that's where you can have some answer at your fingertip

711
32:52.470 --> 32:54.060
on your mobile phone.

712
32:54.060 --> 32:58.050
AI lets you personalize the messaging, for instance,

713
32:58.050 --> 32:59.760
manage this diabetic,

714
32:59.760 --> 33:03.450
or you have environmental issues in California today

715
33:03.450 --> 33:07.410
with very dry and windy air, which may exacerbate

716
33:07.410 --> 33:10.620
or create, you know, asthma attack in asthmatic.

717
33:10.620 --> 33:12.930
Knowing at the population health level

718
33:12.930 --> 33:15.750
that you have those individual with asthma,

719
33:15.750 --> 33:20.040
with those risk of developing an acute episode,

720
33:20.040 --> 33:23.190
you can message them precisely

721
33:23.190 --> 33:24.840
because you know they're at risk

722
33:24.840 --> 33:27.030
in those environmental condition.

723
33:27.030 --> 33:30.840
So with this difficulty to access healthcare

724
33:30.840 --> 33:33.347
at the individual level, but with those tools to manage

725
33:33.347 --> 33:36.660
at the population scale, the healthcare needs of many,

726
33:36.660 --> 33:39.930
but in very personalized, individual ways,

727
33:39.930 --> 33:43.350
this is what technology and especially AI powered

728
33:43.350 --> 33:44.940
technology can do today.

729
33:44.940 --> 33:47.220
<v ->You know, that's a good point. If I could add one more.</v>

730
33:47.220 --> 33:48.173
<v Joe>Yeah, please.</v>

731
33:50.175 --> 33:51.390
<v ->I also worked in philanthropy</v>

732
33:51.390 --> 33:54.510
and worked in supporting efforts

733
33:54.510 --> 33:57.360
to deploy emerging technology across various cities.

734
33:57.360 --> 34:00.030
And one of those efforts was really around the deployment

735
34:00.030 --> 34:02.070
of autonomous vehicles.

736
34:02.070 --> 34:04.560
And one of the things that I would encourage you all to do

737
34:04.560 --> 34:06.510
as well is to deploy, deploy, deploy

738
34:06.510 --> 34:08.670
and really test in very different environments.

739
34:08.670 --> 34:10.740
So we looked at how that testing

740
34:10.740 --> 34:12.090
happened in different cities,

741
34:12.090 --> 34:14.040
in different parts of those cities.

742
34:14.040 --> 34:15.960
And then again, all of the insights that

743
34:15.960 --> 34:17.580
what you were saying, you know, all of the insights

744
34:17.580 --> 34:21.420
that you gather from that diverse deployment strategy,

745
34:21.420 --> 34:22.440
I think is really important.

746
34:22.440 --> 34:25.140
Oftentimes what we found in that context was

747
34:25.140 --> 34:29.310
we were really deploying these AVs in environments

748
34:29.310 --> 34:31.290
that were suitable for the technology, right?

749
34:31.290 --> 34:34.710
So flat roads, really sunny environments, Las Vegas,

750
34:34.710 --> 34:38.550
Phoenix, but what where you really have difficulty

751
34:38.550 --> 34:41.370
and where you're actually gonna learn a lot as a company

752
34:41.370 --> 34:44.940
and I think grow is when you go to like the Pittsburghs

753
34:44.940 --> 34:47.580
of the world, which is actually a hub for, but right?

754
34:47.580 --> 34:50.520
And you're training your technology on the hilly roads

755
34:50.520 --> 34:52.380
or you're going to environments where

756
34:52.380 --> 34:54.210
the language is gonna be an issue for how

757
34:54.210 --> 34:55.740
to get into the car

758
34:55.740 --> 34:57.420
or not everyone is gonna have a credit card

759
34:57.420 --> 34:58.530
to be able to access it.

760
34:58.530 --> 35:02.040
So another, I think big lesson on this digital inclusion

761
35:02.040 --> 35:03.720
is to test a lot

762
35:03.720 --> 35:06.660
and to test in environments where you're not,

763
35:06.660 --> 35:08.250
you're really gonna learn a lot as a company.

764
35:08.250 --> 35:10.740
I think it just makes you a lot stronger as well.

765
35:10.740 --> 35:11.910
<v ->I can't help but think</v>

766
35:11.910 --> 35:13.810
when I'm listening to you and Bettina,

767
35:14.670 --> 35:15.930
we're talking about skills.

768
35:15.930 --> 35:17.640
I mean, empathy really is something

769
35:17.640 --> 35:19.110
that you're putting into your design

770
35:19.110 --> 35:20.460
and your testing process, which is to

771
35:20.460 --> 35:22.890
really deeply understand the customer

772
35:22.890 --> 35:24.297
and what those customer's needs are.

773
35:24.297 --> 35:26.610
And the fact that we're even having this conversation

774
35:26.610 --> 35:30.570
is an awareness of a real problem that so many people have.

775
35:30.570 --> 35:32.640
Kevin, when you were talking about the number of people,

776
35:32.640 --> 35:36.570
25% of Americans who have some level of disability,

777
35:36.570 --> 35:37.403
that's incredible.

778
35:37.403 --> 35:41.460
So to be aware of that right, is just really some,

779
35:41.460 --> 35:43.860
I mean, it's a starting point for all of us to think about

780
35:43.860 --> 35:46.080
trying to see things from people's perspective

781
35:46.080 --> 35:48.126
and to innovate around that.

782
35:48.126 --> 35:48.960
<v ->Yes.</v>

783
35:48.960 --> 35:50.790
Oh, in healthcare, you know, for a long time

784
35:50.790 --> 35:53.220
and still are, we are, you know,

785
35:53.220 --> 35:55.200
medical knowledge has been privileged

786
35:55.200 --> 35:59.640
to those clinic medically trained people, physician.

787
35:59.640 --> 36:01.500
You know, when I came to public health,

788
36:01.500 --> 36:05.430
I understood that the more informed and educated

789
36:05.430 --> 36:08.490
the individual you you want to serve are

790
36:08.490 --> 36:09.540
the better off you are.

791
36:09.540 --> 36:11.730
So why not breaking that medical knowledge

792
36:11.730 --> 36:13.830
to everyone, right?

793
36:13.830 --> 36:16.170
That's what technology provide.

794
36:16.170 --> 36:21.030
And again, AI can do that in a more comprehensive,

795
36:21.030 --> 36:24.843
personalized way at a population scale and very fast.

796
36:25.890 --> 36:29.160
So that knowledge is no longer privilege.

797
36:29.160 --> 36:32.520
And at a time when you cannot access a doctor

798
36:32.520 --> 36:36.660
or you have to wait to get to this clinic,

799
36:36.660 --> 36:41.310
then you may get this precise, personalized information

800
36:41.310 --> 36:45.693
right to you and in a way you can understand and act on it.

801
36:46.680 --> 36:49.320
<v ->So we have just a couple left.</v>

802
36:49.320 --> 36:51.780
If there's one thing that you would leave the audience

803
36:51.780 --> 36:54.870
with, one idea that you'd say is the most important thing

804
36:54.870 --> 36:56.490
you'd wanna share, what would that be?

805
36:56.490 --> 36:58.290
Kevin, we'll start with you.

806
36:58.290 --> 37:00.450
<v ->So the one thing, and I mentioned it before,</v>

807
37:00.450 --> 37:03.600
is that "nothing about us without us" concept

808
37:03.600 --> 37:07.950
and really developing, as you're developing new technology,

809
37:07.950 --> 37:11.640
really making sure that it's designed from the beginning

810
37:11.640 --> 37:14.640
with different audiences that technology is designed

811
37:14.640 --> 37:16.710
to serve and those that you don't really think about,

812
37:16.710 --> 37:18.030
back to the point earlier.

813
37:18.030 --> 37:20.460
So making sure that you're including people

814
37:20.460 --> 37:23.913
in the user experience so that it is designed inclusively.

815
37:25.182 --> 37:26.520
Think about (indistinct).
<v ->Thank you.</v>

816
37:26.520 --> 37:30.450
<v ->Here we are at CES, the world, you know,</v>

817
37:30.450 --> 37:32.460
is assembled here to see the latest

818
37:32.460 --> 37:33.810
of the latest in technology.

819
37:33.810 --> 37:35.790
So this is an exciting time

820
37:35.790 --> 37:38.370
and we should not restrict ourselves at looking

821
37:38.370 --> 37:41.190
at the technology pertaining to our industry or interests.

822
37:41.190 --> 37:45.150
Let's be open-minded in terms of what we see out there.

823
37:45.150 --> 37:47.370
And so stop by or boost at your metrics.

824
37:47.370 --> 37:51.000
And so if I try to communicate what we are doing,

825
37:51.000 --> 37:53.190
you can leave it and see it in person.

826
37:53.190 --> 37:57.840
<v ->Connection or how much does it actually reduce it?</v>

827
37:57.840 --> 38:02.130
And I think really think about ways of integrating

828
38:02.130 --> 38:04.380
more opportunities or practices to ensure that

829
38:04.380 --> 38:06.360
that connection is actually stronger than ever.

830
38:06.360 --> 38:08.160
I think when you have that in mind,

831
38:08.160 --> 38:11.100
I think we'll definitely be in a much more inclusive place.

832
38:11.100 --> 38:13.140
<v ->The challenge and the opportunity for all of us,</v>

833
38:13.140 --> 38:16.320
I think is going back to the, I think empathy, you know,

834
38:16.320 --> 38:21.060
to really be aware of people who may need access

835
38:21.060 --> 38:22.680
to these kinds of things and don't have it.

836
38:22.680 --> 38:24.810
And in what ways can we help?

837
38:24.810 --> 38:27.260
What ways can we help them have the skills that they need

838
38:27.260 --> 38:29.430
so that they can participate so that there's not

839
38:29.430 --> 38:32.460
five years from now really a greater divide.

840
38:32.460 --> 38:33.870
That is our time today.

841
38:33.870 --> 38:36.090
I wanna thank this awesome panel that we've had

842
38:36.090 --> 38:37.680
and thank you all for being here today

843
38:37.680 --> 38:40.440
and hope everyone enjoys the rest of CES.

844
38:40.440 --> 38:42.275
Thanks for being here.

845
38:42.275 --> 38:44.858
