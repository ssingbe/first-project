00:00.017 --> 00:02.600
(bright music)

00:10.380 --> 00:11.640
My name is Brian Tegtmeyer.

00:11.640 --> 00:13.950
I'm with NHTSA

00:13.950 --> 00:16.110
and the office of EMS

00:16.110 --> 00:17.970
and the National 911 program.

00:17.970 --> 00:20.850
Welcome to our session today on "Connected Vehicle Safety:

00:20.850 --> 00:23.190
Reducing Roadway Risk and Saving Lives."

00:23.190 --> 00:24.930
I've got a great panel here

00:24.930 --> 00:26.130
and we're gonna spend our time

00:26.130 --> 00:31.130
going through a variety of topics and questions

00:31.290 --> 00:34.110
that we have to talk about connected vehicles

00:34.110 --> 00:37.860
and how they reach 911 and how that can impact lives.

00:37.860 --> 00:38.850
Before I start though,

00:38.850 --> 00:40.710
I wanna spend just a couple minutes

00:40.710 --> 00:42.630
framing this issue for you.

00:42.630 --> 00:43.530
And first of all,

00:43.530 --> 00:46.710
introduce what we do at NHTSA's National 911 program.

00:46.710 --> 00:48.570
We work to enhance highway safety.

00:48.570 --> 00:51.120
We do that by creating and sharing resources,

00:51.120 --> 00:52.800
collaborating with our stakeholders,

00:52.800 --> 00:56.433
and connecting the system's 911 centers nationwide.

00:57.540 --> 00:59.190
When we look at this issue,

00:59.190 --> 01:00.720
we look at it from the point of view

01:00.720 --> 01:02.790
of the National Roadway Safety Strategy

01:02.790 --> 01:04.680
and our Safe System Approach.

01:04.680 --> 01:06.740
911 is involved in all five elements

01:06.740 --> 01:08.610
of the Safe System Approach.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.920
We are involved with safer people.

01:10.920 --> 01:13.470
When risky behavior happens, they call 911.

01:13.470 --> 01:16.140
When someone's driving under the influence,

01:16.140 --> 01:17.910
reckless, distracted driving,

01:17.910 --> 01:19.980
that results in calls to 911.

01:19.980 --> 01:22.590
Safer roads, if the roads are unsafe,

01:22.590 --> 01:25.110
if there's debris, lights are out,

01:25.110 --> 01:26.340
or other hazards,

01:26.340 --> 01:29.133
it results in calls to 911.

01:30.060 --> 01:31.890
When we have safer speeds,

01:31.890 --> 01:33.930
vehicles driving unsafe at speeds,

01:33.930 --> 01:35.010
our 911 centers

01:35.010 --> 01:37.470
are our nation's law enforcement dispatch center

01:37.470 --> 01:39.660
and they're involved in the enforcement

01:39.660 --> 01:41.100
of speed and traffic laws

01:41.100 --> 01:44.550
and relaying that information to their law enforcement.

01:44.550 --> 01:47.010
And then we're gonna talk about this a lot,

01:47.010 --> 01:48.060
the safer vehicles,

01:48.060 --> 01:52.230
how does advanced automatic crash notification

01:52.230 --> 01:55.650
play into connecting the vehicle to the 911 centers

01:55.650 --> 01:58.680
and transmit critical data through the telemetry?

01:58.680 --> 02:02.010
And then finally, all of this is for when a crash occurs,

02:02.010 --> 02:03.420
we have post crash care.

02:03.420 --> 02:06.230
And that begins with the call to 911

02:06.230 --> 02:09.000
and our nation's 911 telecommunicators

02:09.000 --> 02:12.300
that work to identify the caller location,

02:12.300 --> 02:13.560
the nature of the crash,

02:13.560 --> 02:15.300
and the severity of the incident

02:15.300 --> 02:17.850
to make sure we can send the most appropriate help.

02:18.810 --> 02:20.220
So when I talk about this,

02:20.220 --> 02:22.920
one of the things I like to demonstrate and talk about

02:22.920 --> 02:27.000
is having a continuity and a consistent level of care.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.130
So we look at the Interstate I-95,

02:29.130 --> 02:31.530
our nation's longest North-South interstate

02:31.530 --> 02:33.750
from Maine to Florida,

02:33.750 --> 02:37.500
and it goes through 15 states in the District of Columbia

02:37.500 --> 02:41.040
and there's almost 200 911 jurisdictions there.

02:41.040 --> 02:42.270
So as you can imagine,

02:42.270 --> 02:44.490
if a crash occurs along this roadway,

02:44.490 --> 02:47.190
the level of training, the technology,

02:47.190 --> 02:49.470
the staffing of those 911 centers

02:49.470 --> 02:52.350
and how this information from a connected vehicle

02:52.350 --> 02:53.940
gets into the 911 centers

02:53.940 --> 02:56.030
and their current state of next generation 911

02:56.030 --> 02:57.690
is gonna dramatically vary.

02:57.690 --> 02:59.100
And that's what we need to do,

02:59.100 --> 03:02.700
is that we are advocating to push the bar higher

03:02.700 --> 03:05.733
and make sure that if a crash occurs along this roadway,

03:05.733 --> 03:08.483
that the minimum level of data that we need

03:08.483 --> 03:11.733
is received to all of our nation's 911 centers.

03:13.050 --> 03:14.550
To frame that further,

03:14.550 --> 03:16.200
when emergency responds to crashes,

03:16.200 --> 03:17.370
we are estimated at NHTSA

03:17.370 --> 03:20.610
that there are 13 million motor vehicle crashes a year.

03:20.610 --> 03:22.230
6 million of them result

03:22.230 --> 03:24.900
in law enforcement being dispatched,

03:24.900 --> 03:27.210
and 1.5 million of those crashes

03:27.210 --> 03:29.880
result in EMS being dispatched.

03:29.880 --> 03:33.780
And we know in those 1.5 million crashes of EMS

03:33.780 --> 03:37.080
that there's almost 170,000 people

03:37.080 --> 03:38.880
critically or seriously injured.

03:38.880 --> 03:41.130
Over 55,000 of those crash victims

03:41.130 --> 03:43.200
need to be extricated from the vehicle.

03:43.200 --> 03:47.190
And over 8,700 are partially or completely ejected

03:47.190 --> 03:48.240
from the vehicle.

03:48.240 --> 03:51.150
So this is a serious situation we're dealing with

03:51.150 --> 03:53.430
and there is a lot of severity.

03:53.430 --> 03:54.870
All of that results

03:54.870 --> 03:57.960
in over 42,000 traffic fatalities a year.

03:57.960 --> 04:00.480
We have seen this number dropping in the last couple years

04:00.480 --> 04:01.830
and we're happy for that.

04:01.830 --> 04:05.520
But one of the most important facts that we can share

04:05.520 --> 04:09.720
is that of the 42,000 fatalities on our roadway,

04:09.720 --> 04:13.920
42% were alive when EMS arrived on scene.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.560
We can drive that number down

04:16.560 --> 04:18.240
if we can get the right help there

04:18.240 --> 04:20.400
in the right way with the right information

04:20.400 --> 04:23.043
to improve the outcome of those patients.

04:24.210 --> 04:27.000
The 911 system is not a national 911 system.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.360
There are over 5,400 911 centers across our nation

04:30.360 --> 04:31.650
and they work independently

04:31.650 --> 04:33.813
at a local and at a state level.

04:35.370 --> 04:39.600
30% of our 911 centers are two seat centers or less.

04:39.600 --> 04:42.300
70% are five seat centers or less.

04:42.300 --> 04:43.380
And why is that important?

04:43.380 --> 04:46.560
'Cause you probably have an image based on TV or the news

04:46.560 --> 04:49.710
showing large 911 centers with all of this technology

04:49.710 --> 04:50.790
and all these people working,

04:50.790 --> 04:52.200
but that's not the reality.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.230
70% of our centers are five seat centers or less,

04:55.230 --> 04:58.620
and they have different abilities, capabilities,

04:58.620 --> 05:01.290
and technology that can get the call

05:01.290 --> 05:04.023
into their 911 centers to process that information.

05:05.190 --> 05:08.670
So we're gonna talk about this today with our panel.

05:08.670 --> 05:10.920
We're gonna talk about it from a 911 point of view,

05:10.920 --> 05:13.290
from a telematics service provider's point of view,

05:13.290 --> 05:14.970
and from connected vehicles.

05:14.970 --> 05:16.320
And that is our goal.

05:16.320 --> 05:19.260
So we've got some question prepared

05:19.260 --> 05:22.023
and I'm gonna sit down and start that process now.

05:24.180 --> 05:28.530
So first question, one second,

05:28.530 --> 05:31.080
it's gonna go to the 911 community,

05:31.080 --> 05:33.150
and I'm gonna ask Ty and Jennifer,

05:33.150 --> 05:35.580
and they're each gonna introduce themselves when they start,

05:35.580 --> 05:37.050
but what do you think

05:37.050 --> 05:39.780
is the single most important piece of information

05:39.780 --> 05:43.110
that 911 centers currently do not have access to

05:43.110 --> 05:46.080
that could positively impact post crash care?

05:46.080 --> 05:47.430
Jennifer?

05:47.430 --> 05:48.600
<v ->Hi Brian, thanks so much.</v>

05:48.600 --> 05:49.830
My name is Jennifer Kirkland.

05:49.830 --> 05:52.860
I'm the State 911 program manager for Colorado.

05:52.860 --> 05:56.370
I have 23 years of experience in 911 centers,

05:56.370 --> 05:59.190
both as a 911 telecommunicator,

05:59.190 --> 06:01.830
all the way up to leading the 911 centers.

06:01.830 --> 06:05.610
And I'm also heavily involved in 911 across the nation

06:05.610 --> 06:06.693
in various ways.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.110
To answer your question directly,

06:10.110 --> 06:12.870
I think there's no one single piece of information

06:12.870 --> 06:13.980
that would be most helpful.

06:13.980 --> 06:15.360
The first one that comes to mind

06:15.360 --> 06:18.750
is maybe number of patients involved in a vehicle.

06:18.750 --> 06:20.305
But what I'd like to highlight is the fact,

06:20.305 --> 06:22.740
something you touched upon in your introduction,

06:22.740 --> 06:27.000
which is that there are 5,400 911 centers across the country

06:27.000 --> 06:29.130
and there is a wide disparity

06:29.130 --> 06:33.150
of both technology availability in those 911 centers

06:33.150 --> 06:35.520
and training availability.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.340
Because 911 is administered at the local level

06:38.340 --> 06:40.050
and sometimes the state level,

06:40.050 --> 06:42.780
there's a wide, wide discrepancy

06:42.780 --> 06:44.580
in the availability of technology.

06:44.580 --> 06:47.970
Some of those 911 centers have state-of-the-art technology

06:47.970 --> 06:49.800
and can take all of the information

06:49.800 --> 06:51.420
that is available to you.

06:51.420 --> 06:55.710
And some of them still work with paper and pen

06:55.710 --> 06:59.520
to get that information out to the field responders.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.460
So the first question is,

07:02.460 --> 07:04.800
is there availability to get that technology

07:04.800 --> 07:07.950
and that information and data coming into the 911 center?

07:07.950 --> 07:11.430
The second thing I'll touch upon is the human aspect of 911.

07:11.430 --> 07:13.860
So in the United States,

07:13.860 --> 07:17.100
there is no national minimum training standard

07:17.100 --> 07:19.680
for 911 telecommunicators.

07:19.680 --> 07:21.390
That is left up to the states

07:21.390 --> 07:23.670
and some states have a minimum training standard

07:23.670 --> 07:24.686
for 911 telecommunicators,

07:24.686 --> 07:26.250
and some do not.

07:26.250 --> 07:28.680
Unfortunately, Colorado is one that does not,

07:28.680 --> 07:31.890
which means that if you call 911 from this room

07:31.890 --> 07:34.710
and reach the 911 center,

07:34.710 --> 07:36.510
there's gonna be a different level of training

07:36.510 --> 07:39.624
than there might be if you go to Colorado and call 911

07:39.624 --> 07:41.820
and say a rural area,

07:41.820 --> 07:44.787
the level of care that you're receiving from the very get go

07:44.787 --> 07:46.650
of your emergency

07:46.650 --> 07:48.510
is going to be vastly different.

07:48.510 --> 07:53.220
So I think as we move forward into technology and data

07:53.220 --> 07:55.920
and what we can get from those connected vehicles,

07:55.920 --> 07:58.680
it's important that we remember that those 911 calls

07:58.680 --> 08:02.310
begin and end with a human being in that 911 center.

08:02.310 --> 08:03.900
And we have to make sure

08:03.900 --> 08:07.320
that they have the training and knowledge

08:07.320 --> 08:09.450
necessary in order to process that call

08:09.450 --> 08:12.570
and to get that data from the connected vehicles

08:12.570 --> 08:14.850
and all of the ways that we can get that data

08:14.850 --> 08:16.770
and get it out to the field responders

08:16.770 --> 08:19.290
and working coordination to drive that,

08:19.290 --> 08:21.330
that fatality number down.

08:21.330 --> 08:22.533
I'll turn it over to Ty.

08:23.940 --> 08:25.200
<v ->Hi, my name's Ty Wooten.</v>

08:25.200 --> 08:26.640
I'm the Director of Government Affairs

08:26.640 --> 08:29.130
for the International Academies of Emergency Dispatch.

08:29.130 --> 08:32.760
We create standardized protocols

08:32.760 --> 08:35.670
that are used in 911 centers

08:35.670 --> 08:38.850
and emergency dispatch centers around the world.

08:38.850 --> 08:43.850
We're in almost 2,600 911 centers in the US

08:44.010 --> 08:47.970
and our protocols are translated

08:47.970 --> 08:49.380
into 29 different languages

08:49.380 --> 08:52.560
and are used in 59 different countries worldwide.

08:52.560 --> 08:54.856
I think from my perspective,

08:54.856 --> 08:58.920
the information coming into the 911 center,

08:58.920 --> 09:00.750
it's really key.

09:00.750 --> 09:02.298
You know, as Jennifer talked about,

09:02.298 --> 09:05.340
it's about a lot of the human element,

09:05.340 --> 09:07.590
but part of it is also understanding

09:07.590 --> 09:11.703
the standardization of the data that's coming in.

09:12.810 --> 09:16.980
From a perspective relative to the OEMs

09:16.980 --> 09:20.133
and the vehicle manufacturers,

09:21.030 --> 09:23.340
you know, having consistent data

09:23.340 --> 09:27.930
that comes in in a consistent way is incredibly important.

09:27.930 --> 09:30.240
Every time we have a variation

09:30.240 --> 09:34.290
in way the information is delivered

09:34.290 --> 09:35.850
to the 911 center,

09:35.850 --> 09:38.220
that creates additional training components

09:38.220 --> 09:39.960
and additional aspects

09:39.960 --> 09:43.470
that each individual 911 center has to manage.

09:43.470 --> 09:46.410
And so because of the wide variety

09:46.410 --> 09:48.930
of 911 centers across the US

09:48.930 --> 09:52.080
and there are different levels of capability,

09:52.080 --> 09:55.980
whether it be technology and or their training,

09:55.980 --> 09:58.890
we need to make it as consistent as possible

09:58.890 --> 10:01.770
so that when the data comes in,

10:01.770 --> 10:02.617
they don't have to go,

10:02.617 --> 10:05.130
"Okay, it's Tuesday after a full moon,

10:05.130 --> 10:09.660
and I now need to stand on my left foot

10:09.660 --> 10:11.910
and jump three times in the circle

10:11.910 --> 10:14.259
to remember what I'm supposed to do.

10:14.259 --> 10:17.730
We need to make it as user friendly

10:17.730 --> 10:19.737
and as straightforward as possible.

10:19.737 --> 10:23.760
And so standardization of the data and the data sets

10:23.760 --> 10:25.173
is critically important.

10:26.040 --> 10:29.040
<v ->And building on what both of you guys talked about,</v>

10:29.040 --> 10:31.780
I think one of the challenges is that,

10:33.000 --> 10:34.407
you know, the data that's available

10:34.407 --> 10:36.180
and coming into our centers now

10:36.180 --> 10:39.030
from the different telematics service providers

10:39.030 --> 10:40.593
who are gonna talk next,

10:41.460 --> 10:44.040
it works differently in different places, right?

10:44.040 --> 10:46.470
So when we talk about this need,

10:46.470 --> 10:47.850
it's not working the same

10:47.850 --> 10:49.455
across the United States right now.

10:49.455 --> 10:50.400
It can work differently.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.570
Can you build on that?

10:51.570 --> 10:54.810
<v ->Yeah, I mean not only does everybody</v>

10:54.810 --> 10:58.110
have these different variations in the 911 center,

10:58.110 --> 11:01.920
but also permeate that into the field response.

11:01.920 --> 11:05.370
So if you're in metro Las Vegas,

11:05.370 --> 11:07.590
you have a lot more resources and capabilities

11:07.590 --> 11:10.920
than you have in rural Colorado

11:10.920 --> 11:12.780
or rural Nebraska

11:12.780 --> 11:15.120
where things are completely different

11:15.120 --> 11:19.770
and where it may take you 45 minutes to an hour

11:19.770 --> 11:21.990
just to get to the patient.

11:21.990 --> 11:24.360
And that's where standardized protocols

11:24.360 --> 11:28.260
and utilizing methods like that

11:28.260 --> 11:31.770
so that we can provide enhancements

11:31.770 --> 11:34.350
and provide response,

11:34.350 --> 11:36.390
whether it's someone who is a bystander,

11:36.390 --> 11:40.140
so we can coach them through CPR or stopping the bleed

11:40.140 --> 11:44.610
or whatever that may be across those mechanisms.

11:44.610 --> 11:45.780
That is huge

11:45.780 --> 11:49.170
because not every jurisdiction has the same resources,

11:49.170 --> 11:50.730
not only in 911,

11:50.730 --> 11:53.790
but as well in the field.

11:53.790 --> 11:54.623
<v ->And I would build on that</v>

11:54.623 --> 11:58.290
and say keeping 911 professionals in the conversation

11:58.290 --> 12:01.650
as you build out that technology is imperative

12:01.650 --> 12:04.380
because 911 professionals look at the situation

12:04.380 --> 12:05.520
from a different perspective

12:05.520 --> 12:09.660
than a law enforcement officer or an EMS professional.

12:09.660 --> 12:11.910
So making sure that they're still involved in that

12:11.910 --> 12:14.520
and continue to be involved in that conversation

12:14.520 --> 12:15.480
is imperative.

12:15.480 --> 12:19.750
<v ->Right, the information that 911 needs is much different</v>

12:20.730 --> 12:25.230
to be able to make the correct determination of what to send

12:25.230 --> 12:26.880
than maybe some of the information

12:26.880 --> 12:30.750
that we will ultimately relay to those field responders.

12:30.750 --> 12:35.750
But we have to have critical first level information first

12:36.570 --> 12:39.040
to be able to get the right response out

12:39.930 --> 12:43.350
so that those field responders can then take it from there.

12:43.350 --> 12:45.660
We'll relay that other additional information,

12:45.660 --> 12:46.500
but we've gotta make sure

12:46.500 --> 12:48.780
that we're getting the right stuff first.

12:48.780 --> 12:49.830
And that's where it's critical

12:49.830 --> 12:53.130
to have 911 engaged in the conversation

12:53.130 --> 12:54.510
because without that,

12:54.510 --> 12:58.200
everybody kind of skips over that part.

12:58.200 --> 13:00.750
And this is a critical thing to remember,

13:00.750 --> 13:04.350
every single call that happens in the field

13:04.350 --> 13:05.940
starts with a 911 call

13:05.940 --> 13:08.550
and it comes through that 911 center

13:08.550 --> 13:12.480
and they're the ones that are managing the logistics

13:12.480 --> 13:14.630
of getting everybody else out to the field.

13:15.840 --> 13:16.673
<v ->Thank you.</v>

13:16.673 --> 13:17.506
I think that's great

13:17.506 --> 13:19.890
and I think the challenge that a, you know,

13:19.890 --> 13:22.050
we're here at a technology conference,

13:22.050 --> 13:23.370
this isn't as much,

13:23.370 --> 13:24.780
what I'm hearing is it's not as much

13:24.780 --> 13:27.780
of a technology challenge as a technology adoption

13:27.780 --> 13:31.710
that 911 hasn't adopted the full level of technology

13:31.710 --> 13:33.630
that's available to them

13:33.630 --> 13:35.273
in what we call in the 911 industry,

13:35.273 --> 13:36.840
next generation 911,

13:36.840 --> 13:40.170
that's not been as widely adopted across every state

13:40.170 --> 13:42.180
and across all the 5,400 911 centers.

13:42.180 --> 13:45.090
So at some point when that full adoption occurs,

13:45.090 --> 13:46.950
we can get this technology and the data

13:46.950 --> 13:47.783
into the centers differently.

13:47.783 --> 13:51.210
But right now it comes in in a variety of ways.

13:51.210 --> 13:54.660
<v ->Right, and we're kind of working off old technology</v>

13:54.660 --> 13:58.200
from the 1930s, 1940s today.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.375
So we have, you know,

14:00.375 --> 14:02.430
we walked the floors this morning

14:02.430 --> 14:04.743
and we saw tons of amazing technology,

14:05.700 --> 14:07.530
and I'm excited about the future.

14:07.530 --> 14:10.500
But unfortunately, we don't have the capability today

14:10.500 --> 14:13.020
to receive the information

14:13.020 --> 14:15.900
that many of you have,

14:15.900 --> 14:17.670
that you want to push to us.

14:17.670 --> 14:19.170
We just can't take it

14:19.170 --> 14:22.680
because we're working off old school systems

14:22.680 --> 14:26.040
and we're moving that way, but we're not there yet.

14:26.040 --> 14:27.270
We don't know,

14:27.270 --> 14:31.020
like the fundamental question of where are you

14:31.020 --> 14:33.510
is huge in 911.

14:33.510 --> 14:35.820
Domino's knows where you are,

14:35.820 --> 14:37.620
Uber knows where you are,

14:37.620 --> 14:40.710
but we can't pinpoint you like they can.

14:40.710 --> 14:43.350
And so just that fundamental question

14:43.350 --> 14:44.943
is important to remember.

14:46.050 --> 14:49.080
<v ->So next vital part of getting crash notifications</v>

14:49.080 --> 14:51.180
from the vehicle into 911

14:51.180 --> 14:54.060
is through our partners at telematics service providers.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.880
So I'm gonna tee this question off

14:56.880 --> 14:59.160
to Jim and Steve to go next,

14:59.160 --> 15:01.350
but can you guys talk about the importance

15:01.350 --> 15:02.850
of your streamlining data

15:02.850 --> 15:05.790
that comes into the 911 telecommunicators?

15:05.790 --> 15:09.180
And with all those different data points that are available,

15:09.180 --> 15:11.130
what should technology companies know

15:11.130 --> 15:14.550
as they strive to get more data into the centers?

15:14.550 --> 15:15.990
<v ->Yeah, so I'm Steve Coker.</v>

15:15.990 --> 15:17.640
I run SiriusXM Connect.

15:17.640 --> 15:19.145
It's a telematics service provider.

15:19.145 --> 15:22.530
We have more than 13 million active subscribers

15:22.530 --> 15:24.240
that we provide services to,

15:24.240 --> 15:28.470
including crash notification, SOS, and related services.

15:28.470 --> 15:32.370
We handle over a hundred crash events every single day.

15:32.370 --> 15:33.510
And so this, you know,

15:33.510 --> 15:34.680
is near and dear to my heart

15:34.680 --> 15:36.825
is because we really are out there trying to figure out

15:36.825 --> 15:38.640
how do we save lives every day.

15:38.640 --> 15:40.860
I think it's helpful to take a brief step back

15:40.860 --> 15:42.517
and understand from the,

15:42.517 --> 15:44.730
you know, PSAP perspective

15:44.730 --> 15:47.610
or the evolution of how data has been transmitted.

15:47.610 --> 15:48.928
And, you know, for the longest time,

15:48.928 --> 15:52.080
and we've been in business for over 30 years,

15:52.080 --> 15:54.330
you know, we get the call from the car,

15:54.330 --> 15:56.697
we then in turn call the PSAP,

15:56.697 --> 15:58.200
the relevant PSAP,

15:58.200 --> 15:59.940
and we've had to verbally communicate

15:59.940 --> 16:01.540
all the relevant information

16:03.330 --> 16:05.760
up into really the past few years.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.320
And only very recently, you know,

16:07.320 --> 16:10.710
through a partnership we have with RapidSOS

16:10.710 --> 16:13.170
are able to now digitally transmit

16:13.170 --> 16:15.780
the data that we can collect digitally from the vehicle

16:15.780 --> 16:19.290
and send it directly to the PSAP as opposed to having to,

16:19.290 --> 16:21.210
you know, stop and communicate verbally

16:21.210 --> 16:23.190
every piece of information

16:23.190 --> 16:24.870
like the latitude and longitude.

16:24.870 --> 16:27.240
And when you're communicating lots of detailed data,

16:27.240 --> 16:29.280
you have error problems and the like,

16:29.280 --> 16:30.360
that takes time.

16:30.360 --> 16:31.650
And what we found is, you know,

16:31.650 --> 16:34.410
we save on average 37 seconds

16:34.410 --> 16:38.550
of providing a critical information to the PSAP

16:38.550 --> 16:40.410
and seconds saved saves lives.

16:40.410 --> 16:42.000
So we're really excited about that

16:42.000 --> 16:44.520
and we think it's a real step forward

16:44.520 --> 16:46.650
in how we can help save lives.

16:46.650 --> 16:48.060
But with the ability

16:48.060 --> 16:51.000
to digitally transmit information to the PSAP,

16:51.000 --> 16:52.680
now we sort of have the converse problem,

16:52.680 --> 16:55.200
which is we can send all kinds of data

16:55.200 --> 16:56.346
and we have, you know,

16:56.346 --> 16:59.257
OEMs and tier one providers suggesting,

16:59.257 --> 17:00.900
"Hey, we've got this really interesting thing

17:00.900 --> 17:04.560
that we'd like to provide that might be useful to the PSAP.

17:04.560 --> 17:07.127
And so we, as the TSPs,

17:07.127 --> 17:10.950
have this intermediary role to help try and figure out,

17:10.950 --> 17:12.930
well, what's the most important information,

17:12.930 --> 17:15.180
how much data should we really send?

17:15.180 --> 17:18.660
Just 'cause we can doesn't mean we should provide it.

17:18.660 --> 17:20.070
And I think it's really important to understand,

17:20.070 --> 17:23.160
we had a great visit at the end of last year

17:23.160 --> 17:25.113
to the PSAP in Wheaton, Illinois.

17:26.640 --> 17:27.556
I'm a former first responder,

17:27.556 --> 17:30.060
I was a deputy sheriff for a few years,

17:30.060 --> 17:34.140
and ours was a pen and paper

17:34.140 --> 17:36.570
with a radio at the time.

17:36.570 --> 17:38.970
These folks have up to 10 screens,

17:38.970 --> 17:40.830
five keyboards, five mice,

17:40.830 --> 17:42.150
to try and manage this.

17:42.150 --> 17:43.920
The cognitive overload

17:43.920 --> 17:46.290
that we are asking the public safety telecommunicators

17:46.290 --> 17:48.330
to deal with is really significant.

17:48.330 --> 17:49.800
And when you provide cognitive overload

17:49.800 --> 17:51.120
in such a critical place,

17:51.120 --> 17:53.100
like it's really important that we simplify

17:53.100 --> 17:55.020
and reduce that complexity.

17:55.020 --> 17:56.565
So I think we're really working to,

17:56.565 --> 18:00.360
as part of the standards of vehicle emergency data set

18:00.360 --> 18:01.807
and related things to say,

18:01.807 --> 18:03.600
"Hey, let's narrow down what's really important

18:03.600 --> 18:06.000
and most importantly for the telecommunicator,

18:06.000 --> 18:09.330
what's actionable for them in making the dispatch decision.

18:09.330 --> 18:12.120
And I think those parts are really critical to,

18:12.120 --> 18:14.880
let's do that in a consistent way.

18:14.880 --> 18:15.720
And I'm gonna leave it to Jim

18:15.720 --> 18:17.850
to talk a little bit more about the consistency

18:17.850 --> 18:19.770
and the work we're doing together to try and make sure that,

18:19.770 --> 18:21.660
but I think that's a really critical aspect.

18:21.660 --> 18:22.950
<v ->No, that's a great point.</v>

18:22.950 --> 18:25.170
And I just wanna, we have,

18:25.170 --> 18:27.810
as all technology people, we have a lot of acronyms.

18:27.810 --> 18:30.030
PSAP is the Public Safety Answering Point,

18:30.030 --> 18:32.220
another term for a 911 center.

18:32.220 --> 18:34.380
So I wanna make sure we all stand on top

18:34.380 --> 18:35.970
that that's what we're talking about there.

18:35.970 --> 18:39.420
So we talk about 911 centers and PSAPs and ECCs

18:39.420 --> 18:43.170
all as synonymous org entities.

18:43.170 --> 18:44.610
But Jim, why don't you go ahead

18:44.610 --> 18:46.560
and build on the type of data

18:46.560 --> 18:48.720
and how that data will make a difference

18:48.720 --> 18:51.810
in a dispatch decision by those 911 telecommunicators.

18:51.810 --> 18:53.850
<v ->Great, thank you and great stuff so far.</v>

18:53.850 --> 18:55.457
So I'm Jim Lanier with OnStar.

18:55.457 --> 18:57.630
OnStar is a subsidiary of GM,

18:57.630 --> 18:59.318
a wholly-owned subsidiary.

18:59.318 --> 19:02.310
OnStar's been providing crash services

19:02.310 --> 19:04.290
to its members since 1996.

19:04.290 --> 19:07.470
And apologize, a little bit of a froggy voice today.

19:07.470 --> 19:10.410
But again, this is great stuff to kind of build on it

19:10.410 --> 19:13.050
and take to the next level of the conversation.

19:13.050 --> 19:15.030
You know, at OnStar we have the same challenges

19:15.030 --> 19:16.950
as far as when we work closely

19:16.950 --> 19:18.600
with our public safety partners,

19:18.600 --> 19:20.223
making sure that we're providing relevant information

19:20.223 --> 19:22.830
in a way that that's timely and efficient and effective.

19:22.830 --> 19:24.570
So going back to, for example,

19:24.570 --> 19:25.403
you know, old school,

19:25.403 --> 19:26.370
and we still do it today,

19:26.370 --> 19:29.310
is the verbal handoff when we receive a crash notification

19:29.310 --> 19:31.680
to ensure that public safety is getting the information.

19:31.680 --> 19:33.090
But again, it's a verbal handoff

19:33.090 --> 19:36.000
and we do have a digital alternative as well

19:36.000 --> 19:38.519
with some of our PSAP partners out there

19:38.519 --> 19:40.950
where we utilize a company called RapidDeploy

19:40.950 --> 19:42.630
that pushes our information digitally

19:42.630 --> 19:44.490
out to the 911 centers.

19:44.490 --> 19:47.220
But where this becomes a bit of a challenge

19:47.220 --> 19:50.640
is the 911 centers have this separate workstation

19:50.640 --> 19:52.770
that they have to access to get this information.

19:52.770 --> 19:55.590
So when you're hearing about next generation 911

19:55.590 --> 19:56.490
in terms like that,

19:56.490 --> 19:59.640
and the next generation actually a telematics per se,

19:59.640 --> 20:02.730
is to bring this information into the 911 centers

20:02.730 --> 20:04.080
into the public safety ecosystem.

20:04.080 --> 20:05.057
Not just available for 911,

20:05.057 --> 20:06.600
but those downstream that need it,

20:06.600 --> 20:09.720
the first responders, trauma centers, et cetera.

20:09.720 --> 20:12.630
So it's integrated into the call handling workflow.

20:12.630 --> 20:13.650
And what I mean by that,

20:13.650 --> 20:15.330
if I'm a 911 telecommunicator,

20:15.330 --> 20:16.290
and been there, done that,

20:16.290 --> 20:17.910
and had the multiple screens and so forth,

20:17.910 --> 20:18.840
and it's very frustrating

20:18.840 --> 20:20.970
if I have to leave my usual comfort zone

20:20.970 --> 20:22.020
of here's how a call comes in,

20:22.020 --> 20:22.860
here's what I do with it,

20:22.860 --> 20:23.960
here's how I dispatch it.

20:23.960 --> 20:26.309
We go swivel over here and try and do something here

20:26.309 --> 20:29.010
and it's not integrated with my other system.

20:29.010 --> 20:30.660
So it becomes a bit of a gludge.

20:30.660 --> 20:32.070
And when you're short staffed

20:32.070 --> 20:33.030
and you have other pressures,

20:33.030 --> 20:34.980
it's just not the most effective way.

20:34.980 --> 20:36.660
So I'm going all this is, again,

20:36.660 --> 20:39.570
circling back to we need to work towards integration.

20:39.570 --> 20:41.504
And for the technology providers out there,

20:41.504 --> 20:43.410
those that can provide information,

20:43.410 --> 20:46.440
crash notifications, smart streets, internet of things,

20:46.440 --> 20:48.450
vehicle connectivity data,

20:48.450 --> 20:49.890
one thing, please, please, please

20:49.890 --> 20:51.390
to kind of build on something said earlier

20:51.390 --> 20:53.550
is don't assume it's plug and play.

20:53.550 --> 20:55.770
You know, the 911 technology is not plug and play.

20:55.770 --> 21:00.000
It's not a native IP environment yet in many places.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.690
So what we need to do collectively is work as an industry

21:03.690 --> 21:06.660
to ensure that we're treating 911 as a customer

21:06.660 --> 21:09.120
and taking into consideration their needs.

21:09.120 --> 21:10.380
But there's opportunities there.

21:10.380 --> 21:13.080
The good news is there's a lot of energy behind this.

21:13.080 --> 21:14.730
This is what our seventh panel I think

21:14.730 --> 21:15.750
that we've had doing this.

21:15.750 --> 21:19.230
We had the data summit that NHTSA hosted for us last year,

21:19.230 --> 21:20.220
which was very, very powerful,

21:20.220 --> 21:23.700
a lot to OEMs and third party service providers,

21:23.700 --> 21:25.950
trauma surgeons, 911 professionals, et cetera.

21:25.950 --> 21:27.810
We had a big mix there.

21:27.810 --> 21:29.130
But the energy behind that was to,

21:29.130 --> 21:31.950
let's collectively start to work on this.

21:31.950 --> 21:33.690
So for example, Steve mentioned VEDS,

21:33.690 --> 21:35.520
the Vehicle Emergency Data Set,

21:35.520 --> 21:37.440
this is a 911 standard.

21:37.440 --> 21:39.450
This is a standard put together,

21:39.450 --> 21:42.270
ANSI approved by the two large 911 associations

21:42.270 --> 21:43.260
collaborated on this

21:43.260 --> 21:45.270
and revised it just a couple of years ago.

21:45.270 --> 21:48.000
And this provides a platform to allow technology providers

21:48.000 --> 21:52.680
to be able to provide information coming from, for example,

21:52.680 --> 21:53.820
a third party service provider

21:53.820 --> 21:56.100
like OnStar, SiriusXM, or Bosch.

21:56.100 --> 21:57.600
You got crash notification,

21:57.600 --> 22:00.530
be able to provide that to the 911 centers

22:00.530 --> 22:01.740
in a consistent manner.

22:01.740 --> 22:03.720
So for all the technology providers out there

22:03.720 --> 22:05.790
can theoretically through a common interface,

22:05.790 --> 22:07.287
be able to take this information in.

22:07.287 --> 22:09.300
The telecommunicator doesn't have to worry about,

22:09.300 --> 22:11.733
oh, is this a call from a Mercedes vehicle

22:11.733 --> 22:15.750
or Bosch or SiriusXM or an OnStar GM vehicle.

22:15.750 --> 22:18.150
It's gonna show up the same way for them every time.

22:18.150 --> 22:19.410
And included with that comes thing

22:19.410 --> 22:21.450
such as injury severity prediction,

22:21.450 --> 22:24.120
which is an extremely important component in all this.

22:24.120 --> 22:26.430
If you have indications initially in the call

22:26.430 --> 22:28.920
that the person has a high probability

22:28.920 --> 22:29.970
of being severely injured,

22:29.970 --> 22:31.170
and please keep in mind with trauma,

22:31.170 --> 22:33.960
a lot of trauma does happen because of what happens inside,

22:33.960 --> 22:35.490
you don't see it initially,

22:35.490 --> 22:36.570
you know, from the trauma perspective,

22:36.570 --> 22:37.890
you might walk up and they seem fine,

22:37.890 --> 22:40.170
but if the vehicle is saying there's been enough force here

22:40.170 --> 22:41.640
to indicate they possibly,

22:41.640 --> 22:43.230
or probably having an internal injury,

22:43.230 --> 22:44.940
they need to go to a trauma center.

22:44.940 --> 22:46.320
So in these rural environments

22:46.320 --> 22:47.880
where I might take 45 minutes

22:47.880 --> 22:48.930
to get out there as a paramedic,

22:48.930 --> 22:50.640
I'm doing everything I can to get there.

22:50.640 --> 22:51.840
But if I know early,

22:51.840 --> 22:54.360
this is why I'm gonna launch a helicopter early.

22:54.360 --> 22:55.193
Most of you are probably familiar

22:55.193 --> 22:56.880
with what's called the golden hour.

22:56.880 --> 22:58.260
The patient needs to be in surgery

22:58.260 --> 23:00.420
within an hour of the time of the incident,

23:00.420 --> 23:02.250
not from when EMS gets there

23:02.250 --> 23:03.210
and put that in context

23:03.210 --> 23:05.610
with 40 plus percent of these patients are alive

23:05.610 --> 23:06.960
when EMS arrives.

23:06.960 --> 23:08.130
But how long did it take 'em to get there?

23:08.130 --> 23:10.050
How much of that golden hour is going away?

23:10.050 --> 23:11.940
So we have a real opportunity to work together

23:11.940 --> 23:16.477
with the OEMs, TSPs, NHTSA, COVESA, other groups to say,

23:16.477 --> 23:17.730
"You know, we can do better with this

23:17.730 --> 23:18.780
because there's standards out there.

23:18.780 --> 23:19.740
We just need to start bringing

23:19.740 --> 23:21.390
the right stakeholders together

23:21.390 --> 23:23.907
and making it easier on everybody involved."

23:25.260 --> 23:26.093
<v ->Oh, that's great.</v>

23:26.093 --> 23:27.240
And I think that's an important part,

23:27.240 --> 23:28.073
Jim, you talked about,

23:28.073 --> 23:31.500
is that this data can drive a different response.

23:31.500 --> 23:32.940
So in our EMS community

23:32.940 --> 23:35.430
and in my partners in NHTSA's office of EMS

23:35.430 --> 23:38.070
is that there is different levels of training.

23:38.070 --> 23:41.217
There's basic level EMTs, paramedic trained EMTs,

23:41.217 --> 23:44.520
and we want advanced life support responding

23:44.520 --> 23:45.840
when there's serious trauma.

23:45.840 --> 23:47.817
We want that critical care helicopter

23:47.817 --> 23:50.010
or other treatment notified

23:50.010 --> 23:52.890
because you are getting the right treatment

23:52.890 --> 23:56.610
and the right care has the biggest potential of outcome,

23:56.610 --> 23:57.720
you know, to that patient.

23:57.720 --> 24:00.150
So getting them to a trauma center

24:00.150 --> 24:02.520
can improve their odds by over 25%.

24:02.520 --> 24:05.160
Just getting them to the right level of trauma center.

24:05.160 --> 24:06.210
And that's what's key.

24:06.210 --> 24:08.220
And that data from the vehicle,

24:08.220 --> 24:09.502
like the mechanism of injury

24:09.502 --> 24:13.950
and the injury predictive scores can really detail that.

24:13.950 --> 24:18.450
So our next group are more in the automotive

24:18.450 --> 24:20.190
and technology industry

24:20.190 --> 24:23.407
and I'm gonna start with them and ask this question of,

24:23.407 --> 24:25.560
you know, what do we think

24:25.560 --> 24:28.260
hearing what we've heard from the 911 and the TSPs,

24:28.260 --> 24:32.280
what can OEMs and other automotive technology leaders do

24:32.280 --> 24:35.130
to help 911 advance post crash care response?

24:35.130 --> 24:36.600
And this is one of those areas

24:36.600 --> 24:38.940
where it can be even a little non-traditional,

24:38.940 --> 24:40.530
not just crash notification,

24:40.530 --> 24:42.930
but other ways that we're gonna make an impact

24:42.930 --> 24:44.820
within the automotive industry?

24:44.820 --> 24:45.780
Tim, you wanna start?

24:45.780 --> 24:46.710
<v ->Yeah, thanks.</v>

24:46.710 --> 24:47.910
So Tim VanGoethem,

24:47.910 --> 24:49.590
I'm the Chief product officer

24:49.590 --> 24:52.200
for a company called Emergency Safety Solutions.

24:52.200 --> 24:56.219
Our focus is to reduce the number of fatalities and injuries

24:56.219 --> 24:58.890
that result from either a vulnerable vehicle

24:58.890 --> 25:00.300
or a disabled vehicle.

25:00.300 --> 25:01.740
Whether they're on the roadside

25:01.740 --> 25:03.270
because they've been in a crash

25:03.270 --> 25:05.370
or they're just dealing with a breakdown

25:05.370 --> 25:07.020
like a flat tire.

25:07.020 --> 25:10.410
I also have the privilege of co-chairing the COVESA,

25:10.410 --> 25:11.820
Connected Safety Birds of Feather.

25:11.820 --> 25:13.710
So we have been in this conversation.

25:13.710 --> 25:17.520
And both ESS and COVESA are thinking about this

25:17.520 --> 25:20.940
in terms of kind of a progression of value chain, right?

25:20.940 --> 25:23.520
Because there's a lot of people involved

25:23.520 --> 25:25.380
in a crash situation.

25:25.380 --> 25:27.330
Certainly the victims themselves,

25:27.330 --> 25:29.550
the first responders that are coming,

25:29.550 --> 25:32.550
the dispatchers that are trying to program a response,

25:32.550 --> 25:35.370
and eventually people in the hospital

25:35.370 --> 25:37.320
that are gonna receive those victims.

25:37.320 --> 25:39.090
So the way we've been thinking about this

25:39.090 --> 25:43.260
is how do we kind of understand all of the stakeholders

25:43.260 --> 25:46.500
that are involved in what their collective needs are.

25:46.500 --> 25:51.500
From our view, stage one is we need to notify, right?

25:51.660 --> 25:55.260
And that notification can certainly be to the PSAPs.

25:55.260 --> 25:57.000
You talked about the simple thing, Ty,

25:57.000 --> 25:59.970
of just knowing where a crash has occurred.

25:59.970 --> 26:02.130
It was astounding to me

26:02.130 --> 26:04.770
to learn through our earlier conversations

26:04.770 --> 26:09.030
how blind the 911 call centers and the dispatchers are,

26:09.030 --> 26:12.120
as well as our friends in the TSP community.

26:12.120 --> 26:13.650
I just assumed,

26:13.650 --> 26:14.700
you know, that was in place,

26:14.700 --> 26:16.800
'cause I was part of the Motorola team

26:16.800 --> 26:18.090
that built genuine OnStar.

26:18.090 --> 26:21.240
So I know what the car is capable of doing

26:21.240 --> 26:23.640
and it was astounding to learn

26:23.640 --> 26:25.500
that all the downstream stakeholders

26:25.500 --> 26:28.560
was not getting that simple piece of information.

26:28.560 --> 26:29.658
But we can notify other things.

26:29.658 --> 26:33.570
We can notify the other drivers that are approaching, right?

26:33.570 --> 26:37.170
'Cause even though we're desperate

26:37.170 --> 26:39.600
to prevent crashes,

26:39.600 --> 26:40.860
when they occur,

26:40.860 --> 26:42.960
we need to stop the pileups,

26:42.960 --> 26:44.700
the secondary collisions,

26:44.700 --> 26:46.710
or especially this time of year,

26:46.710 --> 26:50.460
the multi-car pileups that really turn, you know,

26:50.460 --> 26:53.520
a bad situation into tragedy.

26:53.520 --> 26:56.700
So how do we notify people of things?

26:56.700 --> 26:59.490
From emergency safety solutions perspective,

26:59.490 --> 27:01.590
we also wanna protect the scene.

27:01.590 --> 27:04.410
How do we use things like reimagined lighting

27:04.410 --> 27:08.370
or other ways to use line of sight tools

27:08.370 --> 27:10.440
to communicate to the approaching motorists

27:10.440 --> 27:12.150
that there's something in front of them,

27:12.150 --> 27:13.800
whether that's a crash

27:13.800 --> 27:15.180
or somebody on the side of the road

27:15.180 --> 27:16.920
dealing with a flat tire.

27:16.920 --> 27:19.739
And we've deployed these kind of technologies

27:19.739 --> 27:21.600
out into the field already.

27:21.600 --> 27:24.450
And then the last step is response.

27:24.450 --> 27:26.587
How do we program the right response?

27:26.587 --> 27:29.490
So just kind of building on what my colleagues have said,

27:29.490 --> 27:32.850
it's around understanding the characteristics of the crash.

27:32.850 --> 27:34.080
How many cars were involved?

27:34.080 --> 27:35.520
How many people were in the car?

27:35.520 --> 27:37.530
Were they belted, right?

27:37.530 --> 27:38.970
Have they been injected?

27:38.970 --> 27:40.800
That was another kind of interesting thing

27:40.800 --> 27:42.120
for me to understand.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.370
I believed ignorantly

27:44.370 --> 27:46.200
that one of the most important things to understand

27:46.200 --> 27:48.660
is that has the airbag deployed.

27:48.660 --> 27:53.640
What I was astounded to learn is if the airbag has deployed,

27:53.640 --> 27:56.070
there's still a very high probability

27:56.070 --> 27:57.960
like the occupants are okay.

27:57.960 --> 28:00.900
'Cause the automotive industry has done an amazing job

28:00.900 --> 28:03.690
of building crash resilient cars.

28:03.690 --> 28:07.860
But if they've been injected, very different outcome.

28:07.860 --> 28:10.410
And I just didn't expect that.

28:10.410 --> 28:13.350
So how do we understand the characteristics of the crash?

28:13.350 --> 28:14.790
How many people were involved?

28:14.790 --> 28:15.930
Were they belted?

28:15.930 --> 28:17.190
Did they stay in the car?

28:17.190 --> 28:21.180
And then if we can also bridge that to who was in the car

28:21.180 --> 28:23.370
and be able to share, you know,

28:23.370 --> 28:27.060
managing all the privacy topics that obviously get involved.

28:27.060 --> 28:29.160
But do they have medical conditions?

28:29.160 --> 28:30.540
How old are they?

28:30.540 --> 28:32.640
Are they allergic to certain medicines?

28:32.640 --> 28:35.820
And as that information conglomerates

28:35.820 --> 28:37.920
and moves through this value chain,

28:37.920 --> 28:40.650
then I think each of the stakeholders then

28:40.650 --> 28:42.630
will have the information they need

28:42.630 --> 28:45.430
to program the right response and drive a great outcome.

28:46.830 --> 28:48.150
<v ->Thank you.</v>

28:48.150 --> 28:49.770
<v ->Steal that from you.</v>

28:49.770 --> 28:51.510
Hi, my name is Kathy Boden Holland.

28:51.510 --> 28:53.550
I'm the CEO of Mindr.

28:53.550 --> 28:56.880
Mindr is kind of the odd duck out in this group

28:56.880 --> 28:59.820
in that we are the country's largest provider

28:59.820 --> 29:02.940
of ignition interlock devices and services.

29:02.940 --> 29:06.960
An IID is what you would have in your car

29:06.960 --> 29:09.543
if you have had a DUI.

29:10.860 --> 29:14.130
There are programs that are managed in every state.

29:14.130 --> 29:15.630
I am, too, from Colorado,

29:15.630 --> 29:17.940
which has an excellent program,

29:17.940 --> 29:20.430
and we operate in all 50 states.

29:20.430 --> 29:24.240
Just to give you some perspective on size

29:24.240 --> 29:25.950
because people often think of DUI

29:25.950 --> 29:27.660
as something that happens to someone else,

29:27.660 --> 29:32.640
there's a 900,000 DUI arrests annually,

29:32.640 --> 29:35.703
which is actually fewer arrests than pre-COVID.

29:36.810 --> 29:40.620
And yet fatalities associated with substance

29:40.620 --> 29:42.690
has gone up post-COVID.

29:42.690 --> 29:46.290
So it is not that behavior has gotten better or different,

29:46.290 --> 29:49.230
it's actually that enforcement has gone down

29:49.230 --> 29:50.940
not for reasons,

29:50.940 --> 29:52.080
anything that are different

29:52.080 --> 29:53.204
than most companies are dealing with,

29:53.204 --> 29:55.830
which is recruitment and training,

29:55.830 --> 29:57.000
something we've talked about here.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.190
But certainly from a law enforcement perspective,

29:59.190 --> 30:01.890
it's a significant, significant issue.

30:01.890 --> 30:06.890
So we are very much in the keeping our safer people quadrant

30:07.080 --> 30:08.943
of the NHTSA model.

30:09.780 --> 30:12.881
We stop amongst our customer base,

30:12.881 --> 30:15.480
approximately a quarter million

30:15.480 --> 30:19.320
attempted drunk driving events on an annual basis.

30:19.320 --> 30:20.340
But I will tell you

30:20.340 --> 30:25.110
that one of the greatest competitors to us as a company

30:25.110 --> 30:26.700
is non-compliance.

30:26.700 --> 30:29.760
So what that means is that you've had a DUI,

30:29.760 --> 30:34.410
you are to have an IID in your car and you simply don't.

30:34.410 --> 30:37.290
So enforcement of having the IID in the car is even harder

30:37.290 --> 30:39.723
than the enforcement of impaired driving.

30:40.710 --> 30:44.010
An IID is the only proven technology out there

30:44.010 --> 30:46.830
to lower both DUIs,

30:46.830 --> 30:48.300
as well as recidivism.

30:48.300 --> 30:51.510
So actually DUIs are about two thirds of them

30:51.510 --> 30:53.310
are first time offenders.

30:53.310 --> 30:56.910
So it's not always a chronic alcohol issue.

30:56.910 --> 31:00.093
It's a chronic bad decision making issue.

31:01.170 --> 31:02.003
I say all that

31:02.003 --> 31:04.890
because I wanted to just add to this conversation

31:04.890 --> 31:08.970
that something that I think Tim touched on briefly

31:08.970 --> 31:12.360
that the reason compliance is an issue

31:12.360 --> 31:14.430
is something that I think holds its head up here

31:14.430 --> 31:16.473
in this challenge, which is privacy.

31:18.360 --> 31:20.370
All of us are probably really,

31:20.370 --> 31:22.293
we have a huge digital footprint.

31:23.130 --> 31:25.230
Our cars know a lot about us

31:25.230 --> 31:27.780
as do our phones, as do our laptops,

31:27.780 --> 31:30.450
and all the people who are building and operating those,

31:30.450 --> 31:32.845
many of whom are probably in the room today.

31:32.845 --> 31:34.893
We have a huge amount of data,

31:35.850 --> 31:38.770
and the individuals

31:39.660 --> 31:42.000
whose data that is about are not,

31:42.000 --> 31:43.530
are becoming, I think, more and more savvy

31:43.530 --> 31:46.890
about not wanting that to be publicly available,

31:46.890 --> 31:50.880
or even publicly available for good intention, right?

31:50.880 --> 31:52.500
And once you've been in a crash

31:52.500 --> 31:55.471
is not the time to decide you wanna opt in.

31:55.471 --> 31:58.200
And so making sure

31:58.200 --> 32:00.360
that we have both a complete picture of people,

32:00.360 --> 32:02.880
but then also full transparency

32:02.880 --> 32:05.190
as to how and when it may be shared

32:05.190 --> 32:07.170
is I think one of the great challenges

32:07.170 --> 32:09.390
to what we're talking about here today.

32:09.390 --> 32:11.835
I will tell you that that non-compliance

32:11.835 --> 32:15.690
that I talked about as being a competitive issue for us,

32:15.690 --> 32:16.680
we've done the research,

32:16.680 --> 32:17.850
obviously we wanna figure out

32:17.850 --> 32:19.800
why non-compliance is an issue,

32:19.800 --> 32:22.920
and privacy is one of the key factors.

32:22.920 --> 32:26.220
We thought it would be more about not wanting to pay for it,

32:26.220 --> 32:27.053
but it turns out

32:27.053 --> 32:30.120
that that's actually much farther down the list.

32:30.120 --> 32:32.850
And again, it's not necessarily

32:32.850 --> 32:37.080
because they intend to be an impaired driver again,

32:37.080 --> 32:40.380
but because they simply don't wanna have

32:40.380 --> 32:43.380
that kind of tracking on an ongoing basis

32:43.380 --> 32:44.943
and are willing to,

32:46.500 --> 32:47.363
I'll say, you know,

32:47.363 --> 32:49.170
break the rules, break the law,

32:49.170 --> 32:50.520
however you wanna describe it,

32:50.520 --> 32:51.540
in order to avoid that.

32:51.540 --> 32:54.600
So I just kinda wanted to add that to this discussion

32:54.600 --> 32:58.260
or highlight, maybe reraise that to this discussion.

32:58.260 --> 33:02.086
What data would be really valuable to the ecosystem

33:02.086 --> 33:04.110
has to be, you know,

33:04.110 --> 33:06.090
the Venn diagram of what data people want

33:06.090 --> 33:07.840
to be available to the ecosystem

33:08.910 --> 33:10.620
has to also be considered.

33:10.620 --> 33:15.420
And what I would like in the ecosystem probably differs

33:15.420 --> 33:17.700
when I need it to be in the ecosystem

33:17.700 --> 33:20.790
than in advance when I'm asking myself that question.

33:20.790 --> 33:21.720
<v ->Yeah, thanks Kathy.</v>

33:21.720 --> 33:22.620
And that's a great point.

33:22.620 --> 33:25.140
And as a couple people have alluded to,

33:25.140 --> 33:26.910
this conversation that we're having today

33:26.910 --> 33:29.640
is a continuation that really started back in June

33:29.640 --> 33:32.070
in Michigan at an event

33:32.070 --> 33:34.290
and where I've met Tim and Steve

33:34.290 --> 33:36.060
and some others that are on this panel

33:36.060 --> 33:37.950
that we've been building on.

33:37.950 --> 33:39.660
And one of the things that we've recognized

33:39.660 --> 33:41.430
is that whether it's standards,

33:41.430 --> 33:42.750
whether it's data issues,

33:42.750 --> 33:44.147
our concerns with this,

33:44.147 --> 33:45.822
we've been working in different silos.

33:45.822 --> 33:49.050
The 911 community has had its silo,

33:49.050 --> 33:50.940
even TSPs have had their silos,

33:50.940 --> 33:52.500
OEMs definitely have theirs.

33:52.500 --> 33:55.170
But we look at these problems differently.

33:55.170 --> 33:56.820
Tim and I were at that first event together

33:56.820 --> 34:01.440
and our second speaking in a situation similar to this,

34:01.440 --> 34:02.490
he was talking about privacy.

34:02.490 --> 34:05.190
And from my point of view as a 911 professional,

34:05.190 --> 34:06.900
we don't worry about privacy.

34:06.900 --> 34:08.940
It's implicit that if you call 911,

34:08.940 --> 34:10.410
you're waiving your privacy.

34:10.410 --> 34:12.083
If you call 911 on your phone,

34:12.083 --> 34:14.730
we are going to, you know,

34:14.730 --> 34:16.650
we get to decide what we're gonna do,

34:16.650 --> 34:17.700
whether we send police.

34:17.700 --> 34:18.997
Whether if you sit there and say,

34:18.997 --> 34:20.820
"No, no, don't send the police."

34:20.820 --> 34:22.830
Yeah, that's not your call as the caller.

34:22.830 --> 34:23.880
Once you've called us,

34:23.880 --> 34:26.670
we decide who we send, when we send them,

34:26.670 --> 34:29.250
how fast we send them in the 911 world.

34:29.250 --> 34:32.670
So married into the privacy issue of the data

34:32.670 --> 34:34.680
and the data being developed in different standards

34:34.680 --> 34:35.760
and in different silos

34:35.760 --> 34:39.210
has been a fascinating side put of this.

34:39.210 --> 34:41.370
And as we've said, I think, you know,

34:41.370 --> 34:43.500
you hear me speaking from NHTSA,

34:43.500 --> 34:46.710
I'm not speaking from the NHTSA regulatory point of view.

34:46.710 --> 34:49.320
I'm in the Office of Behavior, Research, and Development,

34:49.320 --> 34:50.520
and we're working on this

34:50.520 --> 34:52.860
from how to interface and collaborate

34:52.860 --> 34:54.810
within the 911 community.

34:54.810 --> 34:57.030
We've got five minutes left and that's great.

34:57.030 --> 34:58.500
We've done well to stay on time.

34:58.500 --> 35:02.580
I just would ask anyone on the panel of any final words

35:02.580 --> 35:05.640
as far as this importance of connecting this data

35:05.640 --> 35:06.960
to our 911 community

35:06.960 --> 35:08.550
and our challenges that are ahead of us

35:08.550 --> 35:11.460
or maybe some of the things we've already seen

35:11.460 --> 35:14.160
since we've engaged in the last seven months

35:14.160 --> 35:15.783
some steps forward on.

35:17.280 --> 35:21.240
<v ->Well, I will just say that from my perspective,</v>

35:21.240 --> 35:24.240
working in the 911 industry for 30 years,

35:24.240 --> 35:26.910
the last eight months

35:26.910 --> 35:30.210
has been the most exciting in this conversation

35:30.210 --> 35:32.880
that I've ever seen in my 30 years.

35:32.880 --> 35:35.719
Because to the point that I believe it was Jim

35:35.719 --> 35:37.980
and others have made is that,

35:37.980 --> 35:39.450
and Brian just made,

35:39.450 --> 35:42.330
we've been working in individual silos

35:42.330 --> 35:44.460
and we've been looking at things

35:44.460 --> 35:47.100
from our own individual perspectives.

35:47.100 --> 35:48.900
And in the last eight months,

35:48.900 --> 35:52.440
we have made a tremendous amount of strides

35:52.440 --> 35:54.960
to kind of break those silos down

35:54.960 --> 35:57.480
and have a whole lot more conversations

35:57.480 --> 35:59.310
and have an opportunity

35:59.310 --> 36:03.540
for things to really begin to switch

36:03.540 --> 36:06.450
and begin to kind of work

36:06.450 --> 36:10.170
towards common goals and common outcomes.

36:10.170 --> 36:13.290
And that I think is the most exciting part for me

36:13.290 --> 36:15.000
in the 911 industry

36:15.000 --> 36:18.600
and moving this discussion forward.

36:18.600 --> 36:19.710
<v ->Yeah, and I would build on that</v>

36:19.710 --> 36:23.130
and just say that part of what has come out of that

36:23.130 --> 36:26.520
is also the recognition of 911 as its own profession

36:26.520 --> 36:29.970
not tied specifically to law enforcement, fire, EMS.

36:29.970 --> 36:33.030
Field response definitely has a place at the table,

36:33.030 --> 36:35.970
but having 911 specifically at the table

36:35.970 --> 36:39.510
to provide their input from that specific perspective

36:39.510 --> 36:42.390
has been extremely beneficial.

36:42.390 --> 36:43.590
<v ->Well, and I think that builds</v>

36:43.590 --> 36:45.510
on like what Tim was talking about

36:45.510 --> 36:48.150
as far as even when a crash occurs,

36:48.150 --> 36:50.670
we have challenges for people moving over

36:50.670 --> 36:52.140
and preventing struck bys.

36:52.140 --> 36:54.300
And you've done a webinar with our office

36:54.300 --> 36:57.330
on 911's role in traffic incident management,

36:57.330 --> 36:58.920
and that's something the 911 community

36:58.920 --> 37:01.530
needs to learn a lot more about, right?

37:01.530 --> 37:04.170
<v ->Yeah, and making sure that 911 professionals</v>

37:04.170 --> 37:06.720
are the beginning and the end of the training,

37:06.720 --> 37:08.257
not just as a side.

37:08.257 --> 37:10.200
"Oh yeah, and 911 will do this."

37:10.200 --> 37:11.820
Well, how is 911 gonna do that?

37:11.820 --> 37:14.570
We need to think about that piece of link in the chain.

37:15.600 --> 37:16.889
<v ->I think one of the key benefits,</v>

37:16.889 --> 37:18.150
and I agree wholly with Ty

37:18.150 --> 37:21.433
that I've seen more progress in the last year

37:21.433 --> 37:24.660
than any time that I've been associated with this.

37:24.660 --> 37:28.710
And personally, I've spent some good conversations with Jim

37:28.710 --> 37:30.630
and with our colleagues at Bosch.

37:30.630 --> 37:33.030
I frankly think there's a lot that just,

37:33.030 --> 37:35.490
you know, the TSP providers can do collaboratively

37:35.490 --> 37:37.020
if the three organizations

37:37.020 --> 37:40.110
between OnStar, Bosch, and SiriusXM Connect

37:40.110 --> 37:43.170
can work together to help create alignment and standards

37:43.170 --> 37:45.270
and consistency just on our own

37:45.270 --> 37:48.000
by working together helps the entire ecosystem.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.030
And we're really excited about that opportunity.

37:51.030 --> 37:53.043
<v ->Yeah, and I'll just add on to that.</v>

37:54.210 --> 37:56.400
I've been in this business over 40 years

37:56.400 --> 37:58.980
with the last 30 or so in 911,

37:58.980 --> 38:00.207
remembering when next generation 911

38:00.207 --> 38:02.283
was supposed to come out in 2001.

38:03.240 --> 38:06.360
And it's just, don't wanna sound like a broken record here,

38:06.360 --> 38:08.670
but again, the momentum that's behind this now,

38:08.670 --> 38:11.070
and not treating this like a Pandora's box

38:11.070 --> 38:12.810
or a bunch of separate silos,

38:12.810 --> 38:14.970
and to Jennifer's point, especially in others,

38:14.970 --> 38:16.830
bringing the 911 community into this

38:16.830 --> 38:20.070
as a primary stakeholder is crucial.

38:20.070 --> 38:21.330
It's been kind of a paradox.

38:21.330 --> 38:22.163
When you work in 911,

38:22.163 --> 38:24.180
you're proud of being that quiet professional.

38:24.180 --> 38:25.530
You don't want any notoriety,

38:25.530 --> 38:26.490
you just do your job

38:26.490 --> 38:29.700
and you just go through it and you do great things

38:29.700 --> 38:30.840
and nah, leave me alone.

38:30.840 --> 38:31.673
We're behind the scenes.

38:31.673 --> 38:33.120
We like it that way.

38:33.120 --> 38:34.809
But that's also led to sometimes, I think,

38:34.809 --> 38:38.160
inadvertently not ignoring them but taking them for granted.

38:38.160 --> 38:41.400
So with this opportunity with all of us together,

38:41.400 --> 38:44.160
including our 911 friends and other stakeholders,

38:44.160 --> 38:45.960
this is something to build on.

38:45.960 --> 38:47.430
<v ->Just pile into all of that.</v>

38:47.430 --> 38:51.120
What I've really enjoyed during this journey

38:51.120 --> 38:53.760
is the collaborative attitude.

38:53.760 --> 38:58.430
Even though we compete each with various members

38:58.430 --> 39:00.930
from a commercial perspective,

39:00.930 --> 39:03.210
we're setting that aside for the greater good.

39:03.210 --> 39:05.010
That's amazing, right?

39:05.010 --> 39:06.750
We'll find other ways to differentiate

39:06.750 --> 39:08.100
and drive your businesses,

39:08.100 --> 39:10.350
which is expected.

39:10.350 --> 39:12.930
What I love though is we're finding a way

39:12.930 --> 39:15.240
to collaborate across the ecosystem,

39:15.240 --> 39:16.920
bringing in more and more people.

39:16.920 --> 39:19.590
And we're just getting busy.

39:19.590 --> 39:21.210
We're not waiting around for the perfect.

39:21.210 --> 39:22.339
We're not sitting in the classroom.

39:22.339 --> 39:25.410
We're not dreaming about tomorrow.

39:25.410 --> 39:26.550
We're picking up shovels

39:26.550 --> 39:30.000
and we're getting to work as quickly as we possibly can.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.920
And I just ask that we just keep this going

39:31.920 --> 39:33.780
and bringing in more and more people

39:33.780 --> 39:36.210
so that we understand who else is involved,

39:36.210 --> 39:39.990
who else could be part of making the world better,

39:39.990 --> 39:41.400
addressing the numbers, Brian,

39:41.400 --> 39:43.170
that you presented in the beginning.

39:43.170 --> 39:45.630
Even though the roads are safer,

39:45.630 --> 39:49.500
there's still 42,000 families that don't see it that way.

39:49.500 --> 39:51.513
Right, so let's keep going.

39:52.470 --> 39:54.840
<v ->Well, thank you all.</v>

39:54.840 --> 39:55.920
What a great panel.

39:55.920 --> 39:58.020
Thank you all for being here and listening

39:58.020 --> 40:00.540
and we just hope to continue to work on this

40:00.540 --> 40:01.590
and make improvements.

40:01.590 --> 40:02.548
Thank you.

40:02.548 --> 40:05.231
(audience applauding)

40:05.231 --> 40:07.814
(bright music)
