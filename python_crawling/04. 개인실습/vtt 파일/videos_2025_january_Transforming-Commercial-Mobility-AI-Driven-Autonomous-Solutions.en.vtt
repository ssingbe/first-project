00:00.186 --> 00:02.853
(upbeat music)

00:10.620 --> 00:13.530
<v ->Hello, I'm Ed Bernardon with Code19 Racing,</v>

00:13.530 --> 00:18.530
and I wanna welcome you all to our CES '25 panel,

00:18.660 --> 00:20.760
Transforming Commercial Mobility

00:20.760 --> 00:23.610
with AI-Driven Autonomous Solutions.

00:23.610 --> 00:25.290
And I want you to start off

00:25.290 --> 00:27.600
and think about when you hear the word autonomous vehicle,

00:27.600 --> 00:31.601
you probably think about a robotaxi or a self-driving car.

00:31.601 --> 00:34.050
But today, we're gonna shift that focus,

00:34.050 --> 00:36.390
we're gonna shift it to commercial autonomy.

00:36.390 --> 00:37.740
And in some cases,

00:37.740 --> 00:42.360
we're gonna combine autonomy with automation.

00:42.360 --> 00:47.360
And these are applications where they're AI-powered,

00:47.580 --> 00:50.520
they're in unstructured environments,

00:50.520 --> 00:53.671
and they're defined by the three D's,

00:53.671 --> 00:56.490
dull, dirty, or dangerous,

00:56.490 --> 00:58.890
some combination of the three D's.

00:58.890 --> 01:01.650
So these are all the types of tasks

01:01.650 --> 01:04.710
that humans would just love to give to a machine.

01:04.710 --> 01:07.080
And so what we'll do is we'll start off with a quick,

01:07.080 --> 01:09.360
have each of the panelists introduce themselves,

01:09.360 --> 01:13.680
and then we'll jump into the questions right after that.

01:13.680 --> 01:15.030
John, go right ahead.

01:15.030 --> 01:16.110
<v ->Hello, I'm John Beck.</v>

01:16.110 --> 01:18.900
I'm the director for Autonomy &amp; Active Safety

01:18.900 --> 01:21.060
at Oshkosh Corporation,

01:21.060 --> 01:24.599
a global industrial technology company

01:24.599 --> 01:27.180
that builds purpose-built vehicles

01:27.180 --> 01:30.678
and other equipment for fire and emergency,

01:30.678 --> 01:35.678
refuse collection, construction, access equipment defense,

01:37.740 --> 01:39.753
and airport products.

01:42.060 --> 01:46.530
<v ->And I'm Don Burnett, I'm the founder and CEO of Kodiak.</v>

01:46.530 --> 01:48.600
Kodiak is a technology startup

01:48.600 --> 01:50.100
working in the self-driving space.

01:50.100 --> 01:52.170
We really like to think we embody the dull, dirty,

01:52.170 --> 01:53.490
and dangerous.

01:53.490 --> 01:54.900
We have trucks,

01:54.900 --> 01:57.660
our autonomy technology running in semi-truck over the road,

01:57.660 --> 02:01.110
working to carry freight all across the United States

02:01.110 --> 02:02.910
with some amazing partners like J.B. Hunt

02:02.910 --> 02:05.370
and Werner Enterprises and many others,

02:05.370 --> 02:08.550
but we also do off-road autonomy and unstructured autonomy

02:08.550 --> 02:11.280
in context like military applications.

02:11.280 --> 02:12.840
We work with the U.S. Army

02:12.840 --> 02:17.160
and provide off-road autonomy services there.

02:17.160 --> 02:19.170
And we also run freight

02:19.170 --> 02:21.360
for off-road commercial applications.

02:21.360 --> 02:25.470
We have customers in and related to the mining industry,

02:25.470 --> 02:27.570
where they're moving goods, raw materials,

02:27.570 --> 02:30.630
and other things in and out of mining environments.

02:30.630 --> 02:35.630
And those very, very dull and dirty jobs

02:35.850 --> 02:37.530
are ones that are ripe for automation.

02:37.530 --> 02:38.403
So thank you.

02:39.510 --> 02:40.830
<v ->Hello. Good afternoon, everybody.</v>

02:40.830 --> 02:42.720
My name is Carolina Diez,

02:42.720 --> 02:45.899
and I guess I'm the only non-American in the panel,

02:45.899 --> 02:48.238
so just take it easy on me.

02:48.238 --> 02:50.741
I'm vice president of Future Solutions

02:50.741 --> 02:52.680
in Volvo Construction Equipment,

02:52.680 --> 02:54.960
which is the construction

02:54.960 --> 02:58.950
and infrastructure part of Volvo Group, Swedish company.

02:58.950 --> 03:02.790
And we do trucks, construction machinery, buses,

03:02.790 --> 03:06.180
and engines for boats as well.

03:06.180 --> 03:07.013
<v ->And, Jeremy?</v>

03:08.400 --> 03:11.400
<v ->I'm Benjamin Lyon. Great to meet all of you.</v>

03:11.400 --> 03:15.111
And I'm the Chief Technology officer of Aptiv,

03:15.111 --> 03:17.310
and Aptiv makes autonomous solutions

03:17.310 --> 03:19.619
that run in many, many passenger vehicles

03:19.619 --> 03:24.210
as well as commercial vehicles all over the world,

03:24.210 --> 03:26.190
in addition to autonomous systems

03:26.190 --> 03:29.974
to drive 5G networks in the United States

03:29.974 --> 03:31.473
and all over the world.

03:33.390 --> 03:35.280
<v ->So, John, let's start off with Oshkosh.</v>

03:35.280 --> 03:38.670
You do all sorts of different applications, construction,

03:38.670 --> 03:41.760
you do refuse collection, defense.

03:41.760 --> 03:45.060
How does AI help you bring value

03:45.060 --> 03:47.610
to these kinds of applications?

03:47.610 --> 03:49.920
<v ->Sure. So I can walk you through a few examples</v>

03:49.920 --> 03:53.370
and we'll start with in the construction space.

03:53.370 --> 03:57.510
So we have an access equipment business unit

03:57.510 --> 04:00.150
that makes the boom lifts

04:00.150 --> 04:03.300
and telehandler that you find on every construction site

04:03.300 --> 04:04.950
around the world.

04:04.950 --> 04:08.850
We are currently developing an all electric version

04:08.850 --> 04:13.850
that has a self-leveling chassis, and on that is a boom.

04:14.217 --> 04:17.130
And the idea is that it can transform

04:17.130 --> 04:20.760
either between a boom lift for carrying people up and down,

04:20.760 --> 04:23.010
or it could be, you know,

04:23.010 --> 04:26.850
put a implement on the end like forks for moving materials.

04:26.850 --> 04:30.357
We're also exploring various end effectors

04:30.357 --> 04:33.870
that can, you know, perform the work at height

04:33.870 --> 04:34.920
rather than a person.

04:34.920 --> 04:39.720
So it could be a power washer, it could be a saw,

04:39.720 --> 04:42.750
it could be something that could hold materials in place

04:42.750 --> 04:45.780
while a person is fasting in place, welding,

04:45.780 --> 04:47.550
you know, bolting, what have you.

04:47.550 --> 04:50.209
We're also, you know, that particular platform,

04:50.209 --> 04:54.210
self-leveling, but we're looking at applying AI

04:54.210 --> 04:55.980
to the perception stack on that one

04:55.980 --> 05:00.803
to identify common obstacles and materials

05:00.803 --> 05:03.270
in the construction space

05:03.270 --> 05:07.053
so that as it maneuvers around, it can avoid those.

05:07.980 --> 05:10.170
Furthermore, because it's fully electric,

05:10.170 --> 05:14.522
we are developing an autonomous mobile charging robot

05:14.522 --> 05:17.940
that could detect when these electric vehicles

05:17.940 --> 05:22.127
get low on charge and navigate to those vehicles

05:22.127 --> 05:25.950
and autonomously connect and charge them in place

05:25.950 --> 05:28.230
as opposed to these vehicles

05:28.230 --> 05:32.393
going back to essential charging area.

05:32.393 --> 05:34.377
Then we can move into, you know,

05:34.377 --> 05:36.840
and the airport products

05:36.840 --> 05:38.610
and the ground support equipment there.

05:38.610 --> 05:41.190
First we have, you know,

05:41.190 --> 05:46.080
Aerotech builds and sells the jet bridges

05:46.080 --> 05:48.481
that you use to get on and off airplanes.

05:48.481 --> 05:52.232
Those things are very hard to control manually.

05:52.232 --> 05:56.329
You know, they're big, they're kind of clumsy.

05:56.329 --> 05:58.110
You use a joystick,

05:58.110 --> 05:59.790
you have the three degrees of freedom,

05:59.790 --> 06:02.220
left, right, up, down, forward, back,

06:02.220 --> 06:03.930
plus it sort of pivots.

06:03.930 --> 06:06.480
And there's a, you need to accommodate a multitude

06:06.480 --> 06:08.340
of different types of aircraft.

06:08.340 --> 06:11.160
It's the perfect opportunity to automate.

06:11.160 --> 06:13.290
I'm sure you've all experienced

06:13.290 --> 06:14.790
being late coming to the gate

06:14.790 --> 06:16.590
and then having to wait an extra 20 minutes

06:16.590 --> 06:18.240
for the gate operator to get there

06:18.240 --> 06:20.070
and drive the thing to the plane.

06:20.070 --> 06:23.130
So I've always wanted to automate these things.

06:23.130 --> 06:24.060
Now we're doing it.

06:24.060 --> 06:27.120
An it autonomously, you know,

06:27.120 --> 06:30.250
it recognizes the shape of the door,

06:30.250 --> 06:31.860
the sides of the fuselage,

06:31.860 --> 06:35.138
and autonomously approaches to within about an inch or two

06:35.138 --> 06:36.360
of the aircraft,

06:36.360 --> 06:37.530
and it allows a human operator

06:37.530 --> 06:39.030
to get it the rest of the way.

06:40.110 --> 06:41.918
On top of that, the Aerotech,

06:41.918 --> 06:46.440
we're looking at automating fully electric cargo

06:46.440 --> 06:48.900
and baggage handling equipment,

06:48.900 --> 06:51.990
where, you know, the airports are extremely well defined.

06:51.990 --> 06:53.640
They've got open skies.

06:53.640 --> 06:57.030
And although they are very, very busy places,

06:57.030 --> 06:59.083
because of the, you know,

06:59.083 --> 07:00.510
the nature of fairly low-speed operations,

07:00.510 --> 07:02.220
and it's very well known,

07:02.220 --> 07:04.393
with coordination software,

07:04.393 --> 07:07.953
it seems to be ripe launch point for autonomy.

07:08.790 --> 07:11.992
And then some sort of less mobile applications

07:11.992 --> 07:15.480
as we're using AI on refuse vehicles

07:15.480 --> 07:20.480
to, you know, camera system be able to understand

07:20.859 --> 07:24.300
the difference between a trash can and a refuse can

07:24.300 --> 07:27.690
and locate those things for curbside collection.

07:27.690 --> 07:31.650
And then the arm that comes off the side of the vehicle

07:31.650 --> 07:36.650
can automatically grab that can and empty it into the back.

07:37.050 --> 07:41.025
Another camera that's in the hopper of that refuse vehicle

07:41.025 --> 07:46.025
can detect contaminants in the recycling stream,

07:46.470 --> 07:48.660
which informs the operator

07:48.660 --> 07:51.060
that, you know, now you have a contaminated load

07:51.060 --> 07:53.747
and don't take it directly to the clean recycle sort plant.

07:53.747 --> 07:55.460
Instead, take it to a sorting facility

07:55.460 --> 07:57.060
so that it can be cleaned up.

07:57.060 --> 08:00.063
And that brings value to the customer.

08:00.930 --> 08:03.780
And then also there's some technology

08:03.780 --> 08:07.260
that was born in the motorsports world,

08:07.260 --> 08:11.940
where Corvette Racing had a rear-facing radar on camera,

08:11.940 --> 08:14.970
be able to de determine the trajectory of vehicles

08:14.970 --> 08:17.409
that were overcoming it in racing.

08:17.409 --> 08:21.322
Our fire emergency business unit is using that

08:21.322 --> 08:25.387
to alert roadside emergency responders

08:25.387 --> 08:29.730
in the event of an impending collision.

08:29.730 --> 08:30.563
So.

08:31.770 --> 08:33.240
<v ->One of the interesting things, I think,</v>

08:33.240 --> 08:36.240
when we first spoke, 'cause you didn't,

08:36.240 --> 08:37.950
when you're talking about your refuse collector,

08:37.950 --> 08:39.123
for instance,

08:39.123 --> 08:41.610
you didn't say that it was autonomously driven.

08:41.610 --> 08:45.388
So this idea of autonomy and automation,

08:45.388 --> 08:48.210
or how do those come together?

08:48.210 --> 08:50.700
Because there's a lot of things that happen

08:50.700 --> 08:52.350
when you're picking up garbage

08:52.350 --> 08:53.940
that don't have to do with driving,

08:53.940 --> 08:57.390
and yet automation and AI

08:57.390 --> 09:00.720
is helping make that task more efficient, safer.

09:00.720 --> 09:01.650
<v ->That's absolutely true.</v>

09:01.650 --> 09:03.840
So there's, you know, it takes a skilled operator

09:03.840 --> 09:07.655
to do that, particularly the curbside collection.

09:07.655 --> 09:10.690
Certainly, we're looking into eventually

09:10.690 --> 09:14.070
having sort of a self-driving,

09:14.070 --> 09:16.200
where the vehicle can collect,

09:16.200 --> 09:18.240
drives itself to from can to can,

09:18.240 --> 09:19.445
and those types of things.

09:19.445 --> 09:20.940
<v ->But it's not necessarily the most important thing.</v>

09:20.940 --> 09:21.773
<v ->Exactly.</v>

09:21.773 --> 09:23.430
Right now, it's make it more efficient

09:23.430 --> 09:25.260
for the operator in their day-to-day lives.

09:25.260 --> 09:28.062
They do this thousands of times a day, so.

09:28.062 --> 09:29.564
<v ->That's the dull part.</v>

09:29.564 --> 09:30.640
<v ->That's the dull part. Exactly.</v>

09:30.640 --> 09:34.890
And, you know, so an electric side-loading arm

09:34.890 --> 09:36.510
is a few seconds faster than that.

09:36.510 --> 09:38.430
And over the course of a day that,

09:38.430 --> 09:40.353
that makes up for about 45 minutes.

09:41.880 --> 09:45.630
<v ->Don, when we spoke, you mentioned that you think</v>

09:45.630 --> 09:49.493
that autonomy is at an inflection point that's driven by AI,

09:49.493 --> 09:52.440
especially in unstructured environments.

09:52.440 --> 09:54.890
This is really what we're all talking about here.

09:56.340 --> 09:59.160
Tell us about this inflection point, why now?

09:59.160 --> 10:02.190
<v ->Well, when you look at the results out there,</v>

10:02.190 --> 10:04.830
I've been in the self-driving industry for over 15 years.

10:04.830 --> 10:08.370
It's been a very long, slow, arduous process.

10:08.370 --> 10:10.890
I'm sure most of you are aware of the history

10:10.890 --> 10:11.970
and all the promises.

10:11.970 --> 10:14.010
And, you know, it's here, it's gonna be next year,

10:14.010 --> 10:15.450
it's gonna be next year, it's gonna be next year.

10:15.450 --> 10:18.840
And it feels like it really never came, until now.

10:18.840 --> 10:20.940
And it's finally, it's finally here.

10:20.940 --> 10:24.960
There's many examples of self-driving vehicles

10:24.960 --> 10:26.190
that are out there in the wild.

10:26.190 --> 10:27.690
I think Waymo is the most prominent.

10:27.690 --> 10:29.370
Most of you are probably familiar with that.

10:29.370 --> 10:32.400
Hopefully, many of you have actually had an opportunity

10:32.400 --> 10:33.600
to ride in a Waymo.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.940
Even though it's not my company, I'm a strong advocate

10:35.940 --> 10:38.010
for the great things that they're doing for the industry.

10:38.010 --> 10:39.780
It truly is an amazing experience,

10:39.780 --> 10:41.580
and everyone should go experience it

10:41.580 --> 10:45.000
because I truly believe it is a life-changing experience.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.610
And once you have that, you really see the path.

10:47.610 --> 10:48.870
But that's just one example.

10:48.870 --> 10:50.494
And as Ed mentioned in the beginning,

10:50.494 --> 10:52.835
we're not necessarily here to focus on Robotaxi.

10:52.835 --> 10:55.350
There's so many other use cases,

10:55.350 --> 10:57.150
particularly in the commercial space,

10:57.150 --> 10:59.820
but also in the military space, in refuse, in vocational,

10:59.820 --> 11:03.420
there's all of these opportunities to automate mobility.

11:03.420 --> 11:05.100
And the interesting thing for me

11:05.100 --> 11:06.634
having seen the trajectory of technology

11:06.634 --> 11:08.580
over the last 15 years

11:08.580 --> 11:10.980
is that in the last two to three years,

11:10.980 --> 11:13.890
we've seen an explosion in capability,

11:13.890 --> 11:16.837
particularly generalizable AI.

11:16.837 --> 11:21.600
And rather than really specific niche use cases,

11:21.600 --> 11:24.240
we've seen the technology kind of proliferate

11:24.240 --> 11:25.680
into general use cases,

11:25.680 --> 11:28.470
which has allowed us to take it into off-road

11:28.470 --> 11:31.170
and unstructured environments, like Ed mentioned.

11:31.170 --> 11:32.640
To give you an example of that,

11:32.640 --> 11:34.770
we have, Kodiak has driverless vehicles

11:34.770 --> 11:36.390
that are out operating today.

11:36.390 --> 11:38.370
These are Class 8 semi trucks,

11:38.370 --> 11:40.080
and they're operating out in a place

11:40.080 --> 11:42.529
called the Permian Basin in west Texas.

11:42.529 --> 11:45.690
This is the oil and gas fields of Texas.

11:45.690 --> 11:48.240
If you've ever been there, it's incredibly remote,

11:48.240 --> 11:50.850
there's not much around, but there are road networks.

11:50.850 --> 11:52.200
And they're mostly on dirt roads.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.494
So you get a lot of unstructured environments.

11:54.494 --> 11:56.010
It's not really an area

11:56.010 --> 11:57.870
that's conducive to mapping technology.

11:57.870 --> 11:59.970
You can't really go out and map it ahead of time

11:59.970 --> 12:02.103
because the sand is shifting, the dirt is shifting,

12:02.103 --> 12:04.560
the roads are shifting by the minute.

12:04.560 --> 12:06.120
So everything's always changing.

12:06.120 --> 12:09.211
And it requires a very generalizable AI system

12:09.211 --> 12:12.150
to be able to understand the world,

12:12.150 --> 12:13.860
make sense of the road boundaries,

12:13.860 --> 12:15.570
make sense of the drivable corridors,

12:15.570 --> 12:18.600
detect other dynamic vehicles in the vicinity.

12:18.600 --> 12:21.240
So it's not mining, meaning it's not an enclosed area.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.460
These are road networks where you have oncoming traffic

12:23.460 --> 12:27.062
and pedestrians and, you know, crossing ways

12:27.062 --> 12:30.483
and other kind of complex maneuvers.

12:30.483 --> 12:33.228
But with the advent of VLMs

12:33.228 --> 12:36.090
and all of the transformer AI technology we've had,

12:36.090 --> 12:36.923
we've been able,

12:36.923 --> 12:40.320
the industry has been able to really push the limits

12:40.320 --> 12:42.750
of what we previously thought was possible.

12:42.750 --> 12:45.840
And now you're finally starting to see these deployments.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.210
And so I think it's only going to accelerate.

12:48.210 --> 12:50.460
That's why I talk about 2025

12:50.460 --> 12:53.010
really being the inflection point of autonomy.

12:53.010 --> 12:55.710
It's no longer about, "Don't worry, trust us, it's coming."

12:55.710 --> 12:57.780
Although some companies continue to, you know,

12:57.780 --> 13:01.380
say that year after year, but there are concrete examples

13:01.380 --> 13:04.050
of this technology out there,

13:04.050 --> 13:06.900
providing useful value to companies today.

13:06.900 --> 13:08.378
And 2025, 2026,

13:08.378 --> 13:11.190
you're gonna see a massive amount of scaling.

13:11.190 --> 13:13.740
And now it's really about the operational efficiency

13:13.740 --> 13:18.210
and other less R&amp;D, less technology-driven,

13:18.210 --> 13:21.290
or less technology-related challenges

13:21.290 --> 13:23.160
that still face the industry.

13:23.160 --> 13:26.070
But I think it's a very exciting time

13:26.070 --> 13:28.923
to be in self-driving and to be in automation in general.

13:30.150 --> 13:33.630
<v ->You know, every industry has its characteristics,</v>

13:33.630 --> 13:35.070
its personality.

13:35.070 --> 13:37.950
And let's take trucking, truck for instance.

13:37.950 --> 13:41.700
I was fortunate to get to see your truck a few days ago.

13:41.700 --> 13:43.110
And the trucking industry

13:43.110 --> 13:45.960
could probably be described as conservative.

13:45.960 --> 13:47.610
They're not gonna be at the forefront.

13:47.610 --> 13:48.990
<v ->Trucks are conservative.</v>

13:48.990 --> 13:53.990
<v ->So when you're designing an autonomous,</v>

13:54.240 --> 13:56.310
let's say I want to tackle

13:56.310 --> 13:58.110
this autonomous trucking application.

13:58.110 --> 14:00.480
Certainly, there's the AI, there's the sensors,

14:00.480 --> 14:02.220
there's the planning, the perception,

14:02.220 --> 14:04.320
but then there's also the mechanical aspects

14:04.320 --> 14:07.800
and the ability to develop trust with your customer.

14:07.800 --> 14:08.633
<v ->Yes.</v>

14:08.633 --> 14:10.800
<v ->That's what impressed me the most about your truck</v>

14:10.800 --> 14:12.810
is you can take, if I'm a fleet owner,

14:12.810 --> 14:15.450
you can come in with the right partners

14:15.450 --> 14:18.030
and actually make that truck autonomous.

14:18.030 --> 14:19.395
<v ->Yeah, that's right.</v>

14:19.395 --> 14:22.140
So we've developed a platform-agnostic solution.

14:22.140 --> 14:24.810
It's not tied to any one specific make or model,

14:24.810 --> 14:27.510
which is really important in the commercial trucking space

14:27.510 --> 14:30.360
because most companies use many different makes and models

14:30.360 --> 14:31.193
of their vehicles.

14:31.193 --> 14:33.810
So we wanna make sure we're not tied to a specific one.

14:33.810 --> 14:38.370
We wanna create hardware and sensors that are universal

14:38.370 --> 14:41.190
so they can be put onto any vehicle that comes around.

14:41.190 --> 14:42.450
And we wanna make the maintenance

14:42.450 --> 14:44.970
and installation process dumb and easy, right?

14:44.970 --> 14:47.610
They don't want to have to deal with anything sophisticated.

14:47.610 --> 14:49.260
They just want the technology to work.

14:49.260 --> 14:51.990
And it all comes down to exactly as you said, Ed, trust.

14:51.990 --> 14:54.510
And it's taken a lot of time to build that trust.

14:54.510 --> 14:57.223
We've been working at this for seven years at Kodiak

14:57.223 --> 15:00.780
and many more years be before Kodiak.

15:00.780 --> 15:03.840
And we've, I feel like we finally cracked the code, right?

15:03.840 --> 15:05.400
When you talk to trucking companies,

15:05.400 --> 15:07.140
they believe this technology is real.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.733
They believe that...

15:08.733 --> 15:10.890
They see the benefits to their businesses

15:10.890 --> 15:12.582
and they're really starting to trust

15:12.582 --> 15:15.060
that this technology is gonna be transformative.

15:15.060 --> 15:19.020
But it was a long road, no pun intended, to get here,

15:19.020 --> 15:20.253
but we're finally there.

15:21.930 --> 15:24.390
<v ->Carolina, Volvo Construction Equipment,</v>

15:24.390 --> 15:25.800
and I'm gonna read from this,

15:25.800 --> 15:29.620
wide range of machinery, excavators, wheel loaders,

15:29.620 --> 15:32.640
mining haulers, compactors,

15:32.640 --> 15:37.530
pipe layers that operate in all over the world.

15:37.530 --> 15:40.710
And certainly in Asia, the rules are probably different,

15:40.710 --> 15:42.450
the regulations are different than they are in Europe

15:42.450 --> 15:43.283
or the United States,

15:43.283 --> 15:45.676
but maybe in the northeast corner Colorado,

15:45.676 --> 15:48.990
there are different rules there is in the southwest corner,

15:48.990 --> 15:50.190
who knows what?

15:50.190 --> 15:55.190
How does AI help you in not just the operation

15:56.760 --> 15:59.700
of these kinds of machines, but the engineering,

15:59.700 --> 16:02.387
the operation, and then maintaining them and improving them?

16:02.387 --> 16:06.660
'Cause AI applies all across these diverse

16:06.660 --> 16:09.270
and challenging applications I would imagine.

16:09.270 --> 16:12.612
<v ->We do have a very big palette of operations</v>

16:12.612 --> 16:14.670
in Volvo Construction Equipment.

16:14.670 --> 16:19.670
And it's to the point we do have a very different customers.

16:20.250 --> 16:21.720
They work in different segments,

16:21.720 --> 16:24.450
their businesses are extremely complex,

16:24.450 --> 16:26.520
and they're very, very different.

16:26.520 --> 16:30.000
If we think about, it's extremely different

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
to extract materials on a quarry, to construct a road,

16:36.180 --> 16:37.680
to build a playground.

16:37.680 --> 16:40.560
The landscapes, the challenges,

16:40.560 --> 16:43.710
the purpose of our customers are extremely different.

16:43.710 --> 16:45.247
And on top of that,

16:45.247 --> 16:48.150
we need to understand that these environments

16:48.150 --> 16:49.650
are extremely dynamic.

16:49.650 --> 16:50.880
They change.

16:50.880 --> 16:54.225
And even though the site managers

16:54.225 --> 16:58.680
plan them as good as they can, things move along the way.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.780
It's always changing.

17:00.780 --> 17:02.190
And on top of that,

17:02.190 --> 17:06.843
before we com in into regulations and how AI help us,

17:07.770 --> 17:12.750
the environment needs our products to be robust.

17:12.750 --> 17:15.570
And the durability is actually important for us

17:15.570 --> 17:18.633
because we have, we are working in very rough conditions.

17:19.680 --> 17:23.760
Good for us, we have AI supporting us already.

17:23.760 --> 17:25.680
We do have, for instance, connected map.

17:25.680 --> 17:29.513
We have 170,000 connected machines.

17:29.513 --> 17:33.150
And there, we extract the data for the machines.

17:33.150 --> 17:34.800
We're learning how they work,

17:34.800 --> 17:37.110
we are learning how they're operating.

17:37.110 --> 17:40.860
And by that, we are supporting our customers

17:40.860 --> 17:43.680
to take wiser decisions when it comes to productivity.

17:43.680 --> 17:47.700
And it's also supporting us, to your point and question,

17:47.700 --> 17:49.386
to get a better understanding of our products,

17:49.386 --> 17:50.670
to keep learning.

17:50.670 --> 17:53.610
We are a company with a very long history

17:53.610 --> 17:55.050
in production machinery.

17:55.050 --> 17:55.883
But nevertheless,

17:55.883 --> 18:00.180
we want our products to be the best our customer can have.

18:00.180 --> 18:03.630
And so that's, for instance, AI is supporting us very much

18:03.630 --> 18:05.830
with a predictive maintenance as an example.

18:07.260 --> 18:10.620
Then, when it comes to autonomy

18:10.620 --> 18:13.233
and how the machines will look like,

18:14.220 --> 18:17.940
we do have different challenges than the, let's say,

18:17.940 --> 18:19.740
car industry, for instance,

18:19.740 --> 18:20.670
because of course,

18:20.670 --> 18:24.270
mobility is something that is very interesting for us.

18:24.270 --> 18:28.560
And we could understand that in some of our systems

18:28.560 --> 18:33.560
where we have confined areas with the safety standards,

18:33.693 --> 18:38.040
it can be easier for us to move into autonomous solutions.

18:38.040 --> 18:40.710
But nevertheless, we do have also segments

18:40.710 --> 18:43.230
where there's other equipment,

18:43.230 --> 18:46.470
there is people moving around, and it's very tough.

18:46.470 --> 18:49.962
So it takes a bit more time for us to get there.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.380
Just to give some examples, if we think about,

18:52.380 --> 18:54.990
you said before, we have wheel loaders, we have excavators,

18:54.990 --> 18:56.610
we have numbers.

18:56.610 --> 19:00.600
Place yourself, picturing your mind a large excavator.

19:00.600 --> 19:01.440
Most of the times,

19:01.440 --> 19:03.720
I mean, they are pretty much at the same spot.

19:03.720 --> 19:05.341
They don't really move.

19:05.341 --> 19:07.740
So in this equipment,

19:07.740 --> 19:10.530
the moving is perhaps not the most of the difficult things

19:10.530 --> 19:13.140
for us to do, automotivewise,

19:13.140 --> 19:14.790
but we need to understand

19:14.790 --> 19:16.740
that our products are doing a process.

19:16.740 --> 19:18.690
They're used to do something.

19:18.690 --> 19:22.468
So is the mobility of the boom and the arm

19:22.468 --> 19:24.660
that is perhaps more interesting.

19:24.660 --> 19:26.430
Our machines, they do several different things.

19:26.430 --> 19:31.430
An excavator can drill, can trench.

19:31.770 --> 19:33.410
So we really need to get an understanding

19:33.410 --> 19:35.430
of how the process is working

19:35.430 --> 19:37.290
and also how the attachment will go.

19:37.290 --> 19:40.560
How does it swing? How does it tilt?

19:40.560 --> 19:43.710
So for us, to do the automation in these machines

19:43.710 --> 19:47.850
is all about knowing our customers and knowing our products

19:47.850 --> 19:50.850
and understanding how they work in different environments.

19:50.850 --> 19:52.760
Coming into, when we spoke last time,

19:52.760 --> 19:55.257
if you remember, you were extremely interested

19:55.257 --> 19:57.480
in the LX03,

19:57.480 --> 20:00.570
which is the autonomous electric wheel loader we have.

20:00.570 --> 20:02.250
Volvo Group had a keynote yesterday,

20:02.250 --> 20:05.670
and our CTO, Lars Stenqvist, talk about it a little bit,

20:05.670 --> 20:09.486
and it's one of my favorite projects, if I have to say,

20:09.486 --> 20:13.080
'cause it's my guys in my department working with that one.

20:13.080 --> 20:18.080
And this is bringing the technologies that we see right now

20:19.140 --> 20:22.080
and innovation to the next level.

20:22.080 --> 20:24.187
What we did with this was to really say,

20:24.187 --> 20:26.160
"Okay, we know how the wheel loader works

20:26.160 --> 20:27.660
because we know our customers.

20:28.830 --> 20:31.200
However, how is it gonna be?

20:31.200 --> 20:33.630
How is it going to work in the future?"

20:33.630 --> 20:37.170
And not just on the autonomy, on the software side.

20:37.170 --> 20:39.300
I mean, do we really need a cab?

20:39.300 --> 20:40.740
We need to think how our products

20:40.740 --> 20:42.510
are gonna be in a different way.

20:42.510 --> 20:46.423
So luckily for us, we do have a very, very good relationship

20:46.423 --> 20:48.870
and partnership with LEGO Technic.

20:48.870 --> 20:51.060
So we approached those clever guys in Denmark

20:51.060 --> 20:52.470
and we put a question.

20:52.470 --> 20:55.054
And we really jumped directly together.

20:55.054 --> 20:56.760
We did the sketches.

20:56.760 --> 21:00.283
And on top of that, we did have,

21:00.283 --> 21:03.390
when we do partnerships where we have a reference group

21:03.390 --> 21:06.120
just to see that we're going in the good direction.

21:06.120 --> 21:07.260
And this time,

21:07.260 --> 21:08.970
at least for the very first time for us

21:08.970 --> 21:10.410
in Volvo Construction Equipment,

21:10.410 --> 21:11.820
we had children with us.

21:11.820 --> 21:13.680
And that was super great.

21:13.680 --> 21:16.170
I mean it's fantastic to work with kids

21:16.170 --> 21:17.970
because the sky's the limits.

21:17.970 --> 21:21.897
They have no boundaries when we think.

21:21.897 --> 21:25.378
And that's where the concept of the LX03 came out.

21:25.378 --> 21:28.440
This machine is of course following Volvo Group's,

21:28.440 --> 21:30.150
and by that Volvo Construction Equipment's

21:30.150 --> 21:31.440
sustainable commitments,

21:31.440 --> 21:35.670
we want all our products to be electrified

21:35.670 --> 21:37.200
and sustainable for 2040.

21:37.200 --> 21:38.310
That's our target.

21:38.310 --> 21:41.700
So this particular machine, it's a five ton,

21:41.700 --> 21:44.400
and it's fully electric, it's autonomous.

21:44.400 --> 21:46.140
And what we are doing with it

21:46.140 --> 21:50.250
is that we based component wise on the L25 Electric

21:50.250 --> 21:51.083
that we have right now.

21:51.083 --> 21:53.586
So just to make sure that, okay,

21:53.586 --> 21:56.220
how is going to be autonomous and electric at the same time?

21:56.220 --> 21:57.960
So this is a prototype.

21:57.960 --> 21:58.800
Of course, it's something

21:58.800 --> 22:00.630
that we are not commercializing right now.

22:00.630 --> 22:02.190
That is why the machine is green.

22:02.190 --> 22:04.110
But it's supporting us to understand,

22:04.110 --> 22:08.640
okay, how is the machine going to to be,

22:08.640 --> 22:11.400
how does it interact with other prototypes

22:11.400 --> 22:13.140
and other concepts that we have?

22:13.140 --> 22:15.660
How is the system going to work?

22:15.660 --> 22:18.300
Because in the end, our machines,

22:18.300 --> 22:20.280
and I guess everybody here agrees with me,

22:20.280 --> 22:21.990
they do not work on their own.

22:21.990 --> 22:23.880
I don't have an excavator and I do my thing.

22:23.880 --> 22:25.710
I need a damper, I need a truck.

22:25.710 --> 22:27.600
So it's all about the process.

22:27.600 --> 22:31.050
So it's really the moment right now

22:31.050 --> 22:33.720
to understand how this collaborative environment

22:33.720 --> 22:34.553
is going to be,

22:34.553 --> 22:36.240
how the machine-machine interaction,

22:36.240 --> 22:38.880
how the machine-human interaction is going to be.

22:38.880 --> 22:43.800
And we want these machines to be intelligent autonomous.

22:43.800 --> 22:47.670
This is going to help our customer to have a safer,

22:47.670 --> 22:50.550
more productive, and of course, sustainable environment.

22:50.550 --> 22:55.550
But it is right now that's coming to the moment

22:56.370 --> 22:59.280
that we see that right now is when AI is really coming.

22:59.280 --> 23:01.590
We see that we are getting the,

23:01.590 --> 23:03.600
I mean with the knowledge has been there for many years,

23:03.600 --> 23:05.250
but we see that it's really coming right now

23:05.250 --> 23:06.300
in construction.

23:06.300 --> 23:07.925
At Volvo Group,

23:07.925 --> 23:11.700
we are really wanting to have trustworthy systems.

23:11.700 --> 23:12.900
It's very important for us

23:12.900 --> 23:15.270
that we develop our AR systems in the right way.

23:15.270 --> 23:18.540
That they're fair, that say we are being secure,

23:18.540 --> 23:19.710
that we are transparent,

23:19.710 --> 23:21.960
that we can actually have a traceability

23:21.960 --> 23:23.550
to make sure that the decisions

23:23.550 --> 23:25.830
that our machines are learning right now,

23:25.830 --> 23:27.300
because we're in a learning phase,

23:27.300 --> 23:29.910
but in some years, when they really come out,

23:29.910 --> 23:31.200
that we really make sure

23:31.200 --> 23:34.362
that we're doing things right from the beginning.

23:34.362 --> 23:37.010
<v ->I wanna talk to you a little bit about that learning.</v>

23:37.010 --> 23:39.663
So I would imagine most of the people in this room

23:39.663 --> 23:42.060
know how to drive or have a driver's license.

23:42.060 --> 23:43.440
And so they say, "Oh, okay,

23:43.440 --> 23:48.440
so they understand what Waymo is, you know,

23:48.570 --> 23:49.710
is trying to do."

23:49.710 --> 23:53.220
So I have tried to run a backhoe before,

23:53.220 --> 23:56.010
and the guy that was running the construction company

23:56.010 --> 23:59.151
that was watching me pulled me out of the seat really fast.

23:59.151 --> 24:00.361
And it's a little tricky.

24:00.361 --> 24:02.970
It's not just knowing how to articulate it,

24:02.970 --> 24:05.940
but you have to look for rocks and this and that.

24:05.940 --> 24:08.520
So how do you...

24:08.520 --> 24:10.410
And, you know, it could be a big rock, a little rock,

24:10.410 --> 24:12.540
who knows what, or a pipe that you don't wanna burst,

24:12.540 --> 24:15.210
whatever it might be, how do you go about.

24:15.210 --> 24:17.040
It seems to me that that's a tougher job

24:17.040 --> 24:18.960
than avoiding the bouncing ball

24:18.960 --> 24:20.492
in front of an autonomous car

24:20.492 --> 24:22.110
that's coming outta the playground

24:22.110 --> 24:23.220
and putting the brakes on.

24:23.220 --> 24:26.280
How do you anticipate all these edge cases

24:26.280 --> 24:27.360
and deal with them?

24:27.360 --> 24:30.090
<v ->It's all about the learnings.</v>

24:30.090 --> 24:32.790
I mean, luckily, we have been a corporate,

24:32.790 --> 24:36.750
I mean, we have been cooperating with our customers

24:36.750 --> 24:37.890
for many, many years,

24:37.890 --> 24:40.950
and they really know how their ecosystems work.

24:40.950 --> 24:44.340
Even though if we talk about a quarry

24:44.340 --> 24:46.140
and we know that there's no two quarries

24:46.140 --> 24:49.170
from the same customer that look like the same,

24:49.170 --> 24:50.580
they know their business.

24:50.580 --> 24:53.610
So for us, it's really, collaboration is the key,

24:53.610 --> 24:54.540
the partnership.

24:54.540 --> 24:58.110
We're doing this co-creation together with them

24:58.110 --> 25:00.990
because by getting an understanding

25:00.990 --> 25:03.540
of putting these machines in a safety environment

25:03.540 --> 25:06.420
in the field to really try,

25:06.420 --> 25:08.270
that's when really the magic happens.

25:09.600 --> 25:12.210
<v ->Benjamin, you had a long career at Apple</v>

25:12.210 --> 25:13.950
in the special projects group,

25:13.950 --> 25:18.450
then you went on to work in satellites.

25:18.450 --> 25:21.240
So the question for you is,

25:21.240 --> 25:25.140
how does what you learned in those applications,

25:25.140 --> 25:28.375
'cause they don't seem to be like a wheel loader

25:28.375 --> 25:31.740
or an off-road truck or garbage collector.

25:31.740 --> 25:33.630
How did what you learned there

25:33.630 --> 25:38.070
provide a foundation that can be applied

25:38.070 --> 25:41.635
to these commercial off-road construction

25:41.635 --> 25:44.400
and type applications?

25:44.400 --> 25:45.690
<v ->Well, it's a good question.</v>

25:45.690 --> 25:47.400
I would start with the thing

25:47.400 --> 25:50.100
that actually every one of our panelists said here today,

25:50.100 --> 25:53.220
which is they really deeply understand their customer.

25:53.220 --> 25:54.450
And at the end of the day,

25:54.450 --> 25:57.960
all of the technology that they're employing

25:57.960 --> 25:59.610
is really to a single goal,

25:59.610 --> 26:02.970
and that is to deliver a great experience

26:02.970 --> 26:04.320
for their customer.

26:04.320 --> 26:06.977
And their customers have different goals,

26:06.977 --> 26:09.210
but they're using the technologies

26:09.210 --> 26:12.390
all to deliver a very high-class solution

26:12.390 --> 26:13.290
to their customers.

26:13.290 --> 26:16.470
And that's something I think that is really universal

26:16.470 --> 26:18.780
in great technology companies.

26:18.780 --> 26:20.460
So I would start there.

26:20.460 --> 26:22.350
The other thing that I would talk about

26:22.350 --> 26:24.060
is there's a big change

26:24.060 --> 26:26.520
that we've all been kind of describing,

26:26.520 --> 26:31.230
which is old school AI was very rule-based,

26:31.230 --> 26:34.050
where you would do a lot of data collection

26:34.050 --> 26:37.530
and you would learn in your particular application,

26:37.530 --> 26:39.870
if this happens, then do that,

26:39.870 --> 26:42.090
which we call rules-based.

26:42.090 --> 26:45.360
And the problem with that is, is that the automation,

26:45.360 --> 26:49.710
be it automated networking, be it an automated loader,

26:49.710 --> 26:51.060
be it an autonomous car

26:51.060 --> 26:53.490
or an autonomous rocket going to space

26:53.490 --> 26:56.220
or a satellite moving around in space,

26:56.220 --> 27:00.090
you don't deal with new situations very well that way

27:00.090 --> 27:01.440
because you look through your list

27:01.440 --> 27:03.510
of everything you learned from the past.

27:03.510 --> 27:06.090
And if you don't find it on the list, what do you do?

27:06.090 --> 27:09.330
You wait for more data and then you try again.

27:09.330 --> 27:11.700
The new school of AI

27:11.700 --> 27:16.110
is all about an end-to-end machine learned approach,

27:16.110 --> 27:17.430
which is actually the way humans work.

27:17.430 --> 27:20.340
We learn and we get this generalized intelligence

27:20.340 --> 27:22.170
that the panelists have been talking about.

27:22.170 --> 27:25.380
And because of that end-to-end learned approach,

27:25.380 --> 27:30.380
you're able to handle new situations really, really well.

27:31.080 --> 27:34.830
And that difference is why the world of AI today

27:34.830 --> 27:38.253
is fundamentally different than a year or two years ago.

27:40.050 --> 27:41.970
<v ->When we spoke earlier this week,</v>

27:41.970 --> 27:46.500
you talked about the concept of big AI and small AI

27:46.500 --> 27:48.570
and how that really applies to these types.

27:48.570 --> 27:52.050
Maybe you could explain that, what you really mean by that.

27:52.050 --> 27:52.920
<v ->Sure.</v>

27:52.920 --> 27:54.900
And it actually, again, it ties very much

27:54.900 --> 27:56.640
to all of our solutions.

27:56.640 --> 27:59.400
When you hear about large language models

27:59.400 --> 28:01.735
being used to create a beautiful movie or a new graphic

28:01.735 --> 28:05.584
or solve some very difficult mathematical problem,

28:05.584 --> 28:08.340
that's all running on a data center.

28:08.340 --> 28:09.840
And in that data center,

28:09.840 --> 28:14.430
there's many, many thousands of pieces of compute,

28:14.430 --> 28:17.580
and that's tied to usually to a power station.

28:17.580 --> 28:20.520
And so you're consuming a tremendous amount of power.

28:20.520 --> 28:22.590
But when you're out in the middle of the nowhere,

28:22.590 --> 28:25.800
in the middle of nowhere or you're on a smart device

28:25.800 --> 28:27.900
or you're on a vehicle of some sort,

28:27.900 --> 28:30.090
you're limited by the amount of energy

28:30.090 --> 28:32.575
that can be provided by the battery

28:32.575 --> 28:35.130
or by the combustion engine

28:35.130 --> 28:38.610
or by solar, if you're in space, that you can get.

28:38.610 --> 28:43.610
And so the magic of actually bringing AI to market

28:43.650 --> 28:46.470
is the ability not only to run the big stuff

28:46.470 --> 28:49.290
in the public cloud on a data center,

28:49.290 --> 28:50.310
but then to turn around

28:50.310 --> 28:54.690
and be able to write super, super optimized algorithms

28:54.690 --> 28:58.260
that can run on a cheap little chip inside,

28:58.260 --> 29:01.950
maybe even inside the sensor like a radar or a camera

29:01.950 --> 29:04.380
on an excavator or on a car

29:04.380 --> 29:07.680
and have it provide the value that it needs to provide.

29:07.680 --> 29:10.140
So you have to be able to go from really, really small

29:10.140 --> 29:14.100
to really, really big, and that requires optimization.

29:14.100 --> 29:16.020
And so all of the panelists,

29:16.020 --> 29:17.700
well, one of the things we deal with

29:17.700 --> 29:19.710
and have to build the capability for,

29:19.710 --> 29:21.510
what we call an AI factory,

29:21.510 --> 29:24.900
is the ability to take what might be great academically

29:24.900 --> 29:26.310
and can run in a cloud

29:26.310 --> 29:29.137
and optimize it to really perform at low power

29:29.137 --> 29:30.873
on a small footprint.

29:32.610 --> 29:36.510
<v ->I mentioned early on that a lot of these applications</v>

29:36.510 --> 29:38.640
are dull, dirty, or dangerous.

29:38.640 --> 29:41.951
And so for a second, I wanna focus on the dirty part,

29:41.951 --> 29:43.620
and I'll tell you why.

29:43.620 --> 29:45.150
I was involved in a project,

29:45.150 --> 29:48.000
where we were trying to get rally cars

29:48.000 --> 29:49.590
using autonomous technologies,

29:49.590 --> 29:51.210
lidars, radars, cameras,

29:51.210 --> 29:52.740
whatever it might to detect spectators.

29:52.740 --> 29:54.210
And if anybody knows about rally,

29:54.210 --> 29:57.480
there is dust and dirt all over the place.

29:57.480 --> 30:00.540
In the end, we ended up focusing just on radar

30:00.540 --> 30:02.400
'cause it was the only one that would really work.

30:02.400 --> 30:06.701
So maybe could you give an example,

30:06.701 --> 30:10.740
maybe start with you, John, of how the dirt and the muck

30:10.740 --> 30:12.600
and all this that it's all over the place

30:12.600 --> 30:13.433
in these applications.

30:13.433 --> 30:15.090
How does that change fundamentally?

30:15.090 --> 30:18.690
What's at the base here, the sensors, the perception?

30:18.690 --> 30:22.888
<v ->Yeah, dust, airborne obscurations are obviously an issue,</v>

30:22.888 --> 30:26.970
and, you know, one way of dealing with them

30:26.970 --> 30:29.850
is multimodal perceptions.

30:29.850 --> 30:32.460
So, like you said, radar can see through it.

30:32.460 --> 30:34.770
Lidar sometimes can, sometimes can't.

30:34.770 --> 30:36.254
All dust is different.

30:36.254 --> 30:38.673
But again, by training models,

30:38.673 --> 30:41.715
you can do get to the point

30:41.715 --> 30:44.670
where if you can see the ground in front of you

30:44.670 --> 30:47.550
and you know that you're dealing with heavy obscures,

30:47.550 --> 30:49.560
you can limit your speed just like you do,

30:49.560 --> 30:51.360
just like you and I do in a dusty situation.

30:51.360 --> 30:54.350
We slow down until we can, you know, see the stuff.

30:54.350 --> 30:55.183
<v ->It's not just the sensor,</v>

30:55.183 --> 30:57.390
just the whole programming, how it all works together.

30:57.390 --> 30:58.680
<v ->It'd be wonderful if we had a sensor</v>

30:58.680 --> 31:00.480
that could see through clearly.

31:00.480 --> 31:02.880
<v ->But it's exactly what a human driver would do.</v>

31:02.880 --> 31:05.250
Getting, oh, all of a sudden the rain's super strong,

31:05.250 --> 31:07.072
you slow down a little bit till it goes away.

31:07.072 --> 31:08.640
That kind of thing.

31:08.640 --> 31:09.903
<v ->Yeah, exactly. Yep.</v>

31:11.220 --> 31:12.480
<v ->Any-</v>
<v ->One way of doing it.</v>

31:12.480 --> 31:13.590
<v ->Anyone else?</v>

31:13.590 --> 31:17.550
Sure, I mean I completely agree with what was just said.

31:17.550 --> 31:19.350
The other consideration you have to think about

31:19.350 --> 31:21.300
is in the cleaning of the sensors, right?

31:21.300 --> 31:22.800
So if you're throwing muck and dirt

31:22.800 --> 31:26.340
and debris up into the vehicle that you're riding,

31:26.340 --> 31:28.020
particularly in a rally car situation,

31:28.020 --> 31:29.040
I've never driven rally car,

31:29.040 --> 31:32.280
but I'm vaguely familiar with it, then sensor cleaning

31:32.280 --> 31:33.840
becomes an important piece of that, right?

31:33.840 --> 31:37.711
Having a forced air and kind of fluid or wiping

31:37.711 --> 31:40.050
or something like that, designing those systems

31:40.050 --> 31:42.090
becomes a critical piece of your safety story.

31:42.090 --> 31:43.860
If this is a driverless vehicle

31:43.860 --> 31:46.336
that is in a safety critical environment,

31:46.336 --> 31:49.110
which most of these driverless vehicles will be,

31:49.110 --> 31:52.140
then that becomes a critical piece of your safety story.

31:52.140 --> 31:54.600
The other thing, and I think this really illustrates

31:54.600 --> 31:56.880
the importance of multimodal sensing.

31:56.880 --> 31:58.800
And there's a lot of different schools of thought out there.

31:58.800 --> 32:00.300
And depending on who you listen to,

32:00.300 --> 32:01.380
who's on stage at the moment,

32:01.380 --> 32:03.000
they might tell you that cameras are the best

32:03.000 --> 32:04.980
or that lidar is the best or whatever.

32:04.980 --> 32:06.030
But the truth of the matter

32:06.030 --> 32:07.440
is that these different modalities

32:07.440 --> 32:09.390
have different strengths and weaknesses.

32:09.390 --> 32:10.980
And in particular, as John mentioned,

32:10.980 --> 32:12.900
radar sees right through all of it.

32:12.900 --> 32:15.000
So it can be a very, very powerful sensor

32:15.000 --> 32:18.240
when you have dust or rain or dirt or snow

32:18.240 --> 32:19.530
or any of those kinds of things.

32:19.530 --> 32:21.000
And then the camera,

32:21.000 --> 32:22.770
the camera can really work with lidar

32:22.770 --> 32:24.780
even in an obscured situation

32:24.780 --> 32:27.180
to identify and classify what you're looking at.

32:27.180 --> 32:29.857
And then by classifying it, your AI algorithm can then say,

32:29.857 --> 32:31.650
"I'm gonna reject this or not."

32:31.650 --> 32:34.230
And it's really hard to do that just with lidar,

32:34.230 --> 32:36.150
and it's sometimes very difficult to do that

32:36.150 --> 32:37.140
just with camera.

32:37.140 --> 32:40.080
And I think this really gets to the argument

32:40.080 --> 32:44.790
of why so many companies developing this technology

32:44.790 --> 32:46.740
rely on and spend so much time

32:46.740 --> 32:48.780
optimizing multimodal solutions

32:48.780 --> 32:50.613
because those multimodal solutions

32:50.613 --> 32:54.448
can really help when shits the fan,

32:54.448 --> 32:56.668
figuratively and literally sometimes, but.

32:56.668 --> 32:59.280
(John laughs)

32:59.280 --> 33:01.530
<v ->I can know more than I agree with what you say.</v>

33:01.530 --> 33:05.250
I mean, what we see is that there is no perfect sensor

33:05.250 --> 33:07.380
for such a critical problem for us.

33:07.380 --> 33:10.020
So of course, I mean it has to do a lot of with exploration,

33:10.020 --> 33:11.370
with trial and error.

33:11.370 --> 33:12.810
Again, partnerships.

33:12.810 --> 33:15.060
There is many, many good companies

33:15.060 --> 33:18.011
having very good components that we are trying.

33:18.011 --> 33:19.830
By having this,

33:19.830 --> 33:22.230
right now, it's a great opportunity to have the dialogue

33:22.230 --> 33:23.848
to really put on the table the requirements

33:23.848 --> 33:26.250
and the challenges that we have

33:26.250 --> 33:28.650
with the companies developing these components

33:28.650 --> 33:32.189
because we are helping them to help us.

33:32.189 --> 33:36.696
So it's a very great way to bring up into what's the,

33:36.696 --> 33:38.880
perhaps the first solution will not be,

33:38.880 --> 33:40.480
but then later on in the future.

33:42.883 --> 33:44.820
<v ->Now that we're talking about sensors,</v>

33:44.820 --> 33:47.310
keeping 'em clean, you know, keeping that fan

33:47.310 --> 33:49.556
doing what it's supposed to be doing,

33:49.556 --> 33:54.330
are there any other different types of sensors that you use

33:54.330 --> 33:55.830
because these applications are different?

33:55.830 --> 33:59.820
Or is it the standard lidar, radar, camera thing?

33:59.820 --> 34:01.590
Is there a unique thing that you have to do

34:01.590 --> 34:05.220
with these sensors to get these diverse applications

34:05.220 --> 34:07.530
to, you know, do what they have to do

34:07.530 --> 34:09.783
that's different than what you do in a car?

34:12.000 --> 34:13.902
<v ->I can bring it from...</v>

34:13.902 --> 34:15.720
The thing that we have

34:15.720 --> 34:18.480
is that we do have different customers,

34:18.480 --> 34:19.380
as I said in the beginning.

34:19.380 --> 34:21.603
It's very different segments.

34:23.088 --> 34:26.730
And we cannot unfortunately create the perfect solution

34:26.730 --> 34:29.250
for each of the customers or the segments that we have.

34:29.250 --> 34:31.620
So at some point, we need to find the solution

34:31.620 --> 34:34.500
that is best compromised from everybody.

34:34.500 --> 34:37.800
But yes, I mean there's no essence for instance as well

34:37.800 --> 34:39.480
that we are trying to understand

34:39.480 --> 34:42.090
how much they can help us as an example.

34:42.090 --> 34:45.060
So again, there's many, many things

34:45.060 --> 34:47.910
that we can try to utilize to try to find

34:47.910 --> 34:51.270
in a more flexibility way what can be bringing the best

34:51.270 --> 34:53.037
for all the range of products that we have

34:53.037 --> 34:55.570
and all the segments that we operate and not.

34:56.615 --> 34:58.001
<v ->Just one comment to add,</v>

34:58.001 --> 35:00.840
slightly tangential to the actual question,

35:00.840 --> 35:02.790
which is that we generally think of sensors

35:02.790 --> 35:04.470
in terms of their types of performance.

35:04.470 --> 35:05.850
And you think about it in terms of performance,

35:05.850 --> 35:08.370
in your good question was asked in terms of performance.

35:08.370 --> 35:10.980
What I would tell you is that as you go into production,

35:10.980 --> 35:12.480
companies start to care a lot less

35:12.480 --> 35:13.800
about the performance of sensors

35:13.800 --> 35:16.020
and they care a lot more about the reliability of sensors.

35:16.020 --> 35:18.000
And so when we're evaluating different sensors

35:18.000 --> 35:19.170
or different modalities,

35:19.170 --> 35:21.420
the first question is not how performant is it?

35:21.420 --> 35:22.530
The first question is,

35:22.530 --> 35:26.100
if I'm in a truck and I'm bouncing around like this 24/7,

35:26.100 --> 35:27.420
like how often is it gonna break?

35:27.420 --> 35:29.550
And if it breaks every other week, then that's no good

35:29.550 --> 35:31.636
and it doesn't really matter what it offers us.

35:31.636 --> 35:33.210
But to specifically answer your question,

35:33.210 --> 35:35.280
we're also really interested in infrared cameras,

35:35.280 --> 35:36.660
which are technically still cameras,

35:36.660 --> 35:39.030
but they provide a lot of value, especially at night,

35:39.030 --> 35:40.320
if you're gonna do a lot of night driving,

35:40.320 --> 35:42.840
if you're gonna do a lot of unprotected maneuvering,

35:42.840 --> 35:45.360
where you could see a lot of wildlife, we see a lot of cows,

35:45.360 --> 35:46.500
we see a lot of cattle guards,

35:46.500 --> 35:48.960
we see a lot of deer, and other things in our driving,

35:48.960 --> 35:50.970
and infrared definitely helps distinguish

35:50.970 --> 35:55.203
what you can safely hit and what you should probably avoid.

35:57.240 --> 35:59.700
<v ->Ed, I would add one interesting kind of, I guess,</v>

35:59.700 --> 36:03.498
tangent to this, which is that in our company,

36:03.498 --> 36:04.975
we actually have to deal

36:04.975 --> 36:06.870
with the issue of a scalable architecture.

36:06.870 --> 36:09.300
On one end, we have entry models

36:09.300 --> 36:11.400
that are incredibly high volumes

36:11.400 --> 36:13.530
that do things like adaptive cruise control

36:13.530 --> 36:15.300
or autonomous emergency braking.

36:15.300 --> 36:16.740
And at the complete other end,

36:16.740 --> 36:20.820
we have, you know, autonomous driving, for example.

36:20.820 --> 36:23.760
And so that means that you need an architecture,

36:23.760 --> 36:25.320
an AI architecture

36:25.320 --> 36:28.380
that can deal with a very, very limited sensor set

36:28.380 --> 36:31.650
and then scale all the way up to a very rich sensor set

36:31.650 --> 36:33.411
without having to completely redesign

36:33.411 --> 36:35.850
and rebuild the entire architecture.

36:35.850 --> 36:37.920
And so, you know, as you move

36:37.920 --> 36:40.440
from kind of prototyping into production,

36:40.440 --> 36:42.060
one of the things you have to think about

36:42.060 --> 36:45.813
for a long-term roadmap is a scalable architecture.

36:46.950 --> 36:49.050
<v ->We've got about three minutes left.</v>

36:49.050 --> 36:50.850
And I think one of the interesting things

36:50.850 --> 36:55.850
about this panel is you have a diverse set of experience

36:57.060 --> 36:58.020
in the world of autonomy.

36:58.020 --> 36:59.970
So it gives you a different perspective.

36:59.970 --> 37:00.840
So what I want to do

37:00.840 --> 37:02.760
in the limited amount of time we have left,

37:02.760 --> 37:05.970
each of you take a little, just a few seconds here

37:05.970 --> 37:09.960
and give us your vision

37:09.960 --> 37:13.470
of what AI-driven mobility is gonna be like

37:13.470 --> 37:14.784
in the year 2035.

37:14.784 --> 37:16.650
So 10 years from now.

37:16.650 --> 37:18.450
It could be on road, off-road, whatever you want.

37:18.450 --> 37:20.520
How is mobility gonna be?

37:20.520 --> 37:22.140
What's it gonna be like 10 years from now

37:22.140 --> 37:24.753
when we come back here and we reunite this panel?

37:25.920 --> 37:26.753
<v ->So I think, you know,</v>

37:26.753 --> 37:29.130
there's, you know, with this advent of Generative AI,

37:29.130 --> 37:32.670
I think that's going to accelerate the perception

37:32.670 --> 37:33.503
and the motion planning,

37:33.503 --> 37:35.190
all this, everything autonomy, right?

37:35.190 --> 37:38.130
So, you know, we have a lot of applied machine learning

37:38.130 --> 37:39.358
and applied AI today,

37:39.358 --> 37:41.550
and I think there's a lot of opportunity

37:41.550 --> 37:43.830
for GenAI to improve all that.

37:43.830 --> 37:46.590
So our machines are gonna be much, much smarter

37:46.590 --> 37:47.667
in about 10 years.

37:47.667 --> 37:49.920
And I think the way that we interact with these machines

37:49.920 --> 37:51.960
is gonna be different as well, right?

37:51.960 --> 37:53.700
We're gonna have different types of AMI,

37:53.700 --> 37:57.480
using forms of AR or VR,

37:57.480 --> 38:00.996
and just and even natural language processing,

38:00.996 --> 38:04.080
in the interest of time.

38:04.080 --> 38:04.913
<v ->Sure. Yeah.</v>

38:04.913 --> 38:07.185
I mean, I think the most significant impact

38:07.185 --> 38:08.913
is not just gonna be the,

38:09.930 --> 38:13.650
not the penetration or the density of autonomy and mobility.

38:13.650 --> 38:14.857
Obviously, I can sit here and say,

38:14.857 --> 38:15.870
"I think it's gonna take off

38:15.870 --> 38:17.370
and there's gonna be lots of autonomous vehicles."

38:17.370 --> 38:18.630
That's definitely true,

38:18.630 --> 38:21.450
but I think it's going to become commonplace.

38:21.450 --> 38:23.010
And it's a perception difference,

38:23.010 --> 38:25.110
societal perception difference

38:25.110 --> 38:27.030
that I think is going to be the most interesting thing

38:27.030 --> 38:28.140
in the next 10 years,

38:28.140 --> 38:30.210
to the point where all of the easy stuff,

38:30.210 --> 38:31.043
and by easy stuff,

38:31.043 --> 38:32.880
I do mean like basic driving around town

38:32.880 --> 38:33.840
and that sort of thing,

38:33.840 --> 38:36.510
is gonna become commonplace and expected.

38:36.510 --> 38:37.620
And once it's expected,

38:37.620 --> 38:39.420
people are gonna start asking the questions

38:39.420 --> 38:42.750
that are more akin to how do you pick up this specific bin

38:42.750 --> 38:44.460
at a specific angle and other things.

38:44.460 --> 38:46.650
And we're gonna go into the more of the niche markets

38:46.650 --> 38:50.190
and more of the kind of niche opportunities

38:50.190 --> 38:52.860
within mobility and automation.

38:52.860 --> 38:56.520
But I think it's gonna become ubiquitous within society.

38:56.520 --> 38:58.700
I don't think it's gonna take over all the vehicles

38:58.700 --> 38:59.610
in the next 10 years.

38:59.610 --> 39:02.220
I think it's gonna take longer than that for it to roll out,

39:02.220 --> 39:04.980
but the acceptance is gonna be dramatically different

39:04.980 --> 39:06.963
10 years from now than it is today.

39:07.950 --> 39:09.510
<v ->Yeah, I agree.</v>

39:09.510 --> 39:11.820
I think it's going to be very much related

39:11.820 --> 39:14.130
to the trust that our customers are going to take.

39:14.130 --> 39:16.770
They're also going to see the value coming out of it.

39:16.770 --> 39:19.530
Because if we think about the construction business,

39:19.530 --> 39:23.820
it's all about the process optimization and the safety.

39:23.820 --> 39:26.580
So it's going to be into that direction.

39:26.580 --> 39:29.190
I believe that we will see an early adoption

39:29.190 --> 39:32.160
in some of our ecosystems or some of the customers.

39:32.160 --> 39:33.990
Well, it will take a little more time than others.

39:33.990 --> 39:36.030
We'll be learning along the way.

39:36.030 --> 39:38.160
And it will be very interesting

39:38.160 --> 39:40.440
to see the different machine and machine interaction.

39:40.440 --> 39:42.750
And I work for Volvo Construction Equipment,

39:42.750 --> 39:44.310
but I was telling you before,

39:44.310 --> 39:47.395
unfortunately, my company cannot deliver all the products

39:47.395 --> 39:49.080
that a customer needs.

39:49.080 --> 39:52.470
So I'm expecting machine-machine interaction agnostically

39:52.470 --> 39:53.820
in between different brands.

39:53.820 --> 39:55.570
I'm really looking forward to that.

39:57.120 --> 39:58.230
<v ->You know, it's very true.</v>

39:58.230 --> 40:00.930
The average vehicle on the road in the United States

40:00.930 --> 40:02.520
is over a decade old.

40:02.520 --> 40:04.680
So there will be time that's over a decade

40:04.680 --> 40:07.020
even to get 50% penetration.

40:07.020 --> 40:09.480
That said, generative AI is moving

40:09.480 --> 40:11.970
at an incredible accelerating rate.

40:11.970 --> 40:14.250
And so I think the big difference we will see

40:14.250 --> 40:17.640
is the level of seamlessness and personalization

40:17.640 --> 40:19.320
that comes from that intelligence

40:19.320 --> 40:21.690
across all the products we use

40:21.690 --> 40:24.633
as well as how we do our work and we live our lives.

40:25.560 --> 40:27.000
<v ->Panelists, thank you so much.</v>

40:27.000 --> 40:30.480
I hope we've opened up your eyes a little bit

40:30.480 --> 40:33.360
as to a different world of autonomy.

40:33.360 --> 40:35.340
And I look forward to coming back here in 10 years

40:35.340 --> 40:37.470
to see if all this comes true.

40:37.470 --> 40:38.874
Thank you very, very much.

40:38.874 --> 40:41.307
(audience clapping)

40:41.307 --> 40:43.974
(upbeat music)
