1
00:00.000 --> 00:02.583
(upbeat music)

2
00:11.160 --> 00:12.390
<v ->Well, welcome everyone.</v>

3
00:12.390 --> 00:16.440
We are gonna have an amazing session today on predictive AI.

4
00:16.440 --> 00:18.270
My name's Jim Harris.

5
00:18.270 --> 00:21.720
I used to write a column for "i3" magazine of the CTA,

6
00:21.720 --> 00:23.730
the Consumer Technology Association,

7
00:23.730 --> 00:26.130
for five years before the magazine died.

8
00:26.130 --> 00:26.963
Very sad.

9
00:28.050 --> 00:31.020
We have an amazing panel today on predictive AI.

10
00:31.020 --> 00:32.640
We're not gonna talk about history,

11
00:32.640 --> 00:34.890
we're not gonna talk about our bios.

12
00:34.890 --> 00:37.890
There is this amazing thing called The Google

13
00:37.890 --> 00:41.400
that you can find out all about us here on the panel.

14
00:41.400 --> 00:44.130
We're gonna dive right into the use cases,

15
00:44.130 --> 00:47.760
which are practical, proven use cases

16
00:47.760 --> 00:49.740
with bottom line benefit.

17
00:49.740 --> 00:51.210
And I'll start with one.

18
00:51.210 --> 00:53.040
I was invited to the launch

19
00:53.040 --> 00:57.960
of Trenitalia's 300 kilometer an hour train in Rome,

20
00:57.960 --> 01:01.980
and they had installed 1000 points of presence on the train

21
01:01.980 --> 01:06.960
on different parts, and they measured vibration and sound.

22
01:06.960 --> 01:07.793
And if something

23
01:07.793 --> 01:11.250
went outside of SOP, standard operating procedure,

24
01:11.250 --> 01:14.850
it would yell out, "Hey, I'm the brakes on car 4A,

25
01:14.850 --> 01:18.060
and I am really vibrating a lot."

26
01:18.060 --> 01:19.567
It would then use AI and say,

27
01:19.567 --> 01:22.860
"We predict that part will break down in a week."

28
01:22.860 --> 01:24.120
And rather than wait until

29
01:24.120 --> 01:26.580
it paralyzed the whole train on the tracks

30
01:26.580 --> 01:29.640
and threw the schedule of everything off,

31
01:29.640 --> 01:31.500
they would replace the part that night.

32
01:31.500 --> 01:34.200
It's called predictive maintenance.

33
01:34.200 --> 01:37.890
And I think that if I get a better service,

34
01:37.890 --> 01:39.900
it's gonna cost more.

35
01:39.900 --> 01:43.380
Well, how about better service at 10% lower cost?

36
01:43.380 --> 01:44.580
They're saving 10%

37
01:44.580 --> 01:47.790
of their 2 billion euro budget on maintenance.

38
01:47.790 --> 01:50.400
So there's an example of predictive AI

39
01:50.400 --> 01:52.140
and a bottom line benefit.

40
01:52.140 --> 01:55.200
So that's what you're gonna be getting in rapid fire

41
01:55.200 --> 01:56.370
on our panel today.

42
01:56.370 --> 01:57.930
So who wants to start us off?

43
01:57.930 --> 01:58.920
How about you, Alyssa?

44
01:58.920 --> 01:59.753
<v ->Okay, great.</v>

45
01:59.753 --> 02:02.100
Alyssa Altman, I'm from Publicis Sapient.

46
02:02.100 --> 02:04.320
And we're a partner with Marriott,

47
02:04.320 --> 02:06.660
and in 2020 we worked with them

48
02:06.660 --> 02:08.730
to develop Marriott Homes and Villas.

49
02:08.730 --> 02:11.220
So I think you're familiar with Airbnb,

50
02:11.220 --> 02:13.620
and what Marriott Homes and Villas was

51
02:13.620 --> 02:16.140
is their form of Airbnb.

52
02:16.140 --> 02:19.380
And was really struggling with people getting on the site,

53
02:19.380 --> 02:22.200
figuring out how to define what kind of, you know,

54
02:22.200 --> 02:23.640
vacations they wanted.

55
02:23.640 --> 02:26.250
So we used generative AI

56
02:26.250 --> 02:28.980
to help really change the search mechanism.

57
02:28.980 --> 02:31.920
No longer are you coming on to Marriott Homes and Villas

58
02:31.920 --> 02:34.950
and looking at a date and looking at a location,

59
02:34.950 --> 02:36.337
but you're actually asking them,

60
02:36.337 --> 02:38.092
"Hey, I wanna go to California.

61
02:38.092 --> 02:40.110
I wanna bring my dog.

62
02:40.110 --> 02:43.230
I wanna go to a bachelorette party in the Caribbean."

63
02:43.230 --> 02:48.030
And it served up over 140,000 different options.

64
02:48.030 --> 02:50.970
And what it also did on the predictive side of it

65
02:50.970 --> 02:53.430
is it helped Marriott market better.

66
02:53.430 --> 02:56.250
Because what they were able to do is,

67
02:56.250 --> 02:59.370
with this tool, be able to understand

68
02:59.370 --> 03:00.930
what people were interested in.

69
03:00.930 --> 03:05.040
So it helped them predict how to manage their properties,

70
03:05.040 --> 03:08.730
how to get people excited about going on vacations

71
03:08.730 --> 03:10.380
and scheduling vacations.

72
03:10.380 --> 03:14.430
And they have seen over twice the amount of searches,

73
03:14.430 --> 03:18.210
which ultimately has translated into increased revenue.

74
03:18.210 --> 03:19.170
<v ->Love that case.</v>

75
03:19.170 --> 03:20.910
Thanks Alyssa.

76
03:20.910 --> 03:21.990
Do you want to jump in, Nick?

77
03:21.990 --> 03:22.823
<v ->Sure.</v>

78
03:22.823 --> 03:26.220
So first, thanks Jim and the panelists and the attendees

79
03:26.220 --> 03:29.130
for the opportunity to share the HARMAN story.

80
03:29.130 --> 03:30.900
And thanks to our 30,000 employees

81
03:30.900 --> 03:33.240
who deliver connected experiences,

82
03:33.240 --> 03:36.180
intelligent using AI in the car,

83
03:36.180 --> 03:37.800
in the home and in the enterprise.

84
03:37.800 --> 03:40.230
You know, we're incredibly proud of the work that we do

85
03:40.230 --> 03:42.240
as a Samsung company.

86
03:42.240 --> 03:44.430
I would start out with the enterprise, you know.

87
03:44.430 --> 03:46.290
And we all experienced what it was like

88
03:46.290 --> 03:49.740
during the supply chain semiconductor crisis, you know,

89
03:49.740 --> 03:54.740
having a massive effect on our ability to build, deliver,

90
03:55.770 --> 03:58.920
and you know, get products in the hands of customers.

91
03:58.920 --> 04:02.970
And so we were very fortunate to build a ForecastGPT,

92
04:02.970 --> 04:07.320
which is available on the AWS Marketplace,

93
04:07.320 --> 04:10.920
to help improve demand forecasting, inventory optimization,

94
04:10.920 --> 04:12.810
and most importantly delight customers.

95
04:12.810 --> 04:15.210
You know, there's nothing worse when you go online

96
04:15.210 --> 04:17.790
and you want to order something and it's unavailable,

97
04:17.790 --> 04:20.760
or there's nothing worse than having a parked car

98
04:20.760 --> 04:22.320
waiting for a head unit to show up.

99
04:22.320 --> 04:25.350
And so our ability to really improve the demand forecast

100
04:25.350 --> 04:27.660
and the accuracy for our consumers

101
04:27.660 --> 04:30.090
in the consumer audio space on jbl.com,

102
04:30.090 --> 04:33.210
our ability to commit to our OEMs

103
04:33.210 --> 04:35.400
for delivery of a digital cockpit

104
04:35.400 --> 04:38.400
and car premium audio speakers,

105
04:38.400 --> 04:42.120
our ability to commit to those demands is really important.

106
04:42.120 --> 04:45.360
And then manage our supply chain effectively

107
04:45.360 --> 04:50.360
on inventory optimization, we reduced our inventory by 14%.

108
04:50.520 --> 04:51.450
So when you're talking about

109
04:51.450 --> 04:55.020
billions of dollars of material, the ability to ensure

110
04:55.020 --> 04:57.780
that you're getting the right product

111
04:57.780 --> 04:59.910
at the right place at the right time

112
04:59.910 --> 05:02.430
and managing that working capital,

113
05:02.430 --> 05:04.890
to use that working capital for more R&amp;D capabilities

114
05:04.890 --> 05:06.570
is pretty remarkable.

115
05:06.570 --> 05:10.980
The GPT itself is built on ChatGPT

116
05:10.980 --> 05:15.980
with a Mistral 7B on SageMaker, and it's 88% accurate.

117
05:16.710 --> 05:18.360
So we're really proud of that.

118
05:18.360 --> 05:19.710
We're continuing to find ways

119
05:19.710 --> 05:22.440
to optimize the demand and sales

120
05:22.440 --> 05:23.790
and finance and supply chain.

121
05:23.790 --> 05:26.760
But that's one great example of what we're using AI for

122
05:26.760 --> 05:29.640
to delight customers and not disappoint.

123
05:29.640 --> 05:30.990
<v ->This is a great example.</v>

124
05:30.990 --> 05:32.130
And for those of you

125
05:32.130 --> 05:34.950
who were at Jensen's keynote from NVIDIA,

126
05:34.950 --> 05:38.880
he was talking about running multiple scenarios

127
05:38.880 --> 05:39.870
in a warehouse

128
05:39.870 --> 05:43.890
around inventory management and optimization and logistics,

129
05:43.890 --> 05:46.320
almost like doing Monte Carlos.

130
05:46.320 --> 05:49.740
And so we're gonna see more of this kind of predictive AI

131
05:49.740 --> 05:51.930
on how to optimize the supply chain.

132
05:51.930 --> 05:53.661
So great example, Nick.

133
05:53.661 --> 05:56.040
Who wants to jump in next?

134
05:56.040 --> 05:57.416
<v ->I think I can go next.</v>

135
05:57.416 --> 05:58.983
Mamatha Chamarthi,

136
05:58.983 --> 06:01.770
'til four months ago I was with Stellantis,

137
06:01.770 --> 06:05.130
so my experience spans across OEMs

138
06:05.130 --> 06:07.410
as well as tier one suppliers.

139
06:07.410 --> 06:09.960
And today I am with Goodyear,

140
06:09.960 --> 06:12.570
I joined Goodyear about four months ago,

141
06:12.570 --> 06:14.010
Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company.

142
06:14.010 --> 06:17.280
So I'll start with an example from Stellantis

143
06:17.280 --> 06:20.610
and then talk to you about how you can take something

144
06:20.610 --> 06:22.887
that was applied at Stellantis

145
06:22.887 --> 06:25.950
and how it could be applied at a tier one supplier.

146
06:25.950 --> 06:28.170
So when you look at a car,

147
06:28.170 --> 06:30.780
and I think everyone knows this,

148
06:30.780 --> 06:33.270
that the typical design of the car

149
06:33.270 --> 06:35.340
takes five to seven years.

150
06:35.340 --> 06:38.220
And through a lot of continuous improvement

151
06:38.220 --> 06:42.780
and process improvement and engineering improvement efforts,

152
06:42.780 --> 06:46.680
we as OEEs have been able to reduce that five to seven years

153
06:46.680 --> 06:48.240
to three to five years.

154
06:48.240 --> 06:49.620
And we were still looking at

155
06:49.620 --> 06:54.240
how can we bring a product to market quicker

156
06:54.240 --> 06:56.160
and start with the customer experience

157
06:56.160 --> 06:57.450
and start working backwards

158
06:57.450 --> 07:01.500
and defining what would be the ideal concept of the car

159
07:01.500 --> 07:04.517
that would appeal to our customers?

160
07:04.517 --> 07:07.760
And speed to market of the design

161
07:07.760 --> 07:10.110
and testing it out with the customers

162
07:10.110 --> 07:12.240
was very, very important.

163
07:12.240 --> 07:15.090
And there was also an additional problem,

164
07:15.090 --> 07:19.440
attracting talent into the design office

165
07:19.440 --> 07:21.570
was also kind of going down.

166
07:21.570 --> 07:22.980
That was not that many people

167
07:22.980 --> 07:26.070
that were getting into the Center of Creative Studies

168
07:26.070 --> 07:27.390
and those kind of institutes.

169
07:27.390 --> 07:29.790
So it was a bit of a talent problem

170
07:29.790 --> 07:32.490
but also speed to market problem.

171
07:32.490 --> 07:36.780
And so what we did was we took all of the concepts

172
07:36.780 --> 07:38.880
and all of the production vehicles

173
07:38.880 --> 07:41.430
and all of the specs that we had

174
07:41.430 --> 07:44.550
across the 14 brands of Stellantis

175
07:44.550 --> 07:48.333
and fed into this design GPT.

176
07:49.380 --> 07:53.400
And so the new designers that we were hiring,

177
07:53.400 --> 07:55.920
they didn't have to start from scratch

178
07:55.920 --> 07:59.940
and then build a clay model, go through this entire process.

179
07:59.940 --> 08:04.410
But what they did was started as prompt engineers

180
08:04.410 --> 08:08.890
asking DesignGPT, "I want to design a new concept for Jeep

181
08:10.170 --> 08:13.290
and I want it to reflect the true personality

182
08:13.290 --> 08:16.470
and the brand uniqueness of a Jeep.

183
08:16.470 --> 08:18.630
But I want it to be an EV

184
08:18.630 --> 08:21.420
and taking the attributes of the EV."

185
08:21.420 --> 08:24.300
And my target segment of the customers

186
08:24.300 --> 08:26.783
that I'm going after for this,

187
08:26.783 --> 08:30.090
defining it at a micro segment level.

188
08:30.090 --> 08:33.960
And into this design GPT, by doing this,

189
08:33.960 --> 08:36.063
they got really a jumpstart.

190
08:37.260 --> 08:39.690
And so this is a multimodal search,

191
08:39.690 --> 08:41.520
that it's not just a text search,

192
08:41.520 --> 08:45.480
but you're sending CAD drawings, you're sending all of these

193
08:45.480 --> 08:49.530
and then getting back CAD images

194
08:49.530 --> 08:53.640
of what this new concept car could look like.

195
08:53.640 --> 08:58.640
And it gave almost close to a 40% jumpstart

196
08:59.430 --> 09:01.740
into the design process.

197
09:01.740 --> 09:04.410
Including the interior design, not just the exterior design,

198
09:04.410 --> 09:06.600
interior design, exterior design,

199
09:06.600 --> 09:09.180
and I would call it the phygital experience,

200
09:09.180 --> 09:11.850
the physical experience and the digital experience

201
09:11.850 --> 09:14.220
augmenting the personality of the brand.

202
09:14.220 --> 09:16.230
Now how do we apply it to Goodyear?

203
09:16.230 --> 09:19.829
So if you look at Goodyear and a tire, tire has a mold,

204
09:19.829 --> 09:22.080
tire has tire engineering,

205
09:22.080 --> 09:26.760
which is rubber, fabric, metal giving it the structure,

206
09:26.760 --> 09:29.970
and then you have material science, lots of composites,

207
09:29.970 --> 09:32.400
almost close to 250 chemicals

208
09:32.400 --> 09:34.470
and synthetic and natural rubber

209
09:34.470 --> 09:36.180
that goes into making of a tire.

210
09:36.180 --> 09:38.580
Which I did not know coming from the OEE.

211
09:38.580 --> 09:40.590
I was thinking car is very complex,

212
09:40.590 --> 09:43.770
but tire is equally complex, that I learned.

213
09:43.770 --> 09:47.970
And what we are trying now is a similar kind of

214
09:47.970 --> 09:49.563
how do we accelerate?

215
09:50.700 --> 09:54.630
Bringing a new tire to market is a two year timeline.

216
09:54.630 --> 09:57.180
So how do we cut down the two year

217
09:57.180 --> 10:01.740
and be a lot more competitive and bring the price down

218
10:01.740 --> 10:04.890
and then bring the tire to market quicker?

219
10:04.890 --> 10:06.240
<v ->This is a great example.</v>

220
10:06.240 --> 10:10.680
And in my opinion, it is the least understood aspect of AI,

221
10:10.680 --> 10:14.250
the benefit, cycle times and speed.

222
10:14.250 --> 10:17.010
And you know, they say time is money.

223
10:17.010 --> 10:19.380
Well, if you can take five to seven years

224
10:19.380 --> 10:21.930
down to three to five years, that's a huge difference.

225
10:21.930 --> 10:24.956
We're gonna finish out the first round with Davie.

226
10:24.956 --> 10:26.129
<v ->Thank you, Jim.</v>
<v ->Davie, what's the case study</v>

227
10:26.129 --> 10:27.390
you want to throw in?

228
10:27.390 --> 10:29.370
<v ->I'm happy to be here, thanks for having me.</v>

229
10:29.370 --> 10:30.930
Jumping right in, I think the first one

230
10:30.930 --> 10:34.530
I would bring from Bosch is one we call Super Technician,

231
10:34.530 --> 10:36.660
one we call Super Technician.

232
10:36.660 --> 10:39.390
If you take your car to a service center,

233
10:39.390 --> 10:41.370
what's probably happening behind the scenes

234
10:41.370 --> 10:44.040
is you have one master technician back there

235
10:44.040 --> 10:48.390
that's been there 25, 35 years that knows everything.

236
10:48.390 --> 10:51.510
And then you have about 20, 30 technicians.

237
10:51.510 --> 10:56.510
And what we found is that these technicians rely heavily

238
10:56.520 --> 10:58.260
on this master technician.

239
10:58.260 --> 11:02.760
This person knows the million potential diagnostic codes

240
11:02.760 --> 11:03.930
that are coming out.

241
11:03.930 --> 11:07.320
This person knows who to contact, which OEM to contact.

242
11:07.320 --> 11:10.230
This person knows which website to go to to find the answer.

243
11:10.230 --> 11:11.880
But this is normally one person,

244
11:11.880 --> 11:14.310
and you have 20, 30 technicians

245
11:14.310 --> 11:15.900
that are relying on this person.

246
11:15.900 --> 11:17.820
So you can imagine there's a bottleneck.

247
11:17.820 --> 11:21.750
It could take hours if not days to find this information.

248
11:21.750 --> 11:24.090
And so when you consider this

249
11:24.090 --> 11:27.150
and you consider the positioning of Bosch in this market

250
11:27.150 --> 11:29.610
with over 35,000 service centers

251
11:29.610 --> 11:32.430
and the data that we have is really the holy grail,

252
11:32.430 --> 11:35.340
the question is, and I'm sure we all have

253
11:35.340 --> 11:39.150
sort of this kind of problem where we have this data,

254
11:39.150 --> 11:41.370
we just dunno how to get it out and to use it.

255
11:41.370 --> 11:44.580
And so this is exactly where we started using AI.

256
11:44.580 --> 11:47.823
We used some LLMs, a little bit of knowledge graph,

257
11:48.690 --> 11:52.170
and we built an interface that allows these technicians

258
11:52.170 --> 11:55.590
to all of a sudden become a master technician overnight.

259
11:55.590 --> 11:59.340
So you can imagine that impact on the business

260
11:59.340 --> 12:00.187
when you start to say,

261
12:00.187 --> 12:02.760
"I've now taken it from multiple days

262
12:02.760 --> 12:06.300
into really instant responses."

263
12:06.300 --> 12:08.460
And also the relief of the master technician

264
12:08.460 --> 12:10.080
who now doesn't have to support 20 to 30,

265
12:10.080 --> 12:13.050
who can also then work on the more strategic aspects

266
12:13.050 --> 12:14.610
of their daily job.

267
12:14.610 --> 12:17.820
So it's a way that you can start to think,

268
12:17.820 --> 12:20.190
it doesn't just impact the major service centers,

269
12:20.190 --> 12:23.100
it also impacts the ma and pa shops

270
12:23.100 --> 12:26.250
that are looking to really bring productivity

271
12:26.250 --> 12:30.240
and efficiency into their line of use.

272
12:30.240 --> 12:33.870
Really bringing everyone these technicians as AI-assisted.

273
12:33.870 --> 12:35.850
And that's a little bit of how we look

274
12:35.850 --> 12:38.760
at where AI can come in in this AI assistant world.

275
12:38.760 --> 12:40.020
<v ->This is a great example.</v>

276
12:40.020 --> 12:43.140
We talked about speed in the last use case.

277
12:43.140 --> 12:43.973
This is,

278
12:43.973 --> 12:47.220
think about time to competence for a new technician.

279
12:47.220 --> 12:49.260
So they're only three months on the job,

280
12:49.260 --> 12:52.710
but with the AI, it's like three years of competence

281
12:52.710 --> 12:53.850
that they can access.

282
12:53.850 --> 12:56.760
So amazing case study.

283
12:56.760 --> 12:59.250
Alyssa, you started, so we'll come to you,

284
12:59.250 --> 13:00.870
Nick, for round two.

285
13:00.870 --> 13:04.530
And I think Nick's gonna talk about saving lives.

286
13:04.530 --> 13:06.810
And I don't know if you know,

287
13:06.810 --> 13:11.810
but there are 45,000 deaths every year on US roads

288
13:12.720 --> 13:14.550
due to driver error.

289
13:14.550 --> 13:17.400
And 5.2 million people go to hospital

290
13:17.400 --> 13:19.320
because of car accidents.

291
13:19.320 --> 13:20.790
Now that's just the US numbers.

292
13:20.790 --> 13:22.050
When you look globally,

293
13:22.050 --> 13:24.510
all those numbers are in the millions.

294
13:24.510 --> 13:28.470
So distracted driving, drowsy driving,

295
13:28.470 --> 13:30.720
these are huge problems.

296
13:30.720 --> 13:33.840
What maybe is a case study around this?

297
13:33.840 --> 13:35.280
<v ->Yeah, so we talked about the enterprise,</v>

298
13:35.280 --> 13:36.720
and now talking about, you know,

299
13:36.720 --> 13:38.730
intelligent experiences in cabin.

300
13:38.730 --> 13:43.360
And you know, and certainly our ready products available

301
13:44.220 --> 13:45.450
are really important to us.

302
13:45.450 --> 13:48.269
And one of the really important areas that you mentioned

303
13:48.269 --> 13:53.269
is improving the driver safety and our Ready Care product.

304
13:54.000 --> 13:56.550
And our CTO Armin Prommersberger is in the back,

305
13:56.550 --> 13:58.950
so I'm sure he'll do it more justice than I.

306
13:58.950 --> 14:01.050
But really, he and his team are remarkable

307
14:01.050 --> 14:02.100
at what they've done.

308
14:03.120 --> 14:06.030
But they're using a camera

309
14:06.030 --> 14:10.140
and machine learning sensors in the car

310
14:10.140 --> 14:13.350
to determine not only drowsiness of the driver

311
14:13.350 --> 14:15.030
but cognitive load on the brain

312
14:15.030 --> 14:18.060
and distractedness in the eye movements

313
14:18.060 --> 14:20.430
from the camera and the intelligence.

314
14:20.430 --> 14:22.080
We've collected petabytes worth of data

315
14:22.080 --> 14:27.080
to learn how people get distracted.

316
14:27.960 --> 14:31.740
And so not only is it, you know, being able to determine

317
14:31.740 --> 14:33.450
the distractedness of the driver,

318
14:33.450 --> 14:37.409
but it's also the stress of the driver, the blood pressure,

319
14:37.409 --> 14:38.940
the breathing rhythms.

320
14:38.940 --> 14:41.100
And so being able to monitor that,

321
14:41.100 --> 14:44.790
but then create some interventions and change

322
14:44.790 --> 14:47.640
and make notifications to the driver,

323
14:47.640 --> 14:51.870
change the controls, simplify the digital cockpit.

324
14:51.870 --> 14:55.563
Or perhaps suggest, you know, soothing music.

325
14:56.400 --> 14:58.530
These are all immersive, intelligent things

326
14:58.530 --> 15:00.900
that Armin and his team are doing

327
15:00.900 --> 15:02.430
in these Ready Care offerings

328
15:02.430 --> 15:03.960
with the use of artificial intelligence

329
15:03.960 --> 15:05.455
and machine learning.

330
15:05.455 --> 15:08.730
So again, as we continue to find ways

331
15:08.730 --> 15:10.770
to improve this immersive experience,

332
15:10.770 --> 15:12.420
the Ready Care offerings and products

333
15:12.420 --> 15:13.680
are really important to us.

334
15:13.680 --> 15:17.940
<v ->So my car, if it suggests I listen to classical music,</v>

335
15:17.940 --> 15:19.320
it's telling me I'm stressed.

336
15:19.320 --> 15:23.400
And if it says stop for caffeine, I'm too drowsy.

337
15:23.400 --> 15:24.268
<v ->You're gonna get some advice.</v>

338
15:24.268 --> 15:25.101
<v ->You know, it's gonna give me advice</v>

339
15:25.101 --> 15:26.130
one way or another, is it?

340
15:26.130 --> 15:26.963
I love it.

341
15:28.741 --> 15:30.250
Mamatha, what do you think?

342
15:30.250 --> 15:32.730
<v ->Okay, so I'll extend on that same example</v>

343
15:32.730 --> 15:34.830
of the intelligent cockpit

344
15:34.830 --> 15:37.500
and this whole phygital experience,

345
15:37.500 --> 15:41.040
again, starting with Stellantis and applying it to Goodyear.

346
15:41.040 --> 15:46.020
So as we came together, Fiat, Chrysler and PSA

347
15:46.020 --> 15:48.270
and we became Stellantis,

348
15:48.270 --> 15:50.697
and we looked at the 14 brands and we said,

349
15:50.697 --> 15:53.400
"We need to start working backwards

350
15:53.400 --> 15:57.420
from the customer experience and what is it that they want,

351
15:57.420 --> 15:59.100
to the tech platforms

352
15:59.100 --> 16:01.170
and how we are going to commercialize."

353
16:01.170 --> 16:02.707
But we started with a customer and said,

354
16:02.707 --> 16:05.100
"What is that experience that we want to provide

355
16:05.100 --> 16:06.360
to the customer?"

356
16:06.360 --> 16:10.320
And we started looking at when a customer is buying a brand

357
16:10.320 --> 16:15.320
like a Jeep for example, it has 4x4 capability

358
16:15.930 --> 16:19.080
and it has all of this fantastic capabilities.

359
16:19.080 --> 16:21.780
But imagine it's snowing outside.

360
16:21.780 --> 16:23.280
Tomorrow I'm going to go to Michigan

361
16:23.280 --> 16:25.233
and I'll witness that firsthand.

362
16:26.490 --> 16:30.210
There could be like six inches of snow on the road

363
16:30.210 --> 16:32.310
and you're entering into the car.

364
16:32.310 --> 16:33.720
And how is that scenario?

365
16:33.720 --> 16:35.640
Let me visualize that for you.

366
16:35.640 --> 16:39.090
You could be in your home,

367
16:39.090 --> 16:41.400
turn on your remote start in the car,

368
16:41.400 --> 16:43.320
and hopefully by the time you get to the car

369
16:43.320 --> 16:45.300
the snow has cleared on the window.

370
16:45.300 --> 16:48.810
But the car does not have that intelligence to say,

371
16:48.810 --> 16:50.850
the car is in a sports mode,

372
16:50.850 --> 16:55.650
it needs to go into snow mode, right?

373
16:55.650 --> 16:59.100
It's a Jeep 4x4 with all of the capabilities

374
16:59.100 --> 17:01.590
that it could go, it could take that

375
17:01.590 --> 17:04.290
and go to that vehicle signal.

376
17:04.290 --> 17:06.120
So how do I get that intelligence

377
17:06.120 --> 17:10.620
from the weather to the car and inform the car

378
17:10.620 --> 17:13.170
not only to set the cabin temperature

379
17:13.170 --> 17:16.410
to a comfortable ambient temperature,

380
17:16.410 --> 17:17.730
including reducing the stress

381
17:17.730 --> 17:19.230
that you were talking about, Nick,

382
17:19.230 --> 17:21.000
and playing some soft music

383
17:21.000 --> 17:25.050
because the snow driving is going to be extremely stressful

384
17:25.050 --> 17:26.400
with slippery conditions.

385
17:26.400 --> 17:29.045
And only a Jeep can take you anywhere, by the way.

386
17:29.045 --> 17:31.045
(panelists laughing)

387
17:31.045 --> 17:32.520
So, but how do you send that intelligence

388
17:32.520 --> 17:34.110
so by the time you sit in the car,

389
17:34.110 --> 17:37.080
it's not only the snow around the car is cleared up,

390
17:37.080 --> 17:40.080
but it's set into the snow mode

391
17:40.080 --> 17:42.270
and your drive is super comfortable?

392
17:42.270 --> 17:45.600
And I am talking about this with a real example

393
17:45.600 --> 17:49.830
of me trying to get to work in 45 minutes

394
17:49.830 --> 17:51.390
to go to a town hall,

395
17:51.390 --> 17:54.360
and I'm trying to drive, look at the street,

396
17:54.360 --> 17:57.600
and fumble with changing the mode.

397
17:57.600 --> 17:59.040
That is distracted driving.

398
17:59.040 --> 18:02.160
That's the 2.5 million accidents that you're talking about

399
18:02.160 --> 18:03.960
that are going to the hospital.

400
18:03.960 --> 18:06.000
So you talk about contextualized

401
18:06.000 --> 18:09.300
and personalized experience to that customer

402
18:09.300 --> 18:11.790
that deepens their association with the brand.

403
18:11.790 --> 18:14.557
And you start creating a digital mode and you say,

404
18:14.557 --> 18:17.490
"If my Jeep provides this kind of an experience,

405
18:17.490 --> 18:21.360
I want to buy a Jeep again and again and again,

406
18:21.360 --> 18:25.200
because it's deepening my connection to my brand."

407
18:25.200 --> 18:27.450
Now when I start looking at Goodyear,

408
18:27.450 --> 18:30.150
Goodyear has about 570 service centers,

409
18:30.150 --> 18:32.403
similar to what you've talked about at Bosch.

410
18:33.330 --> 18:36.120
And it's pretty similar thing, like, you know,

411
18:36.120 --> 18:38.070
it's a very transactional relationship

412
18:38.070 --> 18:39.600
we have with the customer.

413
18:39.600 --> 18:40.920
A customer has a flat tire,

414
18:40.920 --> 18:43.530
they have an option of going to a Bridgestone,

415
18:43.530 --> 18:46.110
they have an option of going to Goodyear,

416
18:46.110 --> 18:48.360
or going to a mom and pop store

417
18:48.360 --> 18:49.950
or Discount Tires, Belle Tires.

418
18:49.950 --> 18:54.750
There's umpteen number of competitors in this mix.

419
18:54.750 --> 18:57.270
It's a very overcrowded space.

420
18:57.270 --> 19:01.080
But in this overcrowded space, no one has figured out

421
19:01.080 --> 19:03.840
how do I take this transactional relationship

422
19:03.840 --> 19:05.740
to a lifetime value with the customer?

423
19:06.960 --> 19:08.100
So what do I need?

424
19:08.100 --> 19:10.440
I need vehicle intelligence

425
19:10.440 --> 19:14.640
to predict when that weather change of summer tires

426
19:14.640 --> 19:16.320
to winter tires happen.

427
19:16.320 --> 19:18.517
So I can send a notice to Alyssa and saying,

428
19:18.517 --> 19:22.710
"Alyssa, you have a Mercedes GLS 63 AMG.

429
19:22.710 --> 19:24.240
Why don't you come in

430
19:24.240 --> 19:27.810
and we will change your summer tires to your winter tires?

431
19:27.810 --> 19:30.990
And we will store those summer tires for you,

432
19:30.990 --> 19:33.570
and we'll notify you when your summer tires

433
19:33.570 --> 19:35.430
need to be put on your car again."

434
19:35.430 --> 19:37.920
That for me is a lifetime value.

435
19:37.920 --> 19:40.230
That for me is building loyalty with the customer.

436
19:40.230 --> 19:42.600
That for me says, when I think service,

437
19:42.600 --> 19:43.980
I'll always think Goodyear.

438
19:43.980 --> 19:46.530
And when I think tires, I'll always think Goodyear.

439
19:47.730 --> 19:49.050
<v ->This is a great case study,</v>

440
19:49.050 --> 19:52.410
'cause I have to remember every year

441
19:52.410 --> 19:55.620
when my insurance gives me a, I live in Canada.

442
19:55.620 --> 19:58.080
You can feel sorry for me with the snow.

443
19:58.080 --> 20:02.220
But when I have to go change my tires,

444
20:02.220 --> 20:05.100
and by the time we call, you know,

445
20:05.100 --> 20:07.683
Mercedes-Benz is all jammed up with, you know,

446
20:08.757 --> 20:12.000
300,000 people wanting to change their tires.

447
20:12.000 --> 20:14.340
So early warning would be a great thing.

448
20:14.340 --> 20:15.873
<v ->Exactly, exactly.</v>

449
20:17.220 --> 20:21.360
<v ->Davie, what do you want to throw into this round?</v>

450
20:21.360 --> 20:22.950
<v ->I mean, we're talking about use cases.</v>

451
20:22.950 --> 20:25.503
So maybe a little bit different.

452
20:26.490 --> 20:30.630
I mean, we've been through a scaling of technology before,

453
20:30.630 --> 20:33.120
at least I think many of us have.

454
20:33.120 --> 20:35.070
And when I look at data patterns

455
20:35.070 --> 20:37.410
on how do you approach AI or gen AI,

456
20:37.410 --> 20:38.610
you look a little bit in the past

457
20:38.610 --> 20:39.930
to see how we've done it in the past.

458
20:39.930 --> 20:42.240
And that really helps break the big problem

459
20:42.240 --> 20:43.080
into smaller pieces.

460
20:43.080 --> 20:45.840
And one thing that we've done very well,

461
20:45.840 --> 20:48.510
or we've done I guess quite a lot over the past years

462
20:48.510 --> 20:49.710
is automation,

463
20:49.710 --> 20:52.920
especially when you talk about internal processes,

464
20:52.920 --> 20:55.950
looking again for productivity and efficiencies and impact.

465
20:55.950 --> 20:58.920
And if you think about, at least at Bosch,

466
20:58.920 --> 21:01.800
if you take the experience that we've built

467
21:01.800 --> 21:03.990
and hundreds of thousands of bot hours

468
21:03.990 --> 21:05.523
that have been processed,

469
21:06.630 --> 21:09.330
gen AI or AI in that same sense

470
21:09.330 --> 21:10.920
is a little bit of that same pattern.

471
21:10.920 --> 21:14.910
And so you can kind of build on that experience.

472
21:14.910 --> 21:17.640
I mean, it's about finding technology platforms

473
21:17.640 --> 21:21.720
or technology that fits within your security

474
21:21.720 --> 21:24.120
and privacy requirements.

475
21:24.120 --> 21:27.090
It's about finding tools that are easy to use

476
21:27.090 --> 21:28.680
in self-service

477
21:28.680 --> 21:31.982
that allows you to build on your citizen development aspects

478
21:31.982 --> 21:35.520
when you're starting to talk about gen AI or AI.

479
21:35.520 --> 21:37.890
And then finally it's about not leaving behind your people,

480
21:37.890 --> 21:41.520
because it's a very scary time in our organization

481
21:41.520 --> 21:44.310
when you start thinking about how AI is going to impact us

482
21:44.310 --> 21:45.420
and our world.

483
21:45.420 --> 21:48.540
And so if you look at that, and start to think about

484
21:48.540 --> 21:49.950
how you can start to implement that,

485
21:49.950 --> 21:51.570
that's maybe the next use case,

486
21:51.570 --> 21:54.990
is we've built what we've call Ask Bosch,

487
21:54.990 --> 21:58.320
which is an internal platform which allows our users

488
21:58.320 --> 22:02.940
to build, experiment and innovate in a very safe way, right?

489
22:02.940 --> 22:04.560
So with some guard rails

490
22:04.560 --> 22:06.840
that allows us to really experiment.

491
22:06.840 --> 22:10.290
And what we found is some really great examples

492
22:10.290 --> 22:11.640
that have come out,

493
22:11.640 --> 22:13.500
what I would say is more on the long tail

494
22:13.500 --> 22:15.630
of where AI or gen AI is

495
22:15.630 --> 22:18.060
and really how citizen development

496
22:18.060 --> 22:20.400
can bring a lot of a lot of value.

497
22:20.400 --> 22:24.390
One thing, if you think about our indirect procurement,

498
22:24.390 --> 22:27.810
as a buyer, you have access to 90,000 contracts.

499
22:27.810 --> 22:30.270
Each contract has 20 pages.

500
22:30.270 --> 22:32.190
Every time you have a single question about that,

501
22:32.190 --> 22:34.830
you have 30 clicks to come to your answer,

502
22:34.830 --> 22:36.270
28 different languages.

503
22:36.270 --> 22:40.347
I mean, it's a prime example of being able to use LLMs

504
22:40.347 --> 22:43.740
and a RAG solution to bring a very easy way

505
22:43.740 --> 22:45.870
to bring a lot of efficiency and impact.

506
22:45.870 --> 22:47.330
It makes your buyers happy,

507
22:47.330 --> 22:49.860
it makes your customers happy, it makes your people happy.

508
22:49.860 --> 22:51.990
And at the end of the day, that's really the target

509
22:51.990 --> 22:55.803
as we start to look at how AI can really make impact.

510
22:56.910 --> 22:59.130
<v ->This is really interesting.</v>

511
22:59.130 --> 23:01.530
We work around the world.

512
23:01.530 --> 23:04.590
And I recorded a webinar about a month ago,

513
23:04.590 --> 23:08.910
it just passed 1.1 million views yesterday.

514
23:08.910 --> 23:12.480
It's called the AI Revolution with Jim Harris.

515
23:12.480 --> 23:14.280
And, look it up.

516
23:14.280 --> 23:18.630
But I start with a 30 second piece in English,

517
23:18.630 --> 23:23.460
and then it's in Chinese and then it's in German

518
23:23.460 --> 23:26.940
and then Hindi and then Spanish and French.

519
23:26.940 --> 23:29.557
And the first time I did it, a woman came up to me and said,

520
23:29.557 --> 23:32.730
"Jim, your Mandarin was perfect."

521
23:32.730 --> 23:35.310
And I said (speaking Mandarin) which is thank you,

522
23:35.310 --> 23:37.170
the only word I know in Mandarin.

523
23:37.170 --> 23:41.280
And so really, it's how can we use AI,

524
23:41.280 --> 23:46.200
and this is a tool called HeyGen, how can we use AI,

525
23:46.200 --> 23:48.810
given that we work in many countries

526
23:48.810 --> 23:53.340
with many different manuals, and boom.

527
23:53.340 --> 23:56.070
And always adding value for our customer.

528
23:56.070 --> 23:58.470
We're gonna come for round two to you Alyssa,

529
23:58.470 --> 24:00.900
for the last word on round two.

530
24:00.900 --> 24:04.680
<v ->All right, well, so we work with a global pharma company.</v>

531
24:04.680 --> 24:07.080
So your example around being able

532
24:07.080 --> 24:11.160
to scale content globally is a good one.

533
24:11.160 --> 24:14.520
So what we've done is we've helped them really think about

534
24:14.520 --> 24:16.230
their whole content supply chain

535
24:16.230 --> 24:17.940
from a marketing perspective.

536
24:17.940 --> 24:20.730
They're spending a lot of money on outside agencies,

537
24:20.730 --> 24:24.330
spending a lot of money even within their organization.

538
24:24.330 --> 24:25.637
And as a pharma company,

539
24:25.637 --> 24:28.920
the biggest challenge they have is legal review.

540
24:28.920 --> 24:31.805
It would take like, too long

541
24:31.805 --> 24:34.011
to get marketing content out there,

542
24:34.011 --> 24:37.740
to get to the consumer, to personalize the content.

543
24:37.740 --> 24:39.540
So if you think about all the idea

544
24:39.540 --> 24:41.670
of really understanding the consumer

545
24:41.670 --> 24:44.070
from a predictive perspective,

546
24:44.070 --> 24:46.650
this tool is helping them do that,

547
24:46.650 --> 24:50.730
and it's helping them do that at scale across the globe.

548
24:50.730 --> 24:54.060
So we've seen seven times the number of reuse

549
24:54.060 --> 24:56.880
from content globally.

550
24:56.880 --> 24:59.670
They've been able to increase their speed to market

551
24:59.670 --> 25:01.380
by 30% to 40%.

552
25:01.380 --> 25:04.110
And it's all around thinking about, you know,

553
25:04.110 --> 25:06.540
how you're taking your whole process,

554
25:06.540 --> 25:09.180
but you're leveraging gen AI in the moment

555
25:09.180 --> 25:11.310
and you're building on what you're learning

556
25:11.310 --> 25:12.723
throughout the process.

557
25:13.590 --> 25:16.683
<v ->This makes me think about the use case of design</v>

558
25:16.683 --> 25:20.640
that Mamatha thought to throw in, which is,

559
25:20.640 --> 25:22.830
if I'm designing something new,

560
25:22.830 --> 25:25.953
whether it's a legal contract or a Jeep,

561
25:27.000 --> 25:29.220
why can't I access templates

562
25:29.220 --> 25:33.420
of parts or words of paragraphs and wording

563
25:33.420 --> 25:37.110
so that building a standard template,

564
25:37.110 --> 25:39.390
we don't have everybody reinventing the wheel

565
25:39.390 --> 25:42.000
all around the world in different languages,

566
25:42.000 --> 25:44.460
and now we have to carry, you know,

567
25:44.460 --> 25:49.110
19 million different nut sizes to make cars.

568
25:49.110 --> 25:54.110
So this can help in speed and standardization as well.

569
25:54.690 --> 25:58.440
Why don't you start with our third use case first?

570
25:58.440 --> 26:01.200
And we gotta keep it tight to two minutes.

571
26:01.200 --> 26:02.553
<v ->Okay, fantastic.</v>

572
26:03.510 --> 26:07.470
So the customer that I'm going to talk about is Amazon,

573
26:07.470 --> 26:09.690
a customer of Goodyear.

574
26:09.690 --> 26:11.640
And how are they a customer of Goodyear?

575
26:11.640 --> 26:13.740
We started as a proof of concept

576
26:13.740 --> 26:16.413
in one of the warehouses of Amazon.

577
26:17.250 --> 26:20.040
And so Amazon has this UEI,

578
26:20.040 --> 26:22.890
which is a visual inspection technology.

579
26:22.890 --> 26:26.010
It's looking at the undercarriage and around the vehicle

580
26:26.010 --> 26:27.870
on the defects

581
26:27.870 --> 26:32.280
as overnight the vehicles are rolling into the warehouse.

582
26:32.280 --> 26:34.710
And we started as a proof of concept,

583
26:34.710 --> 26:38.790
setting up a service point in the Amazon warehouse,

584
26:38.790 --> 26:41.730
a Goodyear service point in the Amazon warehouse,

585
26:41.730 --> 26:44.130
collecting those vehicle signals,

586
26:44.130 --> 26:46.507
sending it to the fleet manager and saying,

587
26:46.507 --> 26:48.213
"On this particular vehicle,

588
26:49.796 --> 26:52.440
this is the maintenance that needs to be done.

589
26:52.440 --> 26:57.440
And if you do not schedule it, you know, two weeks later,

590
26:57.630 --> 27:01.170
here is the unplanned downtime that you could expect

591
27:01.170 --> 27:02.937
from this particular vehicle."

592
27:03.870 --> 27:07.170
And so because fleet managers,

593
27:07.170 --> 27:12.170
they spend 50% of this administrative effort

594
27:12.630 --> 27:16.770
is on looking at these alerts on notifications

595
27:16.770 --> 27:18.060
on various vehicles,

596
27:18.060 --> 27:21.360
and when is it that they need to schedule maintenance

597
27:21.360 --> 27:22.320
for these vehicles?

598
27:22.320 --> 27:23.153
And we said,

599
27:23.153 --> 27:27.060
why don't we just automate this whole thing for Amazon?

600
27:27.060 --> 27:29.160
So we started as a proof of concept.

601
27:29.160 --> 27:33.903
Today in the US we are in 1/3 of the Amazon warehouses.

602
27:34.995 --> 27:36.420
1/3!

603
27:36.420 --> 27:41.130
And now we are expanding globally with Amazon

604
27:41.130 --> 27:46.093
to EMEA as well as to APAC and also within US.

605
27:47.190 --> 27:49.500
And think about the fleet manager,

606
27:49.500 --> 27:53.462
instead of administrating, now he is spending time

607
27:53.462 --> 27:57.060
actually looking at the productivity of his fleet.

608
27:57.060 --> 27:58.980
<v ->So this is a great use case</v>

609
27:58.980 --> 28:02.550
because the manager is now doing higher value-added,

610
28:02.550 --> 28:04.140
more strategic things.

611
28:04.140 --> 28:05.430
Fantastic.

612
28:05.430 --> 28:07.140
We're gonna go into round three,

613
28:07.140 --> 28:08.880
and this has to be a lightning round

614
28:08.880 --> 28:12.720
because it'd be great to get some questions from you,

615
28:12.720 --> 28:14.253
our dear audience.

616
28:15.210 --> 28:16.680
So start us off on round--

617
28:16.680 --> 28:17.850
<v ->I can start.</v>
<v ->Okay.</v>

618
28:17.850 --> 28:19.050
<v ->So lightning round.</v>

619
28:19.050 --> 28:21.270
I think the last use case I would bring is

620
28:21.270 --> 28:24.660
we have a ticketing system implementation,

621
28:24.660 --> 28:25.860
which is one of the major ones

622
28:25.860 --> 28:28.350
that we have at Bosch at the moment.

623
28:28.350 --> 28:31.230
And what we found, at least when you think about

624
28:31.230 --> 28:32.250
how do we implement

625
28:32.250 --> 28:35.040
or how do we bring AI into our organization,

626
28:35.040 --> 28:36.480
there's two general ways.

627
28:36.480 --> 28:38.640
One is what we call Use AI

628
28:38.640 --> 28:40.920
and one is called, what we call is Build AI.

629
28:40.920 --> 28:42.630
So Build AI is just like the name,

630
28:42.630 --> 28:44.940
you are building custom LLMs,

631
28:44.940 --> 28:47.310
bringing custom differentiating components

632
28:47.310 --> 28:49.050
into your organization.

633
28:49.050 --> 28:49.980
The second is Use.

634
28:49.980 --> 28:51.840
And this is exactly, we are just using

635
28:51.840 --> 28:52.980
what our partners are building.

636
28:52.980 --> 28:55.260
And I think sometimes we forget about that,

637
28:55.260 --> 28:57.210
but that's what we found has a lot of impact.

638
28:57.210 --> 28:59.670
And so for example, our partner ServiceNow

639
28:59.670 --> 29:01.830
is implementing Now Assist,

640
29:01.830 --> 29:06.060
which gives us immediately access to gen AI components

641
29:06.060 --> 29:07.350
inside of our organization.

642
29:07.350 --> 29:09.990
So a use case in our logistics area

643
29:09.990 --> 29:12.420
is we're getting transport messages

644
29:12.420 --> 29:14.043
from a number of our suppliers.

645
29:15.000 --> 29:16.800
And these come in different languages,

646
29:16.800 --> 29:18.660
they come at different times of the day,

647
29:18.660 --> 29:20.490
and they come very disparate.

648
29:20.490 --> 29:22.260
And what we're able to do now is, again,

649
29:22.260 --> 29:25.020
bring it all together, summarization, language,

650
29:25.020 --> 29:26.760
natural language processing,

651
29:26.760 --> 29:29.820
and makes our agents' life much easier,

652
29:29.820 --> 29:31.050
makes them much more efficient,

653
29:31.050 --> 29:33.870
and allow them to really respond,

654
29:33.870 --> 29:36.180
which impacts our production.

655
29:36.180 --> 29:37.650
So it's really, at the end of the day,

656
29:37.650 --> 29:40.380
small changes using that generative AI

657
29:40.380 --> 29:42.393
that comes out of the box.

658
29:43.560 --> 29:46.230
I can't say enough about that in those cases.

659
29:46.230 --> 29:47.970
<v Jim>Fantastic.</v>

660
29:47.970 --> 29:49.080
Alyssa?

661
29:49.080 --> 29:51.600
<v ->All right, so interestingly enough,</v>

662
29:51.600 --> 29:54.450
we've been working with this House of Beauty brands.

663
29:54.450 --> 29:58.590
And you know, they sell to not only retailers,

664
29:58.590 --> 30:00.450
but they also sell to salons.

665
30:00.450 --> 30:02.610
So they have a whole B2B capability.

666
30:02.610 --> 30:05.100
And what they really needed was

667
30:05.100 --> 30:07.440
how do they get their salespeople

668
30:07.440 --> 30:09.390
to have a level playing field,

669
30:09.390 --> 30:12.510
really understand who they're going in to see,

670
30:12.510 --> 30:15.000
how they're serving up the content.

671
30:15.000 --> 30:18.120
Very similar in the automotive space, as you've heard,

672
30:18.120 --> 30:20.520
you know, really understanding, diagnosing

673
30:20.520 --> 30:22.260
what they need to go in and sell.

674
30:22.260 --> 30:26.880
So we help them leverage gen AI to think about how they,

675
30:26.880 --> 30:30.870
you know, are serving up content to the salespeople.

676
30:30.870 --> 30:31.980
But I think even more so,

677
30:31.980 --> 30:34.350
when the salesperson gets into their car,

678
30:34.350 --> 30:36.180
they can actually talk to the tool,

679
30:36.180 --> 30:38.310
the tool will write up their notes,

680
30:38.310 --> 30:41.490
prepare a email back to the client,

681
30:41.490 --> 30:43.770
make sure they're sending their orders through.

682
30:43.770 --> 30:45.720
And we're in the midst of this,

683
30:45.720 --> 30:48.570
we're launching in one country, in Germany right now.

684
30:48.570 --> 30:51.120
And one of the things that I wanted to share is,

685
30:51.120 --> 30:52.920
you know, when we initiated this,

686
30:52.920 --> 30:54.840
our biggest challenge was data

687
30:54.840 --> 30:56.940
and making sure they had the right data

688
30:56.940 --> 30:58.500
to be able to activate this.

689
30:58.500 --> 31:02.340
So as you begin to think about predictive

690
31:02.340 --> 31:05.700
and how you're entering the marketplace with gen AI,

691
31:05.700 --> 31:08.640
with your use cases, really thinking about the data

692
31:08.640 --> 31:11.730
and testing it in a way where it's action-oriented

693
31:11.730 --> 31:15.990
and you can get content out there to people quickly

694
31:15.990 --> 31:16.923
to test it out.

695
31:18.060 --> 31:19.230
<v ->This is a great example.</v>

696
31:19.230 --> 31:21.720
I know one CEO in the pharma space,

697
31:21.720 --> 31:26.720
and she's got a 5X increase in open rates of her emails.

698
31:26.790 --> 31:29.280
Because what she does is she uses ChatGPT

699
31:29.280 --> 31:31.530
to research her prospect,

700
31:31.530 --> 31:34.740
the CEO she's gonna pitch and the company,

701
31:34.740 --> 31:36.300
to figure out their pain points

702
31:36.300 --> 31:40.140
and then intersect that with her offerings.

703
31:40.140 --> 31:44.280
And so it's not spamming people with the same email,

704
31:44.280 --> 31:47.970
it is highly targeted to the real pain points

705
31:47.970 --> 31:49.800
of that particular individual.

706
31:49.800 --> 31:52.045
So I see a one-to-one future

707
31:52.045 --> 31:55.770
that you've been talking about, Alyssa, which is how do we,

708
31:55.770 --> 31:56.880
whether it's Marriott,

709
31:56.880 --> 31:59.340
customize our offering just for you

710
31:59.340 --> 32:04.290
with a dog or a bachelorette party or these other cases.

711
32:04.290 --> 32:07.440
So we're gonna see more personalization,

712
32:07.440 --> 32:10.353
which people then interpret as higher quality.

713
32:11.635 --> 32:14.673
So it's an interesting time we're living in.

714
32:15.690 --> 32:17.100
Our final example,

715
32:17.100 --> 32:18.810
and then we'll take a couple of questions,

716
32:18.810 --> 32:21.360
and then if there aren't enough questions,

717
32:21.360 --> 32:23.250
we'll come back to another case study.

718
32:23.250 --> 32:24.240
<v ->Great, thanks Jim.</v>

719
32:24.240 --> 32:26.040
So we covered the enterprise

720
32:26.040 --> 32:28.620
and improving inventory through ForecastGPT.

721
32:28.620 --> 32:31.110
We talked about improving distracted driving

722
32:31.110 --> 32:34.200
through our Ready Care product in the automotive space.

723
32:34.200 --> 32:35.220
The last I'll share with

724
32:35.220 --> 32:38.790
is on our lifestyle business and our consumer audio.

725
32:38.790 --> 32:41.460
In terms of how we manage customer calls,

726
32:41.460 --> 32:44.010
you know, we average 300,000 to 400,000

727
32:44.010 --> 32:46.020
customer calls a year,

728
32:46.020 --> 32:49.350
inquiries about technical questions

729
32:49.350 --> 32:52.350
on our smart audio products and our headphones,

730
32:52.350 --> 32:57.350
or returns, or wanting to know more about, you know,

731
32:57.720 --> 33:00.060
recommended products.

732
33:00.060 --> 33:04.950
And so we're using customer sentiment analysis with AI

733
33:04.950 --> 33:09.090
to help really augment the case calls with our call center.

734
33:09.090 --> 33:12.150
And what we're seeing is the AI goes through

735
33:12.150 --> 33:15.090
and will look at the contextual information,

736
33:15.090 --> 33:17.430
and within 300 milliseconds will help

737
33:17.430 --> 33:21.870
informing the call center person the customer sentiment.

738
33:21.870 --> 33:24.960
You know, is the customer frustrated, is there inquisitive,

739
33:24.960 --> 33:27.990
are they negative, are they neutral,

740
33:27.990 --> 33:30.303
or are they a promoter of the product?

741
33:32.064 --> 33:35.160
And from that very quick analysis,

742
33:35.160 --> 33:39.210
it arms the call center person to really narrow in on

743
33:39.210 --> 33:41.820
how to serve the needs of that customer as efficiently

744
33:41.820 --> 33:43.470
and as effectively as possible.

745
33:43.470 --> 33:45.420
It normally takes us, you know, before that,

746
33:45.420 --> 33:49.110
one to five minutes to really look through the questions,

747
33:49.110 --> 33:50.370
the case, the information,

748
33:50.370 --> 33:53.430
and really provide a level of information and accuracy.

749
33:53.430 --> 33:55.710
The bot does it in, you know, 91% accuracy,

750
33:55.710 --> 33:58.950
providing more intelligence to the call center.

751
33:58.950 --> 34:01.380
And so when you're talking about that volume,

752
34:01.380 --> 34:03.243
you're talking about that efficiency.

753
34:04.500 --> 34:07.680
And you know, most importantly we're seeing

754
34:07.680 --> 34:11.820
that over 60% to 70% of the calls

755
34:11.820 --> 34:15.660
are going from a negative sentiment to a positive sentiment

756
34:15.660 --> 34:17.520
just based on the way we're interacting.

757
34:17.520 --> 34:21.000
And I know there's a lot of talk about AI replacing, right?

758
34:21.000 --> 34:23.040
But what we look at is how does it augment,

759
34:23.040 --> 34:25.830
how do we provide human-centric solutions

760
34:25.830 --> 34:28.500
that improve the experience

761
34:28.500 --> 34:30.120
with the human in the center of the loop?

762
34:30.120 --> 34:31.680
So I think this is, again,

763
34:31.680 --> 34:34.770
when we design these kinds of things,

764
34:34.770 --> 34:35.730
when we wanna differentiate,

765
34:35.730 --> 34:38.910
and I think Mamatha, you talked about customers have choice.

766
34:38.910 --> 34:41.910
They can buy products from a lot of different opportunities.

767
34:41.910 --> 34:45.420
But they want that personalized, unique experience,

768
34:45.420 --> 34:47.130
seamless and frictionless.

769
34:47.130 --> 34:49.320
And that's what will drive not only loyalty,

770
34:49.320 --> 34:53.182
but you know, our long-term reputation

771
34:53.182 --> 34:56.463
when it comes to being a very customer-centric company.

772
34:57.450 --> 34:58.770
<v ->This is a great example.</v>

773
34:58.770 --> 35:01.710
I've only been dealing with my bank for 50 years,

774
35:01.710 --> 35:03.030
and when I want a new product,

775
35:03.030 --> 35:05.160
they ask me my name, my address.

776
35:05.160 --> 35:07.530
You know, only 50 years I've been dealing with them.

777
35:07.530 --> 35:10.710
So how can we get out of the way all the stuff

778
35:10.710 --> 35:15.090
that actually creates a very negative interaction experience

779
35:15.090 --> 35:17.040
and automate all that?

780
35:17.040 --> 35:21.840
So dear audience, we have four minutes and 20 seconds left.

781
35:21.840 --> 35:26.640
So if you'd like to ask this great panel a question,

782
35:26.640 --> 35:28.980
come to the mic.

783
35:28.980 --> 35:31.020
We'll take number one.

784
35:31.020 --> 35:33.420
And we're in our speed round, remember.

785
35:33.420 --> 35:34.320
<v Audience Member>Thank you.</v>

786
35:34.320 --> 35:36.150
I have a question related to you,

787
35:36.150 --> 35:39.120
the master technician example that you had.

788
35:39.120 --> 35:42.150
And you know, for like consulting companies,

789
35:42.150 --> 35:45.300
you could have the same type of situation

790
35:45.300 --> 35:49.050
where there's very experienced people in the company,

791
35:49.050 --> 35:51.030
but all of that knowledge is not necessarily

792
35:51.030 --> 35:52.830
written down somewhere.

793
35:52.830 --> 35:54.570
So how do you get it,

794
35:54.570 --> 35:56.910
I mean, they don't put a USB stick into their head.

795
35:56.910 --> 35:59.013
So how do you get it into--
<v ->Not yet.</v>

796
35:59.013 --> 36:00.210
<v Audience Member>Into a format</v>

797
36:00.210 --> 36:03.810
where generative or predictive AI can help you?

798
36:03.810 --> 36:05.070
<v ->That's an amazing question.</v>

799
36:05.070 --> 36:06.270
<v ->Yeah, great question.</v>

800
36:06.270 --> 36:07.890
I mean, to answer the question

801
36:07.890 --> 36:10.020
specifically for the Super Technician,

802
36:10.020 --> 36:12.870
it's because with Bosch's experience

803
36:12.870 --> 36:16.350
and over 100 years of a company with the data,

804
36:16.350 --> 36:17.550
we have that.

805
36:17.550 --> 36:20.310
And the problem wasn't necessarily putting a USB stick,

806
36:20.310 --> 36:22.080
although that probably would've been easier

807
36:22.080 --> 36:24.480
than trying to consolidate all the data that we have

808
36:24.480 --> 36:26.010
and the different data lakes.

809
36:26.010 --> 36:27.420
That was the exercise.

810
36:27.420 --> 36:28.830
It was trying to bring the data

811
36:28.830 --> 36:31.170
in a way that was easily consumable.

812
36:31.170 --> 36:34.800
And what gen AI allowed us to do is exactly that.

813
36:34.800 --> 36:37.560
So it was leveraging knowledge graphs,

814
36:37.560 --> 36:39.870
we brought in the natural language aspect,

815
36:39.870 --> 36:43.440
and then we really brought a easy interface

816
36:43.440 --> 36:44.640
for those technicians.

817
36:44.640 --> 36:46.650
Even if you started the first day,

818
36:46.650 --> 36:48.450
you can now come in and have access to that.

819
36:48.450 --> 36:49.890
And you can correlate that

820
36:49.890 --> 36:51.720
to really a lot of other industries.

821
36:51.720 --> 36:53.640
I mean, especially in the software development,

822
36:53.640 --> 36:56.070
I guess you can also look at that in the same way.

823
36:56.070 --> 36:57.810
You have peer programming,

824
36:57.810 --> 37:00.090
where senior developers are the ones that are doing

825
37:00.090 --> 37:01.470
with all the knowledge.

826
37:01.470 --> 37:03.210
So it's going to be, you can correlate that

827
37:03.210 --> 37:04.740
to a lot of other aspects.

828
37:04.740 --> 37:06.270
But hopefully that answers the question.

829
37:06.270 --> 37:09.510
<v ->You probably also had expert technician use the app,</v>

830
37:09.510 --> 37:10.770
because it's a learning agent

831
37:10.770 --> 37:13.080
and it's learning to get better and better

832
37:13.080 --> 37:16.260
and mimic the behavior of the expert technician.

833
37:16.260 --> 37:17.926
<v ->Yes. I mean, at the end of the day,</v>

834
37:17.926 --> 37:20.103
that's the holy grail is that service data, yeah.

835
37:21.090 --> 37:24.810
<v ->We are at the early innings of this AI revolution.</v>

836
37:24.810 --> 37:26.280
Microsoft before the show

837
37:26.280 --> 37:28.770
announced it will spend $80 billion,

838
37:28.770 --> 37:31.117
I feel a Dr. Evil moment coming on,

839
37:31.117 --> 37:36.117
$80 billion on AI data centers, 50% of them in the US.

840
37:36.540 --> 37:39.750
So Microsoft is really doubling down on AI.

841
37:39.750 --> 37:43.980
So we are just at the start of this AI revolution.

842
37:43.980 --> 37:46.530
And these case studies we've heard today

843
37:46.530 --> 37:48.840
are gonna continue to advance.

844
37:48.840 --> 37:52.680
We have time for one more quick question if there is one.

845
37:52.680 --> 37:56.190
And if there isn't one, by show of hands, I don't see one,

846
37:56.190 --> 38:00.750
we're just gonna go to a quick 15 second final insight

847
38:00.750 --> 38:01.800
from everyone.

848
38:01.800 --> 38:04.050
Who wants to start it?

849
38:04.050 --> 38:05.996
Davie, why don't you start us off on the far end there?

850
38:05.996 --> 38:07.050
<v ->(laughing) Okay, thanks.</v>

851
38:07.050 --> 38:10.290
I mean, I think as I said, look in your organization

852
38:10.290 --> 38:13.710
for other ways that you've scaled technology successful.

853
38:13.710 --> 38:18.710
Take those lessons learned and bring AI in that same way.

854
38:18.720 --> 38:20.880
And please don't forget your people,

855
38:20.880 --> 38:22.230
because they're the most important part

856
38:22.230 --> 38:23.670
of that transformation.

857
38:23.670 --> 38:24.503
<v Jim>Fantastic.</v>

858
38:24.503 --> 38:25.668
Mamatha?

859
38:25.668 --> 38:29.340
<v ->So what I would say is do not try to</v>

860
38:29.340 --> 38:33.540
hold all of this knowledge and expertise in one small group.

861
38:33.540 --> 38:37.440
Try to democratize it and create a tool set

862
38:37.440 --> 38:40.380
and platform that all employees could use.

863
38:40.380 --> 38:43.650
And when you have Millennial and Gen Z kind of employees

864
38:43.650 --> 38:45.960
that are used to this way of working,

865
38:45.960 --> 38:49.560
this kind of tool set will help implement things

866
38:49.560 --> 38:52.380
and bring things faster to market for your company.

867
38:52.380 --> 38:55.440
So don't just leave it to an engineering

868
38:55.440 --> 38:58.294
or any other organization, democratize it.

869
38:58.294 --> 38:59.375
<v ->Yeah.</v>

870
38:59.375 --> 39:01.290
I would say that,

871
39:01.290 --> 39:03.450
make sure you have a strong governance model

872
39:03.450 --> 39:05.850
and you're building ethical, responsible,

873
39:05.850 --> 39:08.340
and explainable AI models.

874
39:08.340 --> 39:10.560
The human has to be at the center of the loop,

875
39:10.560 --> 39:13.290
both from a validation and biases perspective.

876
39:13.290 --> 39:14.970
But digital trust is everything.

877
39:14.970 --> 39:18.337
And so making sure you have a very strong governance model

878
39:18.337 --> 39:22.470
incorporated into your frameworks is incredibly important.

879
39:22.470 --> 39:23.303
<v ->Fantastic.</v>

880
39:23.303 --> 39:27.150
And we are gonna finish in the very same place we began.

881
39:27.150 --> 39:30.570
<v ->Okay, so think of yourself as inventors.</v>

882
39:30.570 --> 39:33.300
And not only focusing on technology,

883
39:33.300 --> 39:35.220
think about how you're creating strategy,

884
39:35.220 --> 39:37.800
how you're creating experiences.

885
39:37.800 --> 39:40.410
It will change the way your organizations work.

886
39:40.410 --> 39:42.330
So thinking about it holistically

887
39:42.330 --> 39:45.660
and really changing the mindset of what you do every day.

888
39:45.660 --> 39:47.280
<v ->This has been an amazing panel.</v>

889
39:47.280 --> 39:50.490
This is gonna go up 28 to 48 hours from now,

890
39:50.490 --> 39:52.260
live stream, not live streaming,

891
39:52.260 --> 39:54.660
streaming on the CTA website.

892
39:54.660 --> 39:56.940
So tell your friends about it.

893
39:56.940 --> 40:00.840
If you could join with me in thanking this amazing panel

894
40:00.840 --> 40:02.452
for their insights.

895
40:02.452 --> 40:05.334
(all applauding)

896
40:05.334 --> 40:08.001
(upbeat jingle)
