1
00:00.125 --> 00:02.708
(upbeat music)

2
00:10.470 --> 00:13.800
<v ->Hope everybody's having an amazing CES.</v>

3
00:13.800 --> 00:16.110
This panel is about,

4
00:16.110 --> 00:20.220
do you need a chief cybersecurity officer?

5
00:20.220 --> 00:22.110
And we're ready to get started.

6
00:22.110 --> 00:24.090
A little bit about me before.

7
00:24.090 --> 00:27.540
I'm an editor at ZDNET on the news team.

8
00:27.540 --> 00:28.890
I've covered cybersecurity

9
00:28.890 --> 00:32.520
and enterprise coverage topics before.

10
00:32.520 --> 00:34.800
Right now, I focus on AI,

11
00:34.800 --> 00:36.270
particularly helping our audience

12
00:36.270 --> 00:40.230
learn how to navigate the AI revolution we're currently in.

13
00:40.230 --> 00:43.020
But enough about that. Now to our amazing panelists.

14
00:43.020 --> 00:44.460
I would love to kick off the panel

15
00:44.460 --> 00:46.740
by letting them each introduce themselves.

16
00:46.740 --> 00:49.170
So just tell us a little bit about who you are,

17
00:49.170 --> 00:51.960
what you do, and how you got into cybersecurity.

18
00:51.960 --> 00:54.330
<v ->Got it. Well, thank you, Sabrina.</v>

19
00:54.330 --> 00:56.343
And, you know, welcome, everybody here.

20
00:57.240 --> 01:00.123
So my name is Nabil Bukhari. I work for Extreme Networks.

21
01:01.020 --> 01:02.220
You might be familiar with it.

22
01:02.220 --> 01:05.790
Extreme Networks is the largest pure play networking company

23
01:05.790 --> 01:07.413
for enterprises on the planet.

24
01:08.640 --> 01:11.070
Who's who in the world,

25
01:11.070 --> 01:13.110
you know, that runs on our technology.

26
01:13.110 --> 01:15.780
For example, if you ever go to a sports stadium

27
01:15.780 --> 01:17.670
in US and half of Europe,

28
01:17.670 --> 01:19.410
you're probably on our network.

29
01:19.410 --> 01:21.450
You know, when you go fly anywhere,

30
01:21.450 --> 01:23.490
you're probably on our network.

31
01:23.490 --> 01:26.070
You get packages. Those come through our network.

32
01:26.070 --> 01:29.310
So we're very, very widely deployed out there.

33
01:29.310 --> 01:31.170
My role there, I play multiple roles there.

34
01:31.170 --> 01:32.760
I'm the CTO, I'm the CPO,

35
01:32.760 --> 01:35.340
I'm also the general manager of the subscription business,

36
01:35.340 --> 01:38.733
so you can say that I'm half technology and half business.

37
01:39.840 --> 01:41.460
How did we get into cybersecurity?

38
01:41.460 --> 01:44.190
I think we moved into the security space

39
01:44.190 --> 01:46.080
about three or four years ago,

40
01:46.080 --> 01:49.350
and we moved in there because we felt that security

41
01:49.350 --> 01:52.800
was kind of like a overlay niche market by itself,

42
01:52.800 --> 01:54.750
and we felt that that was the most inefficient way

43
01:54.750 --> 01:56.610
to secure our clients,

44
01:56.610 --> 01:59.490
and that's why we ended up kind of moving into that space

45
01:59.490 --> 02:00.840
and converging the networking

46
02:00.840 --> 02:02.400
and security products together.

47
02:02.400 --> 02:05.310
So that's kind of, you know, who I am, what we are doing,

48
02:05.310 --> 02:08.430
and how we are related to cybersecurity, yeah.

49
02:08.430 --> 02:10.590
<v ->Well, thank you so much. Karen?</v>

50
02:10.590 --> 02:11.940
<v ->Hi, I am Karen Evans.</v>

51
02:11.940 --> 02:14.970
I'm the managing director for the Cyber Readiness Institute.

52
02:14.970 --> 02:17.190
And do you wanna know how

53
02:17.190 --> 02:19.740
the Cyber Readiness Institute got started

54
02:19.740 --> 02:21.780
or how I got started in cyber?

55
02:21.780 --> 02:24.240
'Cause those are two different things

56
02:24.240 --> 02:28.230
and the reason why I do the Cyber Readiness Institute.

57
02:28.230 --> 02:31.320
So it's a nonprofit that's focused

58
02:31.320 --> 02:33.240
on small and medium businesses,

59
02:33.240 --> 02:37.500
and what we do is we're focused on four core issues,

60
02:37.500 --> 02:40.560
which is considered cyber hygiene,

61
02:40.560 --> 02:42.450
but it's really about human behavior

62
02:42.450 --> 02:47.010
and the focus and culture of an organization

63
02:47.010 --> 02:50.040
so that you're always focused on what is the risk

64
02:50.040 --> 02:52.770
and that you ingrain this into all your employees,

65
02:52.770 --> 02:54.090
and it's free.

66
02:54.090 --> 02:58.470
And the reason why the Cyber Readiness Institute got started

67
02:58.470 --> 03:00.420
is because several years ago,

68
03:00.420 --> 03:02.730
President Obama had a commission

69
03:02.730 --> 03:05.010
as it related to cybersecurity,

70
03:05.010 --> 03:08.010
and the two co-chairs on that,

71
03:08.010 --> 03:11.610
one of which is our leader, which is Sam Palmisano.

72
03:11.610 --> 03:14.820
A few of you might know him. He used to run IBM.

73
03:14.820 --> 03:17.130
He runs several nonprofits now.

74
03:17.130 --> 03:21.330
He's also running a big venture capital fund.

75
03:21.330 --> 03:23.640
They made all these recommendations,

76
03:23.640 --> 03:25.290
but they knew that the funding

77
03:25.290 --> 03:27.570
was gonna go to state and local governments

78
03:27.570 --> 03:30.780
and then to critical infrastructure.

79
03:30.780 --> 03:34.110
And their recognition was small and medium businesses

80
03:34.110 --> 03:36.840
are the economic driver of every country

81
03:36.840 --> 03:39.543
and that if they don't get it right,

82
03:40.500 --> 03:43.200
it's gonna affect the supply chains of everything.

83
03:43.200 --> 03:46.230
And I thought that that was pretty intuitive

84
03:46.230 --> 03:48.930
and have a lot of foresight on their part.

85
03:48.930 --> 03:50.730
The other person who was his partner,

86
03:50.730 --> 03:52.080
and this is Ajay Banga,

87
03:52.080 --> 03:54.600
who was the CEO of MasterCard at the time,

88
03:54.600 --> 03:57.390
and he's now in charge of the World Bank.

89
03:57.390 --> 04:01.380
But the companies that belong to CRI that started this

90
04:01.380 --> 04:03.063
are MasterCard, Apple,

91
04:04.530 --> 04:09.530
it was GM, ExxonMobil, and then Principal Financial,

92
04:09.630 --> 04:11.040
and now T-Mobile is there.

93
04:11.040 --> 04:13.470
So it's a small group of companies

94
04:13.470 --> 04:16.440
that are very focused globally

95
04:16.440 --> 04:20.490
on the economics supply chain

96
04:20.490 --> 04:23.910
of a lot of different industries across the board.

97
04:23.910 --> 04:25.950
So that's how that got started.

98
04:25.950 --> 04:27.540
But I'll save my story

99
04:27.540 --> 04:30.240
of how I got started in cybersecurity

100
04:30.240 --> 04:32.130
'cause that one is always...

101
04:32.130 --> 04:33.330
You don't wanna follow it,

102
04:33.330 --> 04:36.690
so I'll hold it
(panelists laugh)

103
04:36.690 --> 04:39.728
until the right time to share it.

104
04:39.728 --> 04:41.040
<v ->Okay, well thank you.</v>
<v ->I appreciate that.</v>

105
04:41.040 --> 04:42.180
<v ->Kevin?</v>

106
04:42.180 --> 04:44.280
<v ->Yeah, I appreciate that, Karen.</v>

107
04:44.280 --> 04:47.700
So my name's Kevin, co-founder and CEO of Doppel.

108
04:47.700 --> 04:49.650
We're an AI cybersecurity startup

109
04:49.650 --> 04:51.660
that started just a couple years ago,

110
04:51.660 --> 04:55.233
and we're now the fastest growing company in our vertical.

111
04:56.100 --> 04:57.720
We serve, you know, everyone

112
04:57.720 --> 05:00.000
from small and medium-sized businesses

113
05:00.000 --> 05:03.390
to high-growth startups to Fortune 500s,

114
05:03.390 --> 05:06.660
and we focus in particular on all things social engineering.

115
05:06.660 --> 05:08.910
So if you've ever gotten a text

116
05:08.910 --> 05:11.130
from someone pretending to be your boss

117
05:11.130 --> 05:14.520
or if you've seen, you know, maybe a fake LinkedIn profile

118
05:14.520 --> 05:17.220
of, you know, someone pretending to be part of your company

119
05:17.220 --> 05:20.160
or, you know, even just a traditional phishing email, right,

120
05:20.160 --> 05:22.440
and spoof website,

121
05:22.440 --> 05:24.360
our job is to go and detect

122
05:24.360 --> 05:26.280
and, you know, analyze all those sorts of threats

123
05:26.280 --> 05:28.203
and then take them down at the source.

124
05:29.430 --> 05:31.890
You know, how I got into cybersecurity,

125
05:31.890 --> 05:34.410
so before all this and before Doppel,

126
05:34.410 --> 05:36.990
I was a software engineer at Uber and Lyft.

127
05:36.990 --> 05:39.780
Worked on dispatch systems and flying cars,

128
05:39.780 --> 05:43.650
so very different world than cybersecurity.

129
05:43.650 --> 05:47.130
But, you know, kind of cliche Silicon Valley story,

130
05:47.130 --> 05:49.980
my co-founder and I, Rahul, wanted to start something

131
05:49.980 --> 05:51.870
and do it in the AI space,

132
05:51.870 --> 05:55.170
where, you know, he was roommates

133
05:55.170 --> 05:56.400
and is still very good friends

134
05:56.400 --> 06:00.240
with one of the lead researchers at ChatGPT and OpenAI.

135
06:00.240 --> 06:03.360
And, you know, seeing how that was changing the world

136
06:03.360 --> 06:05.477
made it very clear that there needed to be new products

137
06:05.477 --> 06:09.540
in the cybersecurity space, so that's how we ended up here.

138
06:09.540 --> 06:11.520
<v ->Well, thank you so much for those introductions.</v>

139
06:11.520 --> 06:12.480
I think we should jump

140
06:12.480 --> 06:16.110
right into the title of our session today.

141
06:16.110 --> 06:20.400
Do companies need a chief information security officer,

142
06:20.400 --> 06:23.493
also known as a CISO in the industry?

143
06:24.420 --> 06:26.400
Who's ready to take it on?

144
06:26.400 --> 06:27.848
<v ->I'll-</v>
<v ->You go first.</v>

145
06:27.848 --> 06:28.860
<v ->I go first.</v>

146
06:28.860 --> 06:30.480
We'll keep the sequence.
<v ->We were prepping for this,</v>

147
06:30.480 --> 06:32.580
and it was really...

148
06:32.580 --> 06:35.460
They had to cut us off in the prep session, so you go first.

149
06:35.460 --> 06:37.920
<v ->Yeah, all right. (laughs)</v>

150
06:37.920 --> 06:41.670
So, Sabrina, I think the answer is it depends, right?

151
06:41.670 --> 06:45.060
So I think the general thought that people think,

152
06:45.060 --> 06:46.680
like, "Oh, my god, if I don't have a CISO

153
06:46.680 --> 06:49.980
then I don't have a security policy or security strategy

154
06:49.980 --> 06:51.330
or I'm, like, under a lot of risk."

155
06:51.330 --> 06:53.550
I think that is all bullshit.

156
06:53.550 --> 06:57.600
That's more, you know, kind of hype than anything else.

157
06:57.600 --> 07:00.270
When we see out in the market

158
07:00.270 --> 07:02.610
is that most of the companies,

159
07:02.610 --> 07:04.980
actually even at the mid level and the high level,

160
07:04.980 --> 07:07.110
actually don't really have dedicated CISOs

161
07:07.110 --> 07:08.910
in the E-staff, right?

162
07:08.910 --> 07:09.750
And most of the times,

163
07:09.750 --> 07:12.300
they actually report in to the CIOs, right?

164
07:12.300 --> 07:13.770
So we see that trend quite a bit.

165
07:13.770 --> 07:15.930
I would say that since this panel

166
07:15.930 --> 07:18.123
is about small to medium business,

167
07:19.080 --> 07:20.460
I would say every business should decide

168
07:20.460 --> 07:21.360
whether they need it or not,

169
07:21.360 --> 07:23.490
but I would give you three things to consider.

170
07:23.490 --> 07:25.260
Number one is cost, right?

171
07:25.260 --> 07:26.790
If you're a 200-people company,

172
07:26.790 --> 07:29.130
do you really have the business

173
07:29.130 --> 07:30.480
and do you even have the money

174
07:30.480 --> 07:34.590
to actually create a complete CISO organization?

175
07:34.590 --> 07:36.540
Most, probably not, and at that point in time,

176
07:36.540 --> 07:39.390
the risk and the benefit, they don't really match up.

177
07:39.390 --> 07:41.610
So one is related to your size.

178
07:41.610 --> 07:43.170
Second is related to your business.

179
07:43.170 --> 07:45.840
Depending upon if you are in healthcare,

180
07:45.840 --> 07:47.430
then that's a very different answer

181
07:47.430 --> 07:49.650
compared to, you know, an industry

182
07:49.650 --> 07:51.330
that is not that highly regulated.

183
07:51.330 --> 07:52.950
So that will be the second part.

184
07:52.950 --> 07:56.460
And the third part, I would say, is more organizational.

185
07:56.460 --> 07:58.350
What we have seen in the market

186
07:58.350 --> 08:02.040
is that the moment you take a thing out

187
08:02.040 --> 08:05.700
and make it a separate role altogether,

188
08:05.700 --> 08:07.770
like, for example, you say, like, "Hey, there's a CISO,

189
08:07.770 --> 08:10.560
and now, CISO, you're responsible for the security."

190
08:10.560 --> 08:12.457
Then every other exec says that,

191
08:12.457 --> 08:14.490
"Okay, that's not my problem anymore."

192
08:14.490 --> 08:19.490
And it ends up creating a very siloed approach to security.

193
08:19.770 --> 08:23.070
So it depends upon the organizational structure and culture,

194
08:23.070 --> 08:26.520
but I would say that for medium to small size,

195
08:26.520 --> 08:28.170
if I were to take a wild guess,

196
08:28.170 --> 08:30.300
I would say most of them are better off

197
08:30.300 --> 08:33.330
not having a CISO than having a CISO,

198
08:33.330 --> 08:35.840
based on these three aspects, right?

199
08:35.840 --> 08:39.151
So that's at least how we view it in the market, yeah.

200
08:39.151 --> 08:39.984
<v Sabrina>Okay.</v>

201
08:39.984 --> 08:43.350
<v ->So my background is government.</v>

202
08:43.350 --> 08:45.420
I have 30 years in the federal government,

203
08:45.420 --> 08:48.540
and I was chief information officer

204
08:48.540 --> 08:53.540
for Department of Energy, Department of Homeland Security,

205
08:54.570 --> 08:57.060
for the United States government for six years,

206
08:57.060 --> 08:59.190
so I managed a budget at that point

207
08:59.190 --> 09:04.190
of $71 billion in IT investments across the board.

208
09:04.500 --> 09:07.590
And I also was the first assistant secretary

209
09:07.590 --> 09:10.870
for Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response

210
09:11.790 --> 09:12.990
in the Department of Energy.

211
09:12.990 --> 09:17.220
So I was responsible for the power grid,

212
09:17.220 --> 09:19.503
and the government doesn't own it, okay?

213
09:21.223 --> 09:25.650
So I can relate to CISOs who have responsibilities.

214
09:25.650 --> 09:28.140
The title of this piece, though,

215
09:28.140 --> 09:29.940
and I agree with everything that you said

216
09:29.940 --> 09:31.560
about small and medium businesses

217
09:31.560 --> 09:34.173
'cause it's always a trade-off on the resources,

218
09:35.010 --> 09:37.170
and that's why, again, we're focused on the culture,

219
09:37.170 --> 09:39.450
'cause you said culture multiple times.

220
09:39.450 --> 09:43.680
But I think there's a lot in the title itself,

221
09:43.680 --> 09:46.950
which is chief information security officer.

222
09:46.950 --> 09:49.170
And if the chief information officer...

223
09:49.170 --> 09:54.060
So this is my bias 'cause I'm from a CIO background.

224
09:54.060 --> 09:56.610
If the CIO is really doing their job,

225
09:56.610 --> 09:59.580
which is the strategic use of information,

226
09:59.580 --> 10:02.820
which that's what you were talking about from your company,

227
10:02.820 --> 10:07.110
then the CISO,

228
10:07.110 --> 10:09.810
as long as they have the I in their title,

229
10:09.810 --> 10:13.650
should always belong to the chief information officer

230
10:13.650 --> 10:17.100
because it's talking about the security of the information.

231
10:17.100 --> 10:20.640
It's talking about the risk associated with it,

232
10:20.640 --> 10:24.510
the integrity, everything associated with information.

233
10:24.510 --> 10:27.120
Now, in the government space,

234
10:27.120 --> 10:29.460
every time the CIO doesn't do the job,

235
10:29.460 --> 10:33.240
and this gets into your part about the bifurcation,

236
10:33.240 --> 10:34.620
we get a new chief.

237
10:34.620 --> 10:35.910
So, like, now there's a new

238
10:35.910 --> 10:39.954
chief customer experience officer-

239
10:39.954 --> 10:40.787
<v ->Or chief AI officer.</v>

240
10:40.787 --> 10:42.510
<v ->So we have a chief AI officer,</v>

241
10:42.510 --> 10:44.190
we have a chief data officer,

242
10:44.190 --> 10:46.560
we have a chief information security officer,

243
10:46.560 --> 10:50.130
we have a chief customer experience officer,

244
10:50.130 --> 10:52.350
we have a chief innovation officer,

245
10:52.350 --> 10:55.410
we have a chief technology officer.

246
10:55.410 --> 11:00.090
All of those functions are what a CIO

247
11:00.090 --> 11:03.300
is really supposed to be doing in an organization.

248
11:03.300 --> 11:06.300
It's about the strategic use of information

249
11:06.300 --> 11:08.730
to enhance that customer experience

250
11:08.730 --> 11:11.160
while you're securing and managing the risk.

251
11:11.160 --> 11:15.270
And if a CIO doesn't do their job,

252
11:15.270 --> 11:18.240
that's why you see a lot of this happening.

253
11:18.240 --> 11:20.940
And to your point, what happens is,

254
11:20.940 --> 11:23.340
and I've seen this in private industry a lot,

255
11:23.340 --> 11:25.500
is, "Oh, I have to have a CISO."

256
11:25.500 --> 11:30.480
And then they become the scapegoat when a hack happens,

257
11:30.480 --> 11:31.830
and it's like, "Man."

258
11:31.830 --> 11:35.700
And so, like, they move around all over the place.

259
11:35.700 --> 11:37.500
Like, they're worse than,

260
11:37.500 --> 11:40.470
in DC, it's called political appointees.

261
11:40.470 --> 11:42.420
They have, like, a useful shelf life

262
11:42.420 --> 11:44.670
of about 18 to 24 months, right?

263
11:44.670 --> 11:48.180
Because once an incident happens, they're gone

264
11:48.180 --> 11:49.740
because they're the first ones to go

265
11:49.740 --> 11:52.560
when, in fact, that really shouldn't be the case.

266
11:52.560 --> 11:56.160
It should be the CEO of the organization,

267
11:56.160 --> 11:58.833
and the board should be managing that risk.

268
11:59.880 --> 12:01.620
<v Sabrina>Thank you.</v>

269
12:01.620 --> 12:03.600
<v ->Yeah, no, I think it's a...</v>

270
12:03.600 --> 12:05.310
I mean, it's an interesting question, right?

271
12:05.310 --> 12:08.700
Because, you know, when we talk about SMBs,

272
12:08.700 --> 12:11.220
you know, I think a lot of what we just discussed

273
12:11.220 --> 12:12.780
in terms of the constraints,

274
12:12.780 --> 12:15.480
the resources you have to think about trading off,

275
12:15.480 --> 12:16.313
things like that,

276
12:16.313 --> 12:18.120
it's, you know, obviously,

277
12:18.120 --> 12:19.530
you know, in an ideal situation,

278
12:19.530 --> 12:20.910
you have infinite resources,

279
12:20.910 --> 12:24.360
and you could have, you know, everyone on your team, right?

280
12:24.360 --> 12:27.180
I will disagree, though, with Nabil and Karen here, right?

281
12:27.180 --> 12:29.790
Like, I do think, you know...

282
12:29.790 --> 12:31.260
Well, I do think this.

283
12:31.260 --> 12:34.920
You do need to find someone who can lead and drive security,

284
12:34.920 --> 12:37.500
you know, whether you call it a CISO

285
12:37.500 --> 12:39.780
or whether you call the role a CIO

286
12:39.780 --> 12:41.730
or whether you call the role CSO, right?

287
12:41.730 --> 12:45.810
Or, you know, even if it's not necessarily a C-level yet.

288
12:45.810 --> 12:50.040
But I do think even in the SMB tier, right,

289
12:50.040 --> 12:52.920
it's critical for organizations

290
12:52.920 --> 12:56.100
to have someone who can really drive security

291
12:56.100 --> 13:00.210
and cybersecurity in particular for an organization.

292
13:00.210 --> 13:01.650
Granted, of course, you know,

293
13:01.650 --> 13:03.930
the real answer is, like Nabil said, it depends,

294
13:03.930 --> 13:06.360
and, you know, it depends on the exact risks

295
13:06.360 --> 13:07.800
your organization has

296
13:07.800 --> 13:11.730
and, you know, what sort of regulatory environment you're in

297
13:11.730 --> 13:13.053
and things like that.

298
13:14.760 --> 13:17.520
But something I will, you know, push against

299
13:17.520 --> 13:21.180
is that I don't think just 'cause, you know, you have a CISO

300
13:21.180 --> 13:24.610
or you have someone dedicated to, you know, running security

301
13:25.584 --> 13:26.940
that it has to mean that

302
13:26.940 --> 13:29.700
that function becomes siloed, right?

303
13:29.700 --> 13:31.447
And, you know, I do think, though,

304
13:31.447 --> 13:34.230
you know, and I recognize that that's not necessarily

305
13:34.230 --> 13:35.250
what you're saying, right?

306
13:35.250 --> 13:38.945
Like, it's not that it has to happen that way, you know?

307
13:38.945 --> 13:40.740
You know, it's a legitimate argument

308
13:40.740 --> 13:44.013
that it's just so that that's what happens in practice.

309
13:46.066 --> 13:47.280
But I think, you know, at the end of the day,

310
13:47.280 --> 13:48.510
we're actually all saying the same thing

311
13:48.510 --> 13:50.640
in terms of, you know, you wanna develop that culture,

312
13:50.640 --> 13:53.223
you wanna develop that mindset as an organization.

313
13:53.223 --> 13:55.020
And, you know, coming from the Doppel side,

314
13:55.020 --> 13:57.510
we certainly see it with both our customers

315
13:57.510 --> 13:59.400
and of course ourselves as well, right?

316
13:59.400 --> 14:01.650
And so in my view,

317
14:01.650 --> 14:04.530
I do think having that security leader is important

318
14:04.530 --> 14:07.080
because, you know, it's the same reason why

319
14:07.080 --> 14:09.570
you've got leaders for, you know, maybe it's technology,

320
14:09.570 --> 14:11.430
maybe it's for finance,

321
14:11.430 --> 14:13.470
maybe it's for human resources, right?

322
14:13.470 --> 14:15.330
A CEO can't do everything,

323
14:15.330 --> 14:17.670
and so, you know, how do you work closely

324
14:17.670 --> 14:21.330
with your leadership team to, you know, not silo them either

325
14:21.330 --> 14:23.550
and leave them stranded on an island and scapegoat them,

326
14:23.550 --> 14:25.500
but how do you work closely with them

327
14:25.500 --> 14:28.263
to build the right culture within your organization?

328
14:29.370 --> 14:30.600
<v Sabrina>Is there anything you wanna add</v>

329
14:30.600 --> 14:32.250
before we move to the next question?

330
14:32.250 --> 14:34.260
<v ->Yeah, no, I think I'll just add,</v>

331
14:34.260 --> 14:36.750
what I think Kevin is saying is spot on,

332
14:36.750 --> 14:38.340
that it doesn't have to be

333
14:38.340 --> 14:41.940
that CISO's become, like, more bifurcated and siloed.

334
14:41.940 --> 14:44.010
Unfortunately it ends up being that way.

335
14:44.010 --> 14:44.843
<v ->Right.</v>
<v ->And, you know,</v>

336
14:44.843 --> 14:48.270
and it's not just the people and the organizational part.

337
14:48.270 --> 14:49.590
Obviously we are from the tech industry.

338
14:49.590 --> 14:50.910
You're from tech industry as well.

339
14:50.910 --> 14:53.040
We are to be blamed for that as well

340
14:53.040 --> 14:55.350
because what we like to do as a tech industry

341
14:55.350 --> 14:58.200
is we like to create these niche product categories,

342
14:58.200 --> 14:59.940
and we need to create a person

343
14:59.940 --> 15:02.040
who's a buyer in the organization.

344
15:02.040 --> 15:05.880
So there's an entire security industry whose sole purpose

345
15:05.880 --> 15:08.370
is, like, we don't care what is running anywhere else,

346
15:08.370 --> 15:10.560
we're gonna come in and secure it.

347
15:10.560 --> 15:12.599
And I'm not talking about your company, (laughs)

348
15:12.599 --> 15:13.860
(Karen laughs)
but generally.

349
15:13.860 --> 15:14.940
And if you look at it

350
15:14.940 --> 15:17.280
just from a technologist's point of view,

351
15:17.280 --> 15:21.150
that premise by itself is just absolutely absurd, right?

352
15:21.150 --> 15:24.270
Because information is not an independent thing.

353
15:24.270 --> 15:25.590
Information is in the network,

354
15:25.590 --> 15:27.420
information is in your application,

355
15:27.420 --> 15:30.870
information is in your processes, it's everywhere.

356
15:30.870 --> 15:32.340
It is social engineering as well.

357
15:32.340 --> 15:33.780
That's information as well.

358
15:33.780 --> 15:37.110
So I think because you're protecting information

359
15:37.110 --> 15:39.720
and, by that respect, data,

360
15:39.720 --> 15:41.490
the whole nature of it is that this,

361
15:41.490 --> 15:42.990
from a technology point of view,

362
15:42.990 --> 15:45.660
from the application of technology point of view,

363
15:45.660 --> 15:47.040
and from a, you know,

364
15:47.040 --> 15:48.630
organizational structure point of view,

365
15:48.630 --> 15:50.520
it has to be a shared responsibility.

366
15:50.520 --> 15:51.720
I'll give you our example, right?

367
15:51.720 --> 15:54.570
So obviously, from our customer point of view,

368
15:54.570 --> 15:58.350
you know, we see all over the world all kind of companies,

369
15:58.350 --> 16:00.087
but we are an enterprise as well, right?

370
16:00.087 --> 16:02.400
And we are a pretty decent sized enterprise.

371
16:02.400 --> 16:05.730
We have a CISO, but that CISO reports in to a CIO.

372
16:05.730 --> 16:09.030
So we have that function,

373
16:09.030 --> 16:12.000
but that function is so deeply integrated

374
16:12.000 --> 16:14.370
into the broader CIO role.

375
16:14.370 --> 16:17.310
So I think I wanna kind of caveat

376
16:17.310 --> 16:18.840
and explain that the title,

377
16:18.840 --> 16:22.290
because when it says CISO, I do not read it as,

378
16:22.290 --> 16:24.300
do you need a security team?

379
16:24.300 --> 16:25.440
I don't read it that way.

380
16:25.440 --> 16:26.273
I don't read it,

381
16:26.273 --> 16:29.010
do you need somebody that is dedicated to security?

382
16:29.010 --> 16:30.300
I don't read it that way.

383
16:30.300 --> 16:33.720
I read the O part and the C part,

384
16:33.720 --> 16:36.450
that this is a chief information security officer.

385
16:36.450 --> 16:38.910
Do you need an independent organization?

386
16:38.910 --> 16:41.790
Do you need that person sitting in your C-suite and stuff?

387
16:41.790 --> 16:43.679
So I just wanna make sure that my answers come-

388
16:43.679 --> 16:45.360
<v ->And you're right.</v>
<v ->from that point of view.</v>

389
16:45.360 --> 16:46.980
I'm not against having a security team.

390
16:46.980 --> 16:48.210
Everybody should have one.

391
16:48.210 --> 16:49.367
<v ->Right, right, and you're right,</v>

392
16:49.367 --> 16:51.480
'cause you need a security team, right?

393
16:51.480 --> 16:54.960
You need risk management, you need to do all that,

394
16:54.960 --> 16:56.700
you need the culture piece,

395
16:56.700 --> 16:59.220
and it is a shared responsibility.

396
16:59.220 --> 17:01.797
But I think the way that the panel is set up

397
17:01.797 --> 17:04.200
and the way that they primed us on this is,

398
17:04.200 --> 17:07.380
when does a small and medium business start looking at,

399
17:07.380 --> 17:11.220
hey, I need to, like, shift my organization,

400
17:11.220 --> 17:13.080
and now I'm starting to bring...

401
17:13.080 --> 17:14.910
'Cause a lot of them use managed services.

402
17:14.910 --> 17:16.080
I mean, I'm working with

403
17:16.080 --> 17:19.170
a lot of small and medium businesses, utilities,

404
17:19.170 --> 17:21.240
all kinds of stuff across the board,

405
17:21.240 --> 17:23.730
and they use managed services.

406
17:23.730 --> 17:27.420
So it's when does enough,

407
17:27.420 --> 17:29.460
like, I've crossed over this threshold

408
17:29.460 --> 17:31.890
that I have to start bringing things back in

409
17:31.890 --> 17:34.500
and start managing things myself

410
17:34.500 --> 17:36.840
and then look at the organization

411
17:36.840 --> 17:39.450
versus, well, I'm buying it as a service?

412
17:39.450 --> 17:41.100
I'm buying security as a service,

413
17:41.100 --> 17:44.970
I'm buying, you know, my cloud provisions

414
17:44.970 --> 17:46.290
and things like that.

415
17:46.290 --> 17:48.090
But you do need a security team

416
17:48.090 --> 17:51.780
regardless of whether you bring it back in the house

417
17:51.780 --> 17:54.420
or that you're managing it through a service provider,

418
17:54.420 --> 17:56.970
and that's really what we try to explain

419
17:56.970 --> 17:58.350
to the leaders of the company.

420
17:58.350 --> 18:02.580
It's like just because you're buying these services

421
18:02.580 --> 18:06.567
doesn't mean you don't need to have security.

422
18:06.567 --> 18:07.410
<v Nabil>Yeah, agreed.</v>

423
18:07.410 --> 18:08.430
<v ->Well, thank you for that</v>

424
18:08.430 --> 18:10.050
'cause that actually segues perfectly

425
18:10.050 --> 18:12.270
into what I wanted to ask you next.

426
18:12.270 --> 18:15.330
So how can a business and technology leaders

427
18:15.330 --> 18:20.130
help a technologist frame cybersecurity issues,

428
18:20.130 --> 18:24.540
such as funding, in a lens of risk management

429
18:24.540 --> 18:26.610
as opposed to just telling them

430
18:26.610 --> 18:29.940
or recommending what the best services

431
18:29.940 --> 18:31.950
or the best gear is to buy

432
18:31.950 --> 18:33.750
to keep their information protected?

433
18:35.010 --> 18:36.560
<v ->I'll take a quick stab at it.</v>

434
18:37.530 --> 18:39.930
What we recommend to our customers is that

435
18:39.930 --> 18:44.930
do not coin it as a security budget or risk budget.

436
18:45.240 --> 18:47.160
The point is that everything that you're doing,

437
18:47.160 --> 18:49.440
there should be a risk mitigation budget

438
18:49.440 --> 18:51.300
inside that project.

439
18:51.300 --> 18:53.370
So a lot of times, it happens,

440
18:53.370 --> 18:56.220
like, because we come from connectivity, networking side,

441
18:56.220 --> 18:57.660
you know, application data centers,

442
18:57.660 --> 18:59.040
you know, clouds and stuff,

443
18:59.040 --> 19:00.000
it's like, "Oh, my god,

444
19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
we have opened up like five data centers.

445
19:03.000 --> 19:05.310
Oh, shit, we actually need some security products.

446
19:05.310 --> 19:06.270
Let's go look for them."

447
19:06.270 --> 19:09.060
I mean, that's just the absolute wrong way to do it.

448
19:09.060 --> 19:12.750
When you are setting up a project to do X, right,

449
19:12.750 --> 19:16.110
you wanna open up, let's just take a very simple example,

450
19:16.110 --> 19:17.970
a customer support team.

451
19:17.970 --> 19:19.260
Everybody needs one, right?

452
19:19.260 --> 19:20.460
So when you are setting up

453
19:20.460 --> 19:23.280
your customer support function and organization,

454
19:23.280 --> 19:26.340
think about the risk and the security of that team

455
19:26.340 --> 19:28.080
in that project.

456
19:28.080 --> 19:33.080
I think a lot of teams struggle with this security

457
19:35.100 --> 19:38.640
or risk-related budget after the fact.

458
19:38.640 --> 19:41.730
And a lot of times, you end up not doing it (laughs)

459
19:41.730 --> 19:42.570
because they're like, "Oh, shit.

460
19:42.570 --> 19:44.310
We have a data center. We ran out of money.

461
19:44.310 --> 19:46.440
So you know what? We'll secure it next year."

462
19:46.440 --> 19:47.820
Well, yeah, good luck with that.

463
19:47.820 --> 19:49.650
So I think it's a lot of,

464
19:49.650 --> 19:51.420
because you asked about framing,

465
19:51.420 --> 19:53.070
so the way it should be framed about

466
19:53.070 --> 19:54.630
is that there's a use case,

467
19:54.630 --> 19:57.030
here's the actual, for lack of any other better word,

468
19:57.030 --> 19:58.680
the functionality of the use case.

469
19:58.680 --> 20:01.980
Here's my risk mitigation of that use case,

470
20:01.980 --> 20:04.440
here's my user experience portion of that,

471
20:04.440 --> 20:08.610
and combined together, here's my ROI for that use case.

472
20:08.610 --> 20:12.210
If you do it that way, people are a lot more successful.

473
20:12.210 --> 20:14.490
But then that kind of leads it to,

474
20:14.490 --> 20:16.710
it can't be, like, that's a CTO's budget

475
20:16.710 --> 20:19.620
and that's an CIO's budget, and that's a CISO's budget.

476
20:19.620 --> 20:23.190
It's one budget, and you have your components in it.

477
20:23.190 --> 20:25.470
So easier said than done.

478
20:25.470 --> 20:27.840
I mean, let me not, you know, give you the impression

479
20:27.840 --> 20:30.570
that it is so easy to do it, you should go do it tomorrow.

480
20:30.570 --> 20:33.540
It is complicated, requires a big cultural change,

481
20:33.540 --> 20:35.793
especially in your C-suite.

482
20:37.500 --> 20:39.180
It might be surprising to some of you

483
20:39.180 --> 20:41.230
that culture change starts with your CFO.

484
20:42.300 --> 20:45.390
And a lot of the CFOs actually don't understand any of this,

485
20:45.390 --> 20:46.770
so they come in and say, like, "Oh, my god,

486
20:46.770 --> 20:48.420
you are asking tech, you are asking tech,

487
20:48.420 --> 20:50.250
you are asking tech, dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar.

488
20:50.250 --> 20:51.150
I don't care."

489
20:51.150 --> 20:54.810
So start by educating your CFO.

490
20:54.810 --> 20:57.480
The more your CFO actually understands this,

491
20:57.480 --> 20:58.920
the easier it would become.

492
20:58.920 --> 21:00.450
I'll leave it there. (laughs)

493
21:00.450 --> 21:01.690
<v ->Perfect.</v>
<v ->You should go next.</v>

494
21:01.690 --> 21:05.430
<v ->Yeah, no, I mean, it's really about thinking it</v>

495
21:05.430 --> 21:07.770
through the business lens, right?

496
21:07.770 --> 21:09.660
You know, and that's why my stance is, right,

497
21:09.660 --> 21:12.390
it's, you know, whether we call it C-level or not,

498
21:12.390 --> 21:15.240
like, it's important to have that security leader

499
21:15.240 --> 21:18.630
even at an SMB, you know, stage of business

500
21:18.630 --> 21:21.870
because, you know, that leader then can really drive

501
21:21.870 --> 21:25.500
how do you contextualize these sorts of security decisions

502
21:25.500 --> 21:29.070
or vendor decisions or, you know, internal decisions, right,

503
21:29.070 --> 21:31.020
in the context of the business.

504
21:31.020 --> 21:32.850
You know, like, what happens to the business

505
21:32.850 --> 21:34.890
when, you know, we do have this breach?

506
21:34.890 --> 21:36.300
Or what happens to this business

507
21:36.300 --> 21:38.910
when, you know, we're out of compliance

508
21:38.910 --> 21:41.190
in this particular area from a security perspective

509
21:41.190 --> 21:45.900
or, you know, we leak some data here, right?

510
21:45.900 --> 21:49.440
And so, you know, I think a lot of it

511
21:49.440 --> 21:51.660
just comes down to how you tie it back to the business.

512
21:51.660 --> 21:54.660
And, you know, it's a common phrase, right?

513
21:54.660 --> 21:56.640
Like, once there is a breach, right,

514
21:56.640 --> 22:00.270
and, you know, there is a crisis or a disaster, right,

515
22:00.270 --> 22:01.770
like, that's when businesses

516
22:01.770 --> 22:03.420
are always willing to spend more.

517
22:05.599 --> 22:06.870
But, you know, having someone

518
22:06.870 --> 22:08.490
who's been there before and done that

519
22:08.490 --> 22:11.820
and can, you know, contextualize these sorts of decisions

520
22:11.820 --> 22:13.140
in the context of...

521
22:13.140 --> 22:14.910
It's not just a, you know...

522
22:14.910 --> 22:17.190
Like, I wouldn't even frame it as like a risk thing, right?

523
22:17.190 --> 22:20.010
But it's really about, like, this is what will happen,

524
22:20.010 --> 22:21.060
you know, to our top line

525
22:21.060 --> 22:22.890
or this will happen to our bottom line, right,

526
22:22.890 --> 22:24.590
if we don't do this sort of thing.

527
22:25.710 --> 22:28.890
That's really, I think, how you can really,

528
22:28.890 --> 22:31.260
you know, expand beyond just think of it as a risk framework

529
22:31.260 --> 22:34.863
but really, you know, dollars and cents for a CFO or a CEO.

530
22:36.120 --> 22:37.980
<v ->So I'm gonna take a whole different stance on this.</v>

531
22:37.980 --> 22:40.030
That's why I knew they would go this way.

532
22:41.610 --> 22:44.220
So CRI, we have a program

533
22:44.220 --> 22:45.750
called the Cyber Readiness Program.

534
22:45.750 --> 22:50.010
And, you know, small and medium businesses are the same

535
22:50.010 --> 22:52.863
regardless of sector and the way that they look at it.

536
22:53.700 --> 22:55.950
And we're focused on four areas,

537
22:55.950 --> 22:57.637
and when you look at it, you'll go,

538
22:57.637 --> 22:59.340
"Oh, yeah, Karen, it's a no-brainer." Right?

539
22:59.340 --> 23:02.130
So it's phishing, automatic updates,

540
23:02.130 --> 23:05.250
multifactor authentication, and removable media.

541
23:05.250 --> 23:07.770
But when you work through the program,

542
23:07.770 --> 23:09.690
the program makes you think,

543
23:09.690 --> 23:12.640
and it follows ISO standards and all this other good stuff,

544
23:14.160 --> 23:17.790
but it doesn't use the words ISO standards

545
23:17.790 --> 23:21.510
and cybersecurity risk framework and all this.

546
23:21.510 --> 23:24.570
It doesn't use anything like that, okay?

547
23:24.570 --> 23:26.220
Because the minute you start talking

548
23:26.220 --> 23:30.120
to small and medium businesses about cybersecurity,

549
23:30.120 --> 23:33.750
like, their eyes glaze over,

550
23:33.750 --> 23:35.347
you know, they think, like,

551
23:35.347 --> 23:39.450
"Hey, it's never gonna apply to me because I'm so small."

552
23:39.450 --> 23:41.580
They have no...

553
23:41.580 --> 23:44.190
Like, ransomware has, like, really been

554
23:44.190 --> 23:48.120
an eye-opening experience for society.

555
23:48.120 --> 23:50.730
You know, it's a great business

556
23:50.730 --> 23:52.710
if you wanna be in it, you know?

557
23:52.710 --> 23:55.140
'Cause it's like you can go out and use AI

558
23:55.140 --> 23:56.250
and come up with something,

559
23:56.250 --> 23:58.470
and it's, like, minimum investment, big return, right,

560
23:58.470 --> 24:00.000
if people pay you.

561
24:00.000 --> 24:03.003
Not that I'm advocating people become criminals here.

562
24:04.188 --> 24:05.970
But, I mean, when you look at it

563
24:05.970 --> 24:07.380
from a pure business sense,

564
24:07.380 --> 24:09.720
it is a great return on the investment.

565
24:09.720 --> 24:12.030
Small and medium businesses don't think that way.

566
24:12.030 --> 24:15.090
And the industry, both of you guys have hit on it,

567
24:15.090 --> 24:16.920
the cybersecurity industry

568
24:16.920 --> 24:20.370
has become a victim of its own terminology, right?

569
24:20.370 --> 24:22.740
We have made it sound so scary,

570
24:22.740 --> 24:24.480
who wants to be involved in it?

571
24:24.480 --> 24:26.580
It's like, you know, oh, my gosh.

572
24:26.580 --> 24:28.470
And most of the time in small businesses,

573
24:28.470 --> 24:32.100
it's like the HR person, it's another duty as assigned,

574
24:32.100 --> 24:33.450
and they're like, "Okay.

575
24:33.450 --> 24:36.480
CEO says I have to do cybersecurity. What is that?"

576
24:36.480 --> 24:39.540
So it's really trying

577
24:39.540 --> 24:43.020
to, like, change the discussion,

578
24:43.020 --> 24:47.160
and we have to change the way that we talk about it

579
24:47.160 --> 24:49.380
and the way that we frame it.

580
24:49.380 --> 24:53.040
And so a lot of it has to do, when we talk with them,

581
24:53.040 --> 24:55.560
we're like, "Hey, you know..."

582
24:55.560 --> 24:59.760
They think it's only about Office 365 and the cloud

583
24:59.760 --> 25:01.023
and things like that,

584
25:01.023 --> 25:03.420
and they're like, "Yeah, okay, I can get a pencil and pen."

585
25:03.420 --> 25:05.970
Then you ask them, "Hey, what happens

586
25:05.970 --> 25:09.000
if, like, you know, your customer service thing goes down

587
25:09.000 --> 25:11.700
or, you know, your billing system goes down?"

588
25:11.700 --> 25:12.810
And they said, "Well, what do you mean?"

589
25:12.810 --> 25:15.720
And I said, "You know, like, you can't generate any bills

590
25:15.720 --> 25:18.300
or you can't, like, pay people,

591
25:18.300 --> 25:21.120
or, you know, you're doing this or you're doing..."

592
25:21.120 --> 25:22.830
And they go, "Oh, my gosh.

593
25:22.830 --> 25:26.520
Like, we would have no revenue whatsoever coming in.

594
25:26.520 --> 25:29.940
We would not be able to survive if that happened."

595
25:29.940 --> 25:32.107
And that's when we say,

596
25:32.107 --> 25:37.107
"Hey, that's what will happen if you don't do X."

597
25:37.290 --> 25:41.310
And they're like, "Oh! That's what that person meant."

598
25:41.310 --> 25:44.400
I mean, it just is, like, it's a big eye-opening thing,

599
25:44.400 --> 25:48.900
so we're a victim of the way that we frame the problem

600
25:48.900 --> 25:50.610
and the way that we talk about it.

601
25:50.610 --> 25:52.950
I mean, if you look at the underlying infrastructure,

602
25:52.950 --> 25:54.720
it's all based on military terms,

603
25:54.720 --> 25:57.630
so, you know, like, how many people have memorized that?

604
25:57.630 --> 26:01.710
So we really have to change the way that we talk about it

605
26:01.710 --> 26:03.937
and what we're saying instead of saying,

606
26:03.937 --> 26:05.340
"Well, if you follow this

607
26:05.340 --> 26:08.850
141-dash, you know, 3 encryption standards

608
26:08.850 --> 26:12.330
and 800, you know, 153 and all this,

609
26:12.330 --> 26:16.260
and, oh, and then you have 151 security controls

610
26:16.260 --> 26:18.660
that you have to meet for CMMC

611
26:18.660 --> 26:21.660
and then do this ISO standard and meet this with HIPAA."

612
26:21.660 --> 26:23.640
Like, I mean, you guys

613
26:23.640 --> 26:25.890
have already tuned me out there, okay?

614
26:25.890 --> 26:29.940
So, like, we just have to talk about it differently,

615
26:29.940 --> 26:33.030
and a CEO and the board and the CFO

616
26:33.030 --> 26:36.690
or the small business owner will make that investment

617
26:36.690 --> 26:39.423
when they realize it's gonna affect their revenue.

618
26:40.590 --> 26:41.450
<v ->Yeah, I think I'll add one</v>

619
26:41.450 --> 26:44.580
because the way you describe it is absolutely perfect,

620
26:44.580 --> 26:47.400
because especially for smaller and medium businesses,

621
26:47.400 --> 26:49.200
they understand business continuity.

622
26:49.200 --> 26:50.033
<v ->Yep.</v>

623
26:50.033 --> 26:52.590
<v ->They don't necessarily understand cyber risks, right?</v>

624
26:52.590 --> 26:53.850
And business continuity now,

625
26:53.850 --> 26:56.400
because everything is digital and everything is connected,

626
26:56.400 --> 27:00.840
a huge part of business continuity is your cyber security,

627
27:00.840 --> 27:02.730
but it needs to be framed properly,

628
27:02.730 --> 27:05.250
and that's why it has to be part of every project

629
27:05.250 --> 27:06.240
and every budget, right?

630
27:06.240 --> 27:09.300
So I love the way you described it, yeah.

631
27:09.300 --> 27:10.740
<v ->A bit of a rapid-fire question</v>

632
27:10.740 --> 27:12.840
before we open up questions to the audience,

633
27:12.840 --> 27:16.410
but if a company should hire a CISO,

634
27:16.410 --> 27:18.000
what are some characteristics

635
27:18.000 --> 27:20.493
they should be looking for in that person?

636
27:21.480 --> 27:22.770
<v ->I'll go real quick.</v>

637
27:22.770 --> 27:24.903
Person who understands their business.

638
27:26.550 --> 27:27.383
<v ->That's great.</v>

639
27:27.383 --> 27:29.040
<v ->I mean, I was gonna say something similar, right?</v>

640
27:29.040 --> 27:31.470
Like, you know, in SMB,

641
27:31.470 --> 27:33.960
business environment's very different than enterprise,

642
27:33.960 --> 27:34.793
and then of course

643
27:34.793 --> 27:36.120
you've got your different vertical sectors,

644
27:36.120 --> 27:36.960
things like that,

645
27:36.960 --> 27:40.110
so, yeah, someone who, you know, really understands

646
27:40.110 --> 27:43.080
what the job's gonna be for that particular business.

647
27:43.080 --> 27:44.400
<v Nabil>I think I agree with both of them.</v>

648
27:44.400 --> 27:45.990
I'll add one more characteristic.

649
27:45.990 --> 27:47.905
Hire a nice person.

650
27:47.905 --> 27:50.040
(panelists laugh)
(attendees laugh)

651
27:50.040 --> 27:51.390
Because how many times I'm like,

652
27:51.390 --> 27:52.950
if you've ever done a project

653
27:52.950 --> 27:54.060
and you've finished the whole project

654
27:54.060 --> 27:55.387
and then everybody looks around and says,

655
27:55.387 --> 27:57.030
"Who's gonna talk to the CISO?"

656
27:57.030 --> 27:58.767
<v Karen>Yep.</v>
<v ->Because you go to see them</v>

657
27:58.767 --> 28:01.317
and the first thing the security person says, "No."

658
28:02.220 --> 28:04.830
Don't even know what it is, why you're doing it,

659
28:04.830 --> 28:06.420
what is the business need?

660
28:06.420 --> 28:08.130
So hire somebody that is,

661
28:08.130 --> 28:10.290
I mean, I'm saying that tongue in cheek,

662
28:10.290 --> 28:13.140
but the idea is that hire somebody that is collaborative

663
28:13.140 --> 28:15.420
and somebody that considers themselves

664
28:15.420 --> 28:18.120
and their organization as part of the business

665
28:18.120 --> 28:21.030
and not kind of like a side auditor, right?

666
28:21.030 --> 28:23.550
So that's just absolutely critical

667
28:23.550 --> 28:25.560
because I will tell you this.

668
28:25.560 --> 28:30.330
If your CISO, he or she, is not, you know, a nice person,

669
28:30.330 --> 28:33.183
other functions will find a way to go around him or her.

670
28:34.260 --> 28:36.030
That's, like, the whole shadow IT,

671
28:36.030 --> 28:39.090
and, like, especially with all of the SaaS applications

672
28:39.090 --> 28:40.920
and the AI tools that are out there,

673
28:40.920 --> 28:44.730
it is so easy to go around the security team,

674
28:44.730 --> 28:46.230
and you don't want to do that, right?

675
28:46.230 --> 28:49.087
So find a person who sits and says, like,

676
28:49.087 --> 28:51.120
"Hey, Karen, this is your project.

677
28:51.120 --> 28:53.070
Let me help you find a way to do this.

678
28:53.070 --> 28:54.270
Let's do it together."

679
28:54.270 --> 28:56.310
Rather than, like, "Karen, you figure this out,

680
28:56.310 --> 28:57.270
then come and ask me,

681
28:57.270 --> 28:59.520
and I might say yes or I might say no."

682
28:59.520 --> 29:01.350
So hire a nice person.

683
29:01.350 --> 29:03.187
I don't know how you put it on your resume though,

684
29:03.187 --> 29:04.614
"I'm a nice person." (laughs)

685
29:04.614 --> 29:07.110
(panelists laugh)

686
29:07.110 --> 29:08.310
<v ->Well, thank you so much.</v>

687
29:08.310 --> 29:10.950
I would love to open up the opportunity to all of you

688
29:10.950 --> 29:13.080
to ask our amazing panelists some questions.

689
29:13.080 --> 29:14.130
If you do have a question,

690
29:14.130 --> 29:16.683
just go ahead, stand up, and please go to the mic.

691
29:18.360 --> 29:21.990
<v Attendee>So it's not a question but just a comment.</v>

692
29:21.990 --> 29:23.430
How many people, by a show of hands,

693
29:23.430 --> 29:26.343
belong to InfraGard, the National Member Alliance?

694
29:27.420 --> 29:29.070
None? Really?

695
29:29.070 --> 29:31.680
<v ->That's amazing. That actually is a good question, yeah.</v>

696
29:31.680 --> 29:34.560
<v Attendee>Oh, wow. Okay, so this is a free service.</v>

697
29:34.560 --> 29:38.790
It's a partnership between the FBI and private industry.

698
29:38.790 --> 29:40.950
And they have a national member alliance

699
29:40.950 --> 29:42.360
but also have local chapters.

700
29:42.360 --> 29:47.360
So you get newsletters about cybersecurity, email updates.

701
29:48.060 --> 29:48.960
There's a conference.
<v ->InfraGard.</v>

702
29:48.960 --> 29:53.960
<v Attendee>InfraGard, I-N-F-R-A-G-A-R-D.</v>

703
29:54.150 --> 29:56.340
If you Google it, you'll find it.

704
29:56.340 --> 29:58.350
And so I belong to the New Jersey chapter.

705
29:58.350 --> 30:01.650
We had an end-of-year review of cybersecurity issues

706
30:01.650 --> 30:03.420
with our FBI team,

707
30:03.420 --> 30:08.420
and the CISO for ADP, the payroll giant,

708
30:08.790 --> 30:10.050
he came up and did a talk,

709
30:10.050 --> 30:11.580
and he offered his services

710
30:11.580 --> 30:13.050
to the entire New Jersey chapter.

711
30:13.050 --> 30:15.750
So obviously, being a payroll giant,

712
30:15.750 --> 30:17.310
they get hacked all the time,

713
30:17.310 --> 30:19.740
and so they're sitting on a treasure trove

714
30:19.740 --> 30:21.300
of cybersecurity information,

715
30:21.300 --> 30:23.190
and they're letting us have that information

716
30:23.190 --> 30:24.900
so long as, you know, obviously it doesn't conflict

717
30:24.900 --> 30:26.220
with their business.

718
30:26.220 --> 30:29.040
But it was a valuable connection to make,

719
30:29.040 --> 30:31.680
and I highly recommend everybody join it.

720
30:31.680 --> 30:32.513
<v ->Fantastic.</v>

721
30:32.513 --> 30:34.530
Community is so important when it comes to security.

722
30:34.530 --> 30:36.150
<v Attendee>Yeah, and I don't get any kickback</v>

723
30:36.150 --> 30:38.111
for this, so...
(panelists laugh)

724
30:38.111 --> 30:39.900
But this is like strength in numbers, right?

725
30:39.900 --> 30:42.030
So it's like if more people, we're all in this together,

726
30:42.030 --> 30:43.050
if they attack my company,

727
30:43.050 --> 30:44.165
they're gonna attack your company.

728
30:44.165 --> 30:47.017
<v ->Yeah, 100%, 100%.</v>

729
30:54.360 --> 30:56.100
<v Attendee>Hi. Okay, can you hear me?</v>

730
30:56.100 --> 30:57.000
<v ->Mm-hmm.</v>
<v ->Okay.</v>

731
30:57.000 --> 31:00.360
You touched upon hire someone who's nice

732
31:00.360 --> 31:01.530
or collaborative, right?

733
31:01.530 --> 31:04.320
I 100% agree with that, but at the same time,

734
31:04.320 --> 31:07.140
look at it from the CISO's perspective or security.

735
31:07.140 --> 31:08.220
I've never been a CISO,

736
31:08.220 --> 31:12.570
but I was a senior manager managing a team of SecOps,

737
31:12.570 --> 31:14.550
you know, blue team, red team guys-

738
31:14.550 --> 31:16.080
<v ->Right.</v>
<v ->Guys and girls.</v>

739
31:16.080 --> 31:19.110
And we were under tremendous pressure.

740
31:19.110 --> 31:22.920
I mean, we managed airlines

741
31:22.920 --> 31:24.540
and airports across the world,

742
31:24.540 --> 31:27.330
so you can imagine how many incidents and events

743
31:27.330 --> 31:29.190
we had on a daily basis.

744
31:29.190 --> 31:32.790
But the truth is, from a security perspective,

745
31:32.790 --> 31:36.270
it's frustrating when, you know, either C-level

746
31:36.270 --> 31:39.300
or senior management, mid-level management

747
31:39.300 --> 31:42.360
either disregard, like you said, they go around it,

748
31:42.360 --> 31:45.450
or they ignore you or they don't pay importance to it.

749
31:45.450 --> 31:47.880
So it's kind of, yes,

750
31:47.880 --> 31:49.890
you should hire someone who's very collaborative,

751
31:49.890 --> 31:52.950
and you can, you know, during the interview process,

752
31:52.950 --> 31:54.690
you can figure that out and everything.

753
31:54.690 --> 31:55.650
But at the same time,

754
31:55.650 --> 31:58.470
from a security perspective, it's very frustrating.

755
31:58.470 --> 32:00.480
I think there's a big lack of knowledge,

756
32:00.480 --> 32:04.560
and a lot of C-suite people don't even wanna know about it.

757
32:04.560 --> 32:06.150
They're completely disinterested

758
32:06.150 --> 32:08.430
until a disaster happens, right?

759
32:08.430 --> 32:11.670
And then, you know, like you said or all of you said,

760
32:11.670 --> 32:14.520
you know, the security people are to blame,

761
32:14.520 --> 32:16.714
and they have a shelf life of what, 24 months?

762
32:16.714 --> 32:17.547
<v ->Yeah.</v>

763
32:17.547 --> 32:20.490
<v Attendee>That's surprising to me actually, but okay.</v>

764
32:20.490 --> 32:24.030
But, yeah, I don't know how we can bridge that gap.

765
32:24.030 --> 32:25.230
You know, we talk about it a lot,

766
32:25.230 --> 32:26.790
but nobody seems to address it.

767
32:26.790 --> 32:28.920
<v ->So I think you raise a very interesting point,</v>

768
32:28.920 --> 32:31.260
and that's, you know, why I differentiated

769
32:31.260 --> 32:33.240
between a security team and a CISO.

770
32:33.240 --> 32:37.170
So one part of the CISO is to represent the security team

771
32:37.170 --> 32:39.480
to the other functions and in the C-suite,

772
32:39.480 --> 32:41.730
and that's why it's all the more important.

773
32:41.730 --> 32:43.470
I never said that hire all the nice people

774
32:43.470 --> 32:45.030
in security team (laughs)

775
32:45.030 --> 32:48.840
because they should be the most technically sound people.

776
32:48.840 --> 32:50.490
And by the way, the more paranoid they are,

777
32:50.490 --> 32:53.040
the better off, you know, that role is.

778
32:53.040 --> 32:55.350
But a CISO is...

779
32:55.350 --> 32:57.060
You know, here's the thing.

780
32:57.060 --> 32:57.900
And, again, as I said,

781
32:57.900 --> 32:59.313
it's the C and the O at the end, right?

782
32:59.313 --> 33:01.140
It's the chief and the officer part.

783
33:01.140 --> 33:03.720
They are really the face of that organization.

784
33:03.720 --> 33:05.250
They are the one who are collaborative.

785
33:05.250 --> 33:08.460
They are the one who explain to the other executives

786
33:08.460 --> 33:10.770
why you need it, as Karen pointed out,

787
33:10.770 --> 33:12.960
in terms of either business continuity

788
33:12.960 --> 33:15.180
or, you know, revenue generation

789
33:15.180 --> 33:17.820
or, in some of the cases, PR risk.

790
33:17.820 --> 33:19.485
Who wants your company's, you know, name

791
33:19.485 --> 33:22.170
to be all over the news that, oh, you got hacked and stuff?

792
33:22.170 --> 33:24.000
Although that happens quite a bit these days.

793
33:24.000 --> 33:28.410
So the CISO's role is to translate

794
33:28.410 --> 33:30.780
the very difficult, complicated,

795
33:30.780 --> 33:34.440
and rapidly changing space of security

796
33:34.440 --> 33:37.440
into a language that other execs

797
33:37.440 --> 33:39.990
and other decision makers and stakeholders can understand.

798
33:39.990 --> 33:42.210
Remember, they don't live it on a day-to-day basis,

799
33:42.210 --> 33:44.190
so if you go and you kind of talk about

800
33:44.190 --> 33:45.990
the latest, you know, threat,

801
33:45.990 --> 33:49.110
I mean, to Karen's point, like, the eyes glaze over,

802
33:49.110 --> 33:52.440
but that's why it is so important.

803
33:52.440 --> 33:54.540
The best CISOs that I know,

804
33:54.540 --> 33:56.313
they were technical 10 years ago.

805
33:57.660 --> 34:01.440
They are the best representatives

806
34:01.440 --> 34:04.080
of a super technical organization.

807
34:04.080 --> 34:07.140
So, you know, that's why I wanted to give the caveat

808
34:07.140 --> 34:10.080
that my comments are about specifically about CISO

809
34:10.080 --> 34:11.580
and not about the security team.

810
34:11.580 --> 34:14.250
So CISO is the one who should be representing it,

811
34:14.250 --> 34:16.680
translating it, and making sure that people

812
34:16.680 --> 34:18.120
do not think of the security team

813
34:18.120 --> 34:20.400
as a hurdle or as an audit,

814
34:20.400 --> 34:23.430
but thinks of them as a resource.

815
34:23.430 --> 34:25.410
Like, who wouldn't wanna create a product

816
34:25.410 --> 34:29.010
or a project that is secure from day one, right?

817
34:29.010 --> 34:29.910
That's the whole idea,

818
34:29.910 --> 34:32.193
but it needs to be presented that way.

819
34:33.245 --> 34:34.170
That CISO requires,

820
34:34.170 --> 34:35.970
and I know I was laughing on the nice person,

821
34:35.970 --> 34:38.610
but it's the soft skills that matter

822
34:38.610 --> 34:42.390
because they are selling the value of their teams

823
34:42.390 --> 34:44.444
to everybody else in the organization.

824
34:44.444 --> 34:45.870
<v Attendee>Emotional intelligence.</v>

825
34:45.870 --> 34:48.360
<v ->Emotional intelligence. And the translation, man.</v>

826
34:48.360 --> 34:50.280
It's just like, and I think this is what Karen was saying,

827
34:50.280 --> 34:53.850
is, like, don't bring in, like, your 18 acronyms

828
34:53.850 --> 34:56.310
and the latest 12345.

829
34:56.310 --> 34:58.320
Other people don't understand it.

830
34:58.320 --> 35:00.090
And by the way, on the technology side, I would say,

831
35:00.090 --> 35:02.310
is that we are the worst offenders

832
35:02.310 --> 35:07.020
because we try to sell security products based on fear.

833
35:07.020 --> 35:08.160
<v Karen>Yeah.</v>

834
35:08.160 --> 35:10.260
<v ->And what do you fear the most?</v>

835
35:10.260 --> 35:12.180
The thing that you don't understand.

836
35:12.180 --> 35:14.250
So obviously, you know, the whole industry

837
35:14.250 --> 35:16.680
is built around creating this fear

838
35:16.680 --> 35:18.450
around you don't understand it,

839
35:18.450 --> 35:21.030
I do, and I'm telling you you should buy this, right?

840
35:21.030 --> 35:22.500
I'm not talking about the security team itself.

841
35:22.500 --> 35:24.600
So it's the community thing, right?

842
35:24.600 --> 35:26.790
So that's what I would say on this, yeah.

843
35:26.790 --> 35:27.803
<v Attendee>Thank you.</v>

844
35:29.820 --> 35:30.840
<v Attendee>Thank you, I'll make a comment,</v>

845
35:30.840 --> 35:32.700
and then I have a question for the panel.

846
35:32.700 --> 35:34.050
Matt Aiello, I'm with Heidrick &amp; Struggles.

847
35:34.050 --> 35:34.883
We're an executive search firm.

848
35:34.883 --> 35:36.060
Just a slightly different perspective.

849
35:36.060 --> 35:37.230
So I lead the cyber practice,

850
35:37.230 --> 35:39.360
so we do hundreds of CISO searches

851
35:39.360 --> 35:41.910
for everything from late-stage private equity

852
35:41.910 --> 35:43.680
all the way to Fortune 5.

853
35:43.680 --> 35:46.030
And I agree with everything the panelists said.

854
35:47.160 --> 35:50.790
There is an evolving model over the last couple of years

855
35:50.790 --> 35:54.420
where, you know, 90% of corporate,

856
35:54.420 --> 35:56.760
of Fortune 500 CISOs are already talking to the board.

857
35:56.760 --> 35:58.740
So they're talking directly to the audit committee.

858
35:58.740 --> 36:00.150
They're talking directly...

859
36:00.150 --> 36:02.430
They've got, you know, quarterly presentations.

860
36:02.430 --> 36:03.840
They know how to distill the information.

861
36:03.840 --> 36:07.140
So there is a growing, it's not a big number,

862
36:07.140 --> 36:11.010
but there is a growing number of serious executives

863
36:11.010 --> 36:13.770
who are not rotating every 24 months.

864
36:13.770 --> 36:16.510
They're rotating every 29 1/2 months,

865
36:16.510 --> 36:19.890
(panelists laugh)
so it's getting better.

866
36:19.890 --> 36:22.140
We do a survey with like 500 CISOs.

867
36:22.140 --> 36:26.010
It's, like, about 3.1, it's like three years.

868
36:26.010 --> 36:28.560
But it's not getting lower, which is good.

869
36:28.560 --> 36:31.560
And then the second trend is,

870
36:31.560 --> 36:33.060
and, Karen, I totally agree with you,

871
36:33.060 --> 36:34.920
that as long as you've got the information in there,

872
36:34.920 --> 36:38.670
you need to be a serious information guardian.

873
36:38.670 --> 36:40.260
We are seeing the rise of more technical CISOs

874
36:40.260 --> 36:42.030
'cause everything's moving to AI,

875
36:42.030 --> 36:43.500
everything's moving to data,

876
36:43.500 --> 36:46.620
so you need to have somebody that has deep technical depth,

877
36:46.620 --> 36:48.690
ideally with a CS degree or a EE.

878
36:48.690 --> 36:52.380
But the flip side of that

879
36:52.380 --> 36:54.600
is the ability

880
36:54.600 --> 36:59.600
to translate very sophisticated topics

881
36:59.940 --> 37:04.290
to a non-technical audience and do so successfully

882
37:04.290 --> 37:08.310
and have a broader enterprise risk orientation.

883
37:08.310 --> 37:11.880
This is the move away from the CIO.

884
37:11.880 --> 37:15.780
48% of CISOs report to a technical leader,

885
37:15.780 --> 37:17.730
either a CIO or a CTO,

886
37:17.730 --> 37:20.520
which means that a slight majority don't.

887
37:20.520 --> 37:22.950
They report in to, not to CEOs yet.

888
37:22.950 --> 37:24.180
That's happening in Asia.

889
37:24.180 --> 37:25.440
It's happening a little bit in the US

890
37:25.440 --> 37:28.140
below a certain revenue line.

891
37:28.140 --> 37:31.860
They're reporting in to general counsels,

892
37:31.860 --> 37:33.300
so we're seeing the GC,

893
37:33.300 --> 37:36.930
we're seeing CFOs, a little bit of a scary trend,

894
37:36.930 --> 37:39.420
we're seeing chief administrative officers,

895
37:39.420 --> 37:40.860
chief operating officers.

896
37:40.860 --> 37:43.170
As long as it's C minus one,

897
37:43.170 --> 37:46.470
so CEO and then anybody that's on the ELT,

898
37:46.470 --> 37:49.380
we are supportive of that, agree with you 100%.

899
37:49.380 --> 37:50.467
When a client comes to us and says,

900
37:50.467 --> 37:53.370
"We wanna to hire a world-class CISO,

901
37:53.370 --> 37:55.560
and it's reporting in to infrastructure."

902
37:55.560 --> 37:57.600
We'll say, "We're not gonna do it."

903
37:57.600 --> 37:59.580
Well, I mean, we try,

904
37:59.580 --> 38:00.540
we'll strongly encourage them

905
38:00.540 --> 38:01.950
to change the reporting relationship.

906
38:01.950 --> 38:04.860
So the good news is there's a lot of really good momentum

907
38:04.860 --> 38:06.600
happening in the role.

908
38:06.600 --> 38:08.190
My question, thank you for listening,

909
38:08.190 --> 38:09.270
my question for the panel is,

910
38:09.270 --> 38:10.800
I wanna present a slightly different perspective.

911
38:10.800 --> 38:13.950
It's the role, all those pressures are there,

912
38:13.950 --> 38:15.450
but I think CISOs are kind of rising,

913
38:15.450 --> 38:17.940
some of the best are rising to the challenge.

914
38:17.940 --> 38:19.500
My question to the panel is about AI and cyber,

915
38:19.500 --> 38:21.600
so I'd love just quick, you know, thoughts.

916
38:21.600 --> 38:23.520
I mean, obviously this is a very complex topic.

917
38:23.520 --> 38:27.540
Cyber is a piece of AI and safety and security.

918
38:27.540 --> 38:29.580
I'd just love to hear thoughts, right?

919
38:29.580 --> 38:30.783
Where's this going?

920
38:31.830 --> 38:33.210
Just maybe some guidelines

921
38:33.210 --> 38:35.130
on to where you think cyber and AI are going.

922
38:35.130 --> 38:35.970
<v ->Well, you should start.</v>

923
38:35.970 --> 38:38.420
<v ->Yeah, yeah, I mean, I'm happy to take that one.</v>

924
38:39.480 --> 38:42.030
Like, obviously, you know, with AI, right,

925
38:42.030 --> 38:44.340
there's a lot of hype, there's a lot of buzzwords for sure

926
38:44.340 --> 38:47.820
in terms of, you know, how is it actually impacting,

927
38:47.820 --> 38:48.720
you know, both,

928
38:48.720 --> 38:50.730
you know, I think of it in two different angles, right?

929
38:50.730 --> 38:52.080
One is how's it actually impacting,

930
38:52.080 --> 38:53.340
like, your threat landscape

931
38:53.340 --> 38:55.170
and what you have to look out for,

932
38:55.170 --> 38:56.370
and then how is it impacting,

933
38:56.370 --> 38:58.920
you know, what sort of technology and vendors

934
38:58.920 --> 39:01.620
or, you know, in-house, whatever, right,

935
39:01.620 --> 39:04.353
you know, platform that you have to defend yourself?

936
39:05.190 --> 39:07.950
And from what we've seen at Doppel,

937
39:07.950 --> 39:10.320
I mean, every time an AI model gets released,

938
39:10.320 --> 39:12.480
like the next-generation ChatGPT

939
39:12.480 --> 39:14.970
or, you know, next-generation cloud, right,

940
39:14.970 --> 39:18.150
like, we actually measure a lot of, you know,

941
39:18.150 --> 39:20.160
what can it do internally for us at Doppel?

942
39:20.160 --> 39:22.410
What can it do, you know, externally in our products?

943
39:22.410 --> 39:24.750
And then also, you know, basically

944
39:24.750 --> 39:27.300
do a lot of just conversations with customers

945
39:27.300 --> 39:28.710
in terms of, like, how's it impacting

946
39:28.710 --> 39:31.740
what you're seeing out there as well, right?

947
39:31.740 --> 39:34.680
And so, you know, our thoughts on it,

948
39:34.680 --> 39:36.543
based on, you know, what we've seen,

949
39:37.650 --> 39:39.600
you know, a lot of real change

950
39:39.600 --> 39:42.480
in terms of what you can do from a defensive perspective.

951
39:42.480 --> 39:46.740
So, for example, we've been able to automate,

952
39:46.740 --> 39:48.090
you know, certain teams,

953
39:48.090 --> 39:52.230
like, entire teams at Doppel on the security operations side

954
39:52.230 --> 39:55.080
that we couldn't automate two years ago.

955
39:55.080 --> 39:57.967
It's not the whole, you know, organization.

956
39:57.967 --> 39:58.980
You know, it's basically,

957
39:58.980 --> 40:01.680
you know, we've got a set of, you know, tier one tasks,

958
40:01.680 --> 40:02.880
tier two, tier three, right?

959
40:02.880 --> 40:04.467
And we still, you know, especially tier two

960
40:04.467 --> 40:06.084
and tier three, right,

961
40:06.084 --> 40:08.820
it's still very much human in the loop.

962
40:08.820 --> 40:10.800
But specifically, you know,

963
40:10.800 --> 40:12.840
the models like the 01 in particular

964
40:12.840 --> 40:14.520
that focus a lot more on the reasoning

965
40:14.520 --> 40:16.830
rather than just cheaper inference,

966
40:16.830 --> 40:19.350
those are the ones that we've seen big breakthroughs.

967
40:19.350 --> 40:20.703
In terms of attacks,

968
40:21.660 --> 40:24.570
you know, chatting with customers, things like that,

969
40:24.570 --> 40:27.030
I think it really comes down to both volume

970
40:27.030 --> 40:29.550
and velocity of the attacks, right?

971
40:29.550 --> 40:32.820
So not necessarily something totally entirely new,

972
40:32.820 --> 40:34.890
but just fidelity of certain attacks

973
40:34.890 --> 40:37.233
or the volume of it or the velocity of it,

974
40:38.250 --> 40:40.440
we've seen big changes in that over time as well.

975
40:40.440 --> 40:41.430
For example, smishing,

976
40:41.430 --> 40:44.310
you know, if you talk to Anti-Phishing Working Group,

977
40:44.310 --> 40:47.310
you know, five, six years ago, not as big of a deal,

978
40:47.310 --> 40:48.990
but now it's the fastest growing,

979
40:48.990 --> 40:50.490
you know, phishing attack vector

980
40:50.490 --> 40:53.373
for, you know, all things social engineering.

981
40:54.270 --> 40:58.560
<v ->So real quick, CRI is also research,</v>

982
40:58.560 --> 41:01.110
so I'm glad you asked that.

983
41:01.110 --> 41:03.690
So I'm gonna leave you with this one last thought is,

984
41:03.690 --> 41:07.500
sometimes we get so caught up in the technology,

985
41:07.500 --> 41:10.020
like everything that you just said, right,

986
41:10.020 --> 41:15.020
that some of the old ways might actually be better

987
41:15.030 --> 41:17.100
than trying to implement technology.

988
41:17.100 --> 41:19.620
And I'm talking from a small and medium business,

989
41:19.620 --> 41:21.210
like, you're very efficient,

990
41:21.210 --> 41:22.980
everybody's running efficiently,

991
41:22.980 --> 41:24.810
process the email, do all this stuff,

992
41:24.810 --> 41:26.040
I get all these things.

993
41:26.040 --> 41:30.750
You know, sometimes if you just stop and call your vendor

994
41:30.750 --> 41:33.870
and say, "Did you really send this?

995
41:33.870 --> 41:38.220
'Cause I have no record of this purchase."

996
41:38.220 --> 41:41.850
That you could actually stop a ransomware attack.

997
41:41.850 --> 41:45.150
So I know we're very efficient.

998
41:45.150 --> 41:48.030
We wanna process things really fast.

999
41:48.030 --> 41:49.950
AI is gonna make it more...

1000
41:49.950 --> 41:54.180
So we're researching into how to stop some of these things,

1001
41:54.180 --> 41:58.350
but sometimes just regular human interaction

1002
41:58.350 --> 42:01.560
would actually be the best defense.

1003
42:01.560 --> 42:04.290
<v ->I'll say one sentence, and I promise one.</v>

1004
42:04.290 --> 42:06.300
I'm not known to give short answers,

1005
42:06.300 --> 42:08.340
but I'm gonna try my level best.

1006
42:08.340 --> 42:11.460
AI is going to force the breakage of those silos.

1007
42:11.460 --> 42:14.580
Right now, for me, my SecOps and my CloudOps

1008
42:14.580 --> 42:17.010
is bigger than my CISO's team, right?

1009
42:17.010 --> 42:20.250
So AI will absolutely force

1010
42:20.250 --> 42:22.200
this shared responsibility model,

1011
42:22.200 --> 42:24.000
and I'm actually very happy about that, right?

1012
42:24.000 --> 42:26.490
So that's my short answer,

1013
42:26.490 --> 42:29.430
but I'll give you a longer answer afterwards. (laughs)

1014
42:29.430 --> 42:30.540
<v ->Well, thank you, everyone, for coming.</v>

1015
42:30.540 --> 42:32.100
Thank you, Kevin, Karen, Nabil.

1016
42:32.100 --> 42:33.480
This was a lovely conversation.

1017
42:33.480 --> 42:35.180
Have a wonderful rest of your CES.

1018
42:36.219 --> 42:38.802
(upbeat music)
