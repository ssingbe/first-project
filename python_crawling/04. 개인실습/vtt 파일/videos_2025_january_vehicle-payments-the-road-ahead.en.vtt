1
00:00.125 --> 00:02.708
(upbeat music)

2
00:10.590 --> 00:12.030
<v Chris>This is our largest panel.</v>

3
00:12.030 --> 00:15.480
So I'm gonna talk for 3.4 seconds,

4
00:15.480 --> 00:17.880
but I wanted to introduce my friend and somebody,

5
00:17.880 --> 00:21.570
again, we're celebrating our 25th year of Connect2Car,

6
00:21.570 --> 00:23.130
and Suzanne, who is Vice President

7
00:23.130 --> 00:26.880
of Advanced Mobility Payments System and Automation

8
00:26.880 --> 00:30.180
and anything else you can get your hands into at AECOM.

9
00:30.180 --> 00:35.180
So Suzanne was actually here for year two,

10
00:35.190 --> 00:38.880
and we put on, when I was working at CTA at the time,

11
00:38.880 --> 00:41.490
we put on the first V to V

12
00:41.490 --> 00:45.390
or V to X demonstration right underneath this building,

13
00:45.390 --> 00:46.950
which used to be a parking lot.

14
00:46.950 --> 00:48.903
So think of that 24 years ago.

15
00:50.280 --> 00:53.040
You're the only one that I've had that goes back that far.

16
00:53.040 --> 00:55.320
Everybody else has left me.

17
00:55.320 --> 00:56.668
So thanks for coming back.

18
00:56.668 --> 00:57.897
<v Suzanne>Of course.</v>

19
00:57.897 --> 01:00.840
<v Chris>And without me muttering up the panel,</v>

20
01:00.840 --> 01:02.520
Suzanne, thank you so much.

21
01:02.520 --> 01:03.570
<v ->All right, thank you, Chris.</v>

22
01:03.570 --> 01:05.273
Okay, so I'm so excited about this panel,

23
01:05.273 --> 01:07.830
and I'm so excited I brought a jury for you

24
01:07.830 --> 01:10.200
because there's just so much to say.

25
01:10.200 --> 01:12.990
So 2025 is gonna be the year.

26
01:12.990 --> 01:14.280
We've been trying to figure out

27
01:14.280 --> 01:18.150
how to do payments from vehicles since I've been working,

28
01:18.150 --> 01:19.050
since I've been working.

29
01:19.050 --> 01:22.800
So, and this was so exciting that so many people

30
01:22.800 --> 01:24.780
had so many great things to talk about

31
01:24.780 --> 01:26.550
that they're actually doing now.

32
01:26.550 --> 01:29.010
And we're gonna see what's gonna happen in 2025.

33
01:29.010 --> 01:31.740
By the time we get done this panel, you're gonna be shocked.

34
01:31.740 --> 01:33.750
So our format's gonna be a little bit different,

35
01:33.750 --> 01:35.220
because most people don't know

36
01:35.220 --> 01:36.870
what's going on with vehicle payments.

37
01:36.870 --> 01:38.340
Most people in the world don't know,

38
01:38.340 --> 01:40.380
most people in our industries don't know.

39
01:40.380 --> 01:42.270
So I'm gonna ask everybody here

40
01:42.270 --> 01:45.870
to do maybe a three- to five-minute introduction

41
01:45.870 --> 01:49.920
of themselves and what they're accomplishing in this field.

42
01:49.920 --> 01:50.910
And then at the end,

43
01:50.910 --> 01:53.100
we're going to do some really quick questions

44
01:53.100 --> 01:54.510
about what's coming up.

45
01:54.510 --> 01:56.550
Is that okay with everybody as an approach?

46
01:56.550 --> 01:58.920
I thought that was good to do with so many people.

47
01:58.920 --> 02:02.013
Okay, so first up is JJ, and have at it.

48
02:04.530 --> 02:05.866
<v ->All right, I'll go up here.</v>

49
02:05.866 --> 02:06.699
<v ->Perfect.</v>

50
02:06.699 --> 02:07.590
You can go wherever you want,

51
02:07.590 --> 02:09.210
if you wanna stand up or sit down.

52
02:09.210 --> 02:10.043
It's all good.

53
02:10.043 --> 02:11.393
<v ->Just do it this way.</v>

54
02:11.393 --> 02:12.226
<v ->Perfect.</v>

55
02:12.226 --> 02:13.650
<v ->So thanks everybody for coming.</v>

56
02:13.650 --> 02:14.850
And you're probably wondering why

57
02:14.850 --> 02:18.000
is a government agency even here, and why am I here?

58
02:18.000 --> 02:18.833
Right?

59
02:18.833 --> 02:21.270
So, you know, I've been doing in-vehicle payments

60
02:21.270 --> 02:22.890
for over 50 years,

61
02:22.890 --> 02:25.050
and automated in-vehicle payments for,

62
02:25.050 --> 02:26.820
believe it or not, almost 40 years.

63
02:26.820 --> 02:29.550
You know, we started the toll industry

64
02:29.550 --> 02:33.390
with the organization I helped co-found called E-ZPass.

65
02:33.390 --> 02:36.870
And if you look at E-ZPass as an in-vehicle payment system,

66
02:36.870 --> 02:40.350
although it's only doing tolling, and now some parking

67
02:40.350 --> 02:43.950
and some other things, you know, we're doing, we're one

68
02:43.950 --> 02:47.700
of the top five of all payment processors in the country,

69
02:47.700 --> 02:49.530
which is pretty impressive.

70
02:49.530 --> 02:54.180
You know, we're doing over $10 billion annually in revenue,

71
02:54.180 --> 02:55.770
and if you look at the rest of the country

72
02:55.770 --> 02:57.480
and what they're doing and add that in,

73
02:57.480 --> 02:59.820
it gets even bigger than that.

74
02:59.820 --> 03:01.380
The other issues that we're starting to have,

75
03:01.380 --> 03:03.420
if you do a SWAT on the toll industry right now,

76
03:03.420 --> 03:06.300
you're gonna see some challenges coming ahead.

77
03:06.300 --> 03:08.880
So the transponder, for instance,

78
03:08.880 --> 03:10.980
there is currently a company looking

79
03:10.980 --> 03:12.540
at taking that frequency band.

80
03:12.540 --> 03:15.120
And when we started E-ZPass, we looked at it,

81
03:15.120 --> 03:18.420
and basically, the E-ZPass transponder right now

82
03:18.420 --> 03:21.090
that we used came from Los Alamos.

83
03:21.090 --> 03:24.870
It was a technology transfer out of the military,

84
03:24.870 --> 03:28.230
but when we started E-ZPass, it was this,

85
03:28.230 --> 03:29.190
we weren't the first.

86
03:29.190 --> 03:30.660
There was a system in Dallas,

87
03:30.660 --> 03:32.040
they used a different technology,

88
03:32.040 --> 03:33.300
and of course, when we started,

89
03:33.300 --> 03:35.220
we thought we could do it better.

90
03:35.220 --> 03:38.640
So we used something different, and then California

91
03:38.640 --> 03:41.070
and others used different technologies,

92
03:41.070 --> 03:43.920
and then Succeed came along, and it came different again.

93
03:43.920 --> 03:46.290
So interoperability was a problem.

94
03:46.290 --> 03:50.040
But now with connected vehicles coming along

95
03:50.040 --> 03:53.820
and how interoperable the toll agencies have become due

96
03:53.820 --> 03:57.270
to necessity and people not just traveling in one state,

97
03:57.270 --> 03:59.580
you're starting to see, you know, the ability

98
03:59.580 --> 04:03.870
to start moving into a more connected vehicle side.

99
04:03.870 --> 04:05.730
In addition, when we started tolling,

100
04:05.730 --> 04:07.950
we started it to move traffic.

101
04:07.950 --> 04:09.630
We didn't care about the revenue, really,

102
04:09.630 --> 04:11.640
it was just to move traffic.

103
04:11.640 --> 04:13.860
That model has totally changed.

104
04:13.860 --> 04:16.140
Now we're looking at it as a revenue source,

105
04:16.140 --> 04:18.090
the way to pay for new roads.

106
04:18.090 --> 04:20.340
You know, when I started in this business,

107
04:20.340 --> 04:21.990
it was a million dollars a mile,

108
04:21.990 --> 04:24.090
now it's 110 million a mile

109
04:24.090 --> 04:25.740
for the road we opened this year.

110
04:27.085 --> 04:30.420
So the transponder is a problem also.

111
04:30.420 --> 04:34.050
And with our a hundred million customer database

112
04:34.050 --> 04:35.200
that we have right now,

113
04:36.150 --> 04:39.480
it's time to leap forward into vehicle payments.

114
04:39.480 --> 04:40.710
In North Carolina alone,

115
04:40.710 --> 04:42.480
we are looking at new technologies

116
04:42.480 --> 04:44.550
and the way to open our APIs,

117
04:44.550 --> 04:47.610
and we're actually looking at to do some pilots,

118
04:47.610 --> 04:49.593
and to bring the industry together.

119
04:50.460 --> 04:52.410
I'm still on the executive board of E-ZPass,

120
04:52.410 --> 04:53.460
so I know it's going there.

121
04:53.460 --> 04:56.190
I'm still on IBTTA working with them.

122
04:56.190 --> 05:01.190
So, you know, we've piloted other technologies too.

123
05:01.260 --> 05:04.020
We piloted that gasoline with Circle K,

124
05:04.020 --> 05:07.860
we piloted McDonald's in fast food,

125
05:07.860 --> 05:09.540
and we know the public wants it.

126
05:09.540 --> 05:12.210
We know there's problems in the financial model

127
05:12.210 --> 05:13.590
and bringing it together.

128
05:13.590 --> 05:15.060
But it's all possible.

129
05:15.060 --> 05:17.370
It's all possible, and Succeed,

130
05:17.370 --> 05:20.370
it's starting to move forward at such a rapid rate

131
05:20.370 --> 05:21.480
that the toll industry's

132
05:21.480 --> 05:23.820
having even issues keeping up with it.

133
05:23.820 --> 05:27.000
So I'm not saying there's not gonna be challenges,

134
05:27.000 --> 05:31.170
but you know, we're hoping that within the next year

135
05:31.170 --> 05:34.740
that we start seeing some active pilots within this country,

136
05:34.740 --> 05:36.630
not only with us, with others.

137
05:36.630 --> 05:39.300
The key is to have this open platform,

138
05:39.300 --> 05:42.360
and not have, you know, frankly,

139
05:42.360 --> 05:44.760
I'd like to get this whole process out of government

140
05:44.760 --> 05:48.240
and into an open payment platform that,

141
05:48.240 --> 05:50.730
you know, is commercialized.

142
05:50.730 --> 05:53.670
So with that, Suzanne, I'll turn it back to you.

143
05:53.670 --> 05:56.130
<v ->Awesome, JJ, did you mention,</v>

144
05:56.130 --> 05:57.660
I don't know if, JJ, if you said it,

145
05:57.660 --> 05:59.220
but he's the executive director

146
05:59.220 --> 06:01.320
of North Carolina tolling authority,

147
06:01.320 --> 06:04.680
and so we have, for the first time, I think,

148
06:04.680 --> 06:06.420
in the room, government agencies

149
06:06.420 --> 06:09.150
executing tolling transactions over the air,

150
06:09.150 --> 06:12.810
and potentially disrupting the whole transponder industry

151
06:12.810 --> 06:14.940
by doing payments from cars.

152
06:14.940 --> 06:17.010
And I'm gonna introduce Cathi

153
06:17.010 --> 06:18.870
and doing some of the same stuff.

154
06:18.870 --> 06:19.703
Please go ahead.

155
06:19.703 --> 06:21.840
<v ->Yes. Hi, I'm Cathi Chinn.</v>

156
06:21.840 --> 06:24.270
I'm the Vice President of Innovation

157
06:24.270 --> 06:27.420
and Connected Vehicle Services at Verra Mobility.

158
06:27.420 --> 06:30.300
And Verra Mobility is a publicly traded company.

159
06:30.300 --> 06:33.930
I've been in business about two decades,

160
06:33.930 --> 06:36.000
and we've been serving transportation needs

161
06:36.000 --> 06:37.080
for quite some time.

162
06:37.080 --> 06:40.380
And what I mean by that is that we have serviced some

163
06:40.380 --> 06:43.710
of the largest fleets in the fleet managed carriers

164
06:43.710 --> 06:45.150
in the world.

165
06:45.150 --> 06:47.100
And we provide title

166
06:47.100 --> 06:51.510
and registration services, violation management services,

167
06:51.510 --> 06:52.890
tolling managed services.

168
06:52.890 --> 06:54.390
In fact, we're the largest

169
06:54.390 --> 06:56.673
global tolling managed service provider.

170
06:58.260 --> 07:00.000
And that's just one division.

171
07:00.000 --> 07:02.400
That's commercial services in which I work in.

172
07:02.400 --> 07:05.310
Verra Mobility also has two other divisions,

173
07:05.310 --> 07:07.680
one in parking, T2 Systems,

174
07:07.680 --> 07:10.500
servicing municipalities and universities.

175
07:10.500 --> 07:12.570
And our government services,

176
07:12.570 --> 07:14.970
which is your speed enforcement,

177
07:14.970 --> 07:19.050
red light cameras, speed cameras, school bus safety,

178
07:19.050 --> 07:21.870
I don't typically bring that up in social networks,

179
07:21.870 --> 07:23.820
'cause once you start talking about the fact

180
07:23.820 --> 07:27.213
that tickets are going out, you become really unpopular.

181
07:28.350 --> 07:31.530
So I joined Verra Mobility about three years ago,

182
07:31.530 --> 07:33.360
little over three years ago.

183
07:33.360 --> 07:35.100
And so excited to do so.

184
07:35.100 --> 07:36.540
I've been in transportation working

185
07:36.540 --> 07:39.390
with connected vehicles telematics data predominantly

186
07:39.390 --> 07:42.720
in safety and efficiency for over 20 years.

187
07:42.720 --> 07:46.110
But coming to Verra Mobility, they were looking

188
07:46.110 --> 07:50.040
for a really innovative shift in play

189
07:50.040 --> 07:52.290
into the automotive market,

190
07:52.290 --> 07:54.120
'cause it just makes sense, right?

191
07:54.120 --> 07:56.970
And I think that we've all talked about that for a while.

192
07:57.870 --> 08:01.290
We have a connected vehicle services platform

193
08:01.290 --> 08:05.790
that we have developed in partnerships with tolling agencies

194
08:05.790 --> 08:10.410
and automotive companies that we have had in play,

195
08:10.410 --> 08:12.657
in pilot, for about two and a half years,

196
08:12.657 --> 08:17.190
and just commercializing at the beginning of this year.

197
08:17.190 --> 08:21.180
And because of my desperate need to just fit in,

198
08:21.180 --> 08:23.553
I'm gonna run with the tolling theme here.

199
08:25.260 --> 08:27.270
We have been piloting a lot

200
08:27.270 --> 08:30.360
of different operational scenarios for tolling.

201
08:30.360 --> 08:33.510
So obviously we're thinking about payments,

202
08:33.510 --> 08:36.330
but also the complexities with tolling agencies

203
08:36.330 --> 08:39.090
and the toll roads, whether it's an express lane

204
08:39.090 --> 08:41.867
and you have to think about lane discrimination,

205
08:41.867 --> 08:44.790
whether it's high occupancy discounts

206
08:44.790 --> 08:47.940
and looking at passenger detection systems to determine

207
08:47.940 --> 08:49.590
how many people are in the vehicle,

208
08:49.590 --> 08:51.870
so you can appropriately rate that toll

209
08:51.870 --> 08:53.823
and pay that toll in real time.

210
08:54.720 --> 08:56.670
Also, congestion.

211
08:56.670 --> 08:59.160
Equity is a really big thing when you think

212
08:59.160 --> 09:02.670
about deploying toll roads in communities,

213
09:02.670 --> 09:04.590
especially disadvantaged communities,

214
09:04.590 --> 09:07.050
the impact that that can have.

215
09:07.050 --> 09:10.260
So we've also been piloting different mechanisms

216
09:10.260 --> 09:15.260
to identify equity and equity advantaged pricing.

217
09:17.010 --> 09:18.990
And so we're super excited

218
09:18.990 --> 09:20.880
to really continue with this platform.

219
09:20.880 --> 09:22.740
In fact, we've had some amazing partners,

220
09:22.740 --> 09:25.260
some sitting on this panel today,

221
09:25.260 --> 09:27.780
who have helped us in this connected vehicle journey.

222
09:27.780 --> 09:32.070
But it's definitely the time. The time is now.

223
09:32.070 --> 09:34.980
I think that when I look at connected vehicles

224
09:34.980 --> 09:39.600
and in-vehicle payments, it's really the same lifecycle,

225
09:39.600 --> 09:41.700
I think, very similar that we went through

226
09:41.700 --> 09:43.050
with mobile phones.

227
09:43.050 --> 09:45.120
And so if you remember we had mobile phones,

228
09:45.120 --> 09:47.310
we were afraid of smartphones for a while,

229
09:47.310 --> 09:49.110
and then slowly but surely,

230
09:49.110 --> 09:53.220
we begin to share more information like location data

231
09:53.220 --> 09:54.810
and other information.

232
09:54.810 --> 09:58.020
And we became comfortable with using the digital wallet

233
09:58.020 --> 10:01.140
of the phone, and I see that same transition happening

234
10:01.140 --> 10:01.973
in the vehicles.

235
10:01.973 --> 10:03.270
And so I think there's a lot

236
10:03.270 --> 10:06.300
that we can learn from that practice,

237
10:06.300 --> 10:08.130
and certainly it's one way

238
10:08.130 --> 10:10.890
to ease people into it of reminding them

239
10:10.890 --> 10:12.510
that we've been through this before.

240
10:12.510 --> 10:15.000
We went through it with the PCs,

241
10:15.000 --> 10:17.700
we went through it through mobile phones.

242
10:17.700 --> 10:19.650
I'm not familiar with the transition,

243
10:19.650 --> 10:21.420
'cause I'm way too young for the PCs,

244
10:21.420 --> 10:23.070
but my boss is in the audience,

245
10:23.070 --> 10:27.824
and so he is very familiar.

246
10:27.824 --> 10:29.940
(audience laughs)

247
10:29.940 --> 10:31.020
<v Suzanne>Your boss for now.</v>

248
10:31.020 --> 10:31.853
<v ->Yeah.</v>

249
10:31.853 --> 10:32.686
(audience laughs)

250
10:32.686 --> 10:36.000
My former boss (laughs) was there.

251
10:36.000 --> 10:38.490
But, I mean, we've been through this before, right?

252
10:38.490 --> 10:41.640
And so when we think about that bridge,

253
10:41.640 --> 10:43.350
I think it'll be easier this time

254
10:43.350 --> 10:45.030
than it has been in the past.

255
10:45.030 --> 10:46.500
But it's certainly the same type

256
10:46.500 --> 10:49.590
of requirements from a privacy perspective

257
10:49.590 --> 10:51.300
is obviously a concern,

258
10:51.300 --> 10:55.320
how we use that data, security authentication.

259
10:55.320 --> 10:59.310
One of the things that I'll mention is Verra Mobility,

260
10:59.310 --> 11:01.260
I mentioned that we service large fleets.

261
11:01.260 --> 11:05.550
Well, we are the primary provider for rental car companies

262
11:05.550 --> 11:08.070
as well with all of these different transactions.

263
11:08.070 --> 11:11.940
And so there's this shared aspect of payments.

264
11:11.940 --> 11:14.730
And so I think that's still one of the complexities

265
11:14.730 --> 11:15.750
that we have to think through

266
11:15.750 --> 11:19.290
and work on is that if you have a digital wallet associated

267
11:19.290 --> 11:20.490
with your car,

268
11:20.490 --> 11:22.920
and we start to move into shared environments,

269
11:22.920 --> 11:25.560
how do you authenticate, right?

270
11:25.560 --> 11:28.980
And not just from a rental car perspective and car share,

271
11:28.980 --> 11:32.310
but think about other people that use your car.

272
11:32.310 --> 11:35.970
There's new communities coming up where no cars are allowed,

273
11:35.970 --> 11:37.890
and basically you have a shared pool of cars.

274
11:37.890 --> 11:41.340
How do you think about managing the digital payments

275
11:41.340 --> 11:44.970
along the user journey for road charges?

276
11:44.970 --> 11:46.170
And when I think about road charges,

277
11:46.170 --> 11:49.260
I'm thinking about parking, I think about fueling,

278
11:49.260 --> 11:53.130
EV charging, tolling, road usage charge.

279
11:53.130 --> 11:54.810
So a lot of complexities there,

280
11:54.810 --> 11:56.580
but I think it's a very exciting time

281
11:56.580 --> 11:58.180
to be a part of this transition.

282
11:59.730 --> 12:00.630
<v ->I think it is too.</v>

283
12:00.630 --> 12:02.520
And we're gonna move on down the value chain.

284
12:02.520 --> 12:05.070
We talked a little about infrastructure and tolling.

285
12:05.070 --> 12:06.090
We're gonna move to a little bit

286
12:06.090 --> 12:08.820
of the other aspects of the payment.

287
12:08.820 --> 12:10.500
<v ->Hi, my name is Cynthia Hollen,</v>

288
12:10.500 --> 12:14.250
and I'm the CEO and founder of Mavi OnMyWay Commerce.

289
12:14.250 --> 12:16.530
And I've been working in the e-commerce

290
12:16.530 --> 12:21.270
and digital channels since the beginning of e-commerce.

291
12:21.270 --> 12:22.860
And I agree with you, Cathi,

292
12:22.860 --> 12:27.330
that payments have gotten in some ways easier

293
12:27.330 --> 12:30.210
since we went from the, "Oh, I don't know if it's safe

294
12:30.210 --> 12:33.780
to type my credit card number into this browser" thing,

295
12:33.780 --> 12:38.400
to now feeling much more comfortable with that.

296
12:38.400 --> 12:40.980
So it's gotten easier from that perspective,

297
12:40.980 --> 12:42.720
but it's actually gotten harder

298
12:42.720 --> 12:46.350
because payments has become a consumer service,

299
12:46.350 --> 12:49.140
whereas it used to be a thing that I had to do

300
12:49.140 --> 12:50.580
to buy a thing.

301
12:50.580 --> 12:52.290
Now it's a thing all by itself.

302
12:52.290 --> 12:57.240
We're putting, we're launching shopping from cars this week,

303
12:57.240 --> 12:58.230
next week, I think,

304
12:58.230 --> 13:00.127
so soon, you're gonna be able to buy an Audi,

305
13:00.127 --> 13:01.417
"Hey Audi, I'm hungry."

306
13:01.417 --> 13:03.990
"Okay, Cynthia, your favorite cheeseburger can be ready

307
13:03.990 --> 13:05.580
for you in five minutes.

308
13:05.580 --> 13:07.200
Do you want me to pay for it for you

309
13:07.200 --> 13:09.120
because your credit card is already built

310
13:09.120 --> 13:10.890
into the wallet of the car,

311
13:10.890 --> 13:12.180
tell them that you're coming,

312
13:12.180 --> 13:15.240
and by the way, would you like to have, you know,

313
13:15.240 --> 13:17.400
points accumulated as part of that?"

314
13:17.400 --> 13:18.750
This is what's happening, right?

315
13:18.750 --> 13:19.890
I'm talking to consumers

316
13:19.890 --> 13:21.540
and I'm telling them this amazing thing.

317
13:21.540 --> 13:22.650
Your car is gonna be able

318
13:22.650 --> 13:24.390
to make sure your French fries are crispy

319
13:24.390 --> 13:25.560
for you when you arrive

320
13:25.560 --> 13:27.900
and they're gonna be able to tell the delivery person

321
13:27.900 --> 13:29.190
what parking space you're in.

322
13:29.190 --> 13:30.360
You know what they ask me?

323
13:30.360 --> 13:31.440
They say, "Oh, am I gonna be able

324
13:31.440 --> 13:33.517
to get my loyalty points for that?"

325
13:33.517 --> 13:35.107
"Oh, can I use Apple Pay for that?"

326
13:35.107 --> 13:37.980
"Oh, am I gonna be able to have it identified from the,

327
13:37.980 --> 13:40.590
how do I know that it's my husband's credit card

328
13:40.590 --> 13:41.790
and not my credit card?"

329
13:41.790 --> 13:44.790
So the expectation from consumers about all

330
13:44.790 --> 13:47.340
of the sophistications of payments that they've come

331
13:47.340 --> 13:51.030
to be part of their everyday world are now the thing

332
13:51.030 --> 13:53.010
that's making payments more complicated.

333
13:53.010 --> 13:56.640
It's how many different ways people want to be able to pay,

334
13:56.640 --> 13:59.820
and we're really excited to bring that to people,

335
13:59.820 --> 14:03.330
because the more, frankly the more ways they want

336
14:03.330 --> 14:05.970
to give me their money in as many different places

337
14:05.970 --> 14:09.570
as they are, we're building more and more pipes.

338
14:09.570 --> 14:11.280
Those 72 minutes a day

339
14:11.280 --> 14:13.800
that we're all trapped in a car right now

340
14:13.800 --> 14:18.780
with not an easy way to spend more money is the playground

341
14:18.780 --> 14:21.333
for all of us to collect in right now.

342
14:23.280 --> 14:25.830
<v ->All right, thank you, Cynthia. John?</v>

343
14:25.830 --> 14:29.970
<v ->Hi, my name is John Moon. I'm with 19Y Advisors.</v>

344
14:29.970 --> 14:34.710
We kind of consult with clients on the automotive industry.

345
14:34.710 --> 14:37.170
Prior to this, I was a managing director

346
14:37.170 --> 14:40.170
at Honda Innovations working on in-vehicle payments.

347
14:40.170 --> 14:43.020
I think it's been now almost 10 years

348
14:43.020 --> 14:44.490
that I've actually worked on this.

349
14:44.490 --> 14:48.540
Not quite as long as the toll folks down there, but-

350
14:48.540 --> 14:51.360
<v Cynthia>Oh, the toll folks.</v>

351
14:51.360 --> 14:54.750
<v ->I think in 2017 we showcased some work together</v>

352
14:54.750 --> 14:57.450
with fuel pumps and parking meters,

353
14:57.450 --> 15:02.280
and then in 2019, kind of showcased an entire platform.

354
15:02.280 --> 15:04.920
I also worked more recently

355
15:04.920 --> 15:07.530
with the in-vehicle payments special interest group

356
15:07.530 --> 15:11.250
with COVESA, who's kind of a supporting sponsor

357
15:11.250 --> 15:15.030
of this session and panel as well.

358
15:15.030 --> 15:19.470
So I've kept in touch with a lot of the technology

359
15:19.470 --> 15:21.180
and the partners and the players

360
15:21.180 --> 15:24.900
and the OEMs within in-vehicle payments.

361
15:24.900 --> 15:27.914
And I have to say we are seeing the most,

362
15:27.914 --> 15:32.580
let's say signs of life in terms of a ecosystem

363
15:32.580 --> 15:34.140
that's beginning to thrive.

364
15:34.140 --> 15:37.770
You know, we have all of the parts and components.

365
15:37.770 --> 15:42.330
I think what we'll see this year is actually a bit

366
15:42.330 --> 15:45.060
of that organization that needs

367
15:45.060 --> 15:47.040
to make that ecosystem actually something

368
15:47.040 --> 15:50.100
that you deliver to clients and customers.

369
15:50.100 --> 15:54.360
And I think we're gonna start seeing that ability

370
15:54.360 --> 15:56.880
for the technology

371
15:56.880 --> 16:01.880
to really now be in consumer's hands, or in their cars,

372
16:03.540 --> 16:06.120
and you'll be able to start like actually seeing some

373
16:06.120 --> 16:06.960
of these transactions.

374
16:06.960 --> 16:09.000
I think there's an expectation

375
16:09.000 --> 16:12.210
that this capability should be there,

376
16:12.210 --> 16:15.420
and I think what you're starting to see is,

377
16:15.420 --> 16:18.450
automakers are actually beginning to deploy technologies

378
16:18.450 --> 16:19.650
that make it possible.

379
16:19.650 --> 16:23.370
And some of that's connectivity, some of that's screen size,

380
16:23.370 --> 16:28.140
some of that is actual like platforms, Android Automotive,

381
16:28.140 --> 16:30.510
or CarPlay even.

382
16:30.510 --> 16:33.600
So all of the ingredients are there,

383
16:33.600 --> 16:35.040
we just need to bake the cake,

384
16:35.040 --> 16:38.100
and hopefully that's what we start seeing here

385
16:38.100 --> 16:40.290
in the next few years.

386
16:40.290 --> 16:41.760
<v ->We're gonna see it this year.</v>

387
16:41.760 --> 16:43.350
So we've done infrastructure,

388
16:43.350 --> 16:46.590
we've done payment approaches or systems, payment systems,

389
16:46.590 --> 16:48.846
and now we have the banks.

390
16:48.846 --> 16:49.679
(John laughs)

391
16:49.679 --> 16:52.410
So Abdullah, if you could kick that off.

392
16:52.410 --> 16:53.243
<v ->Sure.</v>

393
16:53.243 --> 16:54.960
Hi, my name's Abdullah Pandit,

394
16:54.960 --> 16:58.320
and I work at JP Morgan Payments.

395
16:58.320 --> 17:00.090
So we talked about a lot of the use cases.

396
17:00.090 --> 17:03.270
We talked about tolling, we talked about QSR,

397
17:03.270 --> 17:04.773
we talked about parking here.

398
17:06.060 --> 17:09.510
The underlying capability across all these use cases

399
17:09.510 --> 17:12.840
is being able to make a payment for those,

400
17:12.840 --> 17:17.840
and in a safe, frictionless, efficient manner,

401
17:18.960 --> 17:21.060
whether that's through card payments

402
17:21.060 --> 17:22.740
in certain jurisdictions and countries,

403
17:22.740 --> 17:25.200
there's alternative payment methods as well like bank rail

404
17:25.200 --> 17:27.510
for certain use cases might be better off.

405
17:27.510 --> 17:29.610
So what we're looking to build at JP Morgan

406
17:29.610 --> 17:33.450
is a vertical SaaS platform dedicated to mobility,

407
17:33.450 --> 17:35.280
and we are working with a number

408
17:35.280 --> 17:36.843
of partners in the ecosystem,

409
17:37.860 --> 17:41.730
and we strongly believe that there is growth in this sector,

410
17:41.730 --> 17:44.760
and I think I have spoken to most

411
17:44.760 --> 17:46.710
of the people in this panel already,

412
17:46.710 --> 17:48.990
and that's something we really wanna bring in,

413
17:48.990 --> 17:53.070
and the fact we being working with a lot of these players,

414
17:53.070 --> 17:54.300
whether those are auto OEMs,

415
17:54.300 --> 17:57.630
whether those are energy majors or petrol majors,

416
17:57.630 --> 18:00.423
we're trying to build this platform of life.

417
18:04.110 --> 18:04.983
<v ->All right, Mo?</v>

418
18:07.440 --> 18:09.240
<v ->Hello, my name is Mohamed Abouelenin,</v>

419
18:09.240 --> 18:11.940
and I'm VP of product architecture

420
18:11.940 --> 18:13.980
and social engineering at MasterCard.

421
18:13.980 --> 18:15.390
Just a small like clarification,

422
18:15.390 --> 18:18.658
we are a network of banks, not just one bank. (laughs)

423
18:18.658 --> 18:19.491
<v Suzanne>Okay.</v>

424
18:19.491 --> 18:23.490
<v ->So we have been working, and we've been privileged</v>

425
18:23.490 --> 18:25.980
to be leading the payment innovation

426
18:25.980 --> 18:29.340
for the last almost decade that touches the commerce

427
18:29.340 --> 18:32.010
for digital and physical world,

428
18:32.010 --> 18:33.930
and with a specific interest

429
18:33.930 --> 18:35.640
and focus on connected vehicles,

430
18:35.640 --> 18:38.850
'cause of what we just have heard from all the use cases.

431
18:38.850 --> 18:40.950
That's very something very common we have heard

432
18:40.950 --> 18:43.050
from Cathi, from JJ

433
18:43.050 --> 18:45.240
that they are very keen on finding the best way

434
18:45.240 --> 18:46.800
for interoperability for payment,

435
18:46.800 --> 18:49.260
and this is exactly what we are working on.

436
18:49.260 --> 18:51.510
So we have been working on with a bunch of partners,

437
18:51.510 --> 18:54.540
as Abdullah mentioned, with a main goal,

438
18:54.540 --> 18:56.280
and more actually focusing

439
18:56.280 --> 18:59.370
on how can we bring all those partnerships in a way

440
18:59.370 --> 19:02.490
that we can enable standard way to communicate

441
19:02.490 --> 19:05.670
between the service providers and the credential providers?

442
19:05.670 --> 19:08.220
So the payment becomes very secure,

443
19:08.220 --> 19:10.140
seamless for the consumers,

444
19:10.140 --> 19:12.960
and we can leverage all the great technology data points

445
19:12.960 --> 19:15.060
that we have been seeing on the rise

446
19:15.060 --> 19:16.920
from the authentication,

447
19:16.920 --> 19:19.140
knowing that the how many actually passengers

448
19:19.140 --> 19:21.330
in the vehicle, and how can we leverage this

449
19:21.330 --> 19:24.090
in a very interoperable way based on a standard.

450
19:24.090 --> 19:28.710
So when we look at MasterCard, those actually solutions,

451
19:28.710 --> 19:33.150
we mainly focus on how first thing is how we make sure

452
19:33.150 --> 19:37.110
that the transaction is seamless, frictionless, secure.

453
19:37.110 --> 19:41.220
And then the second actually thing comes for us is the easy

454
19:41.220 --> 19:43.920
for the user journey to load their credentials,

455
19:43.920 --> 19:46.170
make sure that they are able to transact

456
19:46.170 --> 19:49.440
from an open loop infrastructure,

457
19:49.440 --> 19:51.480
that means they're banking cars.

458
19:51.480 --> 19:52.890
They don't need to juggle multiple apps,

459
19:52.890 --> 19:56.160
or multiple accounts, or QR code.

460
19:56.160 --> 19:59.970
That simplifies a lot their user journey on the second side,

461
19:59.970 --> 20:02.790
and the most important thing is we wanna make sure

462
20:02.790 --> 20:05.280
when we talk about partnerships,

463
20:05.280 --> 20:06.720
we meet our partners where they are.

464
20:06.720 --> 20:08.430
We don't ask them to just implement

465
20:08.430 --> 20:11.430
and live with the legacy solutions that have been there

466
20:11.430 --> 20:14.760
for payments for like 20 or for 30 years.

467
20:14.760 --> 20:17.340
We wanna make sure we co-innovate together, we hear them,

468
20:17.340 --> 20:20.310
we make sure we take the extra miles that we need to take

469
20:20.310 --> 20:22.380
to land where we need to land,

470
20:22.380 --> 20:24.510
and we don't need to boil the ocean on the other side.

471
20:24.510 --> 20:27.240
So we wanna make sure we start somewhere with what we have,

472
20:27.240 --> 20:30.210
and make sure we don't compromise on the payment principles,

473
20:30.210 --> 20:34.020
like secure, fast, seamless and and privacy by design.

474
20:34.020 --> 20:36.243
But we also wanna make sure we start,

475
20:37.080 --> 20:40.500
actually start meeting the demand from the customers,

476
20:40.500 --> 20:42.210
as JJ was mentioning.

477
20:42.210 --> 20:43.920
But last but not least, I would like to,

478
20:43.920 --> 20:47.700
wanna focus on the fact that in order to achieve this,

479
20:47.700 --> 20:49.560
we realized that we cannot do it alone.

480
20:49.560 --> 20:52.770
We have to do it with a bunch of the right partners,

481
20:52.770 --> 20:55.050
but also we wanted to build this infrastructure,

482
20:55.050 --> 20:57.240
and build this standardization

483
20:57.240 --> 20:59.400
for the infrastructure together with partners.

484
20:59.400 --> 21:01.650
And this is where we actually were have been leading

485
21:01.650 --> 21:05.910
with an EMVCo, which is the payment standardization body

486
21:05.910 --> 21:07.440
that actually assures the interoperability.

487
21:07.440 --> 21:10.560
This is how today, when you tap your phone

488
21:10.560 --> 21:13.260
or your card on a terminal,

489
21:13.260 --> 21:15.540
it doesn't actually matter whether it's a MasterCard

490
21:15.540 --> 21:18.990
or Visa, Amex, because it's the same actually protocol used

491
21:18.990 --> 21:20.880
to communicate between the device and the terminal.

492
21:20.880 --> 21:22.350
This is what we mean for interoperable,

493
21:22.350 --> 21:24.600
and this is what we exactly trying to bring here

494
21:24.600 --> 21:27.270
for all connected vehicles use cases.

495
21:27.270 --> 21:30.270
We are actually spending from tollways,

496
21:30.270 --> 21:32.610
parking, EV charging, fuel,

497
21:32.610 --> 21:34.770
we are covering all those use cases trying

498
21:34.770 --> 21:37.470
to lead standardization with an EMVCo

499
21:37.470 --> 21:39.030
so we can have the base

500
21:39.030 --> 21:41.580
and foundation for all partners to innovate upon,

501
21:41.580 --> 21:45.600
and scale the use case with other actually partners

502
21:45.600 --> 21:49.270
within the ecosystem, and with that, back to you, Suzanne.

503
21:49.270 --> 21:50.640
<v ->Yeah, that was amazing.</v>

504
21:50.640 --> 21:52.680
By the way, everyone did that so precisely,

505
21:52.680 --> 21:55.500
and we have 18 minutes left, so that's very exciting.

506
21:55.500 --> 21:59.220
So when we think about the value chain of this transaction,

507
21:59.220 --> 22:00.930
there's one group which is missing,

508
22:00.930 --> 22:02.340
because we didn't have any more room

509
22:02.340 --> 22:03.697
for more chairs up here.

510
22:03.697 --> 22:04.680
(audience laughs)

511
22:04.680 --> 22:07.800
I'm not even kidding, and that is the OEMs.

512
22:07.800 --> 22:09.690
And so I'm gonna pose, you know,

513
22:09.690 --> 22:11.580
the question that we talked about ahead of time,

514
22:11.580 --> 22:14.550
which is I'm gonna ask all of you to talk

515
22:14.550 --> 22:16.890
a little bit about maybe one

516
22:16.890 --> 22:20.880
or two specific things that you're going to do in 2025,

517
22:20.880 --> 22:23.850
because you know, I think maybe it's because I got

518
22:23.850 --> 22:25.530
an actual vacation over Christmas,

519
22:25.530 --> 22:28.020
and like for a few days I didn't leave the house,

520
22:28.020 --> 22:29.850
but I came back feeling so fired up

521
22:29.850 --> 22:31.740
and so excited about this year

522
22:31.740 --> 22:34.080
that this is gonna be the year where it happens.

523
22:34.080 --> 22:35.550
And so I'm hoping that all

524
22:35.550 --> 22:37.560
of you guys could maybe talk a little bit

525
22:37.560 --> 22:41.010
about one specific thing that you're doing this year

526
22:41.010 --> 22:44.070
to make payment from the vehicles a reality,

527
22:44.070 --> 22:47.190
and if you could incorporate maybe your work with the OEMs,

528
22:47.190 --> 22:50.790
because they're not here, but I assure you,

529
22:50.790 --> 22:53.970
and I assure you that they are deeply engaged in this,

530
22:53.970 --> 22:56.400
and deeply involved with many members on our panel,

531
22:56.400 --> 22:58.230
and independently working on this also.

532
22:58.230 --> 23:01.170
So they're not left out of what we're working on here.

533
23:01.170 --> 23:02.670
So if you wouldn't mind,

534
23:02.670 --> 23:04.860
could you kick us off, JJ, and talk about that?

535
23:04.860 --> 23:08.130
<v ->Sure, so this year, I am actually really excited,</v>

536
23:08.130 --> 23:12.630
'cause North Carolina, as a business unit,

537
23:12.630 --> 23:14.760
we'll call it like that, 'cause we're actually a business

538
23:14.760 --> 23:18.120
within government, we're actually responsible for our own,

539
23:18.120 --> 23:19.530
you know, P&amp;L and stuff like that.

540
23:19.530 --> 23:24.420
So I don't believe in just doing things to do 'em,

541
23:24.420 --> 23:25.253
and I don't believe

542
23:25.253 --> 23:28.050
in doing 7 million white papers to get there.

543
23:28.050 --> 23:30.000
So you know, we're the ones that came up

544
23:30.000 --> 23:33.090
with the video enforcement system,

545
23:33.090 --> 23:34.590
you know, out of North Carolina.

546
23:34.590 --> 23:36.900
We actually piloted that originally,

547
23:36.900 --> 23:39.810
and we were the first ones to do all electronic tolling too,

548
23:39.810 --> 23:41.460
and take the toll booths out.

549
23:41.460 --> 23:45.300
So you know, in anything, you have to prove the concept.

550
23:45.300 --> 23:49.800
So this year, second quarter, hopefully, you know,

551
23:49.800 --> 23:53.580
we're going to have a connected vehicle payment system,

552
23:53.580 --> 23:56.370
end-to-end, to try to make that happen,

553
23:56.370 --> 23:58.410
to prove the concept that it really works.

554
23:58.410 --> 24:00.150
We're working with a couple car companies,

555
24:00.150 --> 24:01.860
a couple of the payment providers,

556
24:01.860 --> 24:06.000
and the ultimate goal is to come up with an open system

557
24:06.000 --> 24:08.160
that will do not just tolling,

558
24:08.160 --> 24:10.440
but the other things I talked about earlier, parking,

559
24:10.440 --> 24:11.820
fast food, you know,

560
24:11.820 --> 24:13.710
basically anything you could talk about,

561
24:13.710 --> 24:16.020
car washes and things,

562
24:16.020 --> 24:18.960
like open it up to the things you talked about

563
24:18.960 --> 24:21.000
is ordering your, your French fries

564
24:21.000 --> 24:22.410
and your hamburger, right?

565
24:22.410 --> 24:23.760
And then getting points for it,

566
24:23.760 --> 24:25.650
and making sure that it all comes together.

567
24:25.650 --> 24:28.260
There's a lot to do to get there.

568
24:28.260 --> 24:29.940
Tolling, as you know, has been kind

569
24:29.940 --> 24:34.230
of a compartmentalized thing between agencies.

570
24:34.230 --> 24:35.370
But you know, as I said,

571
24:35.370 --> 24:37.500
I was there when we founded E-ZPass.

572
24:37.500 --> 24:39.150
Nobody wanted to do it, right?

573
24:39.150 --> 24:40.950
It was just seven agencies originally.

574
24:40.950 --> 24:43.920
Now we're up to like 36, right?

575
24:43.920 --> 24:45.570
We have 15 agencies partnered

576
24:45.570 --> 24:47.370
with us on this connected vehicle pilot

577
24:47.370 --> 24:49.803
that we're working on for payment currently.

578
24:50.700 --> 24:53.280
We've come together on interoperability.

579
24:53.280 --> 24:55.860
Now you can drive the whole East Coast,

580
24:55.860 --> 24:57.720
and into Texas, and Colorado,

581
24:57.720 --> 25:01.860
and others on the same transponders and our license plate.

582
25:01.860 --> 25:04.590
So we're working together on making it happen,

583
25:04.590 --> 25:09.150
and again it's not just North Carolina trying

584
25:09.150 --> 25:11.400
to come up with a system for them.

585
25:11.400 --> 25:14.070
We're trying to come up with an open payment system

586
25:14.070 --> 25:18.240
and an open platform that will work for everybody.

587
25:18.240 --> 25:20.913
My CTO Manish is in the audience,

588
25:21.870 --> 25:23.700
and in reality, we'll probably go

589
25:23.700 --> 25:25.680
through a couple different phases of this.

590
25:25.680 --> 25:28.140
If anything, E-ZPass did too, right?

591
25:28.140 --> 25:29.640
All electronic toll collection.

592
25:29.640 --> 25:31.230
There's one agency that just went live

593
25:31.230 --> 25:32.910
with it 35 years later.

594
25:32.910 --> 25:36.120
So you know, it's gonna evolve.

595
25:36.120 --> 25:38.670
This is a evolution, not a revolution.

596
25:38.670 --> 25:40.980
But I think you brought up the cell phone.

597
25:40.980 --> 25:42.930
I think that's a good analogy.

598
25:42.930 --> 25:47.910
You know, probably not as fast as AI caught on to the,

599
25:47.910 --> 25:50.850
you know, that's probably the first one now for expansion,

600
25:50.850 --> 25:53.220
and cell phones were second,

601
25:53.220 --> 25:55.320
but I think this is really gonna take off.

602
25:56.160 --> 25:57.197
<v ->All right, Cathi.</v>

603
25:58.890 --> 26:00.000
<v ->So I mentioned earlier</v>

604
26:00.000 --> 26:05.000
that we have been piloting road usage charging

605
26:05.220 --> 26:07.980
and tolling for about two and a half years.

606
26:07.980 --> 26:12.980
And so in 2025 is our point of commercialization,

607
26:14.340 --> 26:15.450
and so we're working

608
26:15.450 --> 26:19.083
with multiple OEMs at different phases in the pipeline,

609
26:20.460 --> 26:25.380
but it will be really exciting to see the work

610
26:25.380 --> 26:28.890
and all of the lessons learned applied

611
26:28.890 --> 26:32.220
for the commercial aspect this year.

612
26:32.220 --> 26:36.300
The one thing that that I wanna mention I thought about

613
26:36.300 --> 26:37.620
as you were talking, JJ,

614
26:37.620 --> 26:42.620
is that it has been essential to have the right partners

615
26:43.920 --> 26:46.950
in the room when you go about things like this.

616
26:46.950 --> 26:49.800
And so, JJ, you were talking about your community,

617
26:49.800 --> 26:51.100
and the tolling community,

618
26:52.385 --> 26:54.060
and so for those of you who aren't aware,

619
26:54.060 --> 26:58.620
there's a larger organization, IBTTA,

620
26:58.620 --> 27:01.530
which is a collection of toll agencies

621
27:01.530 --> 27:06.200
and industry experts that jump in fully ready

622
27:07.290 --> 27:08.340
to move things forward.

623
27:08.340 --> 27:11.730
And so I can tell you that without their help

624
27:11.730 --> 27:14.610
and without their participation, without them allowing us

625
27:14.610 --> 27:16.920
to use their toll roads

626
27:16.920 --> 27:20.010
and the different scenarios that they have,

627
27:20.010 --> 27:22.740
we wouldn't be as far along as we are today.

628
27:22.740 --> 27:24.960
We wouldn't be ready for commercialization.

629
27:24.960 --> 27:28.590
And so I see more of that in the future,

630
27:28.590 --> 27:32.760
and I think that there's other organizations

631
27:32.760 --> 27:34.650
in authoring bodies

632
27:34.650 --> 27:38.250
that will probably dive a little bit deeper into

633
27:38.250 --> 27:39.690
to get that type of support.

634
27:39.690 --> 27:41.580
But our focus is commercialization

635
27:41.580 --> 27:44.820
and learning from the consumer experience.

636
27:44.820 --> 27:45.870
<v ->That's awesome. Thank you.</v>

637
27:45.870 --> 27:48.000
So we have toll deployments, look for this year.

638
27:48.000 --> 27:48.990
By this time next year,

639
27:48.990 --> 27:50.760
we'll have several toll deployments.

640
27:50.760 --> 27:52.350
Cynthia, I know you can't see the clock.

641
27:52.350 --> 27:54.240
It's at 12 minutes.

642
27:54.240 --> 27:55.500
You don't have the benefit of that.

643
27:55.500 --> 27:59.250
So we have three minutes for, oh see,

644
27:59.250 --> 28:00.543
look at how clever you are, thank you.

645
28:00.543 --> 28:02.520
<v ->I am going to speak on behalf</v>

646
28:02.520 --> 28:06.120
of what I call great big giant motorized shopping carts

647
28:06.120 --> 28:07.833
on wheels, the OEMs.

648
28:08.970 --> 28:10.560
We work closely with a lot

649
28:10.560 --> 28:13.440
of these motorized shopping cart companies,

650
28:13.440 --> 28:17.430
and in fact, we're invited into the industry four years ago

651
28:17.430 --> 28:21.540
by several of them, who smartly said we've been trying

652
28:21.540 --> 28:25.080
to put shopping, in-car shopping in vehicles for years,

653
28:25.080 --> 28:28.170
and we finally figured out that we're car guys.

654
28:28.170 --> 28:30.810
We actually need someone who understands retail

655
28:30.810 --> 28:32.250
and understands consumers,

656
28:32.250 --> 28:35.160
and understands payments to tell us what is it

657
28:35.160 --> 28:36.750
that consumers want.

658
28:36.750 --> 28:39.240
Or as I like to say, how can I take all

659
28:39.240 --> 28:42.030
of your money in every place that you are?

660
28:42.030 --> 28:46.020
Can you please retail experts, marketplace experts,

661
28:46.020 --> 28:48.630
consumer experts, tell us what do we do

662
28:48.630 --> 28:51.420
with this fabulous biggest interactive screen

663
28:51.420 --> 28:53.760
in your household that is GPS-enabled

664
28:53.760 --> 28:56.460
and tied to an in-car wallet,

665
28:56.460 --> 28:58.560
and actually provide an experience

666
28:58.560 --> 28:59.880
that consumers care about?

667
28:59.880 --> 29:02.520
And we know that it's tolling, and we know that it's fuel,

668
29:02.520 --> 29:03.600
and we know that it's parking

669
29:03.600 --> 29:05.820
and we think that it's these other things.

670
29:05.820 --> 29:07.440
Can you tell us what that means?

671
29:07.440 --> 29:08.940
So I think that's great

672
29:08.940 --> 29:11.310
that the OEMs are thinking about ways

673
29:11.310 --> 29:15.750
that this consumer electronic device can become a real part

674
29:15.750 --> 29:18.330
of my world other than a piece of transportation.

675
29:18.330 --> 29:21.090
And they are all out there thinking about it.

676
29:21.090 --> 29:23.790
In terms of commercialization, as I mentioned,

677
29:23.790 --> 29:26.700
we are actually rolling out into millions of vehicles

678
29:26.700 --> 29:29.430
with in-car commerce in the next weeks,

679
29:29.430 --> 29:33.060
in the next days, I think, certainly up

680
29:33.060 --> 29:36.000
to about 15 million vehicles in the United States this year

681
29:36.000 --> 29:38.220
across about four or five different OEMs.

682
29:38.220 --> 29:41.220
And the technology partnerships, as Cathi mentioned,

683
29:41.220 --> 29:43.230
are critical to making that happen,

684
29:43.230 --> 29:46.380
not just in the car world, but in the retail world.

685
29:46.380 --> 29:47.820
How do you partner with Walmart?

686
29:47.820 --> 29:50.190
How do you partner with Oracle, and NCR,

687
29:50.190 --> 29:54.810
and all of these players, because the cars are a screen,

688
29:54.810 --> 29:58.290
the retail coming from the world of retail, I'm biased,

689
29:58.290 --> 29:59.910
the retail is what's really out there,

690
29:59.910 --> 30:03.180
and this is another channel for us to sell more things.

691
30:03.180 --> 30:06.120
If you wanna see an example of some of the great technology

692
30:06.120 --> 30:09.090
that's being being put in place, JP Morgan, and Mavi,

693
30:09.090 --> 30:11.760
and Qualcomm have a demo right downstairs

694
30:11.760 --> 30:15.750
where you can see a combined using the bio identity

695
30:15.750 --> 30:18.750
to recognize a person figuring out which payment device

696
30:18.750 --> 30:20.490
to use based on that camera.

697
30:20.490 --> 30:23.010
So the valet isn't stealing your car and going out

698
30:23.010 --> 30:24.990
and buying a burger on, you know,

699
30:24.990 --> 30:26.883
on joyriding with your burgers.

700
30:28.080 --> 30:29.160
And then Mavi, of course,

701
30:29.160 --> 30:31.530
is processing the transaction and putting that through.

702
30:31.530 --> 30:34.350
So the problem has been solved.

703
30:34.350 --> 30:36.690
What we've all been trying to think about making happen

704
30:36.690 --> 30:39.630
for 10 years, it's here now.

705
30:39.630 --> 30:42.543
So shop a lot from your cars.

706
30:45.030 --> 30:48.210
<v ->And to Cynthia's point, the technology,</v>

707
30:48.210 --> 30:49.620
and what I said before,

708
30:49.620 --> 30:54.218
the ecosystem's kind of primed and ready.

709
30:54.218 --> 30:58.530
I worked with Mohamed's group before, five years ago,

710
30:58.530 --> 31:01.200
and the technology, payments technology,

711
31:01.200 --> 31:03.420
was there and available then.

712
31:03.420 --> 31:05.940
It's available now.

713
31:05.940 --> 31:08.190
But again, I think there are many components

714
31:08.190 --> 31:10.680
to the ecosystem that need to mature,

715
31:10.680 --> 31:14.280
and I think you're starting to see that maturity.

716
31:14.280 --> 31:15.690
To take a transportation analogy,

717
31:15.690 --> 31:16.920
I don't think it's gonna be a bang.

718
31:16.920 --> 31:20.163
I think it's gonna be like a train leaving the station.

719
31:21.360 --> 31:23.910
More people will get on board, you'll see more

720
31:23.910 --> 31:27.990
and more implementations, you'll see more success,

721
31:27.990 --> 31:29.310
and that will build on itself.

722
31:29.310 --> 31:34.310
So I think it'll be more like a train, less of a bang,

723
31:34.830 --> 31:38.400
and that's kind of looking at a variety

724
31:38.400 --> 31:42.327
of the different OEMs that I work with through partners

725
31:42.327 --> 31:45.690
and a variety of other partners that we advise

726
31:45.690 --> 31:47.133
or clients that we advise.

727
31:48.120 --> 31:50.700
But yeah, I think you'll start to see more

728
31:50.700 --> 31:52.773
and more of it this year.

729
31:56.040 --> 31:57.740
<v ->So I wanna sort of...</v>

730
32:00.360 --> 32:04.980
Hi, so I wanna touch upon some of the stuff that John said

731
32:04.980 --> 32:06.393
and Cynthia said earlier.

732
32:07.350 --> 32:09.453
So payments has been around for a while.

733
32:10.500 --> 32:12.870
Vehicle is just a different form factor.

734
32:12.870 --> 32:14.310
You've had mobile phones.

735
32:14.310 --> 32:15.690
Before that, you had desktops.

736
32:15.690 --> 32:20.403
Before that, you had physical form factors, physical cards.

737
32:21.660 --> 32:24.660
What makes payments from automotive or vehicles unique

738
32:24.660 --> 32:27.390
is the identity and authentication piece

739
32:27.390 --> 32:28.440
because is very different

740
32:28.440 --> 32:31.680
from how it's done in other form factors.

741
32:31.680 --> 32:34.410
And I think that's something which

742
32:34.410 --> 32:36.630
was something we wanna focus on solving this year.

743
32:36.630 --> 32:39.510
And that's something, as Cynthia mentioned downstairs,

744
32:39.510 --> 32:40.680
you can go to the Qualcomm booth.

745
32:40.680 --> 32:43.650
We've done it with Qualcomm where we're showcasing

746
32:43.650 --> 32:47.880
how the payment credentials tie to the biometric facial ID

747
32:47.880 --> 32:51.093
of the individual can be used to perform a payment.

748
32:52.050 --> 32:53.910
And I think that's one

749
32:53.910 --> 32:56.340
of the things we've really pushed this year.

750
32:56.340 --> 32:59.280
We are already working with a number of automotives

751
32:59.280 --> 33:01.740
across Europe and North America,

752
33:01.740 --> 33:03.090
and that's something we wanna sort

753
33:03.090 --> 33:05.140
of bring out over the course of the year.

754
33:07.770 --> 33:10.680
<v ->Thank you, so I will start by saying</v>

755
33:10.680 --> 33:12.360
that we're gonna actually make

756
33:12.360 --> 33:14.700
all your wishes happen for 2025.

757
33:14.700 --> 33:18.337
We're gonna build the all the rail for this to make happen.

758
33:18.337 --> 33:20.113
(panel members laugh)
Yeah, late Santa Claus

759
33:20.113 --> 33:22.650
(laughs) Christmas present.

760
33:22.650 --> 33:26.220
So let's start by maybe actually how we closed 2024.

761
33:26.220 --> 33:30.150
So we have been able by means of engagement

762
33:30.150 --> 33:34.740
with like great partners in the OEM industry, from OEM side,

763
33:34.740 --> 33:39.740
from service provider side, from service integrators side,

764
33:40.050 --> 33:42.780
to be able to build lots

765
33:42.780 --> 33:47.490
of the infrastructure needed for car commerce to happen.

766
33:47.490 --> 33:49.950
And with one big actually milestone happened,

767
33:49.950 --> 33:52.860
end of last year, that when one of the major OEMs,

768
33:52.860 --> 33:54.960
I wish we can actually disclose the name,

769
33:54.960 --> 33:56.430
we have been able

770
33:56.430 --> 34:00.660
to run the first open loop payment transaction

771
34:00.660 --> 34:04.710
for EV charging session using an actually production vehicle

772
34:04.710 --> 34:08.700
with zero modifications on the vehicle,

773
34:08.700 --> 34:12.210
and small modifications on production charger.

774
34:12.210 --> 34:14.820
That was actually a great achievement,

775
34:14.820 --> 34:17.160
because it built and allowed us to build a foundation

776
34:17.160 --> 34:19.740
that's gonna enable lots of those interoperability

777
34:19.740 --> 34:20.940
that we have been talking about

778
34:20.940 --> 34:22.350
and facilitate more

779
34:22.350 --> 34:24.510
from what we have been actually discussing today

780
34:24.510 --> 34:26.520
from use case perspective.

781
34:26.520 --> 34:28.832
And what we are looking for in 2025

782
34:28.832 --> 34:30.900
is run actually at this couple of pilots

783
34:30.900 --> 34:32.970
for a couple of use cases toll agencies,

784
34:32.970 --> 34:35.850
and EV charging is gonna be on top of them

785
34:35.850 --> 34:40.740
to demonstrate actually how the standard's gonna help scale

786
34:40.740 --> 34:45.003
those use cases with different industry stakeholders.

787
34:46.650 --> 34:47.910
Thank you.

788
34:47.910 --> 34:48.743
<v ->Wow. That was great.</v>

789
34:48.743 --> 34:51.240
We did that with five minutes left.

790
34:51.240 --> 34:54.060
Does anybody in the audience have any questions?

791
34:54.060 --> 34:56.843
I know we're not set up to do that, but I can come down and,

792
34:58.290 --> 34:59.840
Oh, go ahead. Let me come down.

793
35:05.430 --> 35:06.263
All right.

794
35:11.430 --> 35:15.930
<v Audience Member>So I think I heard you say you guys</v>

795
35:15.930 --> 35:20.930
are piloting some in-vehicle payment scenarios

796
35:21.060 --> 35:23.310
with EV charging.

797
35:23.310 --> 35:24.143
<v ->That's right.</v>

798
35:24.143 --> 35:26.220
<v ->Okay, 'cause I know a lot of times,</v>

799
35:26.220 --> 35:29.130
there are challenges when individuals

800
35:29.130 --> 35:30.990
are using their apps to charge,

801
35:30.990 --> 35:35.820
and there's always issues, and so definitely like the toll

802
35:35.820 --> 35:38.420
and all the other activities, 'cause those are real.

803
35:39.300 --> 35:42.480
But you know, in order to drive EV demand

804
35:42.480 --> 35:46.380
and getting people more comfortable, just seeing more pilots

805
35:46.380 --> 35:49.170
around in-vehicle payments for charging

806
35:49.170 --> 35:51.510
just to make that seamless.

807
35:51.510 --> 35:52.500
<v ->I love the question.</v>

808
35:52.500 --> 35:54.630
That's exactly what we have been actually busy doing

809
35:54.630 --> 35:56.250
for the whole last year,

810
35:56.250 --> 35:58.500
and for exact addressing your concern,

811
35:58.500 --> 36:00.480
and as we said from the second actually pillar

812
36:00.480 --> 36:03.090
within MasterCard, how we look at those things.

813
36:03.090 --> 36:05.370
We wanna make sure that users have the freedom

814
36:05.370 --> 36:07.950
to choose whatever actually payment method they wanna have

815
36:07.950 --> 36:09.360
without actually being forced

816
36:09.360 --> 36:12.270
to have specific apps, creating an account,

817
36:12.270 --> 36:13.920
private label cards.

818
36:13.920 --> 36:15.600
They wanna actually make a transaction,

819
36:15.600 --> 36:17.100
this should be truly

820
36:17.100 --> 36:20.760
what is called in the EV charging industry plug and charge.

821
36:20.760 --> 36:22.500
That's what we are standardizing and going after

822
36:22.500 --> 36:24.650
to be more specific about EV charging open

823
36:24.650 --> 36:26.640
to payment standardization.

824
36:26.640 --> 36:28.350
This is exactly what we're piloting.

825
36:28.350 --> 36:29.580
But of course,

826
36:29.580 --> 36:31.380
because it's a very well established industry,

827
36:31.380 --> 36:34.980
as you know, with some sort of legacy,

828
36:34.980 --> 36:37.050
we have been trying to find the right

829
36:37.050 --> 36:38.790
and the best solution that actually,

830
36:38.790 --> 36:40.410
that does not actually necessarily disrupt

831
36:40.410 --> 36:43.680
the existing infrastructure from the OEM side

832
36:43.680 --> 36:44.550
or the charging side,

833
36:44.550 --> 36:47.730
but it just provide the minimum requirements

834
36:47.730 --> 36:50.280
that allows for payment to run securely and seamlessly,

835
36:50.280 --> 36:53.610
and address exactly your concern for the end consumers.

836
36:53.610 --> 36:55.770
<v ->And I think JJ wanted to add to that.</v>

837
36:55.770 --> 36:57.330
<v ->Yeah, I think, you know,</v>

838
36:57.330 --> 37:01.110
the whole electric vehicle concept that came along,

839
37:01.110 --> 37:04.410
I own one, and I own a hybrid also,

840
37:04.410 --> 37:07.950
has really pushed technology and vehicle, you know,

841
37:07.950 --> 37:12.060
10,000%, and as far as payment,

842
37:12.060 --> 37:13.800
you know, every time I go

843
37:13.800 --> 37:15.990
to charge away from my house, you know,

844
37:15.990 --> 37:19.560
it's an issue whether you're using whoever's or whatever.

845
37:19.560 --> 37:21.540
So I think that's a driver

846
37:21.540 --> 37:25.140
for this technology going forward, and in my industry,

847
37:25.140 --> 37:27.900
in tolling it's the business model too, right?

848
37:27.900 --> 37:29.400
So again, I said it before

849
37:29.400 --> 37:32.490
that originally we were designed to move traffic.

850
37:32.490 --> 37:35.070
Right now we're looking at revenue in order to build,

851
37:35.070 --> 37:38.163
you know, $110 million a mile roadways.

852
37:39.030 --> 37:43.005
The current business model we have does not sustain that.

853
37:43.005 --> 37:44.310
You know, we kind of inserted ourself

854
37:44.310 --> 37:47.070
as the middleman in the whole transaction

855
37:47.070 --> 37:48.780
where you don't really need that.

856
37:48.780 --> 37:50.160
I equate it to like,

857
37:50.160 --> 37:52.080
you should be like buying a shovel

858
37:52.080 --> 37:53.880
at Home Depot or wherever.

859
37:53.880 --> 37:55.530
You go, you buy the shovel, you paid,

860
37:55.530 --> 37:58.380
you make the payment, and you're out, right?

861
37:58.380 --> 38:00.630
You accumulate the points or whatever.

862
38:00.630 --> 38:02.850
You know, we have other issues.

863
38:02.850 --> 38:06.300
And two, I mentioned the transponder, out-of-state payments.

864
38:06.300 --> 38:09.660
You know, there's, you hear it in local news

865
38:09.660 --> 38:11.460
and all over the time, all over the place

866
38:11.460 --> 38:16.050
is that connecting across state lines is a problem.

867
38:16.050 --> 38:18.750
You know, in state we could hold your registration,

868
38:18.750 --> 38:20.700
we could do things like that, but out of state,

869
38:20.700 --> 38:22.530
we're accumulating hundreds of millions

870
38:22.530 --> 38:25.080
of dollars worth of uncollectible debt, right?

871
38:25.080 --> 38:27.780
So it's an unsustainable model that we have

872
38:27.780 --> 38:29.280
to look at going forward.

873
38:29.280 --> 38:31.440
And in any transition, as I said before,

874
38:31.440 --> 38:33.030
when we did E-ZPass,

875
38:33.030 --> 38:36.780
it wasn't easy to put it that way, right?

876
38:36.780 --> 38:39.570
And the technology was the easy part,

877
38:39.570 --> 38:40.950
and we had, when we went into it,

878
38:40.950 --> 38:43.020
we thought that would definitely be the hard part.

879
38:43.020 --> 38:43.853
It wasn't.

880
38:43.853 --> 38:46.800
It was the how do we handle the transactions,

881
38:46.800 --> 38:48.360
when are the payments being made?

882
38:48.360 --> 38:51.330
All that stuff that, you know, we didn't think about,

883
38:51.330 --> 38:52.890
that we know about now.

884
38:52.890 --> 38:57.420
So I think now is the time, it's a time in our industry

885
38:57.420 --> 39:00.420
who holds, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars,

886
39:00.420 --> 39:03.150
billions of dollars worth of transactions,

887
39:03.150 --> 39:05.823
and billions of transactions every day,

888
39:06.690 --> 39:09.570
that it's time now to move forward,

889
39:09.570 --> 39:13.950
and you know, eventually, tolling's not gonna be the dog.

890
39:13.950 --> 39:15.930
We'll probably be a flea on that dog

891
39:15.930 --> 39:18.360
because the size of the rest of the parking,

892
39:18.360 --> 39:20.010
and everything is bigger.

893
39:20.010 --> 39:23.160
But I think we're available for a launch.

894
39:23.160 --> 39:25.080
You know, we're the ones that are here now.

895
39:25.080 --> 39:27.390
We're the ones that have been doing it for, you know,

896
39:27.390 --> 39:29.700
50 years in my case, you know,

897
39:29.700 --> 39:32.250
and we have the customer base,

898
39:32.250 --> 39:34.290
so people are used to paying us.

899
39:34.290 --> 39:37.950
So anyway, I think this is a great time to move forward

900
39:37.950 --> 39:40.230
with connective vehicle payment,

901
39:40.230 --> 39:42.410
and if we don't do it now, it's gonna be a long time.

902
39:42.410 --> 39:44.310
<v Suzanne>And we have 30 seconds left.</v>

903
39:44.310 --> 39:45.810
I have one more question also.

904
39:47.100 --> 39:49.920
Thanks. Oh, is it, Roger? (laughs)

905
39:49.920 --> 39:50.970
Do you guys know him?

906
39:52.560 --> 39:54.900
<v Roger>Who knows me? Nobody.</v>

907
39:54.900 --> 39:56.100
Cathi, I got here a little late.

908
39:56.100 --> 39:58.320
I'm wondering, have you talked about the kind

909
39:58.320 --> 39:59.790
of run rate annualized

910
39:59.790 --> 40:03.183
that Verra is processing on connected cars?

911
40:05.880 --> 40:07.140
<v ->I could talk about,</v>

912
40:07.140 --> 40:09.840
publicly, I can talk about transactions,

913
40:09.840 --> 40:12.240
and just on the tolling side alone,

914
40:12.240 --> 40:16.470
we process over 300 million transactions a year.

915
40:16.470 --> 40:21.060
And so obviously that grows once we move into

916
40:21.060 --> 40:23.643
and commercialize with the OEMs.

917
40:24.480 --> 40:27.930
In fact, we're JJ's largest customer.

918
40:27.930 --> 40:29.700
In fact, almost every toll agency,

919
40:29.700 --> 40:31.950
we're their largest customers,

920
40:31.950 --> 40:34.080
because we actually hold the toll liability,

921
40:34.080 --> 40:37.350
and put the capital up to secure those transactions.

922
40:37.350 --> 40:39.030
<v ->All right. And we're out of time.</v>

923
40:39.030 --> 40:41.820
Also check out in ground dynamic charging.

924
40:41.820 --> 40:44.160
This is something that we're working into at AECOM.

925
40:44.160 --> 40:47.730
So the roads will be equipped with equipment

926
40:47.730 --> 40:49.980
to charge vehicles as they go by.

927
40:49.980 --> 40:52.740
And so we'll be looking at how to do payments for that too.

928
40:52.740 --> 40:55.770
All right, we'll answer questions privately after this,

929
40:55.770 --> 40:56.603
'cause our time is up.

930
40:56.603 --> 40:57.519
Thank you, everybody.

931
40:57.519 --> 40:59.982
<v ->Thank you, everybody.
(audience applauds)</v>

932
40:59.982 --> 41:02.649
(upbeat music)
