00:00.025 --> 00:03.608
(upbeat electronic music)

00:10.620 --> 00:13.410
<v ->Well, thank you so much everyone for joining us here</v>

00:13.410 --> 00:15.060
to talk about my favorite topic,

00:15.060 --> 00:16.410
women's health.

00:16.410 --> 00:18.540
We have a wonderful panel today.

00:18.540 --> 00:19.950
I can't wait to hear from them.

00:19.950 --> 00:22.257
And first, let me introduce myself.

00:22.257 --> 00:25.830
My name is Alice, I'm a partner with Foreground Capital,

00:25.830 --> 00:27.450
which is a venture capital fund

00:27.450 --> 00:30.150
investing in early-stage women's health companies.

00:30.150 --> 00:32.892
We have 22 companies in the portfolio,

00:32.892 --> 00:34.260
and are very excited

00:34.260 --> 00:38.010
to continue investing at the forefront of the space.

00:38.010 --> 00:40.050
So we don't have too much time today,

00:40.050 --> 00:43.140
so I wanna make sure we cover all the the key topics.

00:43.140 --> 00:44.400
And the first I like to start with

00:44.400 --> 00:47.190
is always the personal and the why.

00:47.190 --> 00:49.770
So, I like to hear from each panelist:

00:49.770 --> 00:50.610
What is your why?

00:50.610 --> 00:53.490
What brings you into the women's health world?

00:53.490 --> 00:54.841
So let's start with Sheena,

00:54.841 --> 00:56.580
Sheena who has a background

00:56.580 --> 00:58.560
in government affairs and relations

00:58.560 --> 01:00.742
and started a company in women's health.

01:00.742 --> 01:03.150
Tell us more about that journey

01:03.150 --> 01:05.790
and particularly the why that led you there.

01:05.790 --> 01:06.960
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

01:06.960 --> 01:08.370
So, it was two things.

01:08.370 --> 01:11.580
It was my lived experience as a woman

01:11.580 --> 01:13.890
and hearing the challenges of other women,

01:13.890 --> 01:17.130
how difficult it is to navigate the healthcare system.

01:17.130 --> 01:20.310
And so with my background, as you said,

01:20.310 --> 01:23.160
in government relations in the healthcare space,

01:23.160 --> 01:26.970
it really gave me a different and unique perspective

01:26.970 --> 01:29.670
of how the healthcare system worked,

01:29.670 --> 01:30.960
where there was siloed,

01:30.960 --> 01:35.850
and even there, there was cross pathways to work together,

01:35.850 --> 01:39.450
but it also gave me a front-row seat into how technology

01:39.450 --> 01:42.420
was going to change the future of healthcare.

01:42.420 --> 01:45.300
So it was all those things combined together.

01:45.300 --> 01:47.490
<v ->Okay, thank you. Christina.</v>

01:47.490 --> 01:48.990
<v ->Hi, Christina Wurster.</v>

01:48.990 --> 01:52.440
I'm with the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine,

01:52.440 --> 01:53.970
and I have spent most of my career

01:53.970 --> 01:56.220
working for professional medical societies.

01:56.220 --> 01:58.920
So working closely with clinicians

01:58.920 --> 02:00.480
first in the cardiology space,

02:00.480 --> 02:02.790
and now in high-risk obstetrics.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.310
And the reason I came into this, it was funny,

02:05.310 --> 02:08.400
I was actually interviewing for the position during COVID,

02:08.400 --> 02:10.241
but I could just feel the passion

02:10.241 --> 02:13.290
of the members and leaders of this organization

02:13.290 --> 02:14.760
even through Zoom,

02:14.760 --> 02:18.030
and I would say that even with the clinicians

02:18.030 --> 02:19.230
that I worked with before,

02:19.230 --> 02:22.050
but there's just such a passion for the work that they do

02:22.050 --> 02:23.160
in caring for patients

02:23.160 --> 02:24.960
and trying to really improve outcomes.

02:24.960 --> 02:28.470
And so ultimately, that's why I landed where I am.

02:28.470 --> 02:30.540
<v ->Wonderful, thank you so much for sharing.</v>

02:30.540 --> 02:33.510
And let's talk a little about each of your organizations.

02:33.510 --> 02:36.870
So let's first understand, maybe just one sentence.

02:36.870 --> 02:39.480
What does your organization do to help us see:

02:39.480 --> 02:42.240
Where does it sit within the ecosystem of women's health?

02:42.240 --> 02:44.550
There are innovators, there are investors,

02:44.550 --> 02:46.560
there are professional societies.

02:46.560 --> 02:49.980
So help us understand what your group does

02:49.980 --> 02:52.830
and perhaps a sense of the scale or impact.

02:52.830 --> 02:54.600
<v ->Yeah, I'll go first.</v>

02:54.600 --> 02:58.050
So we are a health informatics

02:58.050 --> 03:01.710
or data and analytics company focused on women's health.

03:01.710 --> 03:03.780
So, our mission is to build

03:03.780 --> 03:06.960
the first and largest women's health data index

03:06.960 --> 03:09.990
that cuts across demographics and health status.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.150
So, our vision is really to make sure

03:12.150 --> 03:14.340
that we can have women's health data

03:14.340 --> 03:18.300
be as powerful and actionable as oncology data is.

03:18.300 --> 03:21.690
And to date, we also have a telehealth platform.

03:21.690 --> 03:24.750
So, we've been able to reach over 8,000 women

03:24.750 --> 03:29.070
and then also be able to provide 2,000 of them with care.

03:29.070 --> 03:32.100
And obviously, we're able to get them to opt in

03:32.100 --> 03:33.750
to our research studies

03:33.750 --> 03:36.690
so that we are able to collect and manage their data

03:36.690 --> 03:38.790
for data analytics.

03:38.790 --> 03:39.750
<v ->Exciting, can you share a little bit</v>

03:39.750 --> 03:41.587
about what type of data you're collecting,

03:41.587 --> 03:43.380
and if it helps to bring it to life,

03:43.380 --> 03:46.350
maybe one example of what you're integrating

03:46.350 --> 03:47.880
also with the telehealth?

03:47.880 --> 03:52.800
<v ->Yeah, so what we do is we're really about early diagnosis,</v>

03:52.800 --> 03:54.390
and one of the things that we found out

03:54.390 --> 03:56.190
in the early stages of our company

03:56.190 --> 03:58.050
is that a lot of the diseases

03:58.050 --> 04:01.470
and conditions that impact women only, solely,

04:01.470 --> 04:04.200
or disproportionately have one thing in common,

04:04.200 --> 04:06.450
and that's dermatological conditions.

04:06.450 --> 04:09.330
So, our telehealth platform focuses on that first.

04:09.330 --> 04:12.150
So we're able to diagnose the skin condition

04:12.150 --> 04:14.100
and the underlying health condition,

04:14.100 --> 04:16.200
and then forward them on to a specialist

04:16.200 --> 04:18.810
that they need to see to manage that care.

04:18.810 --> 04:20.063
<v Alice>Great, thank you.</v>

04:20.978 --> 04:24.450
<v ->And so I work for professional medical society.</v>

04:24.450 --> 04:26.190
There are many professional medical societies

04:26.190 --> 04:27.420
across healthcare.

04:27.420 --> 04:30.840
Ours specifically focused on high-risk pregnancy.

04:30.840 --> 04:33.000
So, it's a membership organization

04:33.000 --> 04:35.640
for clinicians and other healthcare providers

04:35.640 --> 04:38.160
that focus on high-risk obstetrics.

04:38.160 --> 04:40.980
They do a general residency in OB-GYN

04:40.980 --> 04:44.970
and then a three-year fellowship in maternal fetal medicine.

04:44.970 --> 04:48.690
There are about 3,000 board-certified MFMs within the US,

04:48.690 --> 04:52.470
and over 90% of those are members of our organization.

04:52.470 --> 04:54.570
But we've been growing, it's a very collaborative,

04:54.570 --> 04:56.220
we kind of like to think of MFM

04:56.220 --> 04:58.830
as the internal medicine of obstetrics

04:58.830 --> 05:02.070
because they work across therapeutic areas

05:02.070 --> 05:04.470
with partners in cardiology, endocrinology,

05:04.470 --> 05:06.990
mental health, for example.

05:06.990 --> 05:10.200
And we focus predominantly on promoting research,

05:10.200 --> 05:13.170
providing continuing medical education

05:13.170 --> 05:16.650
and also advocacy for both patient access

05:16.650 --> 05:17.490
and things like that.

05:17.490 --> 05:18.570
And we work very closely

05:18.570 --> 05:20.586
with a lot of different stakeholder groups,

05:20.586 --> 05:23.100
whether in government, industry,

05:23.100 --> 05:25.950
or other nonprofit organizations.

05:25.950 --> 05:28.290
<v ->Thank you, so that's great to hear.</v>

05:28.290 --> 05:30.120
And now we know what your vantage point is,

05:30.120 --> 05:32.820
Sheena, really speaking from the perspective

05:32.820 --> 05:34.800
having worked with patients

05:34.800 --> 05:36.390
and integrating different types of data

05:36.390 --> 05:38.640
and Christina, with your members.

05:38.640 --> 05:41.850
So next, I'd love to move into the core topics,

05:41.850 --> 05:44.980
which is really around the gaps in women's health

05:45.840 --> 05:49.440
at the intersection of technology and women's health.

05:49.440 --> 05:50.640
And then we'll talk about solutions.

05:50.640 --> 05:53.280
So actually, let me go to Christina first.

05:53.280 --> 05:57.240
What types of gaps are you hearing about from your members,

05:57.240 --> 05:59.460
these MFMs that are providing care daily

05:59.460 --> 06:02.370
to patients in obstetrics?

06:02.370 --> 06:03.389
<v ->Yeah, I mean there's a lot,</v>

06:03.389 --> 06:04.222
(Christina laughing)

06:04.222 --> 06:06.330
so many people are aware,

06:06.330 --> 06:07.980
but I often try to think

06:07.980 --> 06:09.660
from our organization's perspective,

06:09.660 --> 06:11.370
our goal is to help improve

06:11.370 --> 06:14.430
the day-to-day of our members and support them.

06:14.430 --> 06:19.260
Some of the biggest challenges are in patient access,

06:19.260 --> 06:22.980
increasing costs, and increasing complications.

06:22.980 --> 06:26.340
So more and more women and pregnant women are becoming...

06:26.340 --> 06:29.615
considered high risk no longer just based on age.

06:29.615 --> 06:33.810
35 and older is considered a geriatric pregnancy,

06:33.810 --> 06:36.330
but because of so many comorbid conditions,

06:36.330 --> 06:39.150
there's a lot of high-risk pregnancies now

06:39.150 --> 06:40.680
and complications.

06:40.680 --> 06:42.660
And so one of the biggest challenges

06:42.660 --> 06:47.220
is not just access with increase of maternal care deserts,

06:47.220 --> 06:48.270
for example,

06:48.270 --> 06:49.620
but also workforce

06:49.620 --> 06:53.610
and encouraging more people to come into the field.

06:53.610 --> 06:57.000
So, a lot of our members are burnt out,

06:57.000 --> 06:59.430
and so that's a big challenge.

06:59.430 --> 07:00.303
<v ->Got it.</v>

07:00.303 --> 07:02.730
And on the prop call, you mentioned an article

07:02.730 --> 07:05.010
that highlights the maternal healthcare deserts.

07:05.010 --> 07:06.210
Can you share more about that?

07:06.210 --> 07:09.270
<v ->Yeah, in fact one of our partners, the March of Dimes,</v>

07:09.270 --> 07:10.710
many of you probably familiar,

07:10.710 --> 07:13.290
just released their report card.

07:13.290 --> 07:16.680
They do it every year, and it's an alarming statistic.

07:16.680 --> 07:19.080
They kind of give a grade, I think it was a D,

07:19.080 --> 07:21.660
D+ or something among developed countries,

07:21.660 --> 07:24.540
which is obviously going in the wrong direction.

07:24.540 --> 07:27.117
But 50% of counties within the US

07:27.117 --> 07:30.210
do not have obstetric care services.

07:30.210 --> 07:32.130
And 35% of counties...

07:32.130 --> 07:34.230
I'm not countries, I'm sorry, counties,

07:34.230 --> 07:38.160
35% of counties are considered maternal healthcare deserts.

07:38.160 --> 07:41.190
And this data was from 2022.

07:41.190 --> 07:44.040
And we're actually seeing anecdotally across our members

07:44.040 --> 07:46.980
that more and more labor and delivery units are closing.

07:46.980 --> 07:48.360
And that's multifactorial,

07:48.360 --> 07:53.360
but it's leading to limited resources.

07:53.580 --> 07:58.260
For example, our president is the chair of OB-GYN at UCSD

07:58.260 --> 08:00.840
and she's working on an editorial.

08:00.840 --> 08:02.580
You would not think San Diego

08:02.580 --> 08:04.590
would be a maternity care desert,

08:04.590 --> 08:06.660
but it's becoming one.

08:06.660 --> 08:09.480
UCSD has doubled,

08:09.480 --> 08:11.940
they've gone up 100% in the number of deliveries

08:11.940 --> 08:13.590
in the last four years

08:13.590 --> 08:16.890
because more than close to a dozen labor and delivery units

08:16.890 --> 08:19.860
in their county or surrounding counties have closed.

08:19.860 --> 08:21.300
<v ->Oh, you're right, that is surprising.</v>

08:21.300 --> 08:22.860
Wouldn't have thought that, for sure.

08:22.860 --> 08:24.330
So it sounds like challenges

08:24.330 --> 08:27.330
that you're hearing about are mostly around access to care,

08:27.330 --> 08:30.660
of complications and risks with the population,

08:30.660 --> 08:32.340
and then also workforce.

08:32.340 --> 08:36.090
And that's specific to the OB perspective.

08:36.090 --> 08:37.020
Let's hear from Sheena.

08:37.020 --> 08:38.640
It sounds like you're working on a broader set

08:38.640 --> 08:41.640
of women's health issues, starting with skin,

08:41.640 --> 08:42.990
to all the underlying conditions.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.930
So, what gap are you solving in your company

08:45.930 --> 08:48.090
and what other gaps remain that you see?

08:48.090 --> 08:48.960
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

08:48.960 --> 08:50.550
So we're sitting in this space

08:50.550 --> 08:54.570
of knowing that women's health is drastically underfunded,

08:54.570 --> 08:58.770
and so there exists health data gaps,

08:58.770 --> 09:00.570
as well as healthcare gaps.

09:00.570 --> 09:03.775
So what we're trying to do is to close that,

09:03.775 --> 09:06.123
to bridge that, right?

09:07.650 --> 09:11.370
So, for example, only 4% of federal funding

09:11.370 --> 09:15.630
goes to understanding women's health across the board.

09:15.630 --> 09:18.720
Also, recently, about a year and a half ago,

09:18.720 --> 09:22.290
McKinsey released a report on how to close these data gaps

09:22.290 --> 09:25.110
because not only do we have a dearth of data,

09:25.110 --> 09:26.610
the data that we do have

09:26.610 --> 09:30.003
is not actually what I would say good-quality data.

09:30.003 --> 09:33.810
It's not responsible in terms of how it's collected,

09:33.810 --> 09:35.550
but there's also biases

09:35.550 --> 09:38.160
that exist in the data regarding women.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.110
So, that's where we sit.

09:40.110 --> 09:41.970
So we know it's a huge problem,

09:41.970 --> 09:45.660
so we're trying to work with individuals like societies,

09:45.660 --> 09:49.950
other FinTech companies to help close all those gaps.

09:49.950 --> 09:52.620
<v ->Absolutely, data is certainly a big problem.</v>

09:52.620 --> 09:54.660
And thank you for mentioning the McKinsey article.

09:54.660 --> 09:57.383
I'm very proud of my former team in my prior life.

09:57.383 --> 09:58.680
(Alice chuckling)

09:58.680 --> 09:59.760
I do wanna drill down a little bit

09:59.760 --> 10:01.170
'cause data can mean different things.

10:01.170 --> 10:03.810
So there's data around disease burden,

10:03.810 --> 10:06.870
data around investment, or just health data.

10:06.870 --> 10:09.150
So can you give a little bit more color

10:09.150 --> 10:12.492
to what types of data you're looking at in your company,

10:12.492 --> 10:14.040
what data you're referring to?

10:14.040 --> 10:16.770
<v ->Yeah, so we deal a lot with health data.</v>

10:16.770 --> 10:21.720
So our initial health areas are menopause,

10:21.720 --> 10:25.500
cardiovascular disease, and brain health,

10:25.500 --> 10:28.710
particularly Alzheimer's, how they're all interconnected.

10:28.710 --> 10:30.840
So it's the health data, we collect that.

10:30.840 --> 10:33.870
And then not only do we provide women

10:33.870 --> 10:36.600
with insights about their own health,

10:36.600 --> 10:40.920
we provide them insights of how we use that collectively

10:40.920 --> 10:43.410
to help solve a health burden

10:43.410 --> 10:45.510
for other women like themselves.

10:45.510 --> 10:46.343
<v ->That's great.</v>

10:46.343 --> 10:48.030
So, women are both getting care themselves

10:48.030 --> 10:49.770
and contributing to research.

10:49.770 --> 10:50.970
That's wonderful.
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

10:50.970 --> 10:55.140
<v ->Great, so we have a number of gaps to solve:</v>

10:55.140 --> 10:59.190
data, access, workforce, complications.

10:59.190 --> 11:01.350
And this is a tech conference with innovators,

11:01.350 --> 11:02.910
of both startup innovators,

11:02.910 --> 11:04.383
as well as large tech companies

11:04.383 --> 11:06.360
and the innovators within those.

11:06.360 --> 11:09.240
So let's talk about solutions and innovation.

11:09.240 --> 11:10.980
I'll start with Christina first.

11:10.980 --> 11:15.000
What type of innovations are your members engaging with?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.590
Do you find them open to it,

11:16.590 --> 11:20.130
and what are solutions that either they or you think

11:20.130 --> 11:22.680
could really solve some of the issues you're talking about?

11:22.680 --> 11:23.617
<v ->Yeah, thank you.</v>

11:23.617 --> 11:26.703
I think the tide is changing a bit in a good way.

11:28.530 --> 11:31.620
In the past, a lot of kind of negative perceptions

11:31.620 --> 11:34.170
were often existed between clinicians

11:34.170 --> 11:37.470
partnering with industry as conflicts of interests,

11:37.470 --> 11:40.080
and we do have to deal with that.

11:40.080 --> 11:43.286
We've got clinicians writing clinical practice guidelines,

11:43.286 --> 11:45.780
and so their relationships are looked at,

11:45.780 --> 11:48.930
but there is a lot more receptivity

11:48.930 --> 11:51.150
in the women's health fields, I believe,

11:51.150 --> 11:54.480
to recognize that that partnership is critically important

11:54.480 --> 11:57.690
and is the only way that we're going to advance solutions

11:57.690 --> 12:00.690
in getting those working on technologies

12:00.690 --> 12:02.430
and innovations connected

12:02.430 --> 12:04.560
with the clinicians who are on the ground firsthand

12:04.560 --> 12:05.970
and understanding the challenges

12:05.970 --> 12:08.970
and where the solutions are needed.

12:08.970 --> 12:11.340
And I'd also like to comment on the research piece.

12:11.340 --> 12:12.960
I'm very optimistic also there

12:12.960 --> 12:15.960
because I'm seeing some mild improvements.

12:15.960 --> 12:19.110
It's not happening fast enough, of course,

12:19.110 --> 12:22.890
but we don't have a centralized institute within NIH

12:22.890 --> 12:23.910
for women's health, right?

12:23.910 --> 12:28.080
It's decentralized, so that presents challenges.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.323
But I think if we can focus

12:29.323 --> 12:31.830
on promoting the clinician scientists

12:31.830 --> 12:33.150
that are doing the work

12:33.150 --> 12:37.076
and try to break down the barriers that they have,

12:37.076 --> 12:39.690
it's unfortunately, they're kind of a dying breed,

12:39.690 --> 12:42.210
but hopefully we can continue to support them

12:42.210 --> 12:45.270
so that clinician scientists continue to thrive

12:45.270 --> 12:48.220
and work with the innovators in the technology space

12:49.755 --> 12:52.680
to do more research and bring more solutions to the table.

12:52.680 --> 12:53.580
<v ->That's great.</v>

12:53.580 --> 12:54.795
I'd love to actually dive in a little bit more

12:54.795 --> 12:56.070
on these partnerships you mentioned

12:56.070 --> 12:58.168
between clinicians and I guess...

12:58.168 --> 12:59.001
And two levels.

12:59.001 --> 13:01.530
One is what type of groups you see them partnering with.

13:01.530 --> 13:03.930
Are they startups, are they large companies?

13:03.930 --> 13:06.150
And do you have any examples of solutions

13:06.150 --> 13:07.650
that do address some of the challenges

13:07.650 --> 13:08.760
that you mentioned earlier

13:08.760 --> 13:11.340
around access workforce, et cetera?

13:11.340 --> 13:13.290
<v ->Yeah, I mean I think one of the solutions</v>

13:13.290 --> 13:17.220
that's totally low tech but is mentorship.

13:17.220 --> 13:19.770
And there's a lot of programs emerging

13:19.770 --> 13:22.620
outside of the traditional academic or career pathways

13:22.620 --> 13:25.470
in which people are getting paired up with mentors,

13:25.470 --> 13:28.710
clinician mentors with the innovators.

13:28.710 --> 13:30.510
One quick example.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.970
I know of an undergraduate group

13:32.970 --> 13:34.218
at Johns Hopkins University.

13:34.218 --> 13:36.390
They're biomedical engineers,

13:36.390 --> 13:39.000
and they're working on a fetal port delivery system,

13:39.000 --> 13:42.090
and they're taking catheters in the cardiology space

13:42.090 --> 13:46.380
and adopting them for port access for fetal surgery.

13:46.380 --> 13:48.210
And how would you ever think

13:48.210 --> 13:50.700
that a group of undergraduates would come up with that?

13:50.700 --> 13:52.290
But it's because of the mentorship,

13:52.290 --> 13:54.810
and they were exposed and able to observe

13:54.810 --> 13:56.100
some fetal surgeons

13:56.100 --> 13:58.680
and maternal fetal medicine specialists at Johns Hopkins.

13:58.680 --> 14:02.190
So where we can multiply that

14:02.190 --> 14:05.130
and get people connected, I think, will help.

14:05.130 --> 14:07.320
There's the MedTech Innovator,

14:07.320 --> 14:09.030
which I've been a part of in judging,

14:09.030 --> 14:10.230
and programs like that

14:10.230 --> 14:12.268
that are helping connect that expertise

14:12.268 --> 14:17.160
and mentorship with young investigators and innovators.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.500
<v ->Absolutely, and speaking as someone downstream</v>

14:19.500 --> 14:20.910
from the academic innovations,

14:20.910 --> 14:22.560
it's really great to see those partnerships

14:22.560 --> 14:23.970
and the innovations arise.

14:23.970 --> 14:27.060
So our portfolio is actually about 1/3 in maternal health.

14:27.060 --> 14:28.800
So we see a lot of-
<v Christina>Thank you.</v>

14:28.800 --> 14:29.790
<v ->Different innovations here,</v>

14:29.790 --> 14:32.220
such as remote monitoring for pregnancy,

14:32.220 --> 14:36.240
new ways of detecting fetal distress during delivery,

14:36.240 --> 14:38.850
and partnerships with clinicians to test those

14:38.850 --> 14:39.683
are really important,

14:39.683 --> 14:40.516
as well as the researchers.

14:40.516 --> 14:41.790
So great to hear-
<v ->That's amazing. Thank you.</v>

14:41.790 --> 14:43.710
<v ->Your members are participating.</v>

14:43.710 --> 14:45.210
And Sheena, let's turn to you.

14:46.470 --> 14:49.050
What do you see as potential tech solutions,

14:49.050 --> 14:51.990
both within your company and elsewhere

14:51.990 --> 14:54.690
that address the data gaps that you are discussing?

14:54.690 --> 14:55.590
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

14:55.590 --> 14:58.833
But to piggyback off of the previous comments,

14:59.820 --> 15:03.030
I would really like to see more partnerships,

15:03.030 --> 15:04.440
I'll use that word loosely,

15:04.440 --> 15:08.490
but having chief medical officers of your startup.

15:08.490 --> 15:11.640
I think that's paramount, right, from the very beginning,

15:11.640 --> 15:14.403
not after the first release, right?

15:15.480 --> 15:20.480
But we see a lot of technology improving access care data

15:20.990 --> 15:25.560
in one little hub through telemedicine platforms,

15:25.560 --> 15:26.790
through wearables.

15:26.790 --> 15:29.430
I think that's a really great opportunity,

15:29.430 --> 15:33.780
and I would envision more of the health and wellness

15:33.780 --> 15:37.440
and fitness trackers like the Pelotons,

15:37.440 --> 15:39.180
and Whoops, and things like that.

15:39.180 --> 15:41.820
We're gonna see more of them focusing on women's health

15:41.820 --> 15:42.780
and then partnering

15:42.780 --> 15:45.300
with other FinTech companies and societies

15:45.300 --> 15:47.190
to make sure that we're...

15:47.190 --> 15:48.900
privacy concerns are met,

15:48.900 --> 15:51.840
but also we're able to push further with innovation

15:51.840 --> 15:54.690
to solve a lot of the health challenges that we have.

15:54.690 --> 15:55.523
<v ->That's fascinating.</v>

15:55.523 --> 15:56.356
Have you incorporated

15:56.356 --> 16:00.060
any of these wellness type of solutions into your work?

16:00.060 --> 16:01.260
<v ->No, but I would like to,</v>

16:01.260 --> 16:04.380
so if there's anyone in the audience who wants a partner,

16:04.380 --> 16:07.110
but we do a lot of advocacy and education

16:07.110 --> 16:10.920
on our platform and as a company as a whole.

16:10.920 --> 16:12.240
<v ->I think what's also really interesting</v>

16:12.240 --> 16:14.954
is the blurring the lines between what is clinical

16:14.954 --> 16:16.891
versus what is wellness.

16:16.891 --> 16:18.510
If you have a diagnostic

16:18.510 --> 16:22.260
that tests your hormones daily at home, for example,

16:22.260 --> 16:25.620
plug for one of our companies, LA Health, which is here,

16:25.620 --> 16:29.220
is that considered clinical, is that considered wellness?

16:29.220 --> 16:30.630
I do think that there's a blurring the lines

16:30.630 --> 16:32.408
and when we think about health data,

16:32.408 --> 16:33.930
that's all part of your data,

16:33.930 --> 16:36.420
even if it's collected by yourself at home.

16:36.420 --> 16:38.190
<v Sheena>Exactly.</v>
<v ->Yep. Great.</v>

16:38.190 --> 16:42.120
<v ->Yeah, I heard the session prior to this, and it just...</v>

16:42.120 --> 16:43.050
It rang so true.

16:43.050 --> 16:45.180
I think the technology and innovation is there

16:45.180 --> 16:46.620
in so many places.

16:46.620 --> 16:49.440
We talk about some of these healthcare deserts

16:49.440 --> 16:51.840
and that are now being challenged

16:51.840 --> 16:54.000
even by things like climate.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.320
I was supposed to be here on Monday

16:55.320 --> 16:57.570
and had my flight rebooked twice from D.C.

16:57.570 --> 16:59.280
because of storms and, right?

16:59.280 --> 17:02.340
So the access is getting harder and harder,

17:02.340 --> 17:04.800
but things like remote wearables, and technology,

17:04.800 --> 17:05.940
and sensor technology,

17:05.940 --> 17:08.130
where you can be monitoring a patient

17:08.130 --> 17:10.830
and just identify a trigger to then...

17:10.830 --> 17:13.110
And hopefully cut down on the travel

17:13.110 --> 17:14.700
and need for monitoring type thing.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.010
So, it was just exciting to kind of see...

17:17.010 --> 17:20.580
I thought the session before was well-timed with this one.

17:20.580 --> 17:22.980
<v >Definitely.</v>
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

17:22.980 --> 17:24.300
Wonderful, but there's a lot more

17:24.300 --> 17:26.310
we can uncover there as well.

17:26.310 --> 17:28.020
We'll love to turn to some other pastures.

17:28.020 --> 17:30.193
So we are in a new year.

17:30.193 --> 17:31.923
A new year, new beginnings.

17:33.846 --> 17:36.690
What is one thing you would either like to see this year

17:36.690 --> 17:40.683
or you do predict for women's health in 2025?

17:43.950 --> 17:45.243
<v ->Okay, I'll jump in and go.</v>

17:45.243 --> 17:47.370
So, I would say there's two.

17:47.370 --> 17:50.597
I think we're gonna see more women driving the change

17:50.597 --> 17:52.320
in women's healthcare.

17:52.320 --> 17:55.500
I think we're also gonna see a lot more

17:55.500 --> 17:57.840
what they call like citizen science projects,

17:57.840 --> 17:59.820
where companies are actually going out

17:59.820 --> 18:02.580
and asking women to participate,

18:02.580 --> 18:03.449
taking a different term

18:03.449 --> 18:06.270
than a typical clinical trial recruitment.

18:06.270 --> 18:07.670
I think that's gonna be one.

18:08.580 --> 18:11.190
And two, what I would like to see,

18:11.190 --> 18:12.690
and I know we will see,

18:12.690 --> 18:14.760
is that a lot of the technology

18:14.760 --> 18:17.430
will start to incorporate the needs

18:17.430 --> 18:19.320
and differences of women, right?

18:19.320 --> 18:21.420
The hormonal changes, you talked about.

18:21.420 --> 18:25.590
Fit, whether it is a cardiovascular vest,

18:25.590 --> 18:28.110
how is that actually gonna fit with women?

18:28.110 --> 18:31.320
We have our own different body structure there, right?

18:31.320 --> 18:33.390
So I think that's really...

18:33.390 --> 18:34.680
We're gonna see a lot of innovation

18:34.680 --> 18:36.390
that I'm looking forward to.

18:36.390 --> 18:37.710
<v ->That's great.</v>

18:37.710 --> 18:40.920
Yeah, I mean, to be candid, coming from Washington D.C.,

18:40.920 --> 18:44.310
there's some nervousness with the change in administration

18:44.310 --> 18:46.260
on what that will mean

18:46.260 --> 18:49.080
for some of our established health agencies.

18:49.080 --> 18:50.820
So we're a little bit of a wait-and-see,

18:50.820 --> 18:52.260
but I am, again,

18:52.260 --> 18:54.870
hopeful that through partnership and continued dialogue,

18:54.870 --> 18:58.440
a lot of the momentum that has been happening

18:58.440 --> 19:01.230
in the last several years will continue.

19:01.230 --> 19:03.750
And I also agree a little bit of a hope,

19:03.750 --> 19:06.540
but I think that we can do more

19:06.540 --> 19:09.480
to reduce the stigma of participating in research

19:09.480 --> 19:10.898
and get more resources

19:10.898 --> 19:14.400
to women's health research initiatives

19:14.400 --> 19:17.700
and support some of these startup companies

19:17.700 --> 19:20.520
and advance these solutions.

19:20.520 --> 19:22.260
<v ->Absolutely, in terms of women's health,</v>

19:22.260 --> 19:24.270
and US policy is such an interesting time

19:24.270 --> 19:26.400
where we had never seen an administration

19:26.400 --> 19:27.480
like the Biden Administration

19:27.480 --> 19:29.670
pay so much attention to the space.

19:29.670 --> 19:31.620
It's probably the first time we've ever heard a president

19:31.620 --> 19:33.851
say the word menopause out loud.

19:33.851 --> 19:34.740
(Alice chuckling)

19:34.740 --> 19:37.170
And there are some areas within women's health

19:37.170 --> 19:38.940
that are unfortunately politicized,

19:38.940 --> 19:42.090
but no one can argue that maternal fetal medicine

19:42.090 --> 19:43.440
isn't critical and important,

19:43.440 --> 19:45.180
and that preventing pregnancies,

19:45.180 --> 19:46.800
treating skin problems

19:46.800 --> 19:51.330
that are also underlying other health problems are critical,

19:51.330 --> 19:54.300
and really, it's not just about women's health,

19:54.300 --> 19:56.070
but the overall health of women

19:56.070 --> 19:59.250
beyond the reproductive issues as well.

19:59.250 --> 20:00.330
For sure.

20:00.330 --> 20:04.721
All right, let's turn to a couple of fun lightning topics.

20:04.721 --> 20:06.120
<v Christina>Okay.</v>
<v ->Can you share</v>

20:06.120 --> 20:09.690
with the audience your favorite shocking fact

20:09.690 --> 20:10.790
within women's health?

20:12.300 --> 20:13.680
<v ->Well, I shared one earlier,</v>

20:13.680 --> 20:16.500
but I had just again read that March of Dimes report.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.600
So it was frightening to hear

20:18.600 --> 20:23.490
or see the increasing number of maternity care deserts,

20:23.490 --> 20:25.590
mainly because for a lot of women,

20:25.590 --> 20:28.440
their OB-GYN is their primary care.

20:28.440 --> 20:30.870
So I'm just a little bit concerned

20:30.870 --> 20:33.630
that even though that report

20:33.630 --> 20:35.940
was focused on our current maternity healthcare deserts,

20:35.940 --> 20:37.770
it's gonna be extrapolated at impact

20:37.770 --> 20:41.280
across all of women's health at all ages.

20:41.280 --> 20:43.620
So, it's a little alarming and it's growing.

20:43.620 --> 20:45.840
It sounds like even though that was data

20:45.840 --> 20:47.100
that's two years old,

20:47.100 --> 20:48.510
anecdotally, what we're hearing

20:48.510 --> 20:50.730
is that it could be significantly higher

20:50.730 --> 20:52.430
when next year's report comes out.

20:53.790 --> 20:56.940
<v ->Do you have any ideas on what we might do?</v>

20:56.940 --> 20:58.653
What technology to mitigate that?

20:59.700 --> 21:03.750
<v ->Well, I think, again, it's multifactorial, right?</v>

21:03.750 --> 21:07.440
I think it's hard to pinpoint just one thing,

21:07.440 --> 21:09.360
but in support for...

21:09.360 --> 21:12.794
The rising cost may not be something that's so easy

21:12.794 --> 21:15.030
to tackle right away.

21:15.030 --> 21:17.550
But again, I think trying to support the workforce,

21:17.550 --> 21:21.150
encouraging people to go into medicine,

21:21.150 --> 21:22.740
finding them the right mentors,

21:22.740 --> 21:25.556
people that look like them come from similar backgrounds.

21:25.556 --> 21:26.947
I think the workforce

21:26.947 --> 21:30.120
is something that we could potentially work on

21:30.120 --> 21:32.460
and help support.

21:32.460 --> 21:34.890
Things like certified midwives programs,

21:34.890 --> 21:39.890
trying to get more providers access to training

21:39.930 --> 21:42.150
and knowledge that they can,

21:42.150 --> 21:44.010
because they're being forced to see patients

21:44.010 --> 21:46.740
across multiple things that may not have been the area

21:46.740 --> 21:48.333
of their specialty originally.

21:50.010 --> 21:51.660
<v ->So I'm gonna cheat a little bit</v>

21:53.400 --> 21:55.830
to refer back to one that I just shared

21:55.830 --> 22:00.180
is that a lot of the technology or even the old technology

22:00.180 --> 22:03.060
wasn't actually made for women's bodies.

22:03.060 --> 22:04.080
So-
<v ->Can you give us an example?</v>

22:04.080 --> 22:05.163
Let's dive deep.

22:06.420 --> 22:08.340
<v ->So I don't wanna call anyone out in particular,</v>

22:08.340 --> 22:10.860
but the number one killer of women

22:10.860 --> 22:12.540
is cardiovascular disease.

22:12.540 --> 22:14.790
So when we go in to have all these tests

22:14.790 --> 22:16.710
and we're putting things on our bodies,

22:16.710 --> 22:18.840
they're actually not fit for our bodies.

22:18.840 --> 22:20.970
Whether our bodies are too small,

22:20.970 --> 22:23.040
for some women, they may have more chest area.

22:23.040 --> 22:27.210
So all the data that's being gathered like in the office

22:27.210 --> 22:28.740
may be inaccurate.

22:28.740 --> 22:31.440
So, like, that's shocking to me.

22:31.440 --> 22:32.760
<v ->Absolutely, and on that note,</v>

22:32.760 --> 22:34.282
when I was in medical school,

22:34.282 --> 22:37.800
all drawings that I saw in the anatomy textbooks

22:37.800 --> 22:38.633
were male bodies,

22:38.633 --> 22:40.680
except for reproductive organs.

22:40.680 --> 22:41.760
And that never occurred to me

22:41.760 --> 22:45.330
that medicine has that male bias until decades later.

22:45.330 --> 22:47.520
And also women's heart attacks

22:47.520 --> 22:49.830
are called atypical heart attacks,

22:49.830 --> 22:53.220
which implies that because it's a different etiology,

22:53.220 --> 22:54.053
different type of heart attack,

22:54.053 --> 22:56.310
implies that what women experience is atypical.

22:56.310 --> 23:00.030
So then when doctors are seeing a patient with symptoms,

23:00.030 --> 23:01.170
they're not thinking of that type

23:01.170 --> 23:03.810
because it's not the mainstream heart attack,

23:03.810 --> 23:05.640
which is a whole other story.

23:05.640 --> 23:07.055
I absolutely agree there.

23:07.055 --> 23:09.960
All right, let's do a couple more.

23:09.960 --> 23:13.530
We have, again, a room full of folks in tech,

23:13.530 --> 23:16.320
some innovators, different-sized companies.

23:16.320 --> 23:17.670
What is one takeaway

23:17.670 --> 23:20.940
or one thing you'd like folks in the audience to do

23:20.940 --> 23:21.960
based on what we just heard?

23:21.960 --> 23:23.100
We have lots of problems to solve:

23:23.100 --> 23:26.013
access, workforce, health.

23:26.880 --> 23:28.023
Any takeaways?

23:28.980 --> 23:32.013
<v ->Yeah, I mean, I think just to encourage the partnership,</v>

23:33.210 --> 23:34.170
a lot of people in the room

23:34.170 --> 23:37.560
may be from working with startups, or VCs,

23:37.560 --> 23:38.970
or whatever it might be,

23:38.970 --> 23:42.450
and encourage the dialogue and communication.

23:42.450 --> 23:44.280
I think there's a lot that we can be doing together

23:44.280 --> 23:46.470
that we don't necessarily even realize

23:46.470 --> 23:47.940
until the conversations are started.

23:47.940 --> 23:50.160
So, just encourage everybody

23:50.160 --> 23:51.990
to seek out partnership and dialogue

23:51.990 --> 23:55.650
with the clinician community

23:55.650 --> 23:57.390
so that we can together kind of help advance

23:57.390 --> 23:59.820
what you're trying to accomplish.

23:59.820 --> 24:01.380
<v ->Yeah, so for women's health,</v>

24:01.380 --> 24:04.890
I would encourage people to bring experts on your team

24:04.890 --> 24:07.140
who focus on women's health.

24:07.140 --> 24:09.720
Next, don't just make women's health an initiative.

24:09.720 --> 24:13.620
Create so it's a real standalone program.

24:13.620 --> 24:16.230
And then not be afraid to educate

24:16.230 --> 24:19.440
and communicate with your patients and consumers

24:19.440 --> 24:22.020
who are using your products and services.

24:22.020 --> 24:22.853
<v ->Thank you.</v>

24:22.853 --> 24:24.360
All right, let's do a fun one.

24:24.360 --> 24:27.960
Can you give a recommendation for a podcast,

24:27.960 --> 24:31.533
TV show, movie, or book, your favorite medium?

24:32.670 --> 24:35.250
<v ->So mine right now is the "Landman,"</v>

24:35.250 --> 24:37.800
I don't know if anybody watches that.

24:37.800 --> 24:40.710
It's on Amazon Paramount+.

24:40.710 --> 24:43.950
So it's about the individuals

24:43.950 --> 24:46.710
who work the oil fields down in South Texas.

24:46.710 --> 24:50.940
So they don't focus on like the policy business,

24:50.940 --> 24:55.710
they're focused on the people who actually work on the oil

24:55.710 --> 24:58.740
and then also how they have to deal with the cartel.

24:58.740 --> 25:00.390
So, I recommend everyone watch it.

25:00.390 --> 25:01.620
It's awesome.

25:01.620 --> 25:05.100
And it stars Billy Bob Thornton, so you gotta watch it.

25:05.100 --> 25:05.933
<v ->And real quick,</v>

25:05.933 --> 25:07.770
mine is kind of one that's been around for a while,

25:07.770 --> 25:10.620
but Guy Raz, "How I Built This."

25:10.620 --> 25:13.140
He interviews CEOs, and talks about their journeys,

25:13.140 --> 25:15.060
and how they built companies and stuff.

25:15.060 --> 25:16.740
And he's just a creative

25:16.740 --> 25:20.190
and very kind of energizing podcast, so...

25:20.190 --> 25:21.720
<v ->Wonderful, well, thank you to our panelists</v>

25:21.720 --> 25:22.920
for this great discussion,

25:22.920 --> 25:25.590
and come find us after if you wanna discuss more.

25:25.590 --> 25:26.756
<v ->Thank you.</v>
<v ->Thank you, thank you.</v>

25:26.756 --> 25:28.793
(audience applauding)

25:28.793 --> 25:31.460
(upbeat music)
