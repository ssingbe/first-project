1
00:00.111 --> 00:02.778
(rousing music)

2
00:10.587 --> 00:13.020
<v ->Who has on day one?</v>

3
00:13.020 --> 00:15.870
Who's day one today? Anybody?

4
00:15.870 --> 00:17.163
Day one people? Day two?

5
00:18.510 --> 00:19.770
Day one, day one, okay.

6
00:19.770 --> 00:20.770
Yeah, yeah. Day two?

7
00:21.780 --> 00:23.343
Got a few. Any day threes?

8
00:24.240 --> 00:26.193
Yeah, there we go. Day fours?

9
00:27.510 --> 00:29.760
Wow. Right on. Day five?

10
00:29.760 --> 00:31.500
Any other media? Yep. Yep.

11
00:31.500 --> 00:34.320
I started on Sunday at one o'clock.

12
00:34.320 --> 00:38.790
Yeah, great to see you all. Absolutely.

13
00:38.790 --> 00:41.160
Yeah, day five for me.

14
00:41.160 --> 00:43.380
Very glad to see y'all.

15
00:43.380 --> 00:47.160
I've been planning out how to stay awake and energized

16
00:47.160 --> 00:50.100
through Thursday and Friday since December 1st.

17
00:50.100 --> 00:51.840
Very good to see y'all.

18
00:51.840 --> 00:54.600
We've got about 14 hours of recording in on my channel.

19
00:54.600 --> 00:58.650
I'm Dr. Doreen Galli, Chief of Research at TBW Advisors.

20
00:58.650 --> 01:00.990
That's Technical Business Whispers.

21
01:00.990 --> 01:03.630
The answer is always in the whispers.

22
01:03.630 --> 01:08.160
And we've been working on our conference whispers, CES 2025,

23
01:08.160 --> 01:09.783
and we can't wait to get it out.

24
01:10.797 --> 01:14.040
But in the meantime, I wanna ask you if you have a phone,

25
01:14.040 --> 01:17.340
'cause I want you to pick it up and first put it on mute,

26
01:17.340 --> 01:20.370
and second, do me a huge favor.

27
01:20.370 --> 01:23.580
Go to YouTube and please subscribe to my channel.

28
01:23.580 --> 01:27.450
Seriously, I'm like 34 away from getting paid for ads.

29
01:27.450 --> 01:28.590
So do me a favor,

30
01:28.590 --> 01:31.230
and if anyone hits the 1,000th subscriber in the room,

31
01:31.230 --> 01:33.630
please scream so we can celebrate.

32
01:33.630 --> 01:36.600
I think we got enough people in here to make that happen.

33
01:36.600 --> 01:40.920
So TBW Advisors, Technical Business Whispers.

34
01:40.920 --> 01:44.040
I got over 14 hours complete plus releases,

35
01:44.040 --> 01:46.950
complete shows from Unveiled and so on,

36
01:46.950 --> 01:48.240
so really appreciate it.

37
01:48.240 --> 01:50.730
And if anyone is the 1,000th subscriber,

38
01:50.730 --> 01:52.983
please shout out loud so we can celebrate.

39
01:53.910 --> 01:55.443
So a little bit about me.

40
01:56.490 --> 02:01.200
I solve really, really tough problems.

41
02:01.200 --> 02:04.710
If it's a problem 14 people have failed before at it,

42
02:04.710 --> 02:05.823
I raise my hand.

43
02:06.660 --> 02:09.480
If it's something that they consider impossible

44
02:09.480 --> 02:10.740
and it's been difficult,

45
02:10.740 --> 02:13.440
but it has to get done for the business,

46
02:13.440 --> 02:15.720
that's when they called Doreen.

47
02:15.720 --> 02:19.410
So outside of getting most of the.com on,

48
02:19.410 --> 02:21.393
the companies during the .com era,

49
02:22.230 --> 02:24.960
I digitally transformed Dell Manufacturing

50
02:24.960 --> 02:28.860
and about 1,100 other companies since then as an analyst.

51
02:28.860 --> 02:31.440
I integrated eight acquisitions for Deutsche Post World Net,

52
02:31.440 --> 02:34.143
and was a Fortune 10 officer before the age of 40.

53
02:35.280 --> 02:37.830
Most recent problem I got called in to solve

54
02:37.830 --> 02:40.170
was on a sabbatical at Microsoft

55
02:40.170 --> 02:42.480
where I was designing the next generation of Azure,

56
02:42.480 --> 02:45.030
including installing a data boundary.

57
02:45.030 --> 02:46.860
For those of you not familiar,

58
02:46.860 --> 02:49.020
Azure used to have paired regions.

59
02:49.020 --> 02:51.060
That meant they explicitly were moving data

60
02:51.060 --> 02:53.493
from one region to another for resiliency,

61
02:55.080 --> 02:56.730
and they were also very transparent.

62
02:56.730 --> 02:58.350
So it wasn't just customer data,

63
02:58.350 --> 02:59.880
but all the log and metadata,

64
02:59.880 --> 03:00.960
and they told the whole world

65
03:00.960 --> 03:03.870
where all of those dittle related datas.

66
03:03.870 --> 03:05.010
And so, because of that,

67
03:05.010 --> 03:07.950
the architecture had to accommodate it all as well.

68
03:07.950 --> 03:09.600
Tons of fun.

69
03:09.600 --> 03:13.500
But today, we're here to talk about data collection,

70
03:13.500 --> 03:16.230
privacy, and why you should care.

71
03:16.230 --> 03:18.900
And lemme tell you, I have the most amazing panel,

72
03:18.900 --> 03:20.190
and they don't always agree.

73
03:20.190 --> 03:21.840
So we're gonna have a great session.

74
03:21.840 --> 03:23.790
So without further ado, I'll take my seat,

75
03:23.790 --> 03:27.060
and I would love my panelists to introduce themselves.

76
03:27.060 --> 03:27.893
<v ->Hi, everyone.</v>

77
03:27.893 --> 03:29.310
I'm Kate Barecchia.

78
03:29.310 --> 03:31.080
I'm Deputy General Counsel

79
03:31.080 --> 03:34.800
and Global Data Privacy Officer at Imperva.

80
03:34.800 --> 03:37.890
At Imperva, we focus on cybersecurity,

81
03:37.890 --> 03:40.350
and we're sort of invisibly in front

82
03:40.350 --> 03:44.130
of a lot of the websites and data that you use today.

83
03:44.130 --> 03:46.680
I'm really excited that all of you are here today.

84
03:46.680 --> 03:48.903
So thank you so much for joining us.

85
03:51.070 --> 03:54.840
I'm happy to have three certifications in data privacy

86
03:54.840 --> 03:59.070
from the International Association of Privacy Professionals,

87
03:59.070 --> 04:04.070
and I'm also a fellow of information privacy from the IAPP.

88
04:04.350 --> 04:06.180
My background is in engineering,

89
04:06.180 --> 04:11.130
and I find that that enables me to serve as a good bridge

90
04:11.130 --> 04:15.300
between sometimes the complicated regulatory schemes we have

91
04:15.300 --> 04:17.310
and the technical know-how that it takes

92
04:17.310 --> 04:19.620
to build products and solutions

93
04:19.620 --> 04:22.350
that comply with those regulations.

94
04:22.350 --> 04:26.340
Over the past few years, I've built two privacy programs

95
04:26.340 --> 04:28.920
for global compliance from scratch,

96
04:28.920 --> 04:31.200
and I'm really excited to share today

97
04:31.200 --> 04:33.630
some of the pain points and other things

98
04:33.630 --> 04:35.043
I've learned along the way.

99
04:36.810 --> 04:38.160
<v ->All right. Thank you very much, Doreen,</v>

100
04:38.160 --> 04:39.540
for bringing me onto this panel,

101
04:39.540 --> 04:41.040
and I'm very happy to be

102
04:41.040 --> 04:43.380
amongst these illustrious colleagues of mine.

103
04:43.380 --> 04:44.640
My name is Olaf Groth,

104
04:44.640 --> 04:46.920
I'm the CEO of Cambrian Futures,

105
04:46.920 --> 04:49.200
which is an analyst think tank,

106
04:49.200 --> 04:52.560
as it were, on the intersections of emerging tech,

107
04:52.560 --> 04:54.483
business strategy and policy.

108
04:55.530 --> 04:57.390
I also am the CEO of Cambrian Labs,

109
04:57.390 --> 05:00.040
which has invented the Bouncer Bot

110
05:01.470 --> 05:04.680
privacy inclusive data access agent.

111
05:04.680 --> 05:07.260
I'll be talking about that concept here today.

112
05:07.260 --> 05:09.060
And I'm a professional faculty member,

113
05:09.060 --> 05:10.170
a professor of practice,

114
05:10.170 --> 05:12.000
or professor of industry, as they say,

115
05:12.000 --> 05:14.790
at UC Berkeley School of Business, UT Malaysia,

116
05:14.790 --> 05:17.100
and Halt International Business School.

117
05:17.100 --> 05:18.300
Coming to this conversation

118
05:18.300 --> 05:21.660
after about 28 years in the private sector,

119
05:21.660 --> 05:24.210
mostly large technology companies.

120
05:24.210 --> 05:25.950
It's a pleasure to be here.

121
05:25.950 --> 05:27.180
<v ->Awesome.</v>

122
05:27.180 --> 05:28.830
Hi, folks. My name's Shannon Murphy.

123
05:28.830 --> 05:30.600
I'm a security and risk strategist

124
05:30.600 --> 05:33.540
at a very large cybersecurity platform vendor.

125
05:33.540 --> 05:35.550
It's called Trend Micro.

126
05:35.550 --> 05:38.897
And I spend most of my time with CIOs

127
05:38.897 --> 05:42.780
and CISOs in the Fortune 500, but also the mid-market,

128
05:42.780 --> 05:44.880
working on a couple different things.

129
05:44.880 --> 05:47.610
The first is managing

130
05:47.610 --> 05:50.670
these different infrastructure shifts and pressures

131
05:50.670 --> 05:52.470
that get put onto an organization

132
05:52.470 --> 05:55.560
when we're looking at things like the AI transformation

133
05:55.560 --> 05:57.360
or digital transformation.

134
05:57.360 --> 06:02.130
And then secondly, helping architect technology stacks

135
06:02.130 --> 06:06.570
that actually help put them one step ahead of the bad guys.

136
06:06.570 --> 06:09.810
Today, I'm gonna give a slightly different perspective

137
06:09.810 --> 06:11.640
on the panel, I think,

138
06:11.640 --> 06:14.610
kind of exposing more what's happening

139
06:14.610 --> 06:16.830
when it comes to illegitimate data collection.

140
06:16.830 --> 06:20.040
And in fact, there's a better word for that, it's theft.

141
06:20.040 --> 06:22.770
And how does that happen for individuals

142
06:22.770 --> 06:24.180
and also at the enterprise level.

143
06:24.180 --> 06:25.530
So thanks so much.

144
06:25.530 --> 06:26.363
<v ->Excellent.</v>

145
06:26.363 --> 06:27.660
I told you we had quite a panel, didn't I?

146
06:27.660 --> 06:28.950
Let's give them a hand.

147
06:28.950 --> 06:30.516
Woo! It's gonna be a great session.

148
06:30.516 --> 06:32.010
(audience applauding)

149
06:32.010 --> 06:32.843
Excellent.

150
06:32.843 --> 06:35.340
So we're ready to dive into the first topic,

151
06:35.340 --> 06:36.300
data collection,

152
06:36.300 --> 06:38.400
and we'll have Olaf and Shannon kick it off,

153
06:38.400 --> 06:39.360
and then Kate will come in

154
06:39.360 --> 06:41.070
as to why too much data is not good.

155
06:41.070 --> 06:43.200
So what are legitimate uses,

156
06:43.200 --> 06:45.540
what's being collected, and why?

157
06:45.540 --> 06:46.800
<v ->Well, look, let's all be honest.</v>

158
06:46.800 --> 06:48.450
We all enjoy the convenience

159
06:48.450 --> 06:51.417
and the services that the digital platforms are offering us,

160
06:51.417 --> 06:53.910
and in fact, offering us at cheaper price points

161
06:53.910 --> 06:56.250
that we could otherwise obtain.

162
06:56.250 --> 07:00.120
And so, using data on a website to make the website better,

163
07:00.120 --> 07:02.520
to let's say serve up better articles,

164
07:02.520 --> 07:04.440
or to contribute to public health,

165
07:04.440 --> 07:07.050
just think about the pandemic we just lived through,

166
07:07.050 --> 07:09.360
whatever your convictions are on vaccines,

167
07:09.360 --> 07:10.980
it's always good to have information

168
07:10.980 --> 07:13.830
on where the pandemic is flaring up,

169
07:13.830 --> 07:16.530
so you can make a choice about how to expose yourself.

170
07:16.530 --> 07:19.110
So certain amounts of data sharing,

171
07:19.110 --> 07:21.450
whether it's on a digital service provider website,

172
07:21.450 --> 07:23.910
on a news website, to make that website better,

173
07:23.910 --> 07:27.090
make it more focused on you and what you want and need

174
07:27.090 --> 07:28.353
are legitimate.

175
07:29.580 --> 07:31.380
But you have to start asking yourself,

176
07:31.380 --> 07:34.530
well, what kind of data is being collected?

177
07:34.530 --> 07:36.300
I can tell you that I had a student once

178
07:36.300 --> 07:38.520
who was being interviewed

179
07:38.520 --> 07:40.567
to work at a streaming music company and he said,

180
07:40.567 --> 07:43.380
"Professor, they did a data dump on me as a case study

181
07:43.380 --> 07:45.900
and said, 'Here's everything we know about

182
07:45.900 --> 07:48.333
one of our streaming music customers.

183
07:48.333 --> 07:49.860
Go make money with that,

184
07:49.860 --> 07:51.060
tell us how to make money with that.'"

185
07:51.060 --> 07:52.770
He said, "Professor, 80% of that data

186
07:52.770 --> 07:54.570
had nothing to do with music tastes."

187
07:54.570 --> 07:56.160
And so, you have to ask yourself

188
07:56.160 --> 07:59.220
what kind of data is actually being collected, why,

189
07:59.220 --> 08:01.020
and what happens to that data?

190
08:01.020 --> 08:03.120
Which gets us to the second point,

191
08:03.120 --> 08:05.550
which is, a lot of that data gets sold,

192
08:05.550 --> 08:07.560
and it gets sold to third parties

193
08:07.560 --> 08:09.480
and you have no idea that that is happening,

194
08:09.480 --> 08:12.030
and that is where the buck stops.

195
08:12.030 --> 08:14.670
We definitely need to make sure that we understand

196
08:14.670 --> 08:15.780
where's that data going,

197
08:15.780 --> 08:19.200
why are we not getting any say in where that data is going,

198
08:19.200 --> 08:21.210
and on what terms?

199
08:21.210 --> 08:24.090
What part of that data is actually really confidential

200
08:24.090 --> 08:26.610
and should be captured by privacy regulations,

201
08:26.610 --> 08:28.080
or by privacy solutions

202
08:28.080 --> 08:32.280
like our privacy-inclusive data access agent?

203
08:32.280 --> 08:34.740
And so, there's a whole industry out there

204
08:34.740 --> 08:39.740
that is collecting data on you, and that goes way beyond

205
08:40.350 --> 08:42.990
paying for the services on a website.

206
08:42.990 --> 08:43.823
<v ->For sure.</v>

207
08:43.823 --> 08:46.890
And I think ultimately what we all need to understand is,

208
08:46.890 --> 08:51.750
nobody's collecting data for free, for no reason.

209
08:51.750 --> 08:54.690
And it's kind of such an old phrase,

210
08:54.690 --> 08:58.320
but it's like, if you are getting something for free,

211
08:58.320 --> 09:00.063
then you're the product, right?

212
09:00.960 --> 09:03.210
And this is really something to think about

213
09:03.210 --> 09:05.970
when you are looking at, well, what kinds of data

214
09:05.970 --> 09:07.830
are being collected and why?

215
09:07.830 --> 09:09.900
Sometimes there are super legitimate uses

216
09:09.900 --> 09:12.510
and we can have better experiences

217
09:12.510 --> 09:14.940
because that data's being collected.

218
09:14.940 --> 09:18.270
If you do use something like an identity protection

219
09:18.270 --> 09:21.780
app on your phone, this will help flag

220
09:21.780 --> 09:24.540
what data is being collected by that website.

221
09:24.540 --> 09:27.180
So for example, sometimes it makes a ton of sense.

222
09:27.180 --> 09:29.610
If you're on Target or some kind of retail site,

223
09:29.610 --> 09:31.560
it'll flag, this website is known

224
09:31.560 --> 09:33.990
for collecting financial information,

225
09:33.990 --> 09:35.973
and you're kind of like, duh.

226
09:36.870 --> 09:41.870
But it would surprise you how often you go to a website,

227
09:42.090 --> 09:44.070
and if you are using an application like this

228
09:44.070 --> 09:45.300
where it will raise the flag

229
09:45.300 --> 09:49.290
that this is known for collecting health information,

230
09:49.290 --> 09:52.500
financial information, things that are unnecessary.

231
09:52.500 --> 09:57.500
News sites are known for doing this in particular as well.

232
09:57.960 --> 09:59.610
So these are the types of tools

233
09:59.610 --> 10:01.200
that I think can actually help you

234
10:01.200 --> 10:03.210
be a little bit more informed

235
10:03.210 --> 10:06.240
when you aren't necessarily going to the effort

236
10:06.240 --> 10:09.030
of reading through all of the policy,

237
10:09.030 --> 10:11.790
or if you want access to that thing

238
10:11.790 --> 10:15.150
so you're giving the data over for convenience.

239
10:15.150 --> 10:16.440
These types of tools can help

240
10:16.440 --> 10:18.300
be a little bit of a trip wire for you,

241
10:18.300 --> 10:20.880
so that you're part of that decision making process

242
10:20.880 --> 10:23.670
and it's not necessarily just happening.

243
10:23.670 --> 10:25.260
<v ->Great points.</v>

244
10:25.260 --> 10:28.683
And why is too much data not good, Kate?

245
10:30.180 --> 10:33.360
<v ->I think there are a few answers to that question.</v>

246
10:33.360 --> 10:34.560
But before we get there,

247
10:34.560 --> 10:37.410
I'd like to pivot back to something Shannon said,

248
10:37.410 --> 10:39.840
which is making a choice.

249
10:39.840 --> 10:42.900
So all of us in this room are consumers,

250
10:42.900 --> 10:44.640
but many of us in this room

251
10:44.640 --> 10:48.090
may also be the deciders for our businesses

252
10:48.090 --> 10:52.290
about what data our applications or websites are collecting.

253
10:52.290 --> 10:55.860
And I think an often overlooked point

254
10:55.860 --> 11:00.860
in the data conversation is how strong privacy practices

255
11:00.990 --> 11:04.920
can be a really good reputation builder for your brand.

256
11:04.920 --> 11:07.380
And I think it is important to distinguish

257
11:07.380 --> 11:09.450
between privacy and security,

258
11:09.450 --> 11:11.640
because sometimes those two concepts

259
11:11.640 --> 11:13.980
get conflated with each other.

260
11:13.980 --> 11:16.920
So a definition I heard many, many years ago

261
11:16.920 --> 11:21.920
as a baby lawyer was that privacy is the concept of deciding

262
11:22.710 --> 11:25.950
who are the appropriate people to have access to data.

263
11:25.950 --> 11:30.360
So if I write Olaf an email, he and I should have access.

264
11:30.360 --> 11:32.460
That's the privacy decision.

265
11:32.460 --> 11:35.430
Security is preventing anyone

266
11:35.430 --> 11:38.490
who has not been decided as the right audience

267
11:38.490 --> 11:40.200
from having access to that email.

268
11:40.200 --> 11:42.100
So, Shannon, stay out of our business.

269
11:44.070 --> 11:49.070
But so, in the market there are always competing interests,

270
11:50.010 --> 11:52.710
and I try to take a pragmatic approach

271
11:52.710 --> 11:56.733
because the business needs data to do business.

272
11:57.840 --> 12:00.180
But whenever a colleague,

273
12:00.180 --> 12:03.480
and most commonly this comes up in the marketing context

274
12:03.480 --> 12:04.620
more than anywhere else.

275
12:04.620 --> 12:05.557
Whenever a colleague says,

276
12:05.557 --> 12:08.580
"We wanna collect these five points of data," I say, okay,

277
12:08.580 --> 12:10.620
well let's talk about, number one,

278
12:10.620 --> 12:12.060
what's the business need for that?

279
12:12.060 --> 12:14.490
What is your actual documented business need?

280
12:14.490 --> 12:17.040
Because no one will ever get

281
12:17.040 --> 12:19.710
global privacy compliance perfect,

282
12:19.710 --> 12:21.690
but you want to build a defensible plan.

283
12:21.690 --> 12:22.830
So what's your story?

284
12:22.830 --> 12:25.050
Why did you collect this data?

285
12:25.050 --> 12:26.700
So we document that.

286
12:26.700 --> 12:29.070
And then the second big question I ask is,

287
12:29.070 --> 12:33.180
okay, if a consumer or your prospect or customer

288
12:33.180 --> 12:35.310
didn't realize you were collecting that

289
12:35.310 --> 12:37.110
and they found out you collected it,

290
12:37.110 --> 12:39.720
because it made the news or whatever,

291
12:39.720 --> 12:41.130
how does that look for you?

292
12:41.130 --> 12:42.780
Is that a good look for our brand?

293
12:42.780 --> 12:45.510
Does it end up hurting our business in the end?

294
12:45.510 --> 12:49.050
And if the answer is yes, let's have a conversation

295
12:49.050 --> 12:52.290
about is there an alternative, less invasive piece of data

296
12:52.290 --> 12:55.230
that we could use to meet the same business purpose?

297
12:55.230 --> 12:57.870
Is that really a business model we want to pursue?

298
12:57.870 --> 12:59.790
And if it is, let's just make sure everyone

299
12:59.790 --> 13:03.720
understands the risks and we buy in and that's where we are,

300
13:03.720 --> 13:06.450
and we're transparent with the consumers

301
13:06.450 --> 13:09.150
or our customers who may not be consumers,

302
13:09.150 --> 13:13.383
we may be in the middle, about what we're doing and why.

303
13:14.640 --> 13:16.410
<v ->If I may, I wanna come back to</v>

304
13:16.410 --> 13:17.970
two important things you just said.

305
13:17.970 --> 13:20.880
Number one, it's a matter of choice.

306
13:20.880 --> 13:23.220
I'll come back around to that, consumer choice,

307
13:23.220 --> 13:25.500
but also the choice of a corporate

308
13:25.500 --> 13:27.000
information security officer

309
13:27.000 --> 13:29.370
or a corporate chief digital officer

310
13:29.370 --> 13:34.020
in order to protect privacy and protect security as well.

311
13:34.020 --> 13:36.780
Because the two, and this is the second thing you said,

312
13:36.780 --> 13:38.070
are conflated, right?

313
13:38.070 --> 13:40.320
When you're going beyond the firewall,

314
13:40.320 --> 13:43.110
security is privacy, right?

315
13:43.110 --> 13:46.050
So take the example of three employees

316
13:46.050 --> 13:47.640
in any one of your companies.

317
13:47.640 --> 13:50.580
Let's say somebody who is in the legal department

318
13:50.580 --> 13:52.410
doing patent research, Maria.

319
13:52.410 --> 13:55.470
She's researching patent on a new product release.

320
13:55.470 --> 13:56.880
Then there is an engineer

321
13:56.880 --> 13:59.130
who is researching on stackoverflow.com,

322
13:59.130 --> 14:00.080
let's call him Joe,

323
14:00.960 --> 14:04.110
who is looking at existing fragments of code

324
14:04.110 --> 14:05.940
that could be used for the new product.

325
14:05.940 --> 14:07.530
And then there is, let's say Jane,

326
14:07.530 --> 14:10.770
who is helping the chief marketing officer

327
14:10.770 --> 14:13.020
research for the product release

328
14:13.020 --> 14:14.730
in about another week or two.

329
14:14.730 --> 14:18.060
When you conflate the three and you triangulate the three,

330
14:18.060 --> 14:19.230
you might actually find out

331
14:19.230 --> 14:21.130
what kind of product is being released

332
14:22.050 --> 14:23.760
next week or the week after

333
14:23.760 --> 14:26.100
without ever hacking beyond the firewall.

334
14:26.100 --> 14:29.113
Now, imagine you're doing that for 30 people, 300 people,

335
14:29.113 --> 14:32.100
3,000 people and so on and so forth in a corporation.

336
14:32.100 --> 14:35.400
Pretty soon, if competitive intelligence is your aim,

337
14:35.400 --> 14:37.920
you don't actually have to hack behind the firewall

338
14:37.920 --> 14:40.050
or deploy many manual analysts

339
14:40.050 --> 14:41.910
to track what you're seeing out there.

340
14:41.910 --> 14:44.070
You can actually do this within a split second.

341
14:44.070 --> 14:46.050
That is why security and privacy

342
14:46.050 --> 14:50.250
are actually conflated from a CISOs or a CDOs perspective.

343
14:50.250 --> 14:53.040
Why is that not being a big deal right now,

344
14:53.040 --> 14:54.570
or being made into a bigger deal?

345
14:54.570 --> 14:56.850
Is because CISOs are having a hard time

346
14:56.850 --> 14:58.200
justifying the expenditure,

347
14:58.200 --> 15:01.380
given all of the attacks that are coming at us

348
15:01.380 --> 15:03.630
and the perceived lack of protection.

349
15:03.630 --> 15:06.210
And so, they're not focusing beyond the firewall,

350
15:06.210 --> 15:09.480
even though that is the frontier of cybersecurity.

351
15:09.480 --> 15:11.673
It's coming, and you have to look at it.

352
15:12.540 --> 15:15.240
<v ->Great perspective, great perspective.</v>

353
15:15.240 --> 15:16.800
Before we head into privacy,

354
15:16.800 --> 15:18.870
I think we should ask y'all some questions.

355
15:18.870 --> 15:21.030
So how many in here have read

356
15:21.030 --> 15:23.370
the terms and conditions for a privacy notice?

357
15:23.370 --> 15:27.300
I think Apple just updated their iCloud terms today.

358
15:27.300 --> 15:28.140
Completely?

359
15:28.140 --> 15:29.160
A few. Okay.

360
15:29.160 --> 15:31.320
How many of you have had a private conversation

361
15:31.320 --> 15:33.300
and had an ad for something show up

362
15:33.300 --> 15:34.920
related to the private conversation?

363
15:34.920 --> 15:36.300
Yeah, we know that.

364
15:36.300 --> 15:38.940
And how many of you know somebody

365
15:38.940 --> 15:41.403
that have experienced identity theft?

366
15:43.470 --> 15:45.150
And how many of you have been notified

367
15:45.150 --> 15:48.840
that your data has been compromised by a business?

368
15:48.840 --> 15:50.607
Just bought every one of them.

369
15:50.607 --> 15:54.600
One out of three Americans did with AT&amp;T's breach alone.

370
15:54.600 --> 15:57.870
So yeah, we're in real bad shape, at least in this country.

371
15:57.870 --> 15:59.520
And how many of you feel you know

372
15:59.520 --> 16:02.223
how to manage your privacy settings?

373
16:05.550 --> 16:06.570
A few.

374
16:06.570 --> 16:08.040
<v ->I'll say no.</v>

375
16:08.040 --> 16:09.573
It's my area of expertise.

376
16:10.950 --> 16:12.030
<v ->Excellent.</v>

377
16:12.030 --> 16:13.593
So let's head into privacy.

378
16:15.300 --> 16:18.210
Kate, would you like to go into the different approaches

379
16:18.210 --> 16:20.130
from a regulatory perspective?

380
16:20.130 --> 16:20.963
<v ->Sure.</v>

381
16:20.963 --> 16:24.720
So for my benefit, it looks like we have a pretty good

382
16:24.720 --> 16:26.970
multinational audience here.

383
16:26.970 --> 16:31.830
So I always joke, I am obviously an American

384
16:31.830 --> 16:33.729
and I work in the US.

385
16:33.729 --> 16:36.720
We have a French owned parent company.

386
16:36.720 --> 16:41.670
But for many, many years I joked that I spent all my days

387
16:41.670 --> 16:43.593
enforcing privacy rights I don't have.

388
16:44.550 --> 16:47.010
I'm very fortunate to work at a place

389
16:47.010 --> 16:49.410
where we believe privacy is a fundamental human right.

390
16:49.410 --> 16:53.160
So at Imperva, we made the decision many years ago

391
16:53.160 --> 16:57.120
that even though it might cost more, we would apply GDPR,

392
16:57.120 --> 17:00.060
so Europe's General Data Protection Regulation,

393
17:00.060 --> 17:02.730
as a single global privacy standard.

394
17:02.730 --> 17:05.940
And in the end what that does

395
17:05.940 --> 17:10.050
is it gives our employees an even playing field,

396
17:10.050 --> 17:11.460
because they know every day

397
17:11.460 --> 17:12.630
what they have to do with the data.

398
17:12.630 --> 17:15.030
It doesn't matter if the person's data

399
17:15.030 --> 17:17.130
is from Latin America, if it's from Europe,

400
17:17.130 --> 17:19.140
if it's from Canada, it can be from anywhere.

401
17:19.140 --> 17:21.093
One standard, one size fits all.

402
17:22.080 --> 17:25.740
In Europe for a long time, even before GDPR,

403
17:25.740 --> 17:29.310
individuals had the right to request access to their data,

404
17:29.310 --> 17:30.753
correction, deletion.

405
17:31.890 --> 17:34.620
In Europe, marketing is still largely governed

406
17:34.620 --> 17:35.700
by national laws.

407
17:35.700 --> 17:38.280
So there's no one size fits all.

408
17:38.280 --> 17:41.400
But consent in most countries is required.

409
17:41.400 --> 17:43.395
There's still a small minority of countries

410
17:43.395 --> 17:47.910
where you can target based on job function for work.

411
17:47.910 --> 17:51.600
But the biggest difference I see, and this sort of relates

412
17:51.600 --> 17:54.750
to what Olaf was saying beyond the firewall,

413
17:54.750 --> 17:59.160
is the required disclosures around the use of cookies

414
17:59.160 --> 18:02.400
and other tracking technologies on websites.

415
18:02.400 --> 18:06.450
So last week, I was in Dublin on a family vacation

416
18:06.450 --> 18:08.463
and I was like, oh, this is great,

417
18:09.450 --> 18:11.040
I get all these rights again,

418
18:11.040 --> 18:15.030
and I'm mercilessly declining all the cookies.

419
18:15.030 --> 18:17.180
Like spend time to notice? Why, yes I will.

420
18:18.990 --> 18:22.530
But when I got back home, I lost all those rights again.

421
18:22.530 --> 18:24.780
So I reside in Pennsylvania.

422
18:24.780 --> 18:28.710
Many companies have really decided to narrowly tailor

423
18:28.710 --> 18:31.890
their consent notices based on IP address.

424
18:31.890 --> 18:34.650
There is a danger in that from pragmatic purposes

425
18:34.650 --> 18:36.120
for users on VPNs.

426
18:36.120 --> 18:38.010
You don't really know where I am.

427
18:38.010 --> 18:40.380
So in fact, if you take the risk-based approach

428
18:40.380 --> 18:43.320
of using an IP address, in the majority of time,

429
18:43.320 --> 18:46.260
you may actually be wrongly assorting the risk.

430
18:46.260 --> 18:50.160
So around the world, different governments

431
18:50.160 --> 18:52.320
have applied different privacy standards,

432
18:52.320 --> 18:56.460
and in fact, it's a little bit of a tool of trade war.

433
18:56.460 --> 18:59.880
So what you'll see is countries

434
18:59.880 --> 19:02.520
start tightening their privacy laws

435
19:02.520 --> 19:04.710
when they're really angry about something else,

436
19:04.710 --> 19:08.160
because privacy compliance is like a tax.

437
19:08.160 --> 19:10.140
So if you think about it that way,

438
19:10.140 --> 19:12.930
you wanna pay the right amount of tax, no more, no less.

439
19:12.930 --> 19:16.560
My analysis is that if you apply GDPR,

440
19:16.560 --> 19:18.480
you're paying the right amount of tax,

441
19:18.480 --> 19:21.060
'cause it fits every country in the world,

442
19:21.060 --> 19:24.180
but three with data localization requirements.

443
19:24.180 --> 19:27.660
So it's a pretty efficient model to use.

444
19:27.660 --> 19:28.950
In the United States,

445
19:28.950 --> 19:31.560
I think it'll be a state by state analysis

446
19:31.560 --> 19:33.570
for quite a while,

447
19:33.570 --> 19:36.480
and it'll probably remain industry focused.

448
19:36.480 --> 19:40.680
Canada is not, I don't anticipate them passing

449
19:40.680 --> 19:43.740
a Canadian uniform privacy law in the near future.

450
19:43.740 --> 19:46.350
It's been pending for a little while.

451
19:46.350 --> 19:50.223
So we'll continue to see that in the market, I think.

452
19:51.540 --> 19:52.560
<v ->Excellent.</v>

453
19:52.560 --> 19:54.990
Yeah, I agree, the GDPR approach globally.

454
19:54.990 --> 19:56.490
It's better to, once you find

455
19:56.490 --> 19:58.050
whatever the toughest standard is,

456
19:58.050 --> 20:00.150
you pick that standard enterprise wide.

457
20:00.150 --> 20:02.763
It's the easiest for your data engineers as well.

458
20:05.400 --> 20:06.233
Absolutely.

459
20:08.280 --> 20:10.565
<v ->I have to object on that one,</v>

460
20:10.565 --> 20:14.100
and we have to have a little fun tension here on the panel,

461
20:14.100 --> 20:16.830
because I do think that as much as,

462
20:16.830 --> 20:18.810
look, I was born and raised in Europe,

463
20:18.810 --> 20:20.460
I do appreciate European Union

464
20:20.460 --> 20:22.360
sort of putting a stake in the ground,

465
20:23.370 --> 20:25.230
because the other side of the Atlantic

466
20:25.230 --> 20:27.690
is obviously very laissez-faire about data,

467
20:27.690 --> 20:29.520
and I think we have seen some fallout

468
20:29.520 --> 20:31.020
and will see more fallout.

469
20:31.020 --> 20:33.060
But there is a middle ground between

470
20:33.060 --> 20:38.060
the extremely restrictive view that GPR promulgates,

471
20:38.220 --> 20:40.530
which frankly has hurt Europe tremendously

472
20:40.530 --> 20:42.210
in terms of data entrepreneurship

473
20:42.210 --> 20:45.390
and digital entrepreneurship, and the very laissez-faire

474
20:45.390 --> 20:48.990
individual-dignity-disrespecting US approach.

475
20:48.990 --> 20:52.560
And frankly, I think we need to look at the middle ground.

476
20:52.560 --> 20:55.140
If you just want to be a Che Guevara of data

477
20:55.140 --> 20:58.560
and say no more, no more, that's one way to go.

478
20:58.560 --> 21:01.350
That's the approach of the VPNs of this world,

479
21:01.350 --> 21:04.441
the ad blockers, the privacy browsers, et cetera.

480
21:04.441 --> 21:05.274
<v ->The Germans.</v>

481
21:05.274 --> 21:07.320
<v ->The Germans, right? Very bad.</v>

482
21:07.320 --> 21:08.643
And I will tell you,

483
21:09.540 --> 21:13.380
as a German immigrant to the United States,

484
21:13.380 --> 21:15.390
I have said this in public media in Germany,

485
21:15.390 --> 21:17.550
I think Germany is gonna die an analog death

486
21:17.550 --> 21:21.390
if it does not manage to have a more reasonable approach

487
21:21.390 --> 21:23.280
on privacy assured data use.

488
21:23.280 --> 21:25.530
And I do think that there's room for solutions,

489
21:25.530 --> 21:29.460
because privacy is not a one-size-fits-all kind of problem.

490
21:29.460 --> 21:30.750
I mean, if I were to ask you.

491
21:30.750 --> 21:31.860
Here, let me just ask you.

492
21:31.860 --> 21:34.530
Who here minds sharing their GPS footprint

493
21:34.530 --> 21:37.200
with data service providers?

494
21:37.200 --> 21:38.970
Who here has a problem with that?

495
21:38.970 --> 21:41.120
Who here does not have a problem with that?

496
21:43.310 --> 21:44.337
So the ones that have a problem with that

497
21:44.337 --> 21:45.630
are maybe in the majority,

498
21:45.630 --> 21:47.940
but there is a bunch of people in the room that don't mind.

499
21:47.940 --> 21:50.160
I don't mind. I have nothing to hide.

500
21:50.160 --> 21:51.270
But if I was a woman.

501
21:51.270 --> 21:53.070
<v ->It's not about having nothing to hide though.</v>

502
21:53.070 --> 21:55.702
<v ->Well, but see that's the thing.</v>

503
21:55.702 --> 21:59.250
But we should have data agency where we determine,

504
21:59.250 --> 22:02.580
we have a say in what kind of data we wanna give away.

505
22:02.580 --> 22:05.220
Now, every government has the right on a community level

506
22:05.220 --> 22:08.460
to determine, hey, what's a complete out of bound area?

507
22:08.460 --> 22:10.800
So the regulation is important.

508
22:10.800 --> 22:12.510
But for the government to say

509
22:12.510 --> 22:16.170
you must not share anything and nothing should be used

510
22:16.170 --> 22:19.140
shuts off the evolution of the digital economy.

511
22:19.140 --> 22:20.640
We have developed a solution,

512
22:20.640 --> 22:22.560
and other people have as well,

513
22:22.560 --> 22:25.830
that allows you to have an individual privacy charter

514
22:25.830 --> 22:27.990
that's nestled within the national law,

515
22:27.990 --> 22:30.690
or a corporate confidentiality charter,

516
22:30.690 --> 22:33.860
that will allow you to determine what types of data

517
22:33.860 --> 22:36.960
do I want completely to be off record,

518
22:36.960 --> 22:39.750
and then what types of data do I wanna give away

519
22:39.750 --> 22:42.150
because I recognize it's good for me and my services,

520
22:42.150 --> 22:44.103
and what kind of data do I wanna sell?

521
22:45.060 --> 22:48.330
So that then opens up all kinds of opportunity

522
22:48.330 --> 22:51.300
for data trading that is privacy assured

523
22:51.300 --> 22:53.130
and dignity assured.

524
22:53.130 --> 22:54.420
We want to give agency

525
22:54.420 --> 22:56.670
and not a heavy hand shutting everything.

526
22:56.670 --> 22:59.490
<v ->But from a system design, you need to have the system</v>

527
22:59.490 --> 23:01.410
able and ready to execute

528
23:01.410 --> 23:03.960
anything a government suddenly decides it's gonna do.

529
23:03.960 --> 23:04.800
<v ->That's true.</v>
<v ->And so,</v>

530
23:04.800 --> 23:06.180
from a design perspective,

531
23:06.180 --> 23:07.980
you design it with the capabilities,

532
23:07.980 --> 23:09.750
and then it can always do something different.

533
23:09.750 --> 23:11.100
But we found, for example,

534
23:11.100 --> 23:15.840
I mean, try having a data boundary when you're Qatar,

535
23:15.840 --> 23:18.420
or Qatar, however you want to enunciate it.

536
23:18.420 --> 23:20.460
But it's a small location.

537
23:20.460 --> 23:22.230
If there's a catastrophe,

538
23:22.230 --> 23:24.630
the whole location could be at risk

539
23:24.630 --> 23:26.040
for power and everything else.

540
23:26.040 --> 23:27.540
So how do you get resiliency?

541
23:27.540 --> 23:28.373
<v ->You also have to think of the fact--</v>

542
23:28.373 --> 23:30.750
<v ->They needed to find another government they trusted</v>

543
23:30.750 --> 23:32.760
and say, okay, not just my country,

544
23:32.760 --> 23:35.160
but this country's okay as well.

545
23:35.160 --> 23:38.220
So even with the data boundary, what we were seeing is,

546
23:38.220 --> 23:41.190
they were saying, "Well, we understand the resiliency issue.

547
23:41.190 --> 23:42.960
We'll say this country's okay."

548
23:42.960 --> 23:45.030
So they were actually changing the regulations

549
23:45.030 --> 23:47.100
to practicality as a point of information.

550
23:47.100 --> 23:49.980
<v ->I think a major concern for this as well is,</v>

551
23:49.980 --> 23:53.640
when you start opting into selling your data

552
23:53.640 --> 23:57.480
and that data is used in a future breach

553
23:57.480 --> 24:00.210
or to build a bigger story on your identity,

554
24:00.210 --> 24:04.620
is it now your fault because you participated in that sale?

555
24:04.620 --> 24:05.940
And I think that we start to get into

556
24:05.940 --> 24:07.560
really dicey territory.

557
24:07.560 --> 24:08.970
<v ->Absolutely, and I fully agree.</v>

558
24:08.970 --> 24:12.870
That's why we need a privacy-assured data market design.

559
24:12.870 --> 24:14.730
We don't have a transparent data market.

560
24:14.730 --> 24:18.180
It's all backroom dealing between cloaked entities,

561
24:18.180 --> 24:20.790
and that's primarily the big platforms,

562
24:20.790 --> 24:23.220
data brokers, advertising networks,

563
24:23.220 --> 24:25.740
all dealing with each other without any transparency.

564
24:25.740 --> 24:28.020
I have no idea where my data footprint is going.

565
24:28.020 --> 24:29.370
And you're absolutely right,

566
24:29.370 --> 24:31.590
somebody could be combining data from over here

567
24:31.590 --> 24:34.560
with something from over there and form an identity on me.

568
24:34.560 --> 24:35.393
<v ->They absolutely are.</v>

569
24:35.393 --> 24:37.680
<v ->Yeah, they absolutely already.</v>

570
24:37.680 --> 24:38.880
<v ->Probably incorrectly.</v>

571
24:38.880 --> 24:41.610
<v ->That's right, and that may be even worse.</v>

572
24:41.610 --> 24:42.490
But you should have that regulated.

573
24:42.490 --> 24:44.730
<v ->I'm a 65-year-old white, gay male,</v>

574
24:44.730 --> 24:47.880
according to my profile, based on the ads presented to me.

575
24:47.880 --> 24:48.810
<v ->That's right.</v>

576
24:48.810 --> 24:50.700
But you should have transparency around that.

577
24:50.700 --> 24:52.770
Why is that not a regulated market?

578
24:52.770 --> 24:54.390
Why are there no agents?

579
24:54.390 --> 24:56.310
Why is there no structure around that market?

580
24:56.310 --> 24:59.280
Why do we leave it to the big digital service providers

581
24:59.280 --> 25:02.220
to harness that data and just trade it at will?

582
25:02.220 --> 25:03.270
That's what's wrong.

583
25:03.270 --> 25:05.010
<v ->And we know legitimate uses.</v>

584
25:05.010 --> 25:07.860
In my coverage at FinTech Meetup,

585
25:07.860 --> 25:10.740
there was a case to where there's technology

586
25:10.740 --> 25:13.800
where they know if you're subject to fear of missing out,

587
25:13.800 --> 25:16.380
and if you are, they will always use it on you,

588
25:16.380 --> 25:19.170
because they wanna get every dime from every customer.

589
25:19.170 --> 25:21.330
The same with coupons or others.

590
25:21.330 --> 25:24.780
So they know what fears to push your buttons

591
25:24.780 --> 25:26.250
to get you to buy.

592
25:26.250 --> 25:29.460
But that's a legitimate use case in our society.

593
25:29.460 --> 25:31.440
I'd love Shannon to go into the roles

594
25:31.440 --> 25:32.640
of people, process, and tech

595
25:32.640 --> 25:35.070
for legitimate and illegitimate uses.

596
25:35.070 --> 25:39.330
<v ->Shannon, on that point, as Olaf was talking about</v>

597
25:39.330 --> 25:41.940
designing a platform for people,

598
25:41.940 --> 25:44.250
in engineering we learn you have to design

599
25:44.250 --> 25:47.760
for the worst user, not the best user.

600
25:47.760 --> 25:49.440
I don't know what your view is on that

601
25:49.440 --> 25:51.630
as we look at what gets stolen.

602
25:51.630 --> 25:52.680
<v ->Well, for sure.</v>

603
25:52.680 --> 25:54.900
And I mean, I'll talk about the types of data

604
25:54.900 --> 25:57.480
that gets stolen in a moment.

605
25:57.480 --> 25:59.940
When we're looking at what's the good news,

606
25:59.940 --> 26:03.810
or how can you protect yourself in these scenarios.

607
26:03.810 --> 26:05.730
I'm Canadian, but I know the Miranda rights,

608
26:05.730 --> 26:08.640
anything that you say can and will be used against you,

609
26:08.640 --> 26:10.920
and that's totally applicable to data as well.

610
26:10.920 --> 26:12.570
Any data that you provide,

611
26:12.570 --> 26:15.120
whether in a legitimate or illegitimate way,

612
26:15.120 --> 26:17.940
can and will be used either for your benefit

613
26:17.940 --> 26:21.870
for a better service, to sell to another entity,

614
26:21.870 --> 26:24.900
or in the case of data theft

615
26:24.900 --> 26:27.570
will be used against you for monetary gain,

616
26:27.570 --> 26:30.750
data destruction, reputation damage and the like.

617
26:30.750 --> 26:33.840
So I mean, what can people do today?

618
26:33.840 --> 26:36.750
I think as individuals particularly,

619
26:36.750 --> 26:39.870
and I'll talk about a concept called data actionability,

620
26:39.870 --> 26:40.800
I hope, in a little bit.

621
26:40.800 --> 26:43.230
But if you're using crypto, for example,

622
26:43.230 --> 26:44.640
you have crypto wallets,

623
26:44.640 --> 26:47.160
you wanna be looking at things like cold and hot storage,

624
26:47.160 --> 26:51.210
you wanna be using hardware wallets as well.

625
26:51.210 --> 26:54.420
If you're using services where you are paying for things,

626
26:54.420 --> 26:57.000
you wanna be using like your Apple Pay or your G Pay,

627
26:57.000 --> 26:59.340
so that you have a virtual card,

628
26:59.340 --> 27:01.860
and that's not exposing your actual

629
27:01.860 --> 27:05.700
credit card credentials or information.

630
27:05.700 --> 27:09.330
You can also do things like using different email addresses

631
27:09.330 --> 27:12.180
for different services as well.

632
27:12.180 --> 27:15.540
And then of course, it's really not the sexy stuff,

633
27:15.540 --> 27:19.230
but it is the same stuff you've been hearing forever.

634
27:19.230 --> 27:21.090
Great passwords, password manager,

635
27:21.090 --> 27:23.700
having multi-factor authentication

636
27:23.700 --> 27:25.140
on all of your services

637
27:25.140 --> 27:27.430
really is what will make the difference

638
27:28.340 --> 27:29.730
when you get breached,

639
27:29.730 --> 27:31.290
and of course, you probably already have.

640
27:31.290 --> 27:33.000
<v ->Authenticator in '25 too.</v>

641
27:33.000 --> 27:34.590
No text anymore.

642
27:34.590 --> 27:36.570
Text is not an acceptable MFA anymore.

643
27:36.570 --> 27:38.280
<v ->Well, oh yeah, no, for sure.</v>

644
27:38.280 --> 27:40.950
And when we are looking at multifactor authentication,

645
27:40.950 --> 27:42.240
you do wanna be looking at things

646
27:42.240 --> 27:44.910
like the number matching tools,

647
27:44.910 --> 27:47.040
because that's kind next generation.

648
27:47.040 --> 27:48.210
<v ->But ideally not through text,</v>

649
27:48.210 --> 27:49.290
according to the warnings from.

650
27:49.290 --> 27:51.060
<v ->No, no. You wanna be using authenticator</v>

651
27:51.060 --> 27:52.530
or different types of tools like that.

652
27:52.530 --> 27:54.960
Of course, you can talk about things like Fido,

653
27:54.960 --> 27:59.490
hardware tokens and pass keys for consumer technology,

654
27:59.490 --> 28:02.280
SaaS technology are really powerful in fact.

655
28:02.280 --> 28:05.670
But of course, these things are not always super practical.

656
28:05.670 --> 28:07.380
<v ->I mean, I have a question on that.</v>

657
28:07.380 --> 28:10.110
So sure, every technology has its weakness,

658
28:10.110 --> 28:14.970
but if I were counseling a client, I would've said,

659
28:14.970 --> 28:17.940
you definitely want MFA,

660
28:17.940 --> 28:19.830
and I would've said that text MFA

661
28:19.830 --> 28:21.200
was better than no MFA at all.

662
28:21.200 --> 28:22.277
<v ->100%.</v>

663
28:22.277 --> 28:23.790
<v ->Okay.</v>
<v ->100% yes.</v>

664
28:23.790 --> 28:26.460
<v ->'Cause for some of us, we may not have much choice.</v>

665
28:26.460 --> 28:29.190
<v ->The low hanging fruit for the adversary today</v>

666
28:29.190 --> 28:33.450
is people in enterprise that do not have MFA at all.

667
28:33.450 --> 28:34.950
And in fact, we see this a lot

668
28:34.950 --> 28:37.080
actually in a higher education.

669
28:37.080 --> 28:39.120
So a lot of colleges and universities don't have it.

670
28:39.120 --> 28:42.060
It's very expensive to deploy it at that scale,

671
28:42.060 --> 28:44.673
though they absolutely should make the investment,

672
28:45.630 --> 28:47.220
and for that reason,

673
28:47.220 --> 28:49.170
the first layer is people who don't have it at all.

674
28:49.170 --> 28:52.050
The next layer would be different levels of sophistication

675
28:52.050 --> 28:52.890
on that technology.

676
28:52.890 --> 28:53.970
<v ->But even in your personal life,</v>

677
28:53.970 --> 28:56.520
like my doctor, I have my portal,

678
28:56.520 --> 28:58.110
I can schedule an appointment,

679
28:58.110 --> 29:00.540
they encourage you to put MFA on there,

680
29:00.540 --> 29:03.360
but I assume many people don't make that choice.

681
29:03.360 --> 29:06.000
I'd encourage all of you, just a piece of free advice.

682
29:06.000 --> 29:06.833
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

683
29:06.833 --> 29:09.270
<v ->Put your MFA on, even if it's text.</v>

684
29:09.270 --> 29:11.790
<v ->I had some very serious conversations</v>

685
29:11.790 --> 29:16.790
and moved MFA enforceability from three to 400 on the backup

686
29:16.890 --> 29:19.650
to getting it done in a couple weeks when I was at Microsoft

687
29:19.650 --> 29:21.120
for the secure development environment.

688
29:21.120 --> 29:22.890
There's no way you could have that environment

689
29:22.890 --> 29:24.810
without MFA enforceability.

690
29:24.810 --> 29:26.100
So yeah, absolutely.

691
29:26.100 --> 29:27.780
I think the warnings on text came

692
29:27.780 --> 29:30.453
because there's a, it was in December.

693
29:31.864 --> 29:33.570
<v ->But that's a separate deal.</v>

694
29:33.570 --> 29:34.543
<v ->But something's always better than nothing.</v>

695
29:34.543 --> 29:36.810
<v ->And again, if a government's coming for you,</v>

696
29:36.810 --> 29:39.120
there's not much you are going to do as an individual

697
29:39.120 --> 29:40.530
to beat the government.

698
29:40.530 --> 29:41.639
They have an army.
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

699
29:41.639 --> 29:42.900
<v ->Legitimately.</v>

700
29:42.900 --> 29:44.820
Just do your best, friends.

701
29:44.820 --> 29:47.580
Long passwords, MFA, it's all you can do.

702
29:47.580 --> 29:50.400
<v ->And Olaf, you covered over your zero sum, correct?</v>

703
29:50.400 --> 29:51.990
<v ->Yeah, I think I did.</v>
<v ->Excellent.</v>

704
29:51.990 --> 29:56.073
So in that case, why should you care?

705
30:00.000 --> 30:02.460
Shannon, what is sold on the black market,

706
30:02.460 --> 30:03.870
and by who and how?

707
30:03.870 --> 30:07.950
<v ->Yeah, I mean, what's not sold on the black market?</v>

708
30:07.950 --> 30:11.490
So I mentioned this concept of data actionability.

709
30:11.490 --> 30:12.813
What that means is,

710
30:14.520 --> 30:17.760
can I derive immediate value from this piece of data?

711
30:17.760 --> 30:21.240
And I like to compare it to like a literal cash wallet.

712
30:21.240 --> 30:23.400
So if I stole your wallet from you,

713
30:23.400 --> 30:26.160
what is immediately valuable to me would be cash.

714
30:26.160 --> 30:28.260
I can spend that right away.

715
30:28.260 --> 30:30.540
What would not be immediately valuable to me

716
30:30.540 --> 30:32.670
would be like some niche gift card

717
30:32.670 --> 30:35.370
that you got for Christmas from a store in your hometown.

718
30:35.370 --> 30:37.920
That's not super valuable to me right away.

719
30:37.920 --> 30:39.570
The same thing can be said

720
30:39.570 --> 30:41.130
for what's sold on the black market.

721
30:41.130 --> 30:43.740
So the first thing, of course, is crypto wallets.

722
30:43.740 --> 30:45.840
I would drain that crypto right away.

723
30:45.840 --> 30:47.010
That's really valuable for me,

724
30:47.010 --> 30:49.800
especially if I'm a criminal

725
30:49.800 --> 30:53.100
and I'm already using that type of currency today.

726
30:53.100 --> 30:56.340
Other things like web credentials, browser data,

727
30:56.340 --> 30:59.160
stored credit card information, email.

728
30:59.160 --> 31:02.280
Chat credentials is getting even more interesting now

729
31:02.280 --> 31:04.830
in this sort of AI era when people are

730
31:04.830 --> 31:08.220
communicating with LLMs in such a personal way

731
31:08.220 --> 31:11.730
and sharing either private details about their life,

732
31:11.730 --> 31:14.670
about their relationships, or about their business.

733
31:14.670 --> 31:18.870
So chat credentials are getting more popular as well.

734
31:18.870 --> 31:23.340
But even things like fire transfer protocol credentials

735
31:23.340 --> 31:27.120
or VPN credentials, not immediately valuable to me,

736
31:27.120 --> 31:29.280
but in the hands of the right adversary

737
31:29.280 --> 31:30.690
or the right criminal,

738
31:30.690 --> 31:33.750
I could use that as an initial access point

739
31:33.750 --> 31:37.800
in order to start to move into an enterprise environment.

740
31:37.800 --> 31:41.130
So all of this is sold on the black market today.

741
31:41.130 --> 31:42.990
And what does the black market look like?

742
31:42.990 --> 31:44.733
It looks like Amazon.

743
31:45.690 --> 31:49.170
These marketplaces have customer support,

744
31:49.170 --> 31:53.250
they have HR teams, they have reviews of the product.

745
31:53.250 --> 31:54.150
Is this good data?

746
31:54.150 --> 31:56.253
Is this seller known to sell good data?

747
31:56.253 --> 31:58.410
They even have escrow services

748
31:58.410 --> 31:59.850
so that when you buy that data,

749
31:59.850 --> 32:04.850
it's kind of held so that you can get the crypto transaction

750
32:05.670 --> 32:06.660
and then you send it over.

751
32:06.660 --> 32:07.560
So they even have escrow.

752
32:07.560 --> 32:10.740
They're very sophisticated marketplaces

753
32:10.740 --> 32:14.130
where your data is bought and sold today.

754
32:14.130 --> 32:16.560
And yeah, it's very, very real.

755
32:16.560 --> 32:20.490
The way that this happens is through info stealers.

756
32:20.490 --> 32:24.150
Info stealers are responsible for the majority of the data

757
32:24.150 --> 32:27.390
that ends up on the black market today.

758
32:27.390 --> 32:30.660
However, when you look at any enterprise breach,

759
32:30.660 --> 32:33.810
that can happen through any vulnerability,

760
32:33.810 --> 32:36.750
zero-day vulnerability, misconfiguration, threat activity,

761
32:36.750 --> 32:38.650
insider threat, all of that type of thing.

762
32:38.650 --> 32:41.490
<v ->Well, it gets even more insidious actually, right?</v>

763
32:41.490 --> 32:42.660
So you're being tracked

764
32:42.660 --> 32:44.910
on pretty much every element of your life

765
32:44.910 --> 32:47.490
as you're moving through the internet online.

766
32:47.490 --> 32:48.930
I don't know if you all recall seeing

767
32:48.930 --> 32:50.370
that New York Times article

768
32:50.370 --> 32:53.190
where a journalist did a forensic analysis

769
32:53.190 --> 32:56.160
on how her footprint was being tracked within websites,

770
32:56.160 --> 32:58.080
but also between websites,

771
32:58.080 --> 32:59.970
and that includes things that are

772
32:59.970 --> 33:01.530
seemingly meaningless to us,

773
33:01.530 --> 33:05.940
like my screen size, my operating system, my keyboard,

774
33:05.940 --> 33:08.940
even whether or not I have a privacy setting activated.

775
33:08.940 --> 33:10.590
So when I say please keep me private,

776
33:10.590 --> 33:13.110
even that is being used for tracking.

777
33:13.110 --> 33:14.520
And all of that gets put together

778
33:14.520 --> 33:16.380
to where at the end of a research day,

779
33:16.380 --> 33:17.550
the forensics team could tell her

780
33:17.550 --> 33:19.530
what kind of article she was writing.

781
33:19.530 --> 33:20.910
And so, that's why I'm saying

782
33:20.910 --> 33:22.590
people are actually making sense of you

783
33:22.590 --> 33:25.200
with very, very small, to your point earlier, Shannon,

784
33:25.200 --> 33:26.880
very small data points

785
33:26.880 --> 33:28.819
that are all being aggregated together

786
33:28.819 --> 33:30.810
into a more holistic picture.

787
33:30.810 --> 33:32.850
<v ->Well, and I can cross reference that too, right?</v>

788
33:32.850 --> 33:35.160
If I see there's been a recent breach,

789
33:35.160 --> 33:36.480
I can go back and see,

790
33:36.480 --> 33:38.820
has that person been implicated before?

791
33:38.820 --> 33:41.700
So even if it's just your email.

792
33:41.700 --> 33:44.400
Say that a website is asking for just your email

793
33:44.400 --> 33:46.290
to access the information.

794
33:46.290 --> 33:48.660
Well, that doesn't seem that dangerous.

795
33:48.660 --> 33:51.510
But then if we look at first name, last name,

796
33:51.510 --> 33:53.760
and then we compare that to a previous data breach,

797
33:53.760 --> 33:57.870
we can start to tell a pretty solid story of who you are.

798
33:57.870 --> 34:01.050
<v ->And I wanna say, please don't be mistaken</v>

799
34:01.050 --> 34:03.540
that this is all acceptable

800
34:03.540 --> 34:06.510
in terms of you paying with your data.

801
34:06.510 --> 34:09.720
Let's say the value is $25 a month for a subscription.

802
34:09.720 --> 34:12.600
This is a large multiple of that amount

803
34:12.600 --> 34:14.790
that third parties are making on your data

804
34:14.790 --> 34:16.980
that you have absolutely no visibility into.

805
34:16.980 --> 34:19.110
And if you're a corporate executive,

806
34:19.110 --> 34:20.340
this should bother you as well,

807
34:20.340 --> 34:23.040
because you should want

808
34:23.040 --> 34:25.110
to repatriate some of those data points

809
34:25.110 --> 34:27.660
and the value of that data back into your value chain

810
34:27.660 --> 34:30.000
rather than going out there and buying new data sets

811
34:30.000 --> 34:32.700
on somebody that may or may not be sanctioned.

812
34:32.700 --> 34:35.160
So from both the consumer privacy angle

813
34:35.160 --> 34:38.640
as well as a corporate economic angle, you should care.

814
34:38.640 --> 34:43.290
<v ->In the panel yesterday on the AI track,</v>

815
34:43.290 --> 34:46.113
which large language model will dominate,

816
34:46.980 --> 34:50.433
the conclusion, the data sets will dominate.

817
34:52.920 --> 34:54.180
<v ->Data is single handedly,</v>

818
34:54.180 --> 34:56.670
everybody is looking at the shiny new thing.

819
34:56.670 --> 34:58.680
Jenssen's keynote, fantastic.

820
34:58.680 --> 35:00.810
Obviously the shiny new thing really matters.

821
35:00.810 --> 35:01.950
That's the engine room.

822
35:01.950 --> 35:05.760
But really, we're discarding a conversation about the fuel,

823
35:05.760 --> 35:07.233
and the fuel is data.

824
35:08.280 --> 35:11.253
<v ->Kate, would you like to go on the tax of privacy?</v>

825
35:14.010 --> 35:14.843
<v ->Sure.</v>

826
35:14.843 --> 35:19.200
So I think what we've been talking about is data

827
35:19.200 --> 35:22.470
that maybe we've consented to have collected about us,

828
35:22.470 --> 35:26.490
and maybe some data we didn't know was collected about us,

829
35:26.490 --> 35:28.830
maybe some things we got for free,

830
35:28.830 --> 35:31.780
maybe some things we bought, but they took the data anyway.

831
35:33.390 --> 35:37.650
In the regulation scheme,

832
35:37.650 --> 35:41.880
part of what governments are doing is twofold.

833
35:41.880 --> 35:46.230
They're first trying to incentivize people

834
35:46.230 --> 35:48.270
to behave in the way that drives

835
35:48.270 --> 35:50.100
better business for their jurisdictions,

836
35:50.100 --> 35:53.460
and what that looks like in one jurisdiction isn't the same

837
35:53.460 --> 35:56.580
as what it looks like in another jurisdiction.

838
35:56.580 --> 36:01.580
But they're also trying to create a level playing field

839
36:03.600 --> 36:07.350
for both individuals and companies.

840
36:07.350 --> 36:12.350
And so, in that sense, GDPR, CCPA and other privacy laws

841
36:13.710 --> 36:17.700
do function as a tax or tariff.

842
36:17.700 --> 36:20.500
There's a lot of discussion about tariffs generally now.

843
36:21.810 --> 36:25.320
I mean, for what it's worth, I'm not a political expert,

844
36:25.320 --> 36:28.470
but I don't necessarily see privacy laws

845
36:28.470 --> 36:32.070
being a strong impact in the next year or two,

846
36:32.070 --> 36:34.860
because the markets pretty much stabilized

847
36:34.860 --> 36:37.170
right now on that tax.

848
36:37.170 --> 36:40.860
But where I do see greater risk for companies

849
36:40.860 --> 36:44.010
is if the data is lost,

850
36:44.010 --> 36:46.890
and I see that in a regulatory context

851
36:46.890 --> 36:48.393
because the fines are high,

852
36:49.230 --> 36:52.380
but more actually in a reputational context.

853
36:52.380 --> 36:57.330
Because if consumers find out that you have data about them

854
36:57.330 --> 36:59.610
that not only they didn't know you had,

855
36:59.610 --> 37:01.620
but they didn't want you to have,

856
37:01.620 --> 37:05.010
and that leaks, that's pretty tough.

857
37:05.010 --> 37:07.230
Like today in the CES app,

858
37:07.230 --> 37:10.080
it asked me to have access to my health data,

859
37:10.080 --> 37:12.360
and I was like, I'm sorry, what?

860
37:12.360 --> 37:14.700
And being me, I did read.

861
37:14.700 --> 37:16.200
They did have a legitimate reason.

862
37:16.200 --> 37:18.210
They said they wanted to take my step pace

863
37:18.210 --> 37:19.740
and see how long it would take me

864
37:19.740 --> 37:21.630
to get from West Hall to North Hall

865
37:21.630 --> 37:23.490
or wherever I wanted to go.

866
37:23.490 --> 37:26.250
So I understood that, but did they need all my health data?

867
37:26.250 --> 37:28.500
Is there a way they could've taken my step data

868
37:28.500 --> 37:30.573
without taking everything else about me?

869
37:31.620 --> 37:33.630
I am that parent that makes their kids

870
37:33.630 --> 37:35.220
review the privacy notices,

871
37:35.220 --> 37:38.370
and then before they want the app, they have to tell me.

872
37:38.370 --> 37:39.690
I say, did you check it?

873
37:39.690 --> 37:40.523
And they're like, yeah.

874
37:40.523 --> 37:41.356
And I'm like, no, no, no.

875
37:41.356 --> 37:42.600
This is taking your location data

876
37:42.600 --> 37:44.340
even when you're not using the app.

877
37:44.340 --> 37:47.430
<v ->Roll into your last minute closing thought too.</v>

878
37:47.430 --> 37:48.750
We're almost outta time.

879
37:48.750 --> 37:51.990
<v ->Or for my daughter, who's a teenager,</v>

880
37:51.990 --> 37:54.630
she was downloading a free wallpaper app

881
37:54.630 --> 37:55.683
and it wanted to take all her health data.

882
37:55.683 --> 37:57.330
<v ->It's always the wallpaper apps.</v>

883
37:57.330 --> 37:59.280
<v ->And I was like, what on earth is this?</v>

884
37:59.280 --> 38:01.410
I was like, Lily, that's gross.

885
38:01.410 --> 38:04.080
And then when she knew, she didn't want it.

886
38:04.080 --> 38:06.660
But as much as I try to educate them,

887
38:06.660 --> 38:08.190
and they're more sophisticated, I would say,

888
38:08.190 --> 38:10.290
than the average American because of my job,

889
38:10.290 --> 38:11.493
it's still a struggle.

890
38:12.810 --> 38:13.680
<v ->Olaf, closing thought.</v>

891
38:13.680 --> 38:15.930
<v ->Yeah, look, I mean obviously you wanna stay away</v>

892
38:15.930 --> 38:18.210
from any billion four, billion two,

893
38:18.210 --> 38:21.480
whatever it was, fines that Facebook incurred in Texas,

894
38:21.480 --> 38:22.950
and the multi-billion dollar settlement

895
38:22.950 --> 38:25.533
that Google incurred in California,

896
38:26.640 --> 38:28.380
notwithstanding the fact that that's peanuts

897
38:28.380 --> 38:29.850
for these large corporations,

898
38:29.850 --> 38:31.080
but for you it may not be.

899
38:31.080 --> 38:33.780
But I wanna actually drive home Kate's point even more,

900
38:33.780 --> 38:35.940
which is that we're already being taxed,

901
38:35.940 --> 38:37.500
you're just not being taxed by a government.

902
38:37.500 --> 38:39.840
You're being taxed by a shadow economy.

903
38:39.840 --> 38:42.030
The actors behind the scenes, it's a,

904
38:42.030 --> 38:45.450
by 2030, an almost $500 billion data brokerage industry

905
38:45.450 --> 38:46.500
that is taxing you.

906
38:46.500 --> 38:47.670
That's your data.

907
38:47.670 --> 38:48.540
That's your corporate data,

908
38:48.540 --> 38:51.060
that's your individual data, that's your customer trust.

909
38:51.060 --> 38:52.710
You're already being taxed.

910
38:52.710 --> 38:54.840
Do you want that, or do you want to lobby

911
38:54.840 --> 38:58.080
for a more transparent mechanism

912
38:58.080 --> 39:00.600
where you can actually derive value, repatriate it,

913
39:00.600 --> 39:03.180
give people agency, bring it out in the open?

914
39:03.180 --> 39:05.640
Why does this have to be a shadow economy?

915
39:05.640 --> 39:07.650
So I'm gonna roll over into my closing statement

916
39:07.650 --> 39:08.940
as well, if that's all right with you.

917
39:08.940 --> 39:09.773
<v ->Please.</v>

918
39:09.773 --> 39:12.540
<v ->Which is that, look, the technologies exist.</v>

919
39:12.540 --> 39:13.860
I mean, we're working on them,

920
39:13.860 --> 39:15.690
other people are working on them.

921
39:15.690 --> 39:18.060
Make sure that your CISO,

922
39:18.060 --> 39:20.640
but also your customers, your employees,

923
39:20.640 --> 39:24.300
have confidentiality and privacy charters that are nestled.

924
39:24.300 --> 39:26.010
Watermark footprints.

925
39:26.010 --> 39:28.650
Make sure that they're registered to the data creator

926
39:28.650 --> 39:30.840
so the data creator can take ownership,

927
39:30.840 --> 39:33.630
whether that is in service of the corporation

928
39:33.630 --> 39:35.190
or in their own service.

929
39:35.190 --> 39:38.310
And then make sure that we actually

930
39:38.310 --> 39:40.290
rate market participants

931
39:40.290 --> 39:42.180
so that you can decide where to put the data

932
39:42.180 --> 39:43.770
and on what terms.

933
39:43.770 --> 39:45.390
<v ->Shannon?</v>
<v ->Awesome. Thanks.</v>

934
39:45.390 --> 39:46.890
I think what the good news is,

935
39:46.890 --> 39:49.560
is on the enterprise side where you are sharing your data

936
39:49.560 --> 39:51.330
with different companies,

937
39:51.330 --> 39:53.400
is that they have a way bigger tool set

938
39:53.400 --> 39:55.110
available to them today

939
39:55.110 --> 39:58.020
to do a better job of protecting your data

940
39:58.020 --> 40:01.860
so you're not finding yourselves in these massive breaches,

941
40:01.860 --> 40:04.560
going way beyond like legacy technology,

942
40:04.560 --> 40:07.560
like data loss prevention or DLP to do things

943
40:07.560 --> 40:09.750
like data security, posture management

944
40:09.750 --> 40:12.930
where you're looking at the full life cycle of that data,

945
40:12.930 --> 40:15.810
doing things like data detection and response,

946
40:15.810 --> 40:18.270
dark web monitoring so that you have eyes

947
40:18.270 --> 40:21.930
on these marketplaces at all times,

948
40:21.930 --> 40:24.270
and things like zero-trust architectures as well

949
40:24.270 --> 40:26.910
so people within the organization are not getting

950
40:26.910 --> 40:29.100
unnecessary access to your information

951
40:29.100 --> 40:30.630
on that enterprise side as well.

952
40:30.630 --> 40:34.950
So more available to these enterprise players

953
40:34.950 --> 40:37.410
to do right by you, because it's really critical

954
40:37.410 --> 40:41.580
that we take that responsibility extremely seriously.

955
40:41.580 --> 40:43.200
<v ->If I can have 10 seconds to just say,</v>

956
40:43.200 --> 40:45.630
look, don't be fooled into saying

957
40:45.630 --> 40:48.480
that by taking more control over the data economy

958
40:48.480 --> 40:49.620
we'll shrink it.

959
40:49.620 --> 40:50.520
We'll expand it.

960
40:50.520 --> 40:52.830
When people feel like they're cut in

961
40:52.830 --> 40:54.780
and there is transparency, there's trust,

962
40:54.780 --> 40:57.360
there's agency, they'll give you more data,

963
40:57.360 --> 40:59.250
and more participants in the market

964
40:59.250 --> 41:01.025
are more incentivized to do that.

965
41:01.025 --> 41:01.858
So this is the growth--

966
41:01.858 --> 41:04.050
<v ->Them to be compromised, and then when that gets stolen,</v>

967
41:04.050 --> 41:06.103
they can really easily manipulate you.

968
41:06.103 --> 41:07.770
I wanna thank our panel.

969
41:07.770 --> 41:10.200
You guys have been fantastic, and the audience.

970
41:10.200 --> 41:13.680
Remember, go to YouTube, TBW Advisors.

971
41:13.680 --> 41:16.170
I got videos loading tomorrow as well.

972
41:16.170 --> 41:17.670
Please help me get to a thousand.

973
41:17.670 --> 41:19.560
I definitely appreciate you,

974
41:19.560 --> 41:21.810
and definitely appreciate you coming to our panel.

975
41:21.810 --> 41:23.010
I think they've done fantastic.

976
41:23.010 --> 41:24.103
Let's give them a big hand.

977
41:24.103 --> 41:24.936
(audience applauding)

978
41:24.936 --> 41:27.603
(rousing music)
