00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
(dynamic pop music)

2
00:10.650 --> 00:12.995
<v ->All right, the music stopped.</v>

3
00:12.995 --> 00:14.490
I think it's the time to get started.

4
00:14.490 --> 00:17.760
So welcome, everybody, to the second session.

5
00:17.760 --> 00:19.110
My name is Nathan de Ruiter.

6
00:19.110 --> 00:21.960
I'm a partner and managing director at Novaspace,

7
00:21.960 --> 00:24.750
a consulting firm specialized in the space sector.

8
00:24.750 --> 00:29.010
So this topic will be about "Driving into the Future:

9
00:29.010 --> 00:31.576
The Impact of Connected Cars."

10
00:31.576 --> 00:32.670
So not sure you already had a chance

11
00:32.670 --> 00:36.060
to visit some of the booths at the exhibition floor,

12
00:36.060 --> 00:37.080
but if you have some,

13
00:37.080 --> 00:39.872
so you probably have seen and witnessed firsthand

14
00:39.872 --> 00:43.530
the kind of impressive technology advancements

15
00:43.530 --> 00:47.313
of the car manufacturers into the software-defined vehicles.

16
00:48.780 --> 00:52.170
So when we talk about software-defined vehicles,

17
00:52.170 --> 00:55.170
you could argue that connectivity is really a key enabler,

18
00:55.170 --> 00:56.685
so kind of the critical backbone

19
00:56.685 --> 01:00.000
for providing these capabilities.

20
01:00.000 --> 01:03.330
So our session today, we'll discuss about the benefits

21
01:03.330 --> 01:05.987
of software-defined vehicles.

22
01:05.987 --> 01:08.490
Also, we'll look at what does it mean

23
01:08.490 --> 01:10.230
in terms of connectivity requirements

24
01:10.230 --> 01:12.660
to enable those software-defined vehicles.

25
01:12.660 --> 01:15.509
But we also very specifically talk about

26
01:15.509 --> 01:16.590
the role of satellite, right?

27
01:16.590 --> 01:18.810
That's kind of the angle we're taking here.

28
01:18.810 --> 01:20.400
What's the role of satellite?

29
01:20.400 --> 01:21.990
What are the different use cases

30
01:21.990 --> 01:23.310
and potentially as well

31
01:23.310 --> 01:25.530
the opportunities and challenges

32
01:25.530 --> 01:28.440
to make it kind of a wider adoption of satellite

33
01:28.440 --> 01:29.823
into that connected car.

34
01:30.960 --> 01:33.990
We have a great lineup of speakers. It's very interesting.

35
01:33.990 --> 01:35.760
Each one have a very different angle

36
01:35.760 --> 01:37.110
that they bring to the conversation.

37
01:37.110 --> 01:40.200
So we'll see if they can agree or disagree

38
01:40.200 --> 01:43.290
and how the discussion will evolve.

39
01:43.290 --> 01:44.430
So what I'll do first,

40
01:44.430 --> 01:46.470
I will ask each individual speaker

41
01:46.470 --> 01:47.673
to introduce themself,

42
01:48.660 --> 01:51.360
as well highlight the company they're representing

43
01:51.360 --> 01:52.920
and maybe as well kind of what is the angle

44
01:52.920 --> 01:54.810
they provide to the conversation

45
01:54.810 --> 01:58.476
of the connected/software-defined vehicle.

46
01:58.476 --> 01:59.520
So maybe we'll just go down the line.

47
01:59.520 --> 02:00.810
So Kieran, you go first.

48
02:00.810 --> 02:01.650
<v ->Yeah, thanks everyone.</v>

49
02:01.650 --> 02:03.420
So my name is Kieran McAleer.

50
02:03.420 --> 02:05.520
I'm a department manager at AVL,

51
02:05.520 --> 02:08.280
responsible for new innovation solutions

52
02:08.280 --> 02:11.310
to support the automotive development processes.

53
02:11.310 --> 02:15.090
So some solutions we're working on is around cybersecurity,

54
02:15.090 --> 02:18.630
ADAS and automatic robotic drivers.

55
02:18.630 --> 02:22.020
AVL as a company is a technology provider

56
02:22.020 --> 02:27.020
in the areas of development, simulation and testing

57
02:27.180 --> 02:32.180
specifically for the focus on the automotive market.

58
02:32.280 --> 02:35.010
And yeah, the main areas or the main focus points

59
02:35.010 --> 02:39.780
currently in our projects and opportunities with customers

60
02:39.780 --> 02:44.430
is around ADAS, SDV, electrification and safety,

61
02:44.430 --> 02:46.650
and yeah, also now cybersecurity,

62
02:46.650 --> 02:49.500
which is taking more prevalence in the automotive market.

63
02:50.910 --> 02:53.400
<v ->Okay, Sven Hellsten from Ericsson,</v>

64
02:53.400 --> 02:57.480
a Swedish based company, telecommunication,

65
02:57.480 --> 02:58.800
headquarter in Stockholm,

66
02:58.800 --> 03:02.400
working with the satellite technology

67
03:02.400 --> 03:07.169
and we have the vision that satellites with 5G

68
03:07.169 --> 03:08.460
and in the future, 6G,

69
03:08.460 --> 03:12.090
will provide what we call the ubiquitous coverage

70
03:12.090 --> 03:13.500
all around the world

71
03:13.500 --> 03:15.813
for various use cases.

72
03:17.280 --> 03:18.387
<v ->My name is Omar Qaise,</v>

73
03:18.387 --> 03:21.030
I'm the founder and CEO of OQ technology.

74
03:21.030 --> 03:25.050
We are a satellite operator based in Luxembourg

75
03:25.050 --> 03:27.840
that operates low earth orbit nano satellites

76
03:27.840 --> 03:31.530
to provide 5G non-terrestrial network connectivity

77
03:31.530 --> 03:33.210
for remote and rural areas,

78
03:33.210 --> 03:38.210
especially for verticals like energy, mobility, agriculture,

79
03:38.880 --> 03:43.080
and mining and mobility logistics.

80
03:43.080 --> 03:46.770
Fleet management is a core area for 5G

81
03:46.770 --> 03:49.143
and TN connectivity that we provide.

82
03:50.610 --> 03:52.260
<v ->So my name is Joerg Tischler,</v>

83
03:52.260 --> 03:53.460
I'm from T-Systems

84
03:53.460 --> 03:56.010
and heading the connect mobility unit.

85
03:56.010 --> 03:59.220
T-Systems is the business to business system integrator

86
03:59.220 --> 04:01.290
of the telecom T-Mobile US.

87
04:01.290 --> 04:03.450
So we are kind of using connectivity

88
04:03.450 --> 04:06.600
to operate large fleets for OEMs.

89
04:06.600 --> 04:09.120
So meaning all the fleets which have

90
04:09.120 --> 04:10.890
software defined vehicle features.

91
04:10.890 --> 04:12.990
That's what we are building and operating.

92
04:14.610 --> 04:16.140
<v ->My name is Maite Bezerra.</v>

93
04:16.140 --> 04:19.410
I am a senior principal analyst, Forward Intelligence,

94
04:19.410 --> 04:21.510
in software-defined vehicles.

95
04:21.510 --> 04:25.140
And my job is to research this transition

96
04:25.140 --> 04:27.540
that the automotive industry is facing now,

97
04:27.540 --> 04:30.360
moving away from hardware centric vehicles

98
04:30.360 --> 04:32.010
into software-defined vehicles

99
04:32.010 --> 04:34.980
and what that actually entails in terms of hardware,

100
04:34.980 --> 04:36.720
in terms of software platforms,

101
04:36.720 --> 04:39.210
in terms of relationship with their suppliers

102
04:39.210 --> 04:40.680
and even in terms of

103
04:40.680 --> 04:43.203
their internal organizational process as well.

104
04:44.277 --> 04:47.430
<v ->Perfect. That's a great introduction.</v>

105
04:47.430 --> 04:50.280
Maite, we'll just right away start with you.

106
04:50.280 --> 04:51.630
Software defined vehicles,

107
04:51.630 --> 04:53.520
as a consultant to consultant,

108
04:53.520 --> 04:56.070
market sizing always a key question to start with.

109
04:56.070 --> 04:57.660
So can you kinda give an indication

110
04:57.660 --> 05:00.567
what is the current market size of software defined vehicles

111
05:00.567 --> 05:03.477
and what is kind of the growth prospects?

112
05:03.477 --> 05:04.450
<v ->Sure.</v>

113
05:04.450 --> 05:07.770
I think before I address your question specifically,

114
05:07.770 --> 05:10.170
I think it's important to take a step back

115
05:10.170 --> 05:12.450
and understand the evolution of the vehicles.

116
05:12.450 --> 05:14.670
So then we have a good understanding

117
05:14.670 --> 05:17.640
of what software-defined vehicle actually is

118
05:17.640 --> 05:20.610
and the role of connectivity in the different stages, right?

119
05:20.610 --> 05:23.160
So we first have the stage zero,

120
05:23.160 --> 05:25.500
in which we have a purely mechanical vehicle,

121
05:25.500 --> 05:27.480
there's no connectivity in there.

122
05:27.480 --> 05:31.080
Then we have the stage one when we have a connected car.

123
05:31.080 --> 05:33.930
This is a car that has features installed in the car

124
05:33.930 --> 05:37.320
and these features can be enhanced with connectivity.

125
05:37.320 --> 05:38.847
So navigation, for example.

126
05:38.847 --> 05:42.540
You can suddenly have live traffic information

127
05:42.540 --> 05:44.520
if your car is connected.

128
05:44.520 --> 05:48.390
Then you have the level two, which I call a semi-SDV,

129
05:48.390 --> 05:52.530
it's not quite there yet, which is a car that is connected

130
05:52.530 --> 05:55.800
and is also capable of receiving updates

131
05:55.800 --> 05:58.650
to the features that are in the car.

132
05:58.650 --> 06:02.760
However, these updates are essentially bug fixes.

133
06:02.760 --> 06:03.660
You're not changing,

134
06:03.660 --> 06:06.630
fundamentally changing anything in the car.

135
06:06.630 --> 06:09.240
So in this stage one to two,

136
06:09.240 --> 06:11.210
connectivity is kind of an add-on

137
06:11.210 --> 06:14.070
to what you already have in the car, right?

138
06:14.070 --> 06:15.780
And then you have this stage three,

139
06:15.780 --> 06:18.060
which is a software defined vehicle.

140
06:18.060 --> 06:22.920
And in here, connectivity becomes a foundational layer.

141
06:22.920 --> 06:24.930
It's not just an add-on anymore.

142
06:24.930 --> 06:26.460
When you are designing a vehicle,

143
06:26.460 --> 06:27.840
when you're designing a function,

144
06:27.840 --> 06:30.090
connectivity is part of them

145
06:30.090 --> 06:32.970
and this is essentially digitalizing the car,

146
06:32.970 --> 06:35.130
which, quite frankly, has been the same

147
06:35.130 --> 06:36.900
for the past 100 years.

148
06:36.900 --> 06:38.763
So it was time, wasn't it?

149
06:39.600 --> 06:41.070
But when you digitalize the car,

150
06:41.070 --> 06:42.780
you have to digitalize the companies

151
06:42.780 --> 06:43.890
that manufacture the car.

152
06:43.890 --> 06:45.540
You have to digitalize the companies

153
06:45.540 --> 06:48.030
that supply the hardware and the software to the car

154
06:48.030 --> 06:50.160
and the whole supply chain.

155
06:50.160 --> 06:52.560
So I'm saying this just to point out

156
06:52.560 --> 06:55.350
how complex, how comprehensive

157
06:55.350 --> 06:57.540
the concept of software-defined vehicle is.

158
06:57.540 --> 07:01.200
It goes way beyond just the car itself.

159
07:01.200 --> 07:03.431
So Forward Intelligence,

160
07:03.431 --> 07:08.431
we estimate that 4% of all the vehicles sold in 2024

161
07:10.080 --> 07:12.990
were purely software-defined vehicle

162
07:12.990 --> 07:15.300
based on this estimation.

163
07:15.300 --> 07:17.850
Now, is the market going to grow?

164
07:17.850 --> 07:19.020
Definitely.

165
07:19.020 --> 07:21.540
All the automakers are going to migrate

166
07:21.540 --> 07:23.010
to software-defined vehicles.

167
07:23.010 --> 07:26.250
However, this transition is going to be gradual.

168
07:26.250 --> 07:28.620
It's not something that will happen overnight.

169
07:28.620 --> 07:30.759
We are not gonna see enormous growth

170
07:30.759 --> 07:33.690
taking place in the upcoming years.

171
07:33.690 --> 07:36.870
So in 2020, by the end of the decade,

172
07:36.870 --> 07:41.080
we expect it to be around 10% of all new vehicles sold

173
07:41.970 --> 07:44.130
purely software-defined vehicles.

174
07:44.130 --> 07:46.830
Now if you think about connected cars,

175
07:46.830 --> 07:49.440
which is level one and two as well,

176
07:49.440 --> 07:52.230
then we have a higher base.

177
07:52.230 --> 07:57.090
70% of all vehicles sold in 2023 had embedded connectivity.

178
07:57.090 --> 07:59.310
And by 2030, we are gonna see

179
07:59.310 --> 08:01.860
pretty much all new vehicles having them.

180
08:01.860 --> 08:02.880
<v ->All right, great.</v>

181
08:02.880 --> 08:05.053
Kieran, do you see some OEMs

182
08:05.053 --> 08:06.887
taking a particular lead

183
08:06.887 --> 08:10.200
in the kind of the software defined vehicle development

184
08:10.200 --> 08:13.080
or a difference between OEMs?

185
08:13.080 --> 08:14.580
<v ->Yeah, I think from our perspective,</v>

186
08:14.580 --> 08:16.680
there's certainly a difference between the OEMs,

187
08:16.680 --> 08:18.990
as I think also we agree that the SDV,

188
08:18.990 --> 08:20.010
it's got a wide scope,

189
08:20.010 --> 08:23.223
it means different things to different people.

190
08:24.180 --> 08:26.550
We see that what's evident is

191
08:26.550 --> 08:28.320
that the OEMs are going in this direction.

192
08:28.320 --> 08:31.170
So the investment is there and they have a focus.

193
08:31.170 --> 08:33.450
I think there's a general acceptance that

194
08:33.450 --> 08:36.660
within 10 years, there should be a wide adoption

195
08:36.660 --> 08:40.650
of SDV related features, functions in the vehicles.

196
08:40.650 --> 08:42.150
But I would say from our perspective,

197
08:42.150 --> 08:45.210
we see that there is different OEMs at different levels.

198
08:45.210 --> 08:47.070
So it's like comparing,

199
08:47.070 --> 08:50.662
let's say the established OEMs compared to the new startups,

200
08:50.662 --> 08:54.180
the established OEMs have the challenge with existing legacy

201
08:54.180 --> 08:55.560
that they have to accommodate with,

202
08:55.560 --> 08:57.990
they have their defined process, et cetera,

203
08:57.990 --> 08:59.490
and they become more software orientated.

204
08:59.490 --> 09:01.438
This also takes time in the mind,

205
09:01.438 --> 09:03.603
a mind shift as well.

206
09:04.440 --> 09:06.000
And if you look at the new startups,

207
09:06.000 --> 09:07.530
they don't really have this legacy,

208
09:07.530 --> 09:09.900
so they can be quicker to adopt the new technologies,

209
09:09.900 --> 09:12.019
the platforms that are required

210
09:12.019 --> 09:13.980
to bring this SDV capability.

211
09:13.980 --> 09:16.440
And from my perspective, regarding connectivity,

212
09:16.440 --> 09:19.020
maybe this is a personal kind of focus or key.

213
09:19.020 --> 09:20.310
I see the key aspect here

214
09:20.310 --> 09:23.340
around connectivity in the SDV terms

215
09:23.340 --> 09:24.930
should be around, let's say, safety.

216
09:24.930 --> 09:28.020
So not only passenger safety but also pedestrian safety.

217
09:28.020 --> 09:29.596
I think this is where the biggest impact

218
09:29.596 --> 09:30.903
could be for the future.

219
09:32.130 --> 09:33.830
<v ->All right, maybe moving on that.</v>

220
09:35.138 --> 09:37.590
Yeah, so it's Consumer Electronics Show.

221
09:37.590 --> 09:39.300
So consumer experience is important.

222
09:39.300 --> 09:42.390
So maybe talk a bit about

223
09:42.390 --> 09:43.800
the expectations.

224
09:43.800 --> 09:45.000
So safety here, as mentioned,

225
09:45.000 --> 09:46.230
is a primary use case,

226
09:46.230 --> 09:47.670
particularly for connectivity.

227
09:47.670 --> 09:49.050
What are other benefits?

228
09:49.050 --> 09:51.870
For example, Sven, maybe you can talk about it,

229
09:51.870 --> 09:55.890
that the connected or software-defined vehicle can bring

230
09:55.890 --> 09:58.383
from a personal user experience.

231
10:00.540 --> 10:01.373
<v ->Yep.</v>

232
10:03.000 --> 10:07.080
I think when you talk about safety and everything,

233
10:07.080 --> 10:11.130
the question is, what kind of service are you looking for?

234
10:11.130 --> 10:15.420
And basically we're seeing three different tracks now.

235
10:15.420 --> 10:18.450
One is IOT type of connectivity,

236
10:18.450 --> 10:22.773
with messaging, emergency messaging and stuff like that.

237
10:23.790 --> 10:25.380
Possible with LEO satellites,

238
10:25.380 --> 10:28.620
but also with yield satellites, actually,

239
10:28.620 --> 10:31.680
quite good from a coverage perspective.

240
10:31.680 --> 10:35.640
Moving on with more advanced services,

241
10:35.640 --> 10:38.130
you would go into Lee Orbits.

242
10:38.130 --> 10:39.660
Depending on the frequency band,

243
10:39.660 --> 10:42.723
you could go for voice and data everywhere.

244
10:43.800 --> 10:48.330
And actually, also with 5G

245
10:48.330 --> 10:49.590
on some higher bands,

246
10:49.590 --> 10:54.590
you can do quite advanced data services.

247
10:56.280 --> 10:57.780
<v ->And Omar, maybe that's important,</v>

248
10:57.780 --> 11:00.060
as maybe not everybody in the audience, you know,

249
11:00.060 --> 11:01.500
is fully familiar with satellites.

250
11:01.500 --> 11:03.660
So maybe first kind of question,

251
11:03.660 --> 11:05.340
if you can help us situate, you know,

252
11:05.340 --> 11:06.990
how the role of satellite fits

253
11:06.990 --> 11:09.540
with all the other terrestrial technologies out there.

254
11:09.540 --> 11:12.000
And then maybe talk a little bit about OQ Technology

255
11:12.000 --> 11:13.560
and the constellation developing,

256
11:13.560 --> 11:16.320
what kind of value proposition that brings,

257
11:16.320 --> 11:18.420
particularly in realm to the kind of,

258
11:18.420 --> 11:19.800
you talked about mobility,

259
11:19.800 --> 11:22.260
so if connected car is one of the use cases,

260
11:22.260 --> 11:24.633
how your kind of technology fits in there.

261
11:25.620 --> 11:27.701
<v ->So it's well known</v>

262
11:27.701 --> 11:30.750
that satellites are gonna play a very crucial role

263
11:30.750 --> 11:34.230
for software defined vehicles,

264
11:34.230 --> 11:36.926
especially because of the global reach, mainly.

265
11:36.926 --> 11:39.843
I mean, with satellites you can have global coverage,

266
11:40.680 --> 11:44.030
which allows especially to enable,

267
11:44.030 --> 11:45.930
with all the new services

268
11:45.930 --> 11:47.880
and features in these cars,

269
11:47.880 --> 11:49.898
whether it's autonomous driving,

270
11:49.898 --> 11:53.640
safety features, infotainment,

271
11:53.640 --> 11:56.520
you'll need connectivity everywhere.

272
11:56.520 --> 11:58.560
And satellites have the biggest footprint

273
11:58.560 --> 12:00.300
that they could provide in areas,

274
12:00.300 --> 12:01.287
especially where you don't have

275
12:01.287 --> 12:03.600
the terrestrial infrastructure.

276
12:03.600 --> 12:04.470
That's one benefit.

277
12:04.470 --> 12:09.470
The other thing is satellites could actually act as a backup

278
12:09.690 --> 12:13.500
for the existing other terrestrial communication means

279
12:13.500 --> 12:15.150
for vehicles,

280
12:15.150 --> 12:17.850
especially if you want to talk about

281
12:17.850 --> 12:20.820
level five of autonomous driving,

282
12:20.820 --> 12:22.440
you will need to ensure

283
12:22.440 --> 12:24.720
that there is always connectivity.

284
12:24.720 --> 12:28.650
Even if you have terrestrial level of connectivity

285
12:28.650 --> 12:31.410
with 4G, 5G, or wifi,

286
12:31.410 --> 12:34.830
you would still need to have the satellite link available

287
12:34.830 --> 12:36.930
in case there is interruption.

288
12:36.930 --> 12:41.870
And of course, for emergency and hazard,

289
12:45.150 --> 12:47.253
to avoid hazards and accidents.

290
12:48.381 --> 12:51.870
Having low latency communication is very crucial

291
12:51.870 --> 12:54.810
for cars to have enough information

292
12:54.810 --> 12:59.810
that they can also provide the necessary reaction

293
13:01.410 --> 13:03.330
that can be taken also by the cars

294
13:03.330 --> 13:05.970
in case of such incidents.

295
13:05.970 --> 13:09.404
And finally also from navigation point of view,

296
13:09.404 --> 13:12.720
well, you know, GNSS systems are available,

297
13:12.720 --> 13:14.460
provide good navigation method,

298
13:14.460 --> 13:17.130
but also there's improved navigation

299
13:17.130 --> 13:19.380
that could be provided by satellites,

300
13:19.380 --> 13:23.719
especially with augmented reality assisted navigation

301
13:23.719 --> 13:26.550
or real time HD mapping.

302
13:26.550 --> 13:29.880
And that requires also a lot of information exchange

303
13:29.880 --> 13:32.130
that satellites could provide.

304
13:32.130 --> 13:34.110
If you talk also about security,

305
13:34.110 --> 13:39.110
so satellites also are considered a secure platform

306
13:39.210 --> 13:42.180
compared to other terrestrial platforms

307
13:42.180 --> 13:45.630
and that also adds another benefit.

308
13:45.630 --> 13:47.430
Now regarding what we do today,

309
13:47.430 --> 13:51.780
so the idea here is really using the 3GPP standard

310
13:51.780 --> 13:54.690
over satellites for narrow band communication

311
13:54.690 --> 13:57.750
so that you could have seamless roaming

312
13:57.750 --> 14:00.060
and communication with terrestrial networks.

313
14:00.060 --> 14:03.630
And this is something that OEMs are looking for

314
14:03.630 --> 14:07.110
because you don't want to have different technologies

315
14:07.110 --> 14:09.990
and different standards for the car.

316
14:09.990 --> 14:11.400
For connectivity,

317
14:11.400 --> 14:13.650
integrating both terrestrial and satellite

318
14:13.650 --> 14:15.820
within the same chip, the same technology

319
14:17.010 --> 14:19.290
that can work with different telcos

320
14:19.290 --> 14:21.577
that follow the same standard

321
14:21.577 --> 14:23.160
plays a big role

322
14:23.160 --> 14:25.500
and that's the value add we could bring,

323
14:25.500 --> 14:28.440
not just us but any satellite constellation

324
14:28.440 --> 14:30.450
that is following the 3GPP

325
14:30.450 --> 14:32.853
and TN standard for 5G.

326
14:33.884 --> 14:37.380
The use case, of course, there is the geo coverage.

327
14:37.380 --> 14:38.550
It has its own limitation.

328
14:38.550 --> 14:42.720
There's the LEO, which has its own also challenges.

329
14:42.720 --> 14:46.470
But where we see today a lot of adoption, early adoption

330
14:46.470 --> 14:51.470
is for like, B2B and fleet management, telematics.

331
14:51.780 --> 14:54.990
This is where especially

332
14:54.990 --> 14:57.660
getting information about where the car is,

333
14:57.660 --> 15:00.063
whether it's where the fleet is,

334
15:00.063 --> 15:03.630
even the people who are for safety,

335
15:03.630 --> 15:07.110
like workers, where they are and what they did

336
15:07.110 --> 15:11.430
and tracking of the, for example, materials on these cars

337
15:11.430 --> 15:12.990
and also for predictive maintenance,

338
15:12.990 --> 15:17.910
getting reports so that fleet operators could plan

339
15:17.910 --> 15:19.003
maintenance efficiently.

340
15:19.003 --> 15:22.500
So this is the type of use cases that we see.

341
15:22.500 --> 15:24.630
And of course,

342
15:24.630 --> 15:29.630
with future applications, entertainment,

343
15:29.752 --> 15:31.650
you would need higher bandwidth

344
15:31.650 --> 15:35.190
and this is where broadband communications satellites

345
15:35.190 --> 15:36.993
come into the game.

346
15:38.070 --> 15:38.903
<v ->Very good.</v>

347
15:38.903 --> 15:41.700
Yeah, so definitely an evolution in satellite technology,

348
15:41.700 --> 15:43.980
IOT solutions to broadband.

349
15:43.980 --> 15:48.120
So maybe Joerg, maybe just talking still a little bit,

350
15:48.120 --> 15:51.570
positioning satellite versus the terrestrial

351
15:51.570 --> 15:52.920
kind of network technologies.

352
15:52.920 --> 15:53.790
How do you see that?

353
15:53.790 --> 15:56.310
And, I mean, there's a lot of this discussion

354
15:56.310 --> 15:57.540
about convergence, right?

355
15:57.540 --> 16:00.150
Between the two, NTN and terrestrial network.

356
16:00.150 --> 16:03.724
So how do you see that play out today

357
16:03.724 --> 16:05.193
and into the future?

358
16:06.810 --> 16:08.880
<v ->Well, I mean all the use cases you mentioned</v>

359
16:08.880 --> 16:10.080
are perfectly right

360
16:10.080 --> 16:14.280
and the connectivity in itself is no longer an enabler,

361
16:14.280 --> 16:16.200
it's a key requirement.

362
16:16.200 --> 16:19.980
What we see is that there's a coexistence,

363
16:19.980 --> 16:22.710
and you mentioned the important part of standardization.

364
16:22.710 --> 16:24.210
So without standardization,

365
16:24.210 --> 16:27.510
we will not manage to have cooperation

366
16:27.510 --> 16:31.440
or coexisting solutions.

367
16:31.440 --> 16:35.550
The key point is that the selection based on the use case.

368
16:35.550 --> 16:39.960
So not every use case should use a certain technology,

369
16:39.960 --> 16:42.960
but you select, the same way as we use our mobile phones.

370
16:42.960 --> 16:45.480
So we have wifi, we have a cellular connection

371
16:45.480 --> 16:48.000
and based on costs or availability or bandwidth,

372
16:48.000 --> 16:49.500
we use one or the other.

373
16:49.500 --> 16:51.480
The same will happen in car.

374
16:51.480 --> 16:53.400
It's not today, but it will happen,

375
16:53.400 --> 16:57.420
that priority setting, cost-effectiveness,

376
16:57.420 --> 17:01.020
this orchestration of data, of channels is important

377
17:01.020 --> 17:04.140
and it's not thinking about a car has a certain channel

378
17:04.140 --> 17:05.400
or multiple channels,

379
17:05.400 --> 17:07.050
but a service has a certain channel.

380
17:07.050 --> 17:10.020
So maybe your navigation goes to one channel

381
17:10.020 --> 17:12.800
but the updates are loaded once you're on the wifi.

382
17:12.800 --> 17:14.817
So that's different thinking

383
17:14.817 --> 17:16.740
and you have nothing available,

384
17:16.740 --> 17:18.090
then you go non-terrestrial.

385
17:18.090 --> 17:21.150
So that's basically the way we see

386
17:21.150 --> 17:23.910
this selection of channels

387
17:23.910 --> 17:26.601
and that's where the orchestration comes together.

388
17:26.601 --> 17:29.580
It's not just looking at the pure connectivity

389
17:29.580 --> 17:31.860
but the connectivity within a certain context,

390
17:31.860 --> 17:34.350
like an over the air update or navigation

391
17:34.350 --> 17:35.940
or things come together.

392
17:35.940 --> 17:37.920
We are converging services

393
17:37.920 --> 17:39.990
and that's what we are also working on.

394
17:39.990 --> 17:43.230
Bring the product, bring a product together,

395
17:43.230 --> 17:44.850
which includes the connectivity.

396
17:44.850 --> 17:49.020
It's not just having siloed connectivity, siloed security,

397
17:49.020 --> 17:52.230
siloed service, but one converged product.

398
17:52.230 --> 17:53.970
I think that's where the future sits

399
17:53.970 --> 17:57.453
and how connectivity is consumed in the future.

400
17:58.530 --> 17:59.820
<v ->Yeah, thank you. That's an important point.</v>

401
17:59.820 --> 18:00.840
So obviously, you know,

402
18:00.840 --> 18:03.540
you have multiple channels to organize that.

403
18:03.540 --> 18:04.770
I suppose there's software

404
18:04.770 --> 18:06.900
and other capabilities built around it.

405
18:06.900 --> 18:09.270
But from your perspective,

406
18:09.270 --> 18:11.280
who would then be the one

407
18:11.280 --> 18:12.690
who is kind of managing that?

408
18:12.690 --> 18:15.330
Would that be the responsibility of an OEM

409
18:15.330 --> 18:18.360
or where does that sit in your view?

410
18:18.360 --> 18:20.130
<v ->Well, we are part of Deutsche Telecom</v>

411
18:20.130 --> 18:21.150
and T-Mobile US.

412
18:21.150 --> 18:23.103
Obviously the telco providers.

413
18:23.940 --> 18:27.300
So no, that's not the true answer, the full answer.

414
18:27.300 --> 18:30.330
In the end, it can be a service which comes from an MNO

415
18:30.330 --> 18:33.390
or even a virtual MNO

416
18:33.390 --> 18:36.330
to orchestrate based on the fleet demand

417
18:36.330 --> 18:38.070
or the demand of a single car.

418
18:38.070 --> 18:40.140
It can also be the vehicle itself,

419
18:40.140 --> 18:42.000
if the logic is built into the vehicle

420
18:42.000 --> 18:46.260
and then it comes to the upgradable software,

421
18:46.260 --> 18:48.840
because these rules are changing based on what we are doing.

422
18:48.840 --> 18:51.270
You have to change this on a regular basis,

423
18:51.270 --> 18:53.760
maybe even as you use it.

424
18:53.760 --> 18:57.300
Therefore, there are certain, I would say levels

425
18:57.300 --> 19:00.630
or quality gates where you do this orchestration.

426
19:00.630 --> 19:04.054
But the telcos will play a role, the OEMs will play a role,

427
19:04.054 --> 19:07.800
any technology or connectivity provider will play a role

428
19:07.800 --> 19:09.000
based on standards.

429
19:09.000 --> 19:11.723
And that's the key point. No standards, no interaction.

430
19:12.758 --> 19:14.297
<v ->If I just can add to that</v>

431
19:14.297 --> 19:16.350
'cause I really like this point.

432
19:16.350 --> 19:19.200
It's not a responsibility of just one company

433
19:19.200 --> 19:20.340
and I think this is what happens

434
19:20.340 --> 19:22.200
with software defined vehicles.

435
19:22.200 --> 19:26.190
Before, we had this very isolated supply chain

436
19:26.190 --> 19:29.340
in which each company was doing a certain thing.

437
19:29.340 --> 19:31.057
But now, if you think about,

438
19:31.057 --> 19:32.820
"Which connectivity should I use?"

439
19:32.820 --> 19:34.920
and if you think about the use cases,

440
19:34.920 --> 19:36.990
this is down to the vehicle

441
19:36.990 --> 19:39.771
and this is down to the use case,

442
19:39.771 --> 19:42.060
down to the application.

443
19:42.060 --> 19:45.062
So you need to look at the application and see.

444
19:45.062 --> 19:48.330
Is this a mission critical application or is it not?

445
19:48.330 --> 19:49.920
If it is infotainment,

446
19:49.920 --> 19:51.810
then I can have higher latency.

447
19:51.810 --> 19:54.030
If it is an ADAS functionality,

448
19:54.030 --> 19:55.350
what level of criticality

449
19:55.350 --> 19:57.570
within the ADIS functionality it is?

450
19:57.570 --> 20:00.390
'Cause there are different levels in the ADAS as well.

451
20:00.390 --> 20:01.470
Is this something that,

452
20:01.470 --> 20:03.930
if I don't have a real time response,

453
20:03.930 --> 20:06.270
I will put someone's life in risk?

454
20:06.270 --> 20:07.890
'Cause this is also important

455
20:07.890 --> 20:09.000
when you are deciding

456
20:09.000 --> 20:11.160
which connectivity you're going to use.

457
20:11.160 --> 20:13.350
Because one thing that we need in vehicles,

458
20:13.350 --> 20:15.870
especially when we're talking about ADAS,

459
20:15.870 --> 20:18.692
is reliability, right?

460
20:18.692 --> 20:21.450
Vehicles are not smartphones on wheels.

461
20:21.450 --> 20:24.960
And honestly, I can't hear people saying that,

462
20:24.960 --> 20:28.614
because vehicles are mission critical devices.

463
20:28.614 --> 20:30.780
If you're using a smartphone

464
20:30.780 --> 20:32.580
and suddenly you have a problem

465
20:32.580 --> 20:34.230
and your screen was frozen,

466
20:34.230 --> 20:35.063
that's fine.

467
20:35.063 --> 20:36.270
You just reset it.

468
20:36.270 --> 20:37.500
If that happens in a car,

469
20:37.500 --> 20:40.110
you are putting the lives of the people inside the car

470
20:40.110 --> 20:42.150
and the people around you at risk.

471
20:42.150 --> 20:44.227
So I think this idea on,

472
20:44.227 --> 20:45.870
"What connectivity should I use?"

473
20:45.870 --> 20:47.940
and of course the optimal cost

474
20:47.940 --> 20:50.130
has to happen in conjunction

475
20:50.130 --> 20:51.120
of all the companies

476
20:51.120 --> 20:53.670
because you need the data from the vehicle as well.

477
20:53.670 --> 20:56.220
You need to understand what kind of functionality

478
20:56.220 --> 20:57.970
is being used and required as well.

479
20:59.130 --> 21:02.730
<v ->All right, maybe Sven in terms of the Ericsson view</v>

480
21:02.730 --> 21:06.030
on this orchestration of the different channels

481
21:06.030 --> 21:08.370
and who best can manage that

482
21:08.370 --> 21:10.140
and how to work around it?

483
21:10.140 --> 21:13.170
<v ->Well, orchestration is a pretty big word</v>

484
21:13.170 --> 21:18.170
and pretty high up in the telecommunication architecture.

485
21:18.270 --> 21:22.380
But I think it's a combination

486
21:22.380 --> 21:24.090
between the CSPs

487
21:24.090 --> 21:27.300
and the satellite network operators

488
21:27.300 --> 21:28.710
that, of course, need to agree

489
21:28.710 --> 21:32.160
what the business and business relation looks.

490
21:32.160 --> 21:36.030
Who sort of owns the customers? Who do you connect with?

491
21:36.030 --> 21:38.070
Is it your standard SIM

492
21:38.070 --> 21:41.280
or is it the dedicated satellite SIM,

493
21:41.280 --> 21:43.410
which is probably not preferred

494
21:43.410 --> 21:44.490
'cause you want to address

495
21:44.490 --> 21:48.090
the hundreds of millions of potential subscribers

496
21:48.090 --> 21:49.047
and cars out there.

497
21:49.047 --> 21:51.814
And then there's another question about

498
21:51.814 --> 21:52.764
the development of,

499
21:53.790 --> 21:56.790
let's call it the orchestration or the beam hoping

500
21:56.790 --> 21:58.320
or the beam forming and everything,

501
21:58.320 --> 22:01.410
which is something that is done depending on the technology,

502
22:01.410 --> 22:06.270
but especially when it goes into 5G, NRM 10

503
22:06.270 --> 22:09.450
and not for IOT, where you have more static beams.

504
22:09.450 --> 22:11.250
It's a very delicate process

505
22:11.250 --> 22:14.910
where you have to make decisions every millisecond

506
22:14.910 --> 22:18.240
and look at your scheduler information,

507
22:18.240 --> 22:19.680
where the actual users are.

508
22:19.680 --> 22:23.760
And there we believe Ericsson is playing a vital role

509
22:23.760 --> 22:25.830
in developing this.

510
22:25.830 --> 22:27.060
<v ->Perfect.</v>

511
22:27.060 --> 22:29.100
Well, let's get the opportunity to the audience

512
22:29.100 --> 22:30.330
to join our conversation.

513
22:30.330 --> 22:33.030
So if there's some questions, I can do two things.

514
22:33.030 --> 22:35.640
I can give you my mic or you speak out loud.

515
22:35.640 --> 22:37.620
So see your question here.

516
22:37.620 --> 22:39.930
So give you my...

517
22:39.930 --> 22:40.763
<v ->Thank you.</v>

518
22:40.763 --> 22:42.000
Yeah, my name is Henry Lubkin,

519
22:42.000 --> 22:43.560
I'm a venture capitalist

520
22:43.560 --> 22:46.050
but many years have been in the car industry,

521
22:46.050 --> 22:48.240
mainly VW and BMW.

522
22:48.240 --> 22:49.180
Now

523
22:51.270 --> 22:52.740
you didn't speak about

524
22:52.740 --> 22:55.290
what is necessary on the car side.

525
22:55.290 --> 22:56.123
On the car side,

526
22:56.123 --> 23:00.491
if you have active faced array connectivity with satellite,

527
23:00.491 --> 23:04.923
you have to bring a terminal somewhere on the roof.

528
23:05.850 --> 23:07.470
It has to be hardware,

529
23:07.470 --> 23:09.390
software wise integrated

530
23:09.390 --> 23:11.670
into the architecture of the vehicle.

531
23:11.670 --> 23:14.890
I don't see really in the car industry

532
23:15.870 --> 23:18.600
that this is pushed hard.

533
23:18.600 --> 23:19.770
They look at it,

534
23:19.770 --> 23:23.640
but they have so many other things on the top of their head

535
23:23.640 --> 23:28.410
that satellite connectivity is not on top of the list

536
23:28.410 --> 23:30.970
as long as G4 and G5

537
23:32.520 --> 23:36.140
kind of sufficiently supplies the connectivity.

538
23:36.140 --> 23:40.350
You know, I see a slowness there.

539
23:40.350 --> 23:42.870
What are you guys thinking about that?

540
23:42.870 --> 23:44.430
How can that be pushed?

541
23:44.430 --> 23:46.170
I think it would be a huge opportunity

542
23:46.170 --> 23:48.240
to connect the cars for sure.

543
23:48.240 --> 23:50.310
But you didn't talk about the car side,

544
23:50.310 --> 23:52.620
which is a big, big step still to go.

545
23:52.620 --> 23:54.810
It takes three, four years, five years

546
23:54.810 --> 23:58.020
to integrate it into a vehicle architecture.

547
23:58.020 --> 23:59.043
<v ->I can take a shot.</v>

548
24:00.600 --> 24:04.653
I mean, the beauty with 5G, for example, or 4G,

549
24:04.653 --> 24:09.450
is that every single device you buy,

550
24:09.450 --> 24:12.060
it is guaranteed to work

551
24:12.060 --> 24:15.720
and it's thoroughly tested for years, I would say,

552
24:15.720 --> 24:16.553
in the lab.

553
24:16.553 --> 24:17.850
So for example, Ericsson,

554
24:17.850 --> 24:21.090
what we call interoperability testing.

555
24:21.090 --> 24:23.700
That means that there is 100% probability

556
24:23.700 --> 24:25.440
that your smartphone will work

557
24:25.440 --> 24:26.970
when you take it out of the box.

558
24:26.970 --> 24:29.640
And the same would go with car devices,

559
24:29.640 --> 24:30.473
but of course,

560
24:30.473 --> 24:34.260
you would have to integrate it physically into the car

561
24:34.260 --> 24:37.680
and you would have to develop phased array technology

562
24:37.680 --> 24:40.440
that is connected to this pretested chip sets

563
24:40.440 --> 24:44.010
that you can get from, well, you know, the big companies.

564
24:44.010 --> 24:47.460
So I think functionality wise,

565
24:47.460 --> 24:50.850
it's a pretty short step to make it work.

566
24:50.850 --> 24:53.820
Then it's a probably bigger challenge, of course,

567
24:53.820 --> 24:56.195
to get the cost, the integration,

568
24:56.195 --> 24:59.190
the beauty factor and everything into the car.

569
24:59.190 --> 25:01.891
But the technology will work, guaranteed,

570
25:01.891 --> 25:04.890
once you have the right satellites up there

571
25:04.890 --> 25:07.533
and you have decided what spectrum to use.

572
25:09.270 --> 25:12.663
<v ->Maybe to add on this, you're talking about cars.</v>

573
25:14.070 --> 25:16.140
My view, also discussions we are having

574
25:16.140 --> 25:21.140
is more on the other type of vehicles, trucks, machinery,

575
25:21.240 --> 25:22.950
which are in regions and areas

576
25:22.950 --> 25:25.950
where there's no terrestrial network available

577
25:25.950 --> 25:28.384
or is a lower quality.

578
25:28.384 --> 25:32.310
And here we have definitely a higher cost/benefit ratio

579
25:32.310 --> 25:34.890
when you're building this into the vehicles.

580
25:34.890 --> 25:35.790
I fully agree with you,

581
25:35.790 --> 25:40.470
I don't see adoption in passenger cars, in vehicles,

582
25:40.470 --> 25:42.030
in the near future.

583
25:42.030 --> 25:45.690
Probably in the next or even the generation afterwards.

584
25:45.690 --> 25:49.800
But for other type of vehicles, that's much more useful

585
25:49.800 --> 25:52.380
and that's where technology will mature

586
25:52.380 --> 25:55.350
and will get them better priced,

587
25:55.350 --> 25:59.793
better, higher reliability, coming into larger fleets.

588
26:01.560 --> 26:02.393
<v ->Indeed, actually ,</v>

589
26:02.393 --> 26:05.370
this is something where for us,

590
26:05.370 --> 26:07.057
in the market especially for IOT,

591
26:07.949 --> 26:10.650
we had to come up with kind of temporary solution

592
26:10.650 --> 26:14.970
of devices that could be integrated at the vehicle,

593
26:14.970 --> 26:16.230
like using cameras or whatever,

594
26:16.230 --> 26:18.900
which also have the antenna inside

595
26:18.900 --> 26:20.250
in order to bridge the time

596
26:20.250 --> 26:23.580
until the car manufacturer will start standardizing

597
26:23.580 --> 26:25.500
or having that in.

598
26:25.500 --> 26:26.910
But it also creates, like,

599
26:26.910 --> 26:29.610
there are a lot of value added resellers today

600
26:29.610 --> 26:32.850
creating such tracking devices or whatever

601
26:32.850 --> 26:36.067
in the ecosystem to provide that service.

602
26:36.067 --> 26:37.260
And indeed, as you said,

603
26:37.260 --> 26:39.540
it depends also a lot on the use case of the spectrum

604
26:39.540 --> 26:41.340
because for example, we use the S-band,

605
26:41.340 --> 26:42.540
the two gigahertz,

606
26:42.540 --> 26:44.190
and even we know it's like,

607
26:44.190 --> 26:48.780
even inside the car, you would still get coverage

608
26:48.780 --> 26:52.140
and with LEO, since you're coming from different angles,

609
26:52.140 --> 26:54.187
you would capture the satellite

610
26:54.187 --> 26:57.180
compared like, with geo where you need to be pointing

611
26:57.180 --> 26:59.610
or you need to have very advanced beam forming.

612
26:59.610 --> 27:00.630
But of course that's more

613
27:00.630 --> 27:03.090
for narrow band IOT applications,

614
27:03.090 --> 27:08.090
not like continuous streaming or broadband applications.

615
27:08.474 --> 27:10.598
<v ->You can always roll down the window.</v>

616
27:10.598 --> 27:11.945
<v ->Yeah.</v>

617
27:11.945 --> 27:13.170
<v ->Just to add to this,</v>

618
27:13.170 --> 27:17.280
I think usually when we are having technical conversations,

619
27:17.280 --> 27:22.280
unfortunately, business models is often not addressed.

620
27:22.410 --> 27:26.370
So when we look at the commercial vehicle segment,

621
27:26.370 --> 27:29.520
the business model is often very clear

622
27:29.520 --> 27:32.400
because you can directly either monetize it

623
27:32.400 --> 27:34.230
or you can save costs.

624
27:34.230 --> 27:36.480
So the adoption is much easier,

625
27:36.480 --> 27:38.310
but if you look at the private vehicles,

626
27:38.310 --> 27:40.080
it's a bit more complicated.

627
27:40.080 --> 27:43.284
And quite frankly, it has been very difficult

628
27:43.284 --> 27:48.180
to monetize connectivity in private vehicles so far.

629
27:48.180 --> 27:50.585
I'm sorry, but you guys know. (laughs)

630
27:50.585 --> 27:53.550
It's not like it has a high adoption,

631
27:53.550 --> 27:55.740
and in my opinion,

632
27:55.740 --> 28:00.030
it's because the business model so far has been incorrect.

633
28:00.030 --> 28:01.290
I don't think you need to,

634
28:01.290 --> 28:03.360
you should ask the final customer

635
28:03.360 --> 28:04.860
to pay for connectivity.

636
28:04.860 --> 28:06.930
For me, that doesn't make any sense.

637
28:06.930 --> 28:11.930
Think about how many drivers don't have a phone

638
28:12.060 --> 28:15.390
and are not already paying for data in their phones.

639
28:15.390 --> 28:16.927
So then suddenly you were saying,

640
28:16.927 --> 28:19.590
"Oh, why don't you pay again?"

641
28:19.590 --> 28:21.360
And what are you gaining from that?

642
28:21.360 --> 28:24.030
So what what we have to do is actually,

643
28:24.030 --> 28:25.050
we have the tech.

644
28:25.050 --> 28:25.883
Look at this,

645
28:25.883 --> 28:27.900
we have several companies offering the tech,

646
28:27.900 --> 28:30.157
but actually what we have to think is,

647
28:30.157 --> 28:33.030
"What am I offering to my customer?"

648
28:33.030 --> 28:35.670
Consumer pays for value.

649
28:35.670 --> 28:37.620
I'm not gonna pay for connectivity

650
28:37.620 --> 28:40.800
because I don't see value in paying for connectivity.

651
28:40.800 --> 28:44.730
But if my car is offering a functionality

652
28:44.730 --> 28:46.560
that adds value for me.

653
28:46.560 --> 28:49.560
so if my car, if the company that,

654
28:49.560 --> 28:52.170
I dunno, if I'm driving a BMW

655
28:52.170 --> 28:54.090
and I have a feature that updates

656
28:54.090 --> 28:58.980
and upgrades my parking feature, for example,

657
28:58.980 --> 29:01.470
and suddenly I buy my vehicle,

658
29:01.470 --> 29:04.740
my vehicle is capable of semi-automated driving, right?

659
29:04.740 --> 29:08.400
So the wheel moves and I have to use the actuators,

660
29:08.400 --> 29:11.490
but then six months later I have an update,

661
29:11.490 --> 29:16.140
and my car is capable of fully automated driving.

662
29:16.140 --> 29:18.780
The car didn't change, the sensors didn't change,

663
29:18.780 --> 29:20.640
but now I don't have to do anything

664
29:20.640 --> 29:22.950
and the car parks and I just watch it.

665
29:22.950 --> 29:25.088
Six months later, I get an update

666
29:25.088 --> 29:28.950
and I can park my car a few meters away

667
29:28.950 --> 29:30.540
from the parking space.

668
29:30.540 --> 29:33.780
I leave my car, I use my phone, I press a button,

669
29:33.780 --> 29:35.520
the car goes and parks itself

670
29:35.520 --> 29:36.903
and I can summon the car.

671
29:37.770 --> 29:39.630
I would pay for that.

672
29:39.630 --> 29:41.340
Connectivity is embedded in this

673
29:41.340 --> 29:44.790
because the OEM will have to have some level of connectivity

674
29:44.790 --> 29:48.360
to change this functionality over the air.

675
29:48.360 --> 29:51.720
But I'm not paying for connectivity, I'm paying for value.

676
29:51.720 --> 29:52.553
And this is, I think,

677
29:52.553 --> 29:54.210
something that we should be discussing.

678
29:54.210 --> 29:55.320
What is the value

679
29:55.320 --> 29:58.200
the satellite is going to add to the customer?

680
29:58.200 --> 30:00.150
And if it is adding value,

681
30:00.150 --> 30:03.480
then increasing the bill of materials of the vehicle,

682
30:03.480 --> 30:06.810
it's okay, it's something that you have to deal with

683
30:06.810 --> 30:09.393
because you're going to monetize in another way.

684
30:10.410 --> 30:11.820
<v ->And maybe Kieran,</v>

685
30:11.820 --> 30:13.890
can you maybe talk about how you view

686
30:13.890 --> 30:15.870
or from your discussion with OEM side,

687
30:15.870 --> 30:19.710
kind of the benefits of the software defined car?

688
30:19.710 --> 30:21.409
Let's maybe start there

689
30:21.409 --> 30:22.699
and you know,

690
30:22.699 --> 30:25.860
because we still talk about relatively limited adoption,

691
30:25.860 --> 30:27.450
is then the benefits versus the cost

692
30:27.450 --> 30:29.820
not kind of adding up at this point?

693
30:29.820 --> 30:32.160
<v ->I think it's already been mentioned by yourself as well.</v>

694
30:32.160 --> 30:33.540
I think the OEMs are faced with

695
30:33.540 --> 30:35.220
a lot of transition and transformation.

696
30:35.220 --> 30:37.470
So there's, of course, the shift now towards BEV,

697
30:37.470 --> 30:38.430
which they've had to handle.

698
30:38.430 --> 30:40.530
Now there's the hype around SDV.

699
30:40.530 --> 30:41.850
It's delayed,

700
30:41.850 --> 30:45.570
the adoption is not there, it should be there.

701
30:45.570 --> 30:47.937
Then there's now the requirements for cybersecurity.

702
30:47.937 --> 30:50.070
And also infotainment as well.

703
30:50.070 --> 30:51.300
I think also in the future,

704
30:51.300 --> 30:52.875
it was also mentioned by some of the colleagues,

705
30:52.875 --> 30:56.940
it's no point looking at it individual technology

706
30:56.940 --> 30:58.230
by technology by technology

707
30:58.230 --> 31:02.130
because bringing the technology is not so difficult.

708
31:02.130 --> 31:04.410
There's always an interaction of the dependencies on this.

709
31:04.410 --> 31:07.140
So there will be a big dependency on the infotainment

710
31:07.140 --> 31:08.910
with the ADAS, et cetera.

711
31:08.910 --> 31:10.680
And we already see that the OEMs,

712
31:10.680 --> 31:12.690
with the transitions that they're faced with now,

713
31:12.690 --> 31:14.910
are already struggling on the system level.

714
31:14.910 --> 31:17.430
So when you design these features,

715
31:17.430 --> 31:19.740
you don't really think about how to test and validate them.

716
31:19.740 --> 31:21.000
And this is underestimated.

717
31:21.000 --> 31:24.270
Then it's not easy in a global market

718
31:24.270 --> 31:25.830
for automotive manufacturers.

719
31:25.830 --> 31:26.790
So you have to,

720
31:26.790 --> 31:28.230
you have one market

721
31:28.230 --> 31:30.720
and then you have to adopt this for other markets.

722
31:30.720 --> 31:32.430
It may be simple things like road signs,

723
31:32.430 --> 31:33.930
behaviors, whatever.

724
31:33.930 --> 31:34.950
And this is estimated

725
31:34.950 --> 31:37.590
it can also take about 40% additional efforts

726
31:37.590 --> 31:38.850
just for this adoption.

727
31:38.850 --> 31:43.560
So I agree that the technology is one thing,

728
31:43.560 --> 31:44.730
but we need to be looking at it

729
31:44.730 --> 31:48.030
more on the system complexity and the system integration.

730
31:48.030 --> 31:49.500
And if we already look at the market,

731
31:49.500 --> 31:52.020
we can see some OEMs already struggling with this, you know?

732
31:52.020 --> 31:54.060
There's already significant delays.

733
31:54.060 --> 31:56.790
They're canceling vehicles by 12 months

734
31:56.790 --> 31:58.320
and basically, it's the same message.

735
31:58.320 --> 32:00.150
It's around software integration issues.

736
32:00.150 --> 32:02.310
This is what they're currently struggling with.

737
32:02.310 --> 32:03.930
And so I think going forward,

738
32:03.930 --> 32:06.750
it's not so much the technology on its own,

739
32:06.750 --> 32:09.810
it's, we need to have a bigger, wider understanding

740
32:09.810 --> 32:12.840
on how this completely operates as a complete system

741
32:12.840 --> 32:14.550
and then, importantly, how to test this

742
32:14.550 --> 32:16.320
and validate it in the most efficient way

743
32:16.320 --> 32:17.940
that it can be brought into more stream

744
32:17.940 --> 32:19.383
and released to the market.

745
32:20.460 --> 32:22.110
<v ->May I add to this?</v>

746
32:22.110 --> 32:23.970
So you mentioned system integration.

747
32:23.970 --> 32:27.000
I would go even one step further into operations,

748
32:27.000 --> 32:27.930
fleet operations.

749
32:27.930 --> 32:29.940
Because once this is out in the market,

750
32:29.940 --> 32:33.420
it's there for 10 years, 10 plus years.

751
32:33.420 --> 32:35.460
You have to do the upgrades.

752
32:35.460 --> 32:36.600
Someone has to pay for it.

753
32:36.600 --> 32:39.687
The consumer typical will not pay for it.

754
32:39.687 --> 32:44.100
So there are continued costs on it and we see it.

755
32:44.100 --> 32:46.513
We operate fleets for OEMs

756
32:46.513 --> 32:48.690
and there's a a tremendous effort

757
32:48.690 --> 32:52.650
in managing the software, security updates,

758
32:52.650 --> 32:54.480
whatever needs to be done,

759
32:54.480 --> 32:57.870
roll it out and keep it operating for long period of time.

760
32:57.870 --> 33:00.240
And 10 years means two, three,

761
33:00.240 --> 33:02.040
even four technology generations.

762
33:02.040 --> 33:04.050
So where change is happening,

763
33:04.050 --> 33:06.540
that's where standardization is such important

764
33:06.540 --> 33:09.073
that you don't have to change every other day.

765
33:09.073 --> 33:11.070
But that's where the complexity is coming from.

766
33:11.070 --> 33:14.520
It's not the initial technology introduction,

767
33:14.520 --> 33:17.010
it's getting it out, get it integrated,

768
33:17.010 --> 33:17.843
get it rollout,

769
33:17.843 --> 33:20.853
get it into different regulatory,

770
33:21.720 --> 33:23.670
regional regulatory requirements

771
33:23.670 --> 33:25.350
and then operate over time.

772
33:25.350 --> 33:27.480
So that's where the big cost's coming from.

773
33:27.480 --> 33:28.410
<v ->Okay, good.</v>

774
33:28.410 --> 33:31.440
All right, let me see if there's other audience questions.

775
33:31.440 --> 33:35.681
If you have a question please raise your hand.

776
33:35.681 --> 33:38.460
I'll try to see.

777
33:38.460 --> 33:39.293
You are, okay.
(panelists chuckling)

778
33:39.293 --> 33:40.680
Well, it was a good question.

779
33:40.680 --> 33:43.323
I'll allow a second unless, oh no, sure.

780
33:51.870 --> 33:53.760
<v Woman>Thank you. I arrived a little late.</v>

781
33:53.760 --> 33:54.720
So I do apologize

782
33:54.720 --> 33:57.540
if this controversial topic has already been brought up.

783
33:57.540 --> 33:59.910
But if you can share with me what is your,

784
33:59.910 --> 34:03.570
for each of you that would like to respond to this,

785
34:03.570 --> 34:05.130
what is the worst case scenario

786
34:05.130 --> 34:06.660
and what is the best case scenario for you

787
34:06.660 --> 34:11.580
as it relates to Elon's vertically integrated possibility

788
34:11.580 --> 34:14.133
with Tesla and SpaceX and Starlink?

789
34:19.470 --> 34:20.303
<v ->Okay, let me start.</v>

790
34:20.303 --> 34:23.100
So we are,

791
34:23.100 --> 34:24.810
from the type of business we are doing,

792
34:24.810 --> 34:29.100
as Deutsche Telecom and T-Systems operations perspective,

793
34:29.100 --> 34:31.800
it's another partner in the market.

794
34:31.800 --> 34:35.220
So there's a partnership of T-Mobile US and SpaceX.

795
34:35.220 --> 34:36.053
So as an example.

796
34:36.053 --> 34:39.750
So it happens also for other market components

797
34:39.750 --> 34:40.743
or sub-markets.

798
34:41.580 --> 34:44.490
So I think of this market or this whole topic

799
34:44.490 --> 34:47.640
we are talking about, SDV, as a collaboration market.

800
34:47.640 --> 34:50.310
Obviously there are some companies, entities

801
34:50.310 --> 34:52.110
which are very innovative

802
34:52.110 --> 34:55.200
and bring things into the market, disrupt the market.

803
34:55.200 --> 34:56.460
I personally would say it's good

804
34:56.460 --> 34:57.930
because then something is happening,

805
34:57.930 --> 34:59.370
I don't see it as a threat.

806
34:59.370 --> 35:01.020
It's something which develops us

807
35:01.020 --> 35:02.770
and challenge us from time to time.

808
35:05.580 --> 35:07.350
<v ->I completely agree.</v>

809
35:07.350 --> 35:08.643
I think we should,

810
35:09.660 --> 35:11.320
technology has to evolve

811
35:14.549 --> 35:17.820
and you know, regardless of all the polemic,

812
35:17.820 --> 35:21.210
we are just talking about software defined vehicles today

813
35:21.210 --> 35:23.313
because of Tesla, right?

814
35:25.700 --> 35:28.620
Of course, if it wasn't them, it would be someone else.

815
35:28.620 --> 35:32.250
But what I'm trying to say is, we can't stop innovation

816
35:32.250 --> 35:35.640
and innovation only happens vertically

817
35:35.640 --> 35:36.920
when you don't have an ecosystem.

818
35:36.920 --> 35:38.790
'Cause it's the same thing

819
35:38.790 --> 35:41.340
with the software defined vehicle architecture.

820
35:41.340 --> 35:45.870
The reason why Tesla is completely vertically integrated

821
35:45.870 --> 35:48.060
in the whole vehicle architecture

822
35:48.060 --> 35:50.070
is because there wasn't an ecosystem,

823
35:50.070 --> 35:51.780
because quite frankly it's much cheaper

824
35:51.780 --> 35:52.620
to just buy technology

825
35:52.620 --> 35:54.720
that you were not an expert in

826
35:54.720 --> 35:58.110
than developing your own, right?

827
35:58.110 --> 36:02.430
So again, if they do this, we may grow a market

828
36:02.430 --> 36:04.170
that we're gonna have more suppliers

829
36:04.170 --> 36:05.490
and the market's going to grow.

830
36:05.490 --> 36:06.783
So it's good.

831
36:10.320 --> 36:13.083
<v ->All right, good question. Good question.</v>

832
36:15.019 --> 36:17.100
I'm not sure my mic is on.

833
36:17.100 --> 36:18.120
We have a few more minutes.

834
36:18.120 --> 36:21.030
Let me just see if there's any other questions here.

835
36:21.030 --> 36:21.863
Speak loud.

836
36:23.910 --> 36:24.912
Good.

837
36:24.912 --> 36:25.745
I think we can maybe leave it

838
36:25.745 --> 36:27.423
to the last question.

839
36:28.740 --> 36:30.420
Before that, I just want to go back to the Tesla.

840
36:30.420 --> 36:31.470
It's actually an interesting point

841
36:31.470 --> 36:32.550
if you just think about it,

842
36:32.550 --> 36:33.383
where they are today,

843
36:33.383 --> 36:35.370
SpaceX and Starlink,

844
36:35.370 --> 36:37.470
so they offer a lot of different markets.

845
36:37.470 --> 36:39.300
They're offering kind of the broadband connectivity,

846
36:39.300 --> 36:42.930
but connectivity to the car is not at a broadband level.

847
36:42.930 --> 36:45.690
So clearly from their perspective as well,

848
36:45.690 --> 36:47.490
it has not been a primary use case.

849
36:47.490 --> 36:50.160
When this new satellite constellation come into the market,

850
36:50.160 --> 36:52.440
will be interesting to see how they move forward.

851
36:52.440 --> 36:54.780
But you know, that was actually really well related

852
36:54.780 --> 36:55.620
to my last question,

853
36:55.620 --> 36:58.770
'cause we covered a lot of topics about business case,

854
36:58.770 --> 37:01.920
affordability, technical challenges,

855
37:01.920 --> 37:05.130
but is there anything that we didn't discuss

856
37:05.130 --> 37:08.210
so far in the topic of software defined vehicles,

857
37:08.210 --> 37:10.890
in the topic of connected cars

858
37:10.890 --> 37:12.870
that you know, we should be discussing

859
37:12.870 --> 37:15.300
and you want to do a quick pitch about it

860
37:15.300 --> 37:17.010
in the last two and a half minutes we have?

861
37:17.010 --> 37:21.030
So anyone that wants to go first to highlight something

862
37:21.030 --> 37:22.912
or just summarize a key takeaway,

863
37:22.912 --> 37:24.780
that's also allowed, but...

864
37:24.780 --> 37:25.613
<v ->Maybe I start.</v>

865
37:25.613 --> 37:29.010
So just, I think, if we want the adoption to speed up,

866
37:29.010 --> 37:31.080
I think it's already kinda been mentioned,

867
37:31.080 --> 37:34.296
there needs to be kind of a more open architecture.

868
37:34.296 --> 37:36.180
And more collaboration.

869
37:36.180 --> 37:38.100
I think without this,

870
37:38.100 --> 37:40.290
we can bring a certain level of standardization, et cetera,

871
37:40.290 --> 37:41.520
but to really speed it up

872
37:41.520 --> 37:43.710
and bring more mass adoption,

873
37:43.710 --> 37:44.730
we really should be looking

874
37:44.730 --> 37:46.640
for a kind of more open architecture

875
37:46.640 --> 37:48.240
and a more joint collaboration,

876
37:48.240 --> 37:49.920
which maybe hasn't been that prevalent

877
37:49.920 --> 37:51.600
in the automotive industry previously.

878
37:51.600 --> 37:53.943
So I think this would be for me.

879
37:54.810 --> 37:56.310
<v ->Yeah, I see automotive</v>

880
37:56.310 --> 38:00.960
as one of the really driving use segments

881
38:00.960 --> 38:05.220
and really the need of having one technology that is common

882
38:05.220 --> 38:08.160
between the normal way of operating,

883
38:08.160 --> 38:11.790
which is the terrestrial networks, good cost,

884
38:11.790 --> 38:13.740
good through-puts and everything,

885
38:13.740 --> 38:18.400
complemented with what you can call auto coverage services

886
38:19.890 --> 38:22.587
with the same kind of basic technology

887
38:22.587 --> 38:26.430
that doesn't drive additional cost,

888
38:26.430 --> 38:31.430
which is a disadvantage with Starlink and Tesla,

889
38:31.740 --> 38:32.823
of course, currently.

890
38:34.680 --> 38:36.090
<v ->I think one thing we could do</v>

891
38:36.090 --> 38:39.070
to accelerate also the timeline of adoption

892
38:40.992 --> 38:43.020
of connectivity over satellites for cars

893
38:43.020 --> 38:45.150
is harmonization on spectrum,

894
38:45.150 --> 38:48.180
because this is a very critical point.

895
38:48.180 --> 38:51.031
There will be a lot of regulatory aspects there.

896
38:51.031 --> 38:53.670
The access to spectrum is different

897
38:53.670 --> 38:54.750
from region to region,

898
38:54.750 --> 38:58.530
and now on I2 level on WRC,

899
38:58.530 --> 38:59.550
this is being harmonized,

900
38:59.550 --> 39:02.040
but until it's adopted in all countries,

901
39:02.040 --> 39:04.290
until the operators have the access

902
39:04.290 --> 39:06.720
to provide such global coverage in every country,

903
39:06.720 --> 39:07.710
it's gonna take time.

904
39:07.710 --> 39:11.040
But also, it requires also continuous discussion

905
39:11.040 --> 39:14.820
with the OEMs and the chip makers and the telcos also

906
39:14.820 --> 39:17.070
in order to have, in the end,

907
39:17.070 --> 39:20.580
global connectivity everywhere over satellite

908
39:20.580 --> 39:23.003
because you don't want to end up

909
39:23.003 --> 39:24.600
with very complex antennas that cover different bands

910
39:24.600 --> 39:25.980
in different regions,

911
39:25.980 --> 39:27.270
and you wanna have, like,

912
39:27.270 --> 39:29.280
only a few bands that are standardized

913
39:29.280 --> 39:31.473
for vehicle connectivity over satellite.

914
39:34.170 --> 39:35.420
<v ->Maybe one thought here.</v>

915
39:36.600 --> 39:39.420
Software defined vehicle and the whole industry

916
39:39.420 --> 39:41.280
should also look to other industries.

917
39:41.280 --> 39:42.990
So it's not the first industry

918
39:42.990 --> 39:45.780
where software defined is a common term.

919
39:45.780 --> 39:50.010
So software defined networks is at least 10 plus years old.

920
39:50.010 --> 39:52.530
And there are a lot of learnings, from my point of view,

921
39:52.530 --> 39:55.440
from software defined networks to software defined vehicles.

922
39:55.440 --> 39:57.600
Standardization's one, open source is one.

923
39:57.600 --> 39:59.608
So you don't have to reinvent the wheel

924
39:59.608 --> 40:00.990
again and again and again

925
40:00.990 --> 40:03.240
and build your own operating system.

926
40:03.240 --> 40:06.190
So there are a lot of stuff which can be shared

927
40:07.063 --> 40:09.330
and have a common ground.

928
40:09.330 --> 40:12.510
And this is probably also a thought

929
40:12.510 --> 40:13.830
which helps us

930
40:13.830 --> 40:16.867
for the next one or two generations in SDVs.

931
40:16.867 --> 40:19.773
<v ->Do I have time to end on a polemic note?</v>

932
40:20.730 --> 40:23.280
First thing, I think satellite connectivity

933
40:23.280 --> 40:27.150
should be positioned in what it does best.

934
40:27.150 --> 40:28.740
I don't think it will replace

935
40:28.740 --> 40:30.840
any other kind of connectivity.

936
40:30.840 --> 40:31.890
It's going to be used

937
40:31.890 --> 40:34.470
when you don't have other connectivity available.

938
40:34.470 --> 40:37.170
And some of the use cases that I heard in here,

939
40:37.170 --> 40:40.770
they require high bandwidth, they require low latency,

940
40:40.770 --> 40:43.050
they require reliability.

941
40:43.050 --> 40:46.010
Will satellite be able to deliver that

942
40:46.010 --> 40:48.363
to the automotive grade level?

943
40:49.680 --> 40:51.270
I dunno.

944
40:51.270 --> 40:54.810
Second point, the business case for connectivity

945
40:54.810 --> 40:59.430
has been incorrect for a long time in automotive.

946
40:59.430 --> 41:01.890
This has happened with satellite connectivity,

947
41:01.890 --> 41:04.020
this has happened with V2X

948
41:04.020 --> 41:06.870
and it could happen with satellites connectivity

949
41:06.870 --> 41:08.460
if we don't do things differently.

950
41:08.460 --> 41:10.110
If you keep doing the same things,

951
41:10.110 --> 41:11.970
you can't expect different results.

952
41:11.970 --> 41:14.570
And I think this is an opportunity to change things.

953
41:15.864 --> 41:16.890
<v ->All right, thank you very much.</v>

954
41:16.890 --> 41:18.000
That sums up very well.

955
41:18.000 --> 41:19.290
There's still a lot of things to do,

956
41:19.290 --> 41:21.300
a lot of work to do for all of us,

957
41:21.300 --> 41:22.410
but I think, you know,

958
41:22.410 --> 41:25.020
definitely, the value is recognized.

959
41:25.020 --> 41:27.619
Please join me in thanking the panelists.

960
41:27.619 --> 41:29.774
