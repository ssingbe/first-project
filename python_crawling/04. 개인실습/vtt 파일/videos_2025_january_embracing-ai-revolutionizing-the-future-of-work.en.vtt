00:00.397 --> 00:03.480
(upbeat music plays)

2
00:10.530 --> 00:12.060
<v ->Okay, welcome everyone.</v>

3
00:12.060 --> 00:13.740
My name is Tom Andriola.

4
00:13.740 --> 00:16.050
I am the Chief Digital Officer at UC Irvine

5
00:16.050 --> 00:17.550
in Southern California,

6
00:17.550 --> 00:20.223
and I'll be your moderator for today.

7
00:21.270 --> 00:22.800
First of all, I'd just like to recognize,

8
00:22.800 --> 00:25.080
if any of you have families that are impacted

9
00:25.080 --> 00:26.040
in Southern California,

10
00:26.040 --> 00:28.380
we send our thoughts and prayers to you.

11
00:28.380 --> 00:30.570
It's a really challenging time.

12
00:30.570 --> 00:32.040
My family's not directly impacted,

13
00:32.040 --> 00:35.130
but I've been talking to family members who are,

14
00:35.130 --> 00:38.610
and you know, we just send our thoughts and prayers to them.

15
00:38.610 --> 00:41.280
We've got a very interesting panel for you today.

16
00:41.280 --> 00:44.977
And, you know, the name of this show should probably be

17
00:44.977 --> 00:48.450
"AI Everywhere, Everything, All the Time"

18
00:48.450 --> 00:50.250
'cause you couldn't walk through the hall

19
00:50.250 --> 00:54.480
without seeing everyone talking about AI.

20
00:54.480 --> 00:56.610
But if you get past the hype

21
00:56.610 --> 00:58.170
and you really think about, you know,

22
00:58.170 --> 00:59.520
what people are talking about

23
00:59.520 --> 01:04.290
is we have been introduced to a exciting set of new tools

24
01:04.290 --> 01:07.890
that are giving us the opportunity to rethink

25
01:07.890 --> 01:10.560
how we do our work, which means we have

26
01:10.560 --> 01:12.240
to think about the people who do that work

27
01:12.240 --> 01:15.390
and what is their relationship to these tools.

28
01:15.390 --> 01:17.190
And so, what we've put together today

29
01:17.190 --> 01:20.610
is a really exciting panel for you to explore this,

30
01:20.610 --> 01:23.370
where we're going to let them answer some questions

31
01:23.370 --> 01:25.050
and then take some of your questions at the end

32
01:25.050 --> 01:28.320
in terms of what does the future of work look like

33
01:28.320 --> 01:31.860
in an era where we all have access to these tools

34
01:31.860 --> 01:35.520
and an opportunity to rethink the work that we do

35
01:35.520 --> 01:37.260
and the way that we interact with each other?

36
01:37.260 --> 01:39.360
So that's what we're gonna explore today.

37
01:39.360 --> 01:42.000
I would like to introduce our panelists real quick,

38
01:42.000 --> 01:44.310
and in their answers they'll talk a little bit

39
01:44.310 --> 01:45.420
about their backgrounds.

40
01:45.420 --> 01:48.060
Claire Shapiro, Director of Innovation and Insights

41
01:48.060 --> 01:49.533
and Strategy at Visa.

42
01:50.610 --> 01:53.550
Loretta Li-Sevilla... Sevilla?

43
01:53.550 --> 01:55.260
Sevilla, thank you.

44
01:55.260 --> 01:57.873
Global Head of Future of Work at HP.

45
01:58.800 --> 02:03.420
Julia Alexander, co-founder and Chief Product Officer

46
02:03.420 --> 02:05.070
at Exec Online.

47
02:05.070 --> 02:07.290
And Daniel Drellich, senior Vice President

48
02:07.290 --> 02:10.290
of Business Partnering and head of HR at EMD Electronics.

49
02:10.290 --> 02:12.480
Thank you all for being here with us today.

50
02:12.480 --> 02:14.760
Okay, so we're gonna start you off with a little bit

51
02:14.760 --> 02:17.730
of a softball question, and allow each of you to answer

52
02:17.730 --> 02:19.800
from your own perspectives and industries,

53
02:19.800 --> 02:23.400
which is, you know, what is AI's impact on the workforce

54
02:23.400 --> 02:25.650
as you're seeing it today,

55
02:25.650 --> 02:27.620
and how are you thinking about it in terms

56
02:27.620 --> 02:31.470
of your role helping your organization navigate forward?

57
02:31.470 --> 02:32.970
So, Claire, we'll start with you.

58
02:32.970 --> 02:34.800
<v ->Sure, thanks, Tom.</v>

59
02:34.800 --> 02:38.100
So, at Visa in our innovation space,

60
02:38.100 --> 02:40.740
we're really looking at how to bring new technology

61
02:40.740 --> 02:43.320
to create new value for our customers,

62
02:43.320 --> 02:46.110
but also to improve processes

63
02:46.110 --> 02:50.160
and just work better as a company, as a workforce.

64
02:50.160 --> 02:51.990
So, in terms of the financial space,

65
02:51.990 --> 02:54.630
there's a lot going on in AI.

66
02:54.630 --> 02:59.010
We're seeing a lot in fraud, fraud mitigation.

67
02:59.010 --> 03:02.010
It's estimated that there'll be $5 trillion

68
03:02.010 --> 03:04.500
of financial fraud annually.

69
03:04.500 --> 03:07.470
And anything we can do to continue

70
03:07.470 --> 03:11.640
to be smarter about fraud, we are doing with AI.

71
03:11.640 --> 03:13.590
We also are thinking about

72
03:13.590 --> 03:17.460
how the commerce value chain is completely changing

73
03:17.460 --> 03:20.441
with how people buy and purchase.

74
03:20.441 --> 03:23.040
And that might mean us totally rethinking

75
03:23.040 --> 03:26.430
how we support our customers, our issuers, our acquirers,

76
03:26.430 --> 03:29.730
and our merchants, and internally how we work.

77
03:29.730 --> 03:33.480
I mean, Visa, we have a lot of focus on our relationships

78
03:33.480 --> 03:35.040
and a lot of clients,

79
03:35.040 --> 03:37.530
and thinking about how we can better serve our clients

80
03:37.530 --> 03:39.780
through sales channels with AI.

81
03:39.780 --> 03:43.050
So, we're seeing a lot across the board, both internally

82
03:43.050 --> 03:46.233
and how we work better, as well as externally.

83
03:47.700 --> 03:49.560
<v ->Loretta, how about at HP?</v>

84
03:49.560 --> 03:53.760
<v ->Yes, so, a significant transformation that's happening,</v>

85
03:53.760 --> 03:58.260
both internal to HP of how do we take a look

86
03:58.260 --> 04:00.870
at different types of roles and job functions.

87
04:00.870 --> 04:02.520
There are certain types of roles

88
04:02.520 --> 04:05.460
that might transform faster than others,

89
04:05.460 --> 04:07.920
and then also what do we do externally

90
04:07.920 --> 04:11.040
for our customers, to be prepared?

91
04:11.040 --> 04:14.670
We think about use cases in three types of areas.

92
04:14.670 --> 04:18.240
First is we see AI as being able

93
04:18.240 --> 04:21.690
to eliminate non-productive work, right?

94
04:21.690 --> 04:24.720
So if you think about those types of tasks

95
04:24.720 --> 04:29.493
like writing meeting minutes, action items,

96
04:30.330 --> 04:34.650
you know, being able to send transcripts out

97
04:34.650 --> 04:36.182
and things like that.

98
04:36.182 --> 04:39.270
Those are now things that can be done by AI,

99
04:39.270 --> 04:43.290
so you can spend time to do things that have more value.

100
04:43.290 --> 04:47.460
The second kind of category is around being able

101
04:47.460 --> 04:50.790
to make those important tasks more efficient.

102
04:50.790 --> 04:55.380
So, if you think about marketing and creative professionals,

103
04:55.380 --> 04:58.260
that the amount of time... Time is money, right?

104
04:58.260 --> 05:01.710
For them to create images, videos, music.

105
05:01.710 --> 05:05.280
So that can be done much more effectively and efficiently.

106
05:05.280 --> 05:10.280
And the third is around creating superpowers, right?

107
05:10.470 --> 05:13.140
So things that never could've been done before.

108
05:13.140 --> 05:18.140
So you think about live foreign language translation, right?

109
05:18.780 --> 05:21.300
You know, I speak, sorry to say this,

110
05:21.300 --> 05:23.730
but I only speak one language, English.

111
05:23.730 --> 05:26.310
And so, for me to be able to communicate

112
05:26.310 --> 05:29.310
with all the people around the world

113
05:29.310 --> 05:32.250
is really significant, is a new superpower for me.

114
05:32.250 --> 05:35.130
And something that is actually really exciting

115
05:35.130 --> 05:38.190
is actually seeing how communication

116
05:38.190 --> 05:41.550
and accessibility is coming to play too,

117
05:41.550 --> 05:46.020
because there's some new software that actually translates

118
05:46.020 --> 05:49.740
from American Sign Language to text, right?

119
05:49.740 --> 05:52.530
And so, all of a sudden we see this kind of bridging

120
05:52.530 --> 05:54.660
of the digital divide, which is super exciting.

121
05:54.660 --> 05:58.140
<v ->Yeah, I saw an interesting, it was live transcription</v>

122
05:58.140 --> 06:01.530
inside the glasses, in one of the booths that I saw today.

123
06:01.530 --> 06:03.570
Julia, you've been involved in executive education

124
06:03.570 --> 06:04.770
at Exec Online.

125
06:04.770 --> 06:07.860
What are you seeing from the perspective that you have?

126
06:07.860 --> 06:09.870
<v ->Great, thanks Tom, and hello everyone.</v>

127
06:09.870 --> 06:12.570
It's really great to be back here at CES,

128
06:12.570 --> 06:16.170
really one of my favorite ways to kick off a year.

129
06:16.170 --> 06:17.970
I am the co-founder of Exec Online.

130
06:17.970 --> 06:20.130
It's an online leadership development platform

131
06:20.130 --> 06:22.620
that partners with the world's top business schools

132
06:22.620 --> 06:26.250
and Fortune 500, Global 2000 organizations everywhere

133
06:26.250 --> 06:29.940
to uplevel leadership, development and management.

134
06:29.940 --> 06:31.710
And so, it's an exciting time.

135
06:31.710 --> 06:34.050
On this stage last year, I had the privilege

136
06:34.050 --> 06:36.240
of announcing a groundbreaking collaboration

137
06:36.240 --> 06:39.810
between Exec online and Amazon Web Services,

138
06:39.810 --> 06:42.900
AWS's generative AI innovation center.

139
06:42.900 --> 06:43.733
And this year,

140
06:43.733 --> 06:45.270
we're really thinking about how does this all work?

141
06:45.270 --> 06:46.920
How does it all come together?

142
06:46.920 --> 06:49.380
And we're really at this incredible liminal moment,

143
06:49.380 --> 06:52.050
this sort of in-between space that I think makes

144
06:52.050 --> 06:54.930
some of the juice of being alive really, really great.

145
06:54.930 --> 06:57.330
And Exec Online data really shows that

146
06:57.330 --> 07:01.740
on the more open opportunity perspective,

147
07:01.740 --> 07:04.710
only 5% of organizations that we have surveyed

148
07:04.710 --> 07:06.930
say that they have the skills and the workforce

149
07:06.930 --> 07:09.660
that they will need for this next phase.

150
07:09.660 --> 07:12.450
So there's a huge gap between where we are

151
07:12.450 --> 07:14.220
and where we want to be,

152
07:14.220 --> 07:15.870
even if it's not entirely clear

153
07:15.870 --> 07:17.700
exactly where that's going to go.

154
07:17.700 --> 07:20.880
On the other hand, when you survey the leaders

155
07:20.880 --> 07:22.770
that go through the Exec Online platform,

156
07:22.770 --> 07:25.170
the hundreds of thousands of leaders from these companies,

157
07:25.170 --> 07:27.930
wonderful companies such as on this panel,

158
07:27.930 --> 07:29.460
they will say that two thirds of them

159
07:29.460 --> 07:32.640
are at least somewhat or totally burnt out.

160
07:32.640 --> 07:35.497
And so, here we are with a gap where companies are saying

161
07:35.497 --> 07:36.930
"We don't have the workforce we need,"

162
07:36.930 --> 07:39.180
and yet a lot of employees are already

163
07:39.180 --> 07:40.560
being pushed to the max.

164
07:40.560 --> 07:44.310
And so, this is a really tremendous opportunity to use AI

165
07:44.310 --> 07:47.250
to improve the employee experience, to reduce

166
07:47.250 --> 07:50.460
some of that unnecessary work that's a burden on employees,

167
07:50.460 --> 07:52.530
to personalize the employee experience

168
07:52.530 --> 07:55.860
and to create more connectedness among people and teams,

169
07:55.860 --> 08:00.600
while also preparing for the roles of the future

170
08:00.600 --> 08:03.570
and the AI augmented workforce.

171
08:03.570 --> 08:05.850
<v ->Daniel, how about at EMD Electronics?</v>

172
08:05.850 --> 08:06.990
<v ->Sure.</v>

173
08:06.990 --> 08:08.640
And to give kind of another field,

174
08:08.640 --> 08:11.040
but I think it builds off a lot of what we're saying,

175
08:11.040 --> 08:14.010
at EMD, what we do is we provide materials

176
08:14.010 --> 08:16.500
and tools for the semiconductor industry.

177
08:16.500 --> 08:18.510
So, when we talk about AI,

178
08:18.510 --> 08:20.490
when we talk about advanced digital,

179
08:20.490 --> 08:24.060
you need more and more complex semiconductor chips.

180
08:24.060 --> 08:27.270
To do that, we need more of a technical workforce.

181
08:27.270 --> 08:30.330
We need more people to be entering into the sciences

182
08:30.330 --> 08:31.350
than we have today.

183
08:31.350 --> 08:34.380
Currently today, we have a lot of issues with the challenge

184
08:34.380 --> 08:36.960
of we don't have the people in the future to go there.

185
08:36.960 --> 08:38.880
So what are we doing?

186
08:38.880 --> 08:40.890
We're spending a lot of time on workforce development.

187
08:40.890 --> 08:43.740
So, really focusing on that K to 12 group,

188
08:43.740 --> 08:45.570
to say, "Hey, how do we get these people interested

189
08:45.570 --> 08:48.780
and excited so they can be our future scientists?"

190
08:48.780 --> 08:51.630
The other thing we're kind of understanding there is,

191
08:51.630 --> 08:53.370
okay, maybe you're not gonna be a scientist,

192
08:53.370 --> 08:56.010
but you need to understand how to use this technology

193
08:56.010 --> 08:57.150
and how to work with it.

194
08:57.150 --> 09:00.210
So, a bit of a tech or an AI literacy

195
09:00.210 --> 09:01.410
that we're trying to promote there.

196
09:01.410 --> 09:03.480
And I think that's a lot of what we're doing.

197
09:03.480 --> 09:06.540
Inside, if you move now inside our company,

198
09:06.540 --> 09:07.470
we're looking kind of, I would say,

199
09:07.470 --> 09:09.540
on how we're augmenting our employees.

200
09:09.540 --> 09:12.810
So in R&amp;D, how can some experiments be run

201
09:12.810 --> 09:14.250
through digital tools?

202
09:14.250 --> 09:16.410
If we look at manufacturing,

203
09:16.410 --> 09:18.330
how are we using smart manufacturing

204
09:18.330 --> 09:21.390
and digital twins to produce and improve processes

205
09:21.390 --> 09:23.070
that before would've taken a lot longer?

206
09:23.070 --> 09:25.500
So that's some of the ways we're using it at EMD.

207
09:25.500 --> 09:28.080
<v ->Yeah, I want to get into this, you know...</v>

208
09:28.080 --> 09:29.706
I want to get into this issue of, you know,

209
09:29.706 --> 09:34.470
we all have workforces today and you know,

210
09:34.470 --> 09:36.810
the stupid analogy I like to use,

211
09:36.810 --> 09:40.050
it's like, you know, sometime well in the past,

212
09:40.050 --> 09:42.390
the person who would dig the foundation for your house

213
09:42.390 --> 09:46.350
showed up with people, shovels, and a wheelbarrow.

214
09:46.350 --> 09:48.690
And then one day someone showed up with a backhoe

215
09:48.690 --> 09:51.867
and said, "You know, I'm gonna do it in one tenth the time

216
09:51.867 --> 09:54.780
and at one tenth the cost with this new tool."

217
09:54.780 --> 09:57.487
And, you know, and then everyone else says, like,

218
09:57.487 --> 09:59.220
"How do I get into this new economy?"

219
09:59.220 --> 10:00.510
Right?

220
10:00.510 --> 10:02.880
So, we all have this challenge,

221
10:02.880 --> 10:04.187
and Daniel, you just alluded to it,

222
10:04.187 --> 10:06.450
so I'm gonna ask you to expand on your answer.

223
10:06.450 --> 10:09.000
You know, how are you thinking about the reskilling

224
10:09.972 --> 10:11.760
and how are you thinking about the change management?

225
10:11.760 --> 10:12.750
And again, you can blend the two

226
10:12.750 --> 10:13.890
or you can separate the two.

227
10:13.890 --> 10:15.570
How are you thinking about the change management

228
10:15.570 --> 10:18.240
of getting people to jump into the new world

229
10:18.240 --> 10:20.160
that's starting to define itself?

230
10:20.160 --> 10:23.250
<v ->It's a great question and it's an important one.</v>

231
10:23.250 --> 10:24.900
What I would start with is

232
10:24.900 --> 10:28.170
you've gotta meet your employee base where they are.

233
10:28.170 --> 10:30.300
Because if you don't meet with them where they are,

234
10:30.300 --> 10:31.155
you're gonna lose them

235
10:31.155 --> 10:32.460
and you're not gonna bring them along.

236
10:32.460 --> 10:35.160
And, like, for a company like ours, it would be a lot harder

237
10:35.160 --> 10:38.370
to hire 60,000 new people than it would be to reskill them.

238
10:38.370 --> 10:40.050
So this is what we need to do.

239
10:40.050 --> 10:42.360
So what you're looking at is you're tracking a bit,

240
10:42.360 --> 10:45.240
and you've got one piece where you'd almost call it

241
10:45.240 --> 10:47.010
like a cultural initiative, where you're getting people

242
10:47.010 --> 10:48.510
to hear the success stories.

243
10:48.510 --> 10:51.540
You're setting up networks through different technology

244
10:51.540 --> 10:54.300
where people can connect depending on what level they're at.

245
10:54.300 --> 10:57.840
Then you have, you know, I think as most people do nowadays,

246
10:57.840 --> 11:01.260
some form of ChatGPT or GPT technology

247
11:01.260 --> 11:04.110
that the general population can use for their daily work.

248
11:05.670 --> 11:08.190
Now we have a group we call our translators.

249
11:08.190 --> 11:11.580
So they're people who would be, like, say content experts

250
11:11.580 --> 11:14.730
and they'll spend, like, say six weeks or a month

251
11:14.730 --> 11:16.950
with the digital team, gain skills,

252
11:16.950 --> 11:19.597
go back to their area and be ones who could help with,

253
11:19.597 --> 11:22.560
"Okay, here's what we need to develop, here's how we do it."

254
11:22.560 --> 11:24.750
So it's not everyone who has to have that depth,

255
11:24.750 --> 11:26.760
but they have to have the understanding to use the tools.

256
11:26.760 --> 11:29.250
And then obviously, of course we have the more traditional

257
11:29.250 --> 11:32.108
digital and AI type experts.

258
11:32.108 --> 11:33.990
<v ->Yeah, so, I think that's a great point</v>

259
11:33.990 --> 11:36.030
about being able to meet people where they are,

260
11:36.030 --> 11:38.340
because it's going to be important

261
11:38.340 --> 11:41.040
to have your workforce with you.

262
11:41.040 --> 11:44.070
So as you think about mapping your talent

263
11:44.070 --> 11:46.110
and figuring out what their pain points are

264
11:46.110 --> 11:47.037
every day, right?

265
11:47.037 --> 11:52.037
And so, encourage kind of experimentation.

266
11:52.110 --> 11:53.370
The other thing too, I'd say

267
11:53.370 --> 11:57.720
is that it's not just about scaling on hard skills,

268
11:57.720 --> 12:00.960
it's also the soft skills, the power skills,

269
12:00.960 --> 12:03.510
because things are rapidly changing.

270
12:03.510 --> 12:06.870
And so, being able to have the critical thinking,

271
12:06.870 --> 12:09.420
being able to work in an adaptive environment,

272
12:09.420 --> 12:11.130
being able to learn, right?

273
12:11.130 --> 12:14.130
Because there's some, like, my kids are in college

274
12:14.130 --> 12:18.680
and what they learned in freshman year is obsolete

275
12:20.070 --> 12:21.480
by senior year.

276
12:21.480 --> 12:25.380
And then now it's increasingly what they learn in,

277
12:25.380 --> 12:29.223
you know, in fall quarter is obsolete by summer.

278
12:29.223 --> 12:33.000
So, this whole area of how to encourage people

279
12:33.000 --> 12:35.040
to adapt and learn,

280
12:35.040 --> 12:37.830
I think is really important in the reskilling too.

281
12:37.830 --> 12:40.200
<v ->Others, in terms of how they're seeing organizations,</v>

282
12:40.200 --> 12:41.670
have success with this.

283
12:41.670 --> 12:43.350
I see, Julia, I see you want to jump in.

284
12:43.350 --> 12:44.880
<v ->I really agree with everything that you just said</v>

285
12:44.880 --> 12:48.810
and that organizations and individuals who will reskill

286
12:48.810 --> 12:51.750
and learn faster than the pace of change

287
12:51.750 --> 12:54.510
are the individuals and teams and organizations

288
12:54.510 --> 12:55.650
that will succeed.

289
12:55.650 --> 12:57.120
We're all headed on this path together

290
12:57.120 --> 12:58.590
and I think if we're being really honest,

291
12:58.590 --> 13:00.720
no one is a hundred percent sure where we're gonna land,

292
13:00.720 --> 13:01.860
but it's exciting.

293
13:01.860 --> 13:04.380
That means really building in the competencies

294
13:04.380 --> 13:09.120
to be agile, to intake information, to identify the types

295
13:09.120 --> 13:11.460
of AI champions within your organization

296
13:11.460 --> 13:12.543
that are already enthusiastic,

297
13:12.543 --> 13:14.610
that you can continue to create a platform for

298
13:14.610 --> 13:16.500
and empower through this journey

299
13:16.500 --> 13:18.090
are gonna be really critical.

300
13:18.090 --> 13:20.310
There is one area of the reskilling,

301
13:20.310 --> 13:22.680
and that's certainly what I do in my work

302
13:22.680 --> 13:25.590
as well as as an innovation advisor,

303
13:25.590 --> 13:27.540
that I think we're not talking enough about,

304
13:27.540 --> 13:30.510
and it's somewhat of a precursor to reskilling.

305
13:30.510 --> 13:32.760
A lot of times organizations will just jump right in

306
13:32.760 --> 13:34.050
and say, "Okay, we need to reskill,

307
13:34.050 --> 13:35.760
we're gonna do a big reskill initiative

308
13:35.760 --> 13:37.140
and we're gonna spend a lot of budget."

309
13:37.140 --> 13:39.990
And you know, it's great for those of us

310
13:39.990 --> 13:40.950
on the receiving end of that.

311
13:40.950 --> 13:43.500
But the thing is is before this is a precursor,

312
13:43.500 --> 13:46.740
which I would consider to be reclassification of a role

313
13:46.740 --> 13:50.220
and really defining what a role will look like,

314
13:50.220 --> 13:53.550
or a set of roles, before and after an AI

315
13:53.550 --> 13:54.960
implementation and augmentation.

316
13:54.960 --> 13:58.890
So as an example, a basic customer service example,

317
13:58.890 --> 14:02.370
if you're an experienced customer service manager,

318
14:02.370 --> 14:03.960
you might have a team about five to ten

319
14:03.960 --> 14:05.580
customer service agents.

320
14:05.580 --> 14:08.730
Your day to day is scheduling shifts for them,

321
14:08.730 --> 14:11.940
providing performance feedback, doing quality control

322
14:11.940 --> 14:14.790
and overall kind of administrative management

323
14:14.790 --> 14:15.630
during the day.

324
14:15.630 --> 14:18.330
And your team members are, you know, doing the inquiries

325
14:18.330 --> 14:20.910
and you also receive probably some escalation calls

326
14:20.910 --> 14:21.743
and that sort of thing.

327
14:21.743 --> 14:22.650
That's kind of what you do.

328
14:22.650 --> 14:25.650
And they're doing the front end work.

329
14:25.650 --> 14:28.560
That's in the pre-AI, the current world.

330
14:28.560 --> 14:30.660
After AI in a situation like this,

331
14:30.660 --> 14:33.240
a customer experience leader

332
14:33.240 --> 14:35.490
won't really be doing any of those things.

333
14:35.490 --> 14:39.000
The performance management can be done by the AI,

334
14:39.000 --> 14:42.120
the inquiries, the escalation management can definitely

335
14:42.120 --> 14:45.420
be done by the AI, and the vast majority of tier one

336
14:45.420 --> 14:48.270
and increasingly tier two and tier three support

337
14:48.270 --> 14:50.670
probably will be done by the AI at the end of this year,

338
14:50.670 --> 14:52.680
if not sooner.

339
14:52.680 --> 14:53.610
So what does that mean?

340
14:53.610 --> 14:54.720
What is your role now?

341
14:54.720 --> 14:57.780
Your title is still Customer Experience Manager.

342
14:57.780 --> 14:59.310
There needs to be a mapping

343
14:59.310 --> 15:01.140
of what that will look like in the future.

344
15:01.140 --> 15:03.060
Instead, you're gonna be spending more time

345
15:03.060 --> 15:04.620
analyzing workflows.

346
15:04.620 --> 15:06.990
You're gonna be redesigning the workflows of your team,

347
15:06.990 --> 15:08.970
you're gonna be looking at data, you're gonna be working

348
15:08.970 --> 15:11.970
and training and fine tuning the very model that is going

349
15:11.970 --> 15:13.950
to be essentially a teammate for you.

350
15:13.950 --> 15:15.720
The AI will not be a model

351
15:15.720 --> 15:17.850
that is a one input and one output.

352
15:17.850 --> 15:19.980
It's gonna be the collaborator so you can provide

353
15:19.980 --> 15:22.350
better service to your team and to your people.

354
15:22.350 --> 15:24.300
It's a fundamental rethinking of a role.

355
15:24.300 --> 15:27.090
And so, it's interesting 'cause when we say something like,

356
15:27.090 --> 15:30.157
have you ever heard the statement, you know,

357
15:30.157 --> 15:31.920
"Your job won't be replaced by AI,

358
15:31.920 --> 15:34.860
a human augmented version."

359
15:34.860 --> 15:36.570
This is what we're really talking about

360
15:36.570 --> 15:38.250
in the nuts and bolts kind of way.

361
15:38.250 --> 15:41.730
And so, when reskilling comes into that moment,

362
15:41.730 --> 15:44.130
if you don't have the sort of skills that allow you

363
15:44.130 --> 15:46.410
to interact with an AI and fine tune a model

364
15:46.410 --> 15:50.280
and do flows, you have a real gap to fill.

365
15:50.280 --> 15:53.010
And that's an opportunity for organizations.

366
15:53.010 --> 15:54.960
If you're an AI champion, maybe you were already ahead

367
15:54.960 --> 15:56.460
of the curve and you've been studying for two years,

368
15:56.460 --> 15:58.950
you can jump right into that role and be first in line,

369
15:58.950 --> 16:01.080
but everyone else is gonna need a little bit of help.

370
16:01.080 --> 16:03.870
And I think kind of getting to the nuts and bolts of it

371
16:03.870 --> 16:05.910
as leaders here about how you plan to do that

372
16:05.910 --> 16:07.770
in your organizations is something

373
16:07.770 --> 16:09.240
that if you're not already doing it,

374
16:09.240 --> 16:10.530
I really would encourage you to begin

375
16:10.530 --> 16:12.360
to think pretty clearly about

376
16:12.360 --> 16:14.393
how you want to make that transformation.

377
16:15.870 --> 16:17.070
<v ->Yeah, I was gonna say,</v>

378
16:17.910 --> 16:21.210
AI is gonna impact these roles so differently.

379
16:21.210 --> 16:24.180
It's hard to know how exactly for each of these,

380
16:24.180 --> 16:26.970
you know, whether you're very senior, very junior,

381
16:26.970 --> 16:27.840
your role within a company,

382
16:27.840 --> 16:30.450
it may augment and supercharge your workflow.

383
16:30.450 --> 16:33.580
You may have to totally rethink what you're doing day to day

384
16:34.620 --> 16:36.180
and maybe it will require more skills.

385
16:36.180 --> 16:39.300
I think what's important is having a baseline

386
16:39.300 --> 16:43.110
of AI literacy that you're working with your company

387
16:43.110 --> 16:45.120
to kind of champion for.

388
16:45.120 --> 16:47.310
And I completely agree with leaning in

389
16:47.310 --> 16:50.580
to those early adopters and those folks that are

390
16:50.580 --> 16:53.580
taking this new technology and running with it.

391
16:53.580 --> 16:56.280
My background is in research and behavioral insights

392
16:56.280 --> 16:58.530
and I always find that I learn the most from seeing

393
16:58.530 --> 17:01.650
what people are doing when they're kind of learning

394
17:01.650 --> 17:03.000
how to work the system themselves

395
17:03.000 --> 17:05.040
and creating little workflows on their own

396
17:05.040 --> 17:08.400
and kind of sharing about what the technology can do

397
17:08.400 --> 17:10.680
for them rather than more of, like,

398
17:10.680 --> 17:12.540
a top down type of approach.

399
17:12.540 --> 17:15.093
Like, here's the AI, figure it out.

400
17:15.930 --> 17:18.330
So, I always find that working with those kind

401
17:18.330 --> 17:21.270
of early adopters and really sitting alongside them

402
17:21.270 --> 17:23.568
and showing what that technology can do

403
17:23.568 --> 17:26.040
with those exact use cases will be really helpful

404
17:26.040 --> 17:27.720
on top of that baseline of literacy

405
17:27.720 --> 17:31.050
that we'll have to kind of work with our companies.

406
17:31.050 --> 17:33.660
<v ->Yeah, so, I mean, if you think about what a university is,</v>

407
17:33.660 --> 17:35.027
it's a really interesting organization, right?

408
17:35.027 --> 17:37.926
'Cause we're like any other organization, you know,

409
17:37.926 --> 17:41.760
we have our people who will say "Over my dead body,

410
17:41.760 --> 17:45.000
anything new, no matter what it is, I'm against it."

411
17:45.000 --> 17:47.010
And then we have these things called students

412
17:47.010 --> 17:48.240
who are on the front lines

413
17:48.240 --> 17:51.330
and doing stuff that is way outside the box of anything

414
17:51.330 --> 17:52.800
that I would ever think of.

415
17:52.800 --> 17:55.020
And so, you know, we created an environment where we just,

416
17:55.020 --> 17:57.270
we gave people a playground and we said "Experiment."

417
17:57.270 --> 17:59.550
You know, we gave them the playground and said "Go."

418
17:59.550 --> 18:01.680
That's what helped us identify our innovators, right?

419
18:01.680 --> 18:03.030
Our top 10% who took us.

420
18:03.030 --> 18:06.750
And then we tried to, you know, get people to move in

421
18:06.750 --> 18:08.550
and see what the innovators were doing,

422
18:08.550 --> 18:11.197
see that the water was safe before they would jump in.

423
18:11.197 --> 18:14.040
You know, but I even have been looking back at my language

424
18:14.040 --> 18:14.873
and how it's changed.

425
18:14.873 --> 18:16.680
It's like, you gotta start to engage with these tools

426
18:16.680 --> 18:17.970
to understand what they're capable of

427
18:17.970 --> 18:19.230
is kind of how I started with people.

428
18:19.230 --> 18:21.000
It's like, just play with it to understand

429
18:21.000 --> 18:23.400
how you could hack some of your own personal productivity.

430
18:23.400 --> 18:25.380
Now I tell people it's like you gotta build

431
18:25.380 --> 18:27.360
a personal relationship with these tools.

432
18:27.360 --> 18:28.680
Because that's what it's gonna be,

433
18:28.680 --> 18:30.300
it's gonna be an augmentation

434
18:30.300 --> 18:31.680
and someone you're gonna rely on.

435
18:31.680 --> 18:34.710
And I have certain topics that I have been conversing

436
18:34.710 --> 18:37.410
with my AI agent for more than four months on now.

437
18:37.410 --> 18:39.690
And I see it as a colleague, and guess what,

438
18:39.690 --> 18:42.420
it's got a heck of a better memory than I have

439
18:42.420 --> 18:44.610
when we come back to a conversation,

440
18:44.610 --> 18:46.680
which is a really interesting thing to think about.

441
18:46.680 --> 18:47.513
Loretta?

442
18:47.513 --> 18:50.310
<v ->Yeah, and one other comment too about this is that</v>

443
18:50.310 --> 18:54.750
because we had done some research that showed that

444
18:54.750 --> 18:59.010
those that use AI, these early adopters

445
18:59.010 --> 19:02.970
have 11 points more healthy relationship

446
19:02.970 --> 19:04.650
with work than those who do not.

447
19:04.650 --> 19:08.790
So there is an opportunity to experiment

448
19:08.790 --> 19:11.520
and then bring the rest of the workforce in.

449
19:11.520 --> 19:12.900
But an important piece of it,

450
19:12.900 --> 19:16.020
you had mentioned change management is

451
19:16.020 --> 19:17.640
how do you manage change?

452
19:17.640 --> 19:22.290
Because to make sure that you bring the broader workforce,

453
19:22.290 --> 19:24.630
not just the early adopters through.

454
19:24.630 --> 19:27.443
And this is where leadership comes into play

455
19:27.443 --> 19:30.600
and the role of leadership has actually changed

456
19:30.600 --> 19:32.610
the past number of years.

457
19:32.610 --> 19:37.020
So, rather than being supervisors, there's a whole...

458
19:37.020 --> 19:39.030
Those that are most successful in leadership

459
19:39.030 --> 19:41.610
are those that are empathetic, right?

460
19:41.610 --> 19:44.700
And so leading their teams through change,

461
19:44.700 --> 19:49.560
really understanding kind of the emotions of everything

462
19:49.560 --> 19:53.130
that's happening, being able to connect their people

463
19:53.130 --> 19:54.660
to other people.

464
19:54.660 --> 19:58.830
So, this area of leadership and change management

465
19:58.830 --> 20:01.650
is going to be a critical area for us to be successful.

466
20:01.650 --> 20:03.210
<v ->Yeah, I'm kind of curious,</v>

467
20:03.210 --> 20:06.720
given we have one of the co-founders of Exec Online here,

468
20:06.720 --> 20:08.940
you think about how leadership has changed

469
20:08.940 --> 20:12.390
to Loretta's point, EQ being more valuable...

470
20:12.390 --> 20:15.270
You know, are you seeing leadership...

471
20:15.270 --> 20:17.120
Are you seeing leadership differently in this age of AI?

472
20:17.120 --> 20:20.010
Is it gonna evolve, are we gonna expect different things

473
20:20.010 --> 20:22.960
from leaders, and is that what your clients are asking for?

474
20:23.850 --> 20:24.900
<v ->It's such a good question.</v>

475
20:24.900 --> 20:27.750
I think in some ways leadership is evergreen

476
20:27.750 --> 20:32.750
in that leaders are expected and should inspire,

477
20:33.060 --> 20:35.610
guide, and generate results for their organizations.

478
20:35.610 --> 20:38.400
And that'll be the case pre and post-AI.

479
20:38.400 --> 20:40.140
I think how we're going to do that,

480
20:40.140 --> 20:41.550
as well as really what the definition

481
20:41.550 --> 20:44.070
of a great leader will be, is gonna change quite a bit.

482
20:44.070 --> 20:45.780
And we have to think as well

483
20:45.780 --> 20:48.450
that our organizations themselves are changing.

484
20:48.450 --> 20:50.730
Even if we think about an organizational chart,

485
20:50.730 --> 20:54.630
it's almost somewhat of an old and almost outdated,

486
20:54.630 --> 20:57.840
because so many organizations are so much more matrixed,

487
20:57.840 --> 21:00.660
they're more global, they're more cross-functional,

488
21:00.660 --> 21:04.050
they require coordination across many different areas,

489
21:04.050 --> 21:06.270
so that when you think about leadership coming from the top,

490
21:06.270 --> 21:09.060
of course it has to in that management

491
21:09.060 --> 21:11.460
and C-suites are ultimately accountable.

492
21:11.460 --> 21:13.950
But leadership can come from anywhere in an organization,

493
21:13.950 --> 21:17.130
and especially at this time, being on the lookout for folks

494
21:17.130 --> 21:18.780
that are naturally leaders,

495
21:18.780 --> 21:20.910
even if they do not have the title,

496
21:20.910 --> 21:23.670
is going to really help you generate the trust

497
21:23.670 --> 21:25.800
that'll be required to get to the other side.

498
21:25.800 --> 21:28.110
In terms of the future-ready workforce, you know,

499
21:28.110 --> 21:31.050
there are three pillars that you might consider.

500
21:31.050 --> 21:34.320
One is the ability to drive business model transformation.

501
21:34.320 --> 21:38.820
That is the driving of customer results, operational results

502
21:38.820 --> 21:42.000
and transformation that is expected of any business leader.

503
21:42.000 --> 21:46.500
The second is the ability

504
21:46.500 --> 21:49.560
to prioritize inclusion and diversity.

505
21:49.560 --> 21:52.260
We've gotta bring everyone along on this journey

506
21:52.260 --> 21:53.760
or it won't work.

507
21:53.760 --> 21:55.650
So this is something that has to be at the root

508
21:55.650 --> 21:58.950
of every part of your transformation, however you define it,

509
21:58.950 --> 22:01.470
however you want to work it through your organization,

510
22:01.470 --> 22:03.000
it needs to be in the fabric.

511
22:03.000 --> 22:05.520
And being an empathetic leader, completely agree,

512
22:05.520 --> 22:08.610
a purpose-driven, impact-oriented leader,

513
22:08.610 --> 22:10.320
much more than a command and control leader,

514
22:10.320 --> 22:11.940
especially the generations,

515
22:11.940 --> 22:13.860
are the three pillars of the future-ready workforce

516
22:13.860 --> 22:16.500
that, you know, I think we're hearing.

517
22:16.500 --> 22:17.970
<v ->Others wanna jump in on this and talk about</v>

518
22:17.970 --> 22:20.720
the different expectations of leadership going forward?

519
22:21.660 --> 22:23.670
<v ->So, actually I would like to jump in a bit</v>

520
22:23.670 --> 22:25.380
on this diversity topic, right?

521
22:25.380 --> 22:29.040
Because I think when we talk about how AI

522
22:29.040 --> 22:32.340
or new technology can help us, it democratizes a lot, right?

523
22:32.340 --> 22:34.320
So in one aspect we're like, "Okay,

524
22:34.320 --> 22:36.420
people who are neurodiverse

525
22:36.420 --> 22:39.660
now are able to interact more than they did before."

526
22:39.660 --> 22:41.730
People who are introverted may be more comfortable

527
22:41.730 --> 22:42.720
with an avatar.

528
22:42.720 --> 22:45.600
It's easy to get access to things,

529
22:45.600 --> 22:47.820
but in the same times, a lot of these models

530
22:47.820 --> 22:50.670
are based off a certain data set.

531
22:50.670 --> 22:53.610
And if you have a number of creators

532
22:53.610 --> 22:55.950
who are not representative of your customer set,

533
22:55.950 --> 22:58.770
who are not representative of our workforce,

534
22:58.770 --> 23:00.450
you actually might get significant errors

535
23:00.450 --> 23:03.750
in the data, and then that may make you do mistakes

536
23:03.750 --> 23:04.583
and make mistakes,

537
23:04.583 --> 23:05.610
not only in your products but your workforce.

538
23:05.610 --> 23:07.830
So this to us is something that's critical

539
23:07.830 --> 23:11.010
when we talk about it and it's important to recognize

540
23:11.010 --> 23:12.990
that this helps the full workforce.

541
23:12.990 --> 23:14.970
And so it's not about...

542
23:14.970 --> 23:17.010
It's not about setting a quota or anything like that,

543
23:17.010 --> 23:19.060
but it's really improving the technology.

544
23:20.640 --> 23:21.690
So that was my point.

545
23:23.460 --> 23:27.960
<v ->How are you tying AI,</v>

546
23:27.960 --> 23:30.870
and again, I always like to mention

547
23:30.870 --> 23:33.510
that AI is not just generative AI, ChatGPT,

548
23:33.510 --> 23:37.560
but immersive experiences, which I know Daniel,

549
23:37.560 --> 23:41.130
your organization has some representation here at.

550
23:41.130 --> 23:44.070
I think about, you know, computer vision, ambient sound,

551
23:44.070 --> 23:47.220
lots of different ways in which these new tools

552
23:47.220 --> 23:48.360
are being introduced.

553
23:48.360 --> 23:51.240
How are your organizations thinking about tying AI

554
23:51.240 --> 23:54.750
to broader business transformation?

555
23:54.750 --> 23:57.203
You mentioned business model transformation.

556
23:57.203 --> 23:59.040
How are you tying the two together?

557
23:59.040 --> 24:01.500
Or are you tying the two together yet?

558
24:01.500 --> 24:03.330
Because I see that they're ultimately going

559
24:03.330 --> 24:04.890
to become one and the same thing, right?

560
24:04.890 --> 24:06.690
This is just the latest of tools.

561
24:06.690 --> 24:08.790
But how are your organizations doing that?

562
24:09.720 --> 24:10.847
Claire, how are you doing...

563
24:10.847 --> 24:11.680
<v ->Yeah, I can share a little bit.</v>

564
24:11.680 --> 24:14.640
So, we love to do hackathons,

565
24:14.640 --> 24:16.773
we love to do lots of proofs of concepts.

566
24:17.640 --> 24:20.610
One thing that, you know, I mentioned earlier that

567
24:20.610 --> 24:22.320
I did quite a bit of work on is understanding

568
24:22.320 --> 24:25.170
the commerce value chain and how that's shifting.

569
24:25.170 --> 24:28.890
And when you think about how people are deciding

570
24:28.890 --> 24:30.300
on even how to purchase, right?

571
24:30.300 --> 24:32.790
Like, in the future, maybe an agent

572
24:32.790 --> 24:34.980
is making that decision for you.

573
24:34.980 --> 24:38.040
And so what does actually that decision making process

574
24:38.040 --> 24:40.050
look like when it's not even you as a human

575
24:40.050 --> 24:41.820
making that decision?

576
24:41.820 --> 24:43.830
So, really thinking about, like,

577
24:43.830 --> 24:45.780
what is the future going to look like

578
24:45.780 --> 24:48.690
and how is the commerce value chain actually shifting?

579
24:48.690 --> 24:51.870
We've had to do a lot of experimentation about, well,

580
24:51.870 --> 24:54.580
in that kind of future, what is sort of

581
24:55.560 --> 24:57.750
a commerce experience, a checkout experience,

582
24:57.750 --> 25:00.360
what do our clients really need?

583
25:00.360 --> 25:02.880
For us to make sure that we're ahead of the game

584
25:02.880 --> 25:05.250
so that we can ensure that people are, you know,

585
25:05.250 --> 25:09.330
paying and getting paid the best way that they can.

586
25:09.330 --> 25:11.430
So we've done a lot of just experimenting

587
25:11.430 --> 25:14.910
and doing a lot of kind of meeting with our clients

588
25:14.910 --> 25:17.820
to see where they're going and what they're thinking about.

589
25:17.820 --> 25:20.910
But I would say, like, experiment, test, learn, iterate.

590
25:20.910 --> 25:21.960
That's what we've been doing.

591
25:21.960 --> 25:24.090
<v ->Yeah, I think, you know, one of the things I've seen</v>

592
25:24.090 --> 25:26.430
really change in the last six to nine months,

593
25:26.430 --> 25:28.770
in terms of the conversations I've been having,

594
25:28.770 --> 25:31.766
and I do a lot with industry partnerships,

595
25:31.766 --> 25:34.380
I do a lot with workforce development because we're sending,

596
25:34.380 --> 25:38.340
you know, 80,000-10,000 graduates a year into the workforce,

597
25:38.340 --> 25:42.570
is let's say a year ago it was a lot about

598
25:42.570 --> 25:46.350
what are the opportunities to take out the low-value work,

599
25:46.350 --> 25:49.830
create efficiencies, maybe improve margins.

600
25:49.830 --> 25:51.540
Now it's part of the growth agenda,

601
25:51.540 --> 25:54.420
which is why every CEO is talking about this,

602
25:54.420 --> 25:57.690
because it's not just an internal efficiencies place.

603
25:57.690 --> 26:02.010
It's gotta be a part of maintaining our tight relationships

604
26:02.010 --> 26:05.700
with customers, reshaping experiences, not letting people...

605
26:05.700 --> 26:08.100
You know, or even expanding into new markets,

606
26:08.100 --> 26:10.620
you know, by being different than

607
26:10.620 --> 26:12.030
what the rest of the market is doing.

608
26:12.030 --> 26:12.863
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

609
26:12.863 --> 26:14.130
I mean, we're all trying to expand

610
26:14.130 --> 26:15.930
and generate the most value that we can.

611
26:15.930 --> 26:18.810
And so, if you're thinking just about the low stakes,

612
26:18.810 --> 26:21.180
you know, high efficiency use cases, that's great,

613
26:21.180 --> 26:24.240
but that's not going to differentiate you, right?

614
26:24.240 --> 26:26.790
Just having AI and doing that in a way that just makes

615
26:26.790 --> 26:29.010
things more efficient, everyone's doing that now.

616
26:29.010 --> 26:30.480
So you really do have to think about the growth case.

617
26:30.480 --> 26:33.330
<v ->I love the whole media mentions charts that you look at.</v>

618
26:33.330 --> 26:34.860
You can see the big change when you look at

619
26:34.860 --> 26:36.900
the media mentions of any public company

620
26:36.900 --> 26:39.900
and what they've been saying at their investor meetings.

621
26:39.900 --> 26:40.733
Loretta?

622
26:40.733 --> 26:45.690
<v ->Yeah, so I was gonna mention, at HP it's massively changed</v>

623
26:45.690 --> 26:48.660
the approach that we drive solutions, right?

624
26:48.660 --> 26:50.970
So, in the past,

625
26:50.970 --> 26:54.510
customers would buy the PC,

626
26:54.510 --> 26:56.520
then they would buy this software

627
26:56.520 --> 27:00.540
and applications to run on top of it, right?

628
27:00.540 --> 27:03.300
And it was kind of, you know,

629
27:03.300 --> 27:07.320
it was more of, okay, you kind of build the solution.

630
27:07.320 --> 27:11.160
Now, we're tightly integrated from what's happening

631
27:11.160 --> 27:13.350
on the chip level, right?

632
27:13.350 --> 27:16.920
And in co-engineering, across the chip,

633
27:16.920 --> 27:19.803
across us the system, across the OS,

634
27:21.360 --> 27:23.850
and then across the software vendors, right?

635
27:23.850 --> 27:24.780
In the application.

636
27:24.780 --> 27:29.780
And so, it's much more kind of vertically tight

637
27:30.060 --> 27:34.290
in terms of creating kind of brand new breakthrough types

638
27:34.290 --> 27:35.703
of experiences together.

639
27:37.530 --> 27:39.210
<v ->We're gonna come out to your questions</v>

640
27:39.210 --> 27:40.500
in just a couple of minutes,

641
27:40.500 --> 27:44.430
but my last formal question for the group is,

642
27:44.430 --> 27:47.130
someone shared with me maybe about six months ago

643
27:47.130 --> 27:50.640
that, you know, part of what we're gonna go through here,

644
27:50.640 --> 27:52.650
right, because this is, you know,

645
27:52.650 --> 27:56.700
this is a general purpose technology moment, right?

646
27:56.700 --> 27:59.313
Think the internet, think electricity.

647
28:00.360 --> 28:02.610
And one of the big things that we're going to

648
28:03.840 --> 28:05.610
struggle with at an individual level,

649
28:05.610 --> 28:08.760
as an organizational level, is our relationship

650
28:08.760 --> 28:11.790
with technology and the human technology interface

651
28:11.790 --> 28:16.230
is going to evolve to the next version of what it should be.

652
28:16.230 --> 28:19.020
Have your organizations started thinking about that,

653
28:19.020 --> 28:21.120
grappling with it, understanding what

654
28:21.120 --> 28:23.640
the long-term implications of it are?

655
28:23.640 --> 28:25.050
Anybody?

656
28:25.050 --> 28:26.400
<v ->So, I can jump in.</v>

657
28:26.400 --> 28:28.830
I think to your point earlier on our products.

658
28:28.830 --> 28:32.820
So we're involved in the AR/VR development.

659
28:32.820 --> 28:35.460
I can't mention any customers, but we're involved there.

660
28:35.460 --> 28:37.650
And if you think about it now,

661
28:37.650 --> 28:39.390
you're able to have a conversation.

662
28:39.390 --> 28:41.730
Not now, but at some point in time,

663
28:41.730 --> 28:43.590
in the not too far future, you're gonna be able

664
28:43.590 --> 28:45.810
to have a conversation, interact with someone

665
28:45.810 --> 28:48.150
and then say, "Okay, I forgot about that conversation.

666
28:48.150 --> 28:50.010
Let me archive it and get it back."

667
28:50.010 --> 28:52.027
Or you're gonna say, you know,

668
28:52.027 --> 28:54.180
"Hey, let's reverify what happened here."

669
28:54.180 --> 28:56.160
And this is all happening through the screen.

670
28:56.160 --> 28:58.500
A lot of other things could happen through the screen.

671
28:58.500 --> 29:01.590
We're working with other companies to look at,

672
29:01.590 --> 29:05.580
okay, from a brainwave standpoint

673
29:05.580 --> 29:09.659
and using, like, headphones to be able to move objects

674
29:09.659 --> 29:12.840
when you're looking at an ARV screen or another screen,

675
29:12.840 --> 29:14.817
so it's no longer your hands that are doing it,

676
29:14.817 --> 29:15.720
and these kind of things.

677
29:15.720 --> 29:18.840
So two different elements where you can interact

678
29:18.840 --> 29:20.940
with the digital world that we're not using as much today.

679
29:20.940 --> 29:24.003
So we're definitely doubling down in those areas at EMD.

680
29:25.080 --> 29:26.580
<v ->Really exciting.</v>

681
29:26.580 --> 29:29.340
And from the learning perspective,

682
29:29.340 --> 29:31.950
we think about something I'm really excited about

683
29:31.950 --> 29:36.480
is multi-sensory experiences and immersive experiences.

684
29:36.480 --> 29:39.750
In a lot of ways, digital learning has come a long way

685
29:39.750 --> 29:42.690
in the 10 years since I, you know, co-founded Exec Online,

686
29:42.690 --> 29:45.030
but it's still very early.

687
29:45.030 --> 29:47.700
You know, most of digital learning that you see

688
29:47.700 --> 29:51.750
really relies on basically just two of your senses,

689
29:51.750 --> 29:55.680
your sight and your hearing primarily,

690
29:55.680 --> 29:58.410
a little bit of touch sort of, but usually not.

691
29:58.410 --> 30:01.230
A sense that is almost entirely absent

692
30:01.230 --> 30:06.230
is your olfactory system, being able to smell your scent.

693
30:06.330 --> 30:08.820
And if you think about human evolution,

694
30:08.820 --> 30:13.170
the ability to smell and tell if this plant is a good plant

695
30:13.170 --> 30:15.180
or if this way is the right way,

696
30:15.180 --> 30:18.480
is really built in at our DNA to the core.

697
30:18.480 --> 30:20.880
And we're not using this at all virtually

698
30:20.880 --> 30:21.930
in the learning space.

699
30:21.930 --> 30:24.390
And so I really am excited about some of the solutions

700
30:24.390 --> 30:28.050
that are coming out that are going to be more related

701
30:28.050 --> 30:31.260
to scent and smell that will help us learn faster.

702
30:31.260 --> 30:33.930
We've gotta find a way to hack our own systems

703
30:33.930 --> 30:37.770
so that we learn faster in this world, right?

704
30:37.770 --> 30:39.180
We got a lot of great neurotech,

705
30:39.180 --> 30:41.640
but don't forget some of the old fashioned stuff here,

706
30:41.640 --> 30:44.040
the scent and the olfactory system.

707
30:44.040 --> 30:46.440
Really excited for some cool tech that's gonna be coming out

708
30:46.440 --> 30:47.850
to help us in the learning space for that.

709
30:47.850 --> 30:49.140
<v ->Yeah, just a quick example on that.</v>

710
30:49.140 --> 30:53.340
So I work with a snack food company

711
30:53.340 --> 30:58.340
who is using AI to design the smell and the taste parameters

712
30:58.800 --> 31:00.510
of the foods that they're putting on shelves

713
31:00.510 --> 31:01.920
that you're seeing in your supermarket.

714
31:01.920 --> 31:03.630
And who would've thought that would be a place

715
31:03.630 --> 31:06.720
that AI would have impacted the design of a product?

716
31:06.720 --> 31:09.930
So, to your point, there are five senses

717
31:09.930 --> 31:12.090
and then we're gonna tap into the sixth sense,

718
31:12.090 --> 31:15.240
which gets back to Daniel and picking up on brainwaves.

719
31:15.240 --> 31:16.920
Loretta, how about at at HP?

720
31:16.920 --> 31:19.860
<v ->And so, when we think about, you know,</v>

721
31:19.860 --> 31:23.520
you're working with your computer every day, right?

722
31:23.520 --> 31:26.650
The traditional inputs of keyboard/mouse

723
31:27.600 --> 31:29.550
are going to evolve, right?

724
31:29.550 --> 31:31.830
And also is gonna be dependent on

725
31:31.830 --> 31:34.050
what people are most comfortable with,

726
31:34.050 --> 31:39.050
but more kind of conversational AI, voice, gestures.

727
31:41.460 --> 31:44.610
But it might be different for different types of people.

728
31:44.610 --> 31:49.610
Also, what we'll see is contextual awareness, right?

729
31:49.860 --> 31:51.360
So being able to, you know,

730
31:51.360 --> 31:54.540
your PC will become your personal companion.

731
31:54.540 --> 31:56.970
We have sensors on the PC, right?

732
31:56.970 --> 32:00.060
And so can we use that, be able to learn your habits,

733
32:00.060 --> 32:03.720
be able to help you be more effective, be able to predict

734
32:03.720 --> 32:06.240
what you need and then become an agent for you

735
32:06.240 --> 32:11.240
to execute tasks quickly, more effectively.

736
32:11.340 --> 32:13.650
And then also to build kind of personalization.

737
32:13.650 --> 32:17.280
I think you made up a point about personalization as well.

738
32:17.280 --> 32:19.290
So, exciting times.

739
32:19.290 --> 32:21.750
<v ->Great, we're looking at a lot of very interesting</v>

740
32:21.750 --> 32:23.670
shopping experiences of the future,

741
32:23.670 --> 32:26.160
how people purchase both in brick and mortar

742
32:26.160 --> 32:28.050
and in digital channels.

743
32:28.050 --> 32:29.340
I think I mentioned before, you know,

744
32:29.340 --> 32:31.770
AI agents interacting and purchasing on your behalf,

745
32:31.770 --> 32:34.980
but also just thinking about how people are interacting

746
32:34.980 --> 32:36.997
with, say, ChatGPT to say,

747
32:36.997 --> 32:38.790
"I am looking for this, I'd like to buy it,"

748
32:38.790 --> 32:41.130
and buying it right within that flow,

749
32:41.130 --> 32:42.840
within that experience, right?

750
32:42.840 --> 32:45.570
Embedding that and just embedded finance in general

751
32:45.570 --> 32:48.720
is just a major trend in our space.

752
32:48.720 --> 32:51.300
And one more that I'll mention is biometrics.

753
32:51.300 --> 32:53.460
I mean, biometrics, just different interfaces there

754
32:53.460 --> 32:56.970
and obviously AI kind of powers everything under the hood

755
32:56.970 --> 32:59.160
when you think about biometric experiences.

756
32:59.160 --> 33:02.080
But also that's something that you really have to

757
33:03.000 --> 33:04.650
meet people where they're at and really make sure

758
33:04.650 --> 33:06.750
that you're building things that, you know,

759
33:06.750 --> 33:09.663
it's not gonna be too scary for your consumer.

760
33:10.950 --> 33:12.120
<v ->We have about seven minutes left.</v>

761
33:12.120 --> 33:14.940
We'd like to take questions from you, the audience.

762
33:14.940 --> 33:17.700
I'm not exactly sure, maybe we're gonna run a mic

763
33:17.700 --> 33:19.680
to people, but what questions do you have from our audience?

764
33:19.680 --> 33:21.150
I see a hand over here.

765
33:21.150 --> 33:25.143
Do we have a way to get a mic to them?

766
33:27.733 --> 33:29.190
I could also do it.

767
33:29.190 --> 33:30.590
I could play game show host.

768
33:38.430 --> 33:39.720
Yes sir.

769
33:39.720 --> 33:41.100
<v Audience Member>Thank you.</v>

770
33:41.100 --> 33:46.100
So, you've tapped on AI agents and I want to see now,

771
33:46.835 --> 33:48.690
we're gonna see the AI agents evolving

772
33:48.690 --> 33:50.700
into a different multiple stages,

773
33:50.700 --> 33:54.330
but we're also gonna see that how software

774
33:54.330 --> 33:58.950
and solution providers will look at the user as a client.

775
33:58.950 --> 34:02.130
So how loyal the agent will be for his client

776
34:02.130 --> 34:05.133
from a shopping negotiation point of view.

777
34:07.950 --> 34:12.078
<v ->Sorry, the question is around loyalty of the agent?</v>

778
34:12.078 --> 34:16.161
(audience member speaks off mic)

779
34:24.480 --> 34:27.060
Yeah, it's a great call out.

780
34:27.060 --> 34:29.250
Loyalty will look very different.

781
34:29.250 --> 34:30.810
Marketing will look very different.

782
34:30.810 --> 34:32.550
And this is where, you know, you really,

783
34:32.550 --> 34:35.310
it kinda racks your brain about what the entire kind of

784
34:35.310 --> 34:38.463
ecosystem and experience will be for that and consumer.

785
34:40.230 --> 34:41.610
Yeah, that's a great question.

786
34:41.610 --> 34:44.280
I do not have the silver bullet answer to that,

787
34:44.280 --> 34:46.350
but I don't know if any other folks have thoughts.

788
34:46.350 --> 34:49.260
<v ->I just have a thought, which is,</v>

789
34:49.260 --> 34:51.810
you're asking a really important question

790
34:51.810 --> 34:55.620
that I think about a lot, which is really who decides

791
34:55.620 --> 34:59.283
what the AI will decide, right?

792
35:00.210 --> 35:03.990
And how much, not only governance, governance is sort of

793
35:03.990 --> 35:06.300
the word, but really just the day-to-day,

794
35:06.300 --> 35:10.260
where is this effectively influence and power going to sit?

795
35:10.260 --> 35:12.600
So, right now, a lot of the decisions about

796
35:12.600 --> 35:15.570
who decides things sit in some cases in HR,

797
35:15.570 --> 35:17.010
when you're talking about roles,

798
35:17.010 --> 35:19.230
they certainly sit with general managers.

799
35:19.230 --> 35:21.330
You know, if these were human agents, they'd be sitting

800
35:21.330 --> 35:24.000
with the GM of shopping or what have you, right?

801
35:24.000 --> 35:25.980
But now a lot of this is definitely going

802
35:25.980 --> 35:30.690
to come from our more technical teams, from the IT teams.

803
35:30.690 --> 35:31.980
That has a lot of questions

804
35:31.980 --> 35:34.770
about whether that's the right place.

805
35:34.770 --> 35:38.490
Should it be now a cross-functional transformation team

806
35:38.490 --> 35:40.860
that has cross-functional representation?

807
35:40.860 --> 35:42.900
I think there's a lot of promise to that.

808
35:42.900 --> 35:44.797
Some people think it's too slow, you know,

809
35:44.797 --> 35:46.740
"We don't have time for cross-functional team,

810
35:46.740 --> 35:47.820
we just want to get going."

811
35:47.820 --> 35:51.780
So you know, exactly how these agents are gonna be empowered

812
35:51.780 --> 35:55.050
to behave beyond the principles is a really, I think,

813
35:55.050 --> 35:58.440
important question about how comfortable we are

814
35:58.440 --> 36:01.590
as organization about the decision making authority

815
36:01.590 --> 36:04.680
that we're going to be able to delegate.

816
36:04.680 --> 36:06.780
The decision making authority is already there,

817
36:06.780 --> 36:10.560
you know that, it's going to even accelerate exponentially,

818
36:10.560 --> 36:14.820
and our own human personal comfort as well as the governance

819
36:14.820 --> 36:17.310
and management structures that we will put in

820
36:17.310 --> 36:19.890
are going to really determine how this rolls out.

821
36:19.890 --> 36:22.260
<v ->I predict by the second half of 2025,</v>

822
36:22.260 --> 36:25.320
we'll hear our first example of A/B testing within an agent.

823
36:25.320 --> 36:26.670
Just a matter of time.

824
36:26.670 --> 36:28.110
I see we have our next question here.

825
36:28.110 --> 36:29.100
<v Audience Member>Yeah, hi.</v>

826
36:29.100 --> 36:30.720
So I wanna make sure I understood.

827
36:30.720 --> 36:34.530
I heard, I think the lady in the middle mentioned

828
36:34.530 --> 36:38.670
that we're gonna have agents that, on your laptop

829
36:38.670 --> 36:41.370
or what have you, that will learn your habits

830
36:41.370 --> 36:43.860
and can help you optimize.

831
36:43.860 --> 36:45.690
So, it sounds great.

832
36:45.690 --> 36:47.490
And then I had this thought, so how do you do

833
36:47.490 --> 36:51.060
performance reviews if we're all... (laughs)

834
36:51.060 --> 36:53.880
At that point, if we're being fully optimized,

835
36:53.880 --> 36:57.480
then just wanna have your thought about performance reviews.

836
36:57.480 --> 37:01.290
<v ->Yeah, and so, one thing also that's important</v>

837
37:01.290 --> 37:03.900
is privacy, right?

838
37:03.900 --> 37:08.640
And so it's a... Whatever information has to be

839
37:08.640 --> 37:13.640
kind of local and secure, and also as we think about

840
37:14.790 --> 37:18.180
the balance of the person versus the agent

841
37:18.180 --> 37:19.920
and the performance reviews, right?

842
37:19.920 --> 37:23.700
It's going to be about how effective that you

843
37:23.700 --> 37:26.070
as the human is performing, right?

844
37:26.070 --> 37:30.090
The agent's not gonna get a performance review, but you are.

845
37:30.090 --> 37:32.520
And so, if the agents are actually helping you

846
37:32.520 --> 37:35.130
to be more effective and efficient,

847
37:35.130 --> 37:39.540
and also it has to be private, which is why there's shifts

848
37:39.540 --> 37:44.130
to, you know, there's cloud versus local AI.

849
37:44.130 --> 37:45.120
And so, it's a balance.

850
37:45.120 --> 37:48.030
So we see kind of a shift to hybrid that you wanna keep

851
37:48.030 --> 37:51.393
things that are private and local on your PC,

852
37:52.290 --> 37:55.110
and then there are some applications that make sense

853
37:55.110 --> 37:58.980
that are going to be, you know, on the cloud.

854
37:58.980 --> 38:01.410
But how that combination...

855
38:01.410 --> 38:06.410
If it can make you be more effective in your role,

856
38:06.420 --> 38:08.400
as you're working with HR and, you know,

857
38:08.400 --> 38:10.440
going through these performance reviews,

858
38:10.440 --> 38:14.550
it should actually show up as an improvement on you,

859
38:14.550 --> 38:17.970
not... I mean, agents are not gonna be reviewed.

860
38:17.970 --> 38:20.070
<v ->And just adding a different angle to that,</v>

861
38:20.070 --> 38:22.770
I think the organization is gonna have

862
38:22.770 --> 38:24.510
to rethink how it functions.

863
38:24.510 --> 38:27.450
So what is performance, what is a performance review?

864
38:27.450 --> 38:29.160
How do we even do performance management?

865
38:29.160 --> 38:30.600
I mean, this is all gonna evolve

866
38:30.600 --> 38:33.150
and be very, very different than it is today.

867
38:33.150 --> 38:34.890
And we've already seen that in other areas,

868
38:34.890 --> 38:36.900
but we're gonna see that exponentially more now

869
38:36.900 --> 38:37.733
with these things.

870
38:37.733 --> 38:39.090
So I think that's a really important point.

871
38:39.090 --> 38:40.260
And for those of you in organization,

872
38:40.260 --> 38:41.460
something to think about.

873
38:41.460 --> 38:46.410
<v ->Performance reviews are one of the most disliked parts</v>

874
38:46.410 --> 38:48.030
of employees' jobs, right?

875
38:48.030 --> 38:50.070
No one really likes to give them,

876
38:50.070 --> 38:51.690
they don't really like to receive them.

877
38:51.690 --> 38:53.340
It's just a terrible part

878
38:53.340 --> 38:55.440
of the employee experience right now.

879
38:55.440 --> 38:57.030
We all can think of that time when you got

880
38:57.030 --> 38:59.520
that performance review and your manager said that thing

881
38:59.520 --> 39:02.670
and then you spent all day worrying "What did they mean?"

882
39:02.670 --> 39:03.540
It's just a mess.

883
39:03.540 --> 39:04.920
It's really not...

884
39:04.920 --> 39:07.620
Most managers do not give good performance reviews.

885
39:07.620 --> 39:11.850
So, I completely agree here and here that we need

886
39:11.850 --> 39:13.410
to be really careful,

887
39:13.410 --> 39:16.800
because if the agent reviews me, what does that mean?

888
39:16.800 --> 39:18.330
Like, how do I take that?

889
39:18.330 --> 39:19.920
Okay, there's so much going on here.

890
39:19.920 --> 39:21.810
But I also want to say that in my opinion,

891
39:21.810 --> 39:25.290
and this is my personal opinion, speaking as an individual,

892
39:25.290 --> 39:28.950
I think that this could be an area where we can see a lot

893
39:28.950 --> 39:32.070
of empowerment and actually help

894
39:32.070 --> 39:34.560
the performance review process be something

895
39:34.560 --> 39:37.230
that is a co-collaboration between you and your manager,

896
39:37.230 --> 39:40.650
not the current more disempowering way we do it.

897
39:40.650 --> 39:42.570
<v ->And also reducing bias.</v>

898
39:42.570 --> 39:43.980
I mean, performance reviews,

899
39:43.980 --> 39:48.120
there's so much bias in just qualitative reviews,

900
39:48.120 --> 39:50.400
and that could be an excellent way

901
39:50.400 --> 39:52.380
to just kind of level the playing field.

902
39:52.380 --> 39:55.140
So I think about it as your AI is just your assistant,

903
39:55.140 --> 39:56.310
everyone has an assistant now,

904
39:56.310 --> 39:57.870
but you're still the human behind it,

905
39:57.870 --> 40:00.930
and this is just making it more equitable across the board.

906
40:00.930 --> 40:03.180
<v ->Real quick, one question, yep.</v>

907
40:03.180 --> 40:04.950
<v Audience Member>Hi, thank you for all of this.</v>

908
40:04.950 --> 40:06.240
It's been incredibly fascinating.

909
40:06.240 --> 40:09.090
I'm a professor at University of Texas

910
40:09.090 --> 40:14.090
and I'm currently working on how to incorporate AI

911
40:14.130 --> 40:16.440
and emerging technology into curriculum

912
40:16.440 --> 40:18.630
to prepare students for the job market.

913
40:18.630 --> 40:21.610
I'm curious to know from your perspectives

914
40:22.500 --> 40:27.500
how you see incoming new graduates perform in the workplace.

915
40:27.510 --> 40:30.720
Are they already leveraging AI technology?

916
40:30.720 --> 40:34.440
Do you find it to be something that is like, a massive

917
40:34.440 --> 40:38.490
important thing that they walk in with skills in AI already?

918
40:38.490 --> 40:41.730
Or are you planning on upskilling them as part

919
40:41.730 --> 40:45.060
of their introduction to their particular job?

920
40:45.060 --> 40:47.100
<v ->Yeah, I'll take it back from the university perspective.</v>

921
40:47.100 --> 40:50.970
So, for the first time in this quarter, in our surveying

922
40:50.970 --> 40:54.060
with industry, we are hearing that candidates who come

923
40:54.060 --> 40:58.080
to a job interview or apply for a job that talk about

924
40:58.080 --> 41:01.860
having exposure and and competency in these skills

925
41:01.860 --> 41:03.480
become more attractive candidates.

926
41:03.480 --> 41:04.440
First time we've heard that.

927
41:04.440 --> 41:06.300
So I think this is a trend that's only gonna continue

928
41:06.300 --> 41:07.650
that people are exposed.

929
41:07.650 --> 41:09.720
So we've turned that back into that

930
41:09.720 --> 41:11.820
we need to really build on literacy, you know,

931
41:11.820 --> 41:14.190
for every student, you know, along the way

932
41:14.190 --> 41:15.690
so that they have exposure to these tools,

933
41:15.690 --> 41:17.550
they understand how to use them,

934
41:17.550 --> 41:21.930
but also how understand how to use them properly, equitably,

935
41:21.930 --> 41:23.400
ethically, right?

936
41:23.400 --> 41:27.270
And in a way that enhances mankind or humankind, excuse me,

937
41:27.270 --> 41:30.450
versus just willy-nilly, right?

938
41:30.450 --> 41:32.340
We have that responsibility at a university.

939
41:32.340 --> 41:33.870
So I think, you know, we have a lot of things

940
41:33.870 --> 41:35.700
that we're doing to try to build in, you know,

941
41:35.700 --> 41:38.070
how do we build first literacy, then competency,

942
41:38.070 --> 41:41.310
and then for those that want to build true expertise in.

943
41:41.310 --> 41:43.290
But we're, as you know, working at university,

944
41:43.290 --> 41:46.020
it's a long way to get back to curricular reform,

945
41:46.020 --> 41:48.390
but we gotta start the process somewhere.

946
41:48.390 --> 41:50.040
Alright, with that, we're out of time for today.

947
41:50.040 --> 41:50.880
Thank you so much.

948
41:50.880 --> 41:53.620
Please join me in thanking our panelists.

949
41:53.620 --> 41:56.641
(audience applauds)

950
41:56.641 --> 41:59.724
(upbeat music plays)
