00:00.000 --> 00:02.583
(upbeat music)

00:10.770 --> 00:13.743
<v ->Well, welcome to our panel here.</v>

00:14.970 --> 00:17.880
Very honored to be here with this prestigious panel.

00:17.880 --> 00:18.990
My name is Chris Andrews.

00:18.990 --> 00:20.223
I'll be the moderator.

00:21.360 --> 00:24.600
I'm the director of mobility at Pratt Miller.

00:24.600 --> 00:27.990
We're a wholly owned subsidiary of Oshkosh Corporation.

00:27.990 --> 00:31.200
We do product development and technology integration

00:31.200 --> 00:34.110
on mobility and vehicles, so.

00:34.110 --> 00:36.420
But I'd like to have each one of our panelists here

00:36.420 --> 00:38.310
kinda say a little about them and what they do

00:38.310 --> 00:40.020
and then we'll kinda get into some questions.

00:40.020 --> 00:42.180
I think you're really gonna enjoy this.

00:42.180 --> 00:45.720
I already have in our pre-talks with these folks, so.

00:45.720 --> 00:47.850
<v ->Yeah, thank you. I'm excited to be here.</v>

00:47.850 --> 00:49.080
My name is Ossa Fisher.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.720
I am the president of Aurora Innovation,

00:51.720 --> 00:55.350
and we are deploying cars and trucks to drive themselves

00:55.350 --> 00:57.990
using the latest in AI breakthroughs.

00:57.990 --> 00:58.980
So excited to be here,

00:58.980 --> 01:02.490
and we've got some partnerships even on stage with NVIDIA,

01:02.490 --> 01:04.440
Volvo, Continental, and many more.

01:04.440 --> 01:05.640
So thanks for having me.

01:06.810 --> 01:08.400
<v ->Yeah, my name is Burkhard Huhnke,</v>

01:08.400 --> 01:10.770
a very German name, but German American.

01:10.770 --> 01:12.900
In the meantime, I live in San Francisco.

01:12.900 --> 01:15.960
I'm the CTO of Scout Motors.

01:15.960 --> 01:20.960
That is a new company built on the original brand Scout.

01:21.900 --> 01:25.050
Super exciting, fully funded by the Volkswagen Group.

01:25.050 --> 01:28.380
So that is very exciting to be here today

01:28.380 --> 01:30.930
to talk about some of the aspects

01:30.930 --> 01:31.860
we are using currently

01:31.860 --> 01:34.470
in the development phase concerning AI.

01:34.470 --> 01:35.550
So pleasure to be here.

01:35.550 --> 01:36.550
Thank you very much.

01:39.060 --> 01:40.907
<v ->So my name is Raquel Urtasun.</v>

01:40.907 --> 01:43.206
I'm the founder and CEO of Waabi.

01:43.206 --> 01:45.690
And what we do at Waabi is transforming the physical world

01:45.690 --> 01:47.100
with innovative AI,

01:47.100 --> 01:49.230
starting with self-driving trucks,

01:49.230 --> 01:51.660
and really a pleasure to be here today

01:51.660 --> 01:53.880
and very excited about, you know, the conversation

01:53.880 --> 01:54.980
that we're gonna have.

01:56.524 --> 01:58.110
<v ->Yeah, and Norm Marks from NVIDIA.</v>

01:58.110 --> 02:00.360
So I lead our automotive enterprise business,

02:00.360 --> 02:02.160
and since Ossa said it,

02:02.160 --> 02:04.230
of course, we also have a strong partnership

02:04.230 --> 02:06.360
not only with Aurora, but also with Waabi,

02:06.360 --> 02:08.820
and doing a lot of work together with everyone on the panel.

02:08.820 --> 02:12.300
So it'll be an exciting conversation for sure.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.370
<v ->Yeah, I feel this is a pretty pivotal year,</v>

02:14.370 --> 02:16.200
so let's jump right in.

02:16.200 --> 02:18.575
So Ossa, if we could start with you.

02:18.575 --> 02:20.347
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

02:20.347 --> 02:22.830
<v ->You operate in a very safety critical industry</v>

02:22.830 --> 02:23.883
to say the least.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.670
Performance is paramount in AI.

02:26.670 --> 02:28.350
How does Aurora ensure your systems

02:28.350 --> 02:30.450
are reliable, verifiable,

02:30.450 --> 02:32.160
and what practices do you use

02:32.160 --> 02:35.310
in your AI-driven autonomous technology?

02:35.310 --> 02:36.270
<v ->Yeah, thanks for bringing up</v>

02:36.270 --> 02:39.840
the safety critical nature of what we do.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.540
You know, a lot of the talk about AI

02:42.540 --> 02:45.030
over the last couple of years has been with the LLM,

02:45.030 --> 02:47.280
large language models, and ChatGPT,

02:47.280 --> 02:48.450
and that's extraordinary.

02:48.450 --> 02:50.520
I don't wanna diminish that at all.

02:50.520 --> 02:52.560
I think Jensen called that cloud AI.

02:52.560 --> 02:56.010
And while ChatGPT does incredible things,

02:56.010 --> 02:57.960
it generates the recipe.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.430
It doesn't cook the meal.

02:59.430 --> 03:01.320
And I think with physical AI,

03:01.320 --> 03:03.270
which is a new era that's coming in,

03:03.270 --> 03:05.910
we are, Aurora, with our trucks on the ground,

03:05.910 --> 03:07.230
on public roads,

03:07.230 --> 03:11.130
we are interacting with the real world in real time.

03:11.130 --> 03:14.490
And that just demands a different level of care

03:14.490 --> 03:18.090
than what you get from a ChatGPT output.

03:18.090 --> 03:21.900
And so we are using what we call verifiable AI

03:21.900 --> 03:25.688
and this has the benefits of what the LLMs are doing,

03:25.688 --> 03:27.690
these are the massive data models,

03:27.690 --> 03:32.160
and we use human-driven data to augment our models,

03:32.160 --> 03:34.290
but then we deploy guardrails.

03:34.290 --> 03:36.570
And so let me explain a little bit what that means

03:36.570 --> 03:37.800
to contextualize it.

03:37.800 --> 03:38.880
Let's take stop signs,

03:38.880 --> 03:40.950
four-way stop signs, two-way stop signs.

03:40.950 --> 03:42.840
We've got millions and millions of miles

03:42.840 --> 03:44.850
of driver data on that.

03:44.850 --> 03:47.940
But if any of you know the drivers on the road,

03:47.940 --> 03:50.250
I have a 16-year-old who just got her license,

03:50.250 --> 03:51.690
so I know this very well,

03:51.690 --> 03:54.480
humans don't always abide by those stop signs.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.670
In fact, we often roll them.

03:56.670 --> 03:59.850
And so if we're using an AI human-like model

03:59.850 --> 04:02.310
to determine how we navigate the roads,

04:02.310 --> 04:04.920
the Aurora Driver might occasionally roll a stop sign too.

04:04.920 --> 04:07.290
And for us, that would be very much out of alignment

04:07.290 --> 04:09.390
and, frankly, it's against the law.

04:09.390 --> 04:13.230
And so we supplement that model

04:13.230 --> 04:16.260
with guardrails that adhere to the rules of the road.

04:16.260 --> 04:18.750
This ensures that we won't break the law

04:18.750 --> 04:20.610
and is also really, really helpful

04:20.610 --> 04:22.170
when we're working with regulators

04:22.170 --> 04:26.359
to explain to them how we know that we'll behave safely

04:26.359 --> 04:28.500
regarding, you know, the code of conduct

04:28.500 --> 04:30.270
that we all expect from vehicles

04:30.270 --> 04:32.340
that are driving next to us.

04:32.340 --> 04:33.600
<v ->Yeah, no, thanks very much.</v>

04:33.600 --> 04:35.670
So Norm, after that,

04:35.670 --> 04:38.280
why don't we talk about AV 1 to AV 2 models

04:38.280 --> 04:40.080
and end-to-end world models.

04:40.080 --> 04:43.650
I think it's a good way to go into it next, so.

04:43.650 --> 04:45.660
<v ->Yeah, on the heels of the keynote,</v>

04:45.660 --> 04:47.190
and hopefully many of you were there,

04:47.190 --> 04:50.040
it's certainly a hot topic for us right now.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.960
Now, if you were to ask 10 people

04:51.960 --> 04:53.460
to describe AV 1.0 and AV 2.0,

04:54.400 --> 04:56.790
you'd probably get seven or eight different answers.

04:56.790 --> 04:59.400
And I'm not gonna suggest my explanation

04:59.400 --> 05:01.530
will be 100% perfect,

05:01.530 --> 05:03.120
but just to level set,

05:03.120 --> 05:06.510
when we think about AV 1.0 as we describe it,

05:06.510 --> 05:08.340
you know, think about 50 or more

05:08.340 --> 05:10.290
individual deep neural networks

05:10.290 --> 05:13.650
that are detecting certain things,

05:13.650 --> 05:15.180
like detecting a vehicle,

05:15.180 --> 05:18.180
detecting the distance between us and the next vehicle,

05:18.180 --> 05:20.670
detecting a pedestrian on the curb,

05:20.670 --> 05:23.730
detecting eye gaze, whether you're looking forward,

05:23.730 --> 05:26.250
I won't name all 50,

05:26.250 --> 05:30.360
but also trained on labeled image data.

05:30.360 --> 05:33.210
So certainly very effective in the early days,

05:33.210 --> 05:36.090
and as an industry, we're all learning what it's gonna take

05:36.090 --> 05:38.793
to actually get to safe self-driving,

05:40.530 --> 05:41.910
but what we've been learning

05:41.910 --> 05:45.390
is that certainly these models we think are super effective

05:45.390 --> 05:47.640
for Level 2 plus and Level 3.

05:47.640 --> 05:50.640
But in order to get to full Level 4 and beyond,

05:50.640 --> 05:52.200
we see the opportunity really

05:52.200 --> 05:54.660
is to move to this AV 2.0 model,

05:54.660 --> 05:57.030
which really I would describe simply

05:57.030 --> 06:00.360
as moving from individual DNNs

06:00.360 --> 06:03.360
and going beyond just having an ensemble of them,

06:03.360 --> 06:07.170
but actually having one very large, it turns out,

06:07.170 --> 06:09.900
end-to-end world foundation model.

06:09.900 --> 06:13.230
And some call it a VLM, some call it a multimodal LLM,

06:13.230 --> 06:16.050
but one end-to-end world foundation model.

06:16.050 --> 06:17.880
Of course, we're proud to have announce

06:17.880 --> 06:19.530
what we're releasing to the world now

06:19.530 --> 06:21.183
with Cosmos at our keynote.

06:22.350 --> 06:24.000
But, you know, the difference here

06:24.000 --> 06:26.430
is, of course, trained on video data.

06:26.430 --> 06:28.050
You know, our initial models trained

06:28.050 --> 06:30.390
on 20 million plus hours of data

06:30.390 --> 06:31.560
and all of our customers

06:31.560 --> 06:34.020
who will be leveraging the platform,

06:34.020 --> 06:36.060
some of which are up here,

06:36.060 --> 06:38.280
will be able to then use their own data

06:38.280 --> 06:40.440
to then further fine-tune it.

06:40.440 --> 06:43.080
But if I, you know, to a layperson,

06:43.080 --> 06:46.020
a simple way to think about the big distinction

06:46.020 --> 06:50.730
is that in AV 1.0, you're detecting a pedestrian

06:50.730 --> 06:54.390
and then acting based on what you see

06:54.390 --> 06:57.660
versus in an AV 2.0 world foundation model,

06:57.660 --> 07:02.040
that foundation model is actively predicting the next frame.

07:02.040 --> 07:05.820
So it's predicting will that pedestrian step off the curb

07:05.820 --> 07:09.390
or do we expect that pedestrian will stay on the curb?

07:09.390 --> 07:12.360
Will that vehicle cut over in front of us

07:12.360 --> 07:14.340
or will it stay in its lane?

07:14.340 --> 07:18.450
So the power of going from detecting to predicting

07:18.450 --> 07:20.340
we believe will go a very long way.

07:20.340 --> 07:23.340
So huge transformation underway.

07:23.340 --> 07:25.170
From a scale standpoint,

07:25.170 --> 07:28.770
AV 1.0 is a massive computational challenge.

07:28.770 --> 07:32.040
You know, a 50-car fleet collecting data

07:32.040 --> 07:33.960
is about two petabytes a day.

07:33.960 --> 07:36.330
But the data for AV 2.0,

07:36.330 --> 07:38.400
we're talking order of magnitudes

07:38.400 --> 07:40.890
of 50 to even 30 times larger.

07:40.890 --> 07:43.440
So significant challenge

07:43.440 --> 07:45.810
and happy to be a part of helping the industry forward

07:45.810 --> 07:47.400
along the way.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.980
<v ->Yeah, I mean, this is exciting stuff, so.</v>

07:49.980 --> 07:51.090
Raquel, can you tell us,

07:51.090 --> 07:54.120
now that we've gone into end-to-end world models,

07:54.120 --> 07:56.190
how your team is pioneering safety

07:56.190 --> 07:57.690
and how you're using them?

07:57.690 --> 08:00.710
<v ->Yeah, so now that we went from 1.0 I guess to 2.0,</v>

08:00.710 --> 08:03.030
as we continue on the discussion,

08:03.030 --> 08:06.960
yeah, so Waabi, you know, inspiring foundational models

08:06.960 --> 08:08.670
that can use multiple sensors,

08:08.670 --> 08:11.820
including LiDAR, cameras, radar, et cetera.

08:11.820 --> 08:13.440
And the way to think about our models

08:13.440 --> 08:17.280
is that you cannot just take, you know, an LLM or a BLM

08:17.280 --> 08:21.180
and say, you know, "Go and drive vehicles," right?

08:21.180 --> 08:22.110
That's not gonna be safe.

08:22.110 --> 08:24.030
So there is a few things that you need to do

08:24.030 --> 08:25.605
and very different architectures

08:25.605 --> 08:28.950
that you need to develop

08:28.950 --> 08:31.973
in order to have something that has three characteristics.

08:31.973 --> 08:34.200
It's able to be super efficient

08:34.200 --> 08:36.300
so that you can actually run it on the vehicles,

08:36.300 --> 08:37.133
as Norm was saying,

08:37.133 --> 08:39.330
and with very little compute.

08:39.330 --> 08:41.520
It's able to generalize to the unknown.

08:41.520 --> 08:45.150
This is something that, you know, LLMS are amazing

08:45.150 --> 08:47.550
at, you know, doing natural language,

08:47.550 --> 08:51.030
are amazing at answering questions, interfacing with humans,

08:51.030 --> 08:52.650
but oftentimes memorize.

08:52.650 --> 08:54.750
If you go a little bit out of distribution,

08:54.750 --> 08:55.620
they don't work very well.

08:55.620 --> 08:56.940
So we need to build technology

08:56.940 --> 09:01.080
that has the generalization property, you know, in nature.

09:01.080 --> 09:04.260
And the third bit is that for a safety-critical application

09:04.260 --> 09:05.880
like self-driving,

09:05.880 --> 09:08.370
you need it to be provably safe.

09:08.370 --> 09:09.420
Being safe is not enough.

09:09.420 --> 09:12.780
You should be able to verify and validate the system

09:12.780 --> 09:15.390
and that's what you get with Waabi's technology,

09:15.390 --> 09:18.372
which is very differentiated with other 2.0

09:18.372 --> 09:19.620
where you get the best of both worlds.

09:19.620 --> 09:21.390
You get the ability to verify,

09:21.390 --> 09:23.040
but you get the end-to-end power

09:23.040 --> 09:25.860
of next generation generative AI.

09:25.860 --> 09:27.240
And last bit I will say

09:27.240 --> 09:29.400
is that in order to beat the scaling loss,

09:29.400 --> 09:33.090
the thing that these systems have to do is reasoning, right?

09:33.090 --> 09:34.920
And we saw that on Jensen's keynote, right?

09:34.920 --> 09:37.140
Is that you start with, you know, pre-training,

09:37.140 --> 09:39.120
which is what you were talking about,

09:39.120 --> 09:40.410
then you fine-tune.

09:40.410 --> 09:42.000
Well, next generation is reasoning

09:42.000 --> 09:43.590
and that's what we really have been doing

09:43.590 --> 09:45.330
over the last three and a half years at Waabi

09:45.330 --> 09:47.850
is build AI systems that are end to end

09:47.850 --> 09:50.100
but are able to reason in a very, very effective manner

09:50.100 --> 09:52.260
so that the system can understand

09:52.260 --> 09:54.210
the consequences of these actions,

09:54.210 --> 09:57.720
can really decide, you know, all the possibilities

09:57.720 --> 09:58.680
that are possible, right?

09:58.680 --> 10:00.000
And decide what is the safest manner

10:00.000 --> 10:02.543
where at every point in time in a fraction of a second.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.870
<v ->Wow, that's incredible. Thank you.</v>

10:06.870 --> 10:08.250
<v ->So eloquent, right?</v>

10:08.250 --> 10:11.138
<v ->Yeah, (laughs) it really is.</v>

10:11.138 --> 10:12.450
You know, I think you guys were talking

10:12.450 --> 10:15.990
about how there is a, it's not a natural transition,

10:15.990 --> 10:19.020
but it's a break and a whole new way of doing things

10:19.020 --> 10:20.880
and I think that's what a lot of people

10:20.880 --> 10:21.960
need to get their arms around.

10:21.960 --> 10:23.220
It certainly took me a little while,

10:23.220 --> 10:25.500
but it's eye-opening.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.090
So Dr. Burkhard, you want to tell us,

10:27.090 --> 10:28.710
we've talked about AV,

10:28.710 --> 10:30.630
but are there other product development things?

10:30.630 --> 10:32.760
Tell us a little more about that.

10:32.760 --> 10:35.700
<v ->Yeah, let me take you away for a minute</v>

10:35.700 --> 10:38.040
from the exciting topic AV

10:38.040 --> 10:40.590
and explain to you how we are using AI

10:40.590 --> 10:42.630
in the development process.

10:42.630 --> 10:45.510
We talk about the digital twins, as everyone knows.

10:45.510 --> 10:49.020
It's a very interesting fashion word, but what does it mean?

10:49.020 --> 10:54.020
It's actually a replica of the physical surrounding

10:54.330 --> 10:59.130
by creating a digital twin of your existing physics systems.

10:59.130 --> 11:02.010
If you do that, and that's what we've done at Scout Motors

11:02.010 --> 11:02.880
from the beginning on

11:02.880 --> 11:04.710
because that has huge opportunities

11:04.710 --> 11:06.450
and it's actually a digital revolution

11:06.450 --> 11:09.540
which is ongoing there from my perspective.

11:09.540 --> 11:11.340
If you think about the physics

11:11.340 --> 11:13.590
and the science behind the car,

11:13.590 --> 11:16.680
it's all about a differential equation solution.

11:16.680 --> 11:19.170
So if you think about traditional CFD,

11:19.170 --> 11:23.490
which is computational fluid dynamics simulation,

11:23.490 --> 11:26.160
how you would do aerodynamics in the past,

11:26.160 --> 11:27.780
now you have the AI,

11:27.780 --> 11:29.970
you can run machine learning,

11:29.970 --> 11:33.360
and you optimize your system with GPU power

11:33.360 --> 11:35.940
and optimize methods very quickly.

11:35.940 --> 11:37.440
So that allows you, actually,

11:37.440 --> 11:40.560
to use physical prototypes very early in the phase.

11:40.560 --> 11:43.860
Now, you can go through every physics of the car,

11:43.860 --> 11:46.650
besides fluid dynamics,

11:46.650 --> 11:47.700
besides aerodynamics,

11:47.700 --> 11:50.220
you can go into the structure of the car itself.

11:50.220 --> 11:51.540
That's a safety structure.

11:51.540 --> 11:54.600
You can optimize the materials

11:54.600 --> 11:56.070
and you can optimize the structure,

11:56.070 --> 11:59.970
actually can learn from previous tests, crash tests,

11:59.970 --> 12:01.470
and build that into your modeling.

12:01.470 --> 12:04.980
So you have instantly a feedback loop closed

12:04.980 --> 12:07.950
with a real-life data which you have to feed in.

12:07.950 --> 12:10.800
In example, for the wind tunnel testing,

12:10.800 --> 12:13.770
you need sensors to feed in the data

12:13.770 --> 12:18.547
and feed the model with AI and ML data

12:19.440 --> 12:21.390
to make it better and more precise.

12:21.390 --> 12:25.320
So you're receiving in the meantime an accuracy of 99%,

12:25.320 --> 12:27.630
which is ridiculous high.

12:27.630 --> 12:30.480
Now, you can imagine we are not replacing the designer.

12:30.480 --> 12:33.240
So Chris Benjamin, if you are here,

12:33.240 --> 12:36.450
our beautiful Scout Motors design hasn't been designed by AI

12:36.450 --> 12:37.500
and will never.

12:37.500 --> 12:40.800
So, but it's something in between science and arts,

12:40.800 --> 12:42.810
and how can we expedite the process

12:42.810 --> 12:45.000
behind the development and engineering

12:45.000 --> 12:48.510
of these beautiful, a surface,

12:48.510 --> 12:51.360
is an optimized underlying structure

12:51.360 --> 12:54.240
to be weight optimized, structural optimized,

12:54.240 --> 12:56.970
safety optimized, thermal optimized, and so on.

12:56.970 --> 13:00.510
So I think we are leading these kind of efforts

13:00.510 --> 13:02.220
within the Scout Motors organization.

13:02.220 --> 13:05.020
We have done very successfully

13:06.210 --> 13:08.190
reduction from iteration loops

13:08.190 --> 13:11.190
from 24 hours down to five seconds

13:11.190 --> 13:13.920
in the underbody airflow optimization.

13:13.920 --> 13:17.520
Now we are tackling the safety relevant components

13:17.520 --> 13:19.890
on the crash test dynamic.

13:19.890 --> 13:23.040
And, of course, that's ongoing in every physics of the car,

13:23.040 --> 13:25.200
durability testing, fatigue analysis.

13:25.200 --> 13:29.310
Everything is now coming into this world

13:29.310 --> 13:31.290
by adding AI and machine learning

13:31.290 --> 13:32.700
and that is just great.

13:32.700 --> 13:34.320
So back to you, Chris.

13:34.320 --> 13:38.133
<v ->Yeah, and I mean, from 24 hours to five seconds,</v>

13:39.480 --> 13:41.820
this is what CES is about, right?

13:41.820 --> 13:45.030
So I think this is a pivotal year.

13:45.030 --> 13:46.353
So, anyway.

13:47.703 --> 13:48.870
Ossa, can you tell us

13:48.870 --> 13:52.530
how you're using all of this technology

13:52.530 --> 13:55.710
to help in the safety of your real-world scenarios,

13:55.710 --> 13:56.607
testing?
<v ->Yeah.</v>

13:56.607 --> 13:58.110
And I wanna build on what Burkhard said.

13:58.110 --> 14:00.360
Simulation is critical to what we do.

14:00.360 --> 14:02.910
And echoing Jensen from his keynote,

14:02.910 --> 14:04.110
you know, there's the learning model

14:04.110 --> 14:06.300
that's continually ingesting data

14:06.300 --> 14:08.190
and refining what it's doing.

14:08.190 --> 14:10.080
And then for us in the physical world,

14:10.080 --> 14:12.330
there's obviously the compute that exists on the truck

14:12.330 --> 14:14.940
and is navigating real-world situations.

14:14.940 --> 14:17.550
And in that middle is the digital twin,

14:17.550 --> 14:19.290
which Burkhard referenced as well.

14:19.290 --> 14:22.230
And so simulation is core

14:22.230 --> 14:24.600
to how we're developing the Aurora Driver.

14:24.600 --> 14:27.270
But we've been on this journey for a number of years

14:27.270 --> 14:28.530
and we've learned a few things.

14:28.530 --> 14:31.080
So simulation in and of itself

14:31.080 --> 14:32.820
is not actually a test, right?

14:32.820 --> 14:35.160
You actually have to be able to grade the simulation,

14:35.160 --> 14:35.993
and when you're talking

14:35.993 --> 14:38.430
about billions upon billions of simulations,

14:38.430 --> 14:39.960
how do you know which ones are passing

14:39.960 --> 14:40.830
and which ones aren't?

14:40.830 --> 14:43.380
And so one of the latest developments at Aurora

14:43.380 --> 14:46.590
is we're using AI to grade the test

14:46.590 --> 14:47.850
because no human,

14:47.850 --> 14:51.090
and go back 15 years, humans were grading the simulations.

14:51.090 --> 14:55.020
Now we can use AI to grade the simulations.

14:55.020 --> 14:58.350
But we see simulation as an and, not an or.

14:58.350 --> 15:01.890
We couple simulation with real-world experience on the road,

15:01.890 --> 15:04.200
we're on the road in Texas every day,

15:04.200 --> 15:07.380
to navigate the more mundane lane changes, stop signs,

15:07.380 --> 15:08.850
that I referenced earlier.

15:08.850 --> 15:10.320
But we also do track testing.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.720
And just to put this into perspective,

15:12.720 --> 15:13.980
why would you need track testing

15:13.980 --> 15:16.740
in addition to simulation and real-world driving?

15:16.740 --> 15:19.290
Well, take a blown tire for example, right?

15:19.290 --> 15:20.550
We can simulate that,

15:20.550 --> 15:21.570
but what we really need

15:21.570 --> 15:23.430
is that the hardware components are integrated

15:23.430 --> 15:24.810
with the software components,

15:24.810 --> 15:27.060
seeing and responding correctly.

15:27.060 --> 15:30.540
So on a test track, we can blow out the tire

15:30.540 --> 15:33.300
and verify that the simulation

15:33.300 --> 15:36.690
actually did respond to it as appropriate

15:36.690 --> 15:37.830
and that the truck itself

15:37.830 --> 15:40.230
also sees and responds appropriately.

15:40.230 --> 15:41.700
One other way we use a test track

15:41.700 --> 15:43.410
is we are running simulations,

15:43.410 --> 15:46.770
and odd, but you see this more than you would think,

15:46.770 --> 15:49.830
motorcycles going at 80 to a hundred miles per hour

15:49.830 --> 15:52.020
in between lanes on freeways.

15:52.020 --> 15:54.360
The simulation seemed to be catching it,

15:54.360 --> 15:55.500
but when we were in the real world,

15:55.500 --> 15:57.967
our safety drivers were saying,

15:57.967 --> 16:00.990
"We're not sure we're seeing that far enough in advance."

16:00.990 --> 16:02.370
And so we went to the test track

16:02.370 --> 16:05.340
and actually hired a stunt driver, pretty incredible,

16:05.340 --> 16:06.840
who started at 10 miles an hour

16:06.840 --> 16:09.030
and then built up to a hundred miles an hour

16:09.030 --> 16:11.700
to confirm that the perception system

16:11.700 --> 16:13.740
was in fact working accurately

16:13.740 --> 16:15.120
and that our motion planning system,

16:15.120 --> 16:16.980
which is responding to that actor,

16:16.980 --> 16:18.210
was also doing it correctly.

16:18.210 --> 16:21.270
So we see these all working in synergy

16:21.270 --> 16:24.300
and that simulation is a fundamental piece of that.

16:24.300 --> 16:25.590
<v ->Yeah, that's amazing.</v>

16:25.590 --> 16:28.080
And the simulation and the models are only good

16:28.080 --> 16:28.950
when they're validated, right?

16:28.950 --> 16:30.090
<v ->Correct, yeah.</v>

16:30.090 --> 16:31.980
<v ->And then the system gets a lot more information</v>

16:31.980 --> 16:33.180
and it gets better overall.

16:33.180 --> 16:35.010
Yeah, that's amazing.

16:35.010 --> 16:37.530
Raquel, we know we've talked about safety

16:37.530 --> 16:38.460
and how critical it is.

16:38.460 --> 16:41.460
Tell us how you're using simulation

16:41.460 --> 16:44.040
in similar or dissimilar ways.

16:44.040 --> 16:46.442
<v ->Yeah, great segue I guess,</v>

16:46.442 --> 16:50.160
you know, to what Ossa was saying.

16:50.160 --> 16:52.890
So we are a simulation-first company.

16:52.890 --> 16:55.500
So what does it mean is that in the era of AI,

16:55.500 --> 16:58.890
in the era of innovative AI,

16:58.890 --> 17:01.620
data is extremely important, as Norm was saying.

17:01.620 --> 17:04.380
And what we can do with neural simulators

17:04.380 --> 17:06.360
is really get to a level of fidelity

17:06.360 --> 17:08.760
that has never been seen before.

17:08.760 --> 17:10.470
And what is great with simulation

17:10.470 --> 17:13.740
is that you don't need to wait for nature

17:13.740 --> 17:14.820
to show you things.

17:14.820 --> 17:17.460
You can actually create all those simulations.

17:17.460 --> 17:18.840
And more importantly,

17:18.840 --> 17:21.630
since our neural simulator is an AI system

17:21.630 --> 17:24.000
and the software stack is another AI system,

17:24.000 --> 17:26.100
they can actually play games.

17:26.100 --> 17:27.900
And the particular game that is very interesting

17:27.900 --> 17:29.970
is the one where they play adversary.

17:29.970 --> 17:33.210
What does that mean is that the simulator is trying

17:33.210 --> 17:35.940
to create things that are very difficult to handle

17:35.940 --> 17:38.340
for the software stack,

17:38.340 --> 17:39.300
for the virtual driver,

17:39.300 --> 17:42.690
so that every data point is extremely informative.

17:42.690 --> 17:43.740
Why is this important?

17:43.740 --> 17:46.290
Because suddenly you can actually train the systems

17:46.290 --> 17:49.500
at a tiny fraction of the cost that otherwise you will.

17:49.500 --> 17:52.350
So it's not anymore about billions of simulations.

17:52.350 --> 17:56.250
It's really about which simulation is more informative.

17:56.250 --> 17:57.300
The other thing that is,

17:57.300 --> 17:59.340
you know, when you talk about simulation that is important

17:59.340 --> 18:02.880
is that, well, simulation by itself sounds cool,

18:02.880 --> 18:07.170
but it's not sufficient, as was I saying,

18:07.170 --> 18:10.680
unless there is one key thing that you need to do,

18:10.680 --> 18:13.980
which is if you can prove that your simulator,

18:13.980 --> 18:15.450
like, driving with the same software,

18:15.450 --> 18:18.240
the entire software stack, on simulation

18:18.240 --> 18:20.790
is the same as driving in the real world.

18:20.790 --> 18:24.540
Then suddenly you actually have that ultimate driving test

18:24.540 --> 18:26.370
because on the cloud, at the scale,

18:26.370 --> 18:27.660
you can expose the system

18:27.660 --> 18:30.540
to all the different scenario, situations, et cetera.

18:30.540 --> 18:33.720
And that's what we build at Waabi with Waabi World,

18:33.720 --> 18:36.420
really pushing that neural simulator to the next level.

18:36.420 --> 18:38.700
And it's been an incredible accelerator

18:38.700 --> 18:41.130
to make us super capital efficient

18:41.130 --> 18:44.940
and requiring, you know, driving in the physical world

18:44.940 --> 18:47.040
only for validation of the system

18:47.040 --> 18:50.160
versus just general development.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.930
Yeah, so it's been an incredible thing

18:51.930 --> 18:56.040
and I think as we go into the physical AI era

18:56.040 --> 18:58.860
of 2025 and beyond,

18:58.860 --> 19:01.950
we are gonna see more and more neural simulators

19:01.950 --> 19:03.513
really take over the world.

19:04.650 --> 19:05.483
<v ->Oh, that's exciting.</v>

19:05.483 --> 19:08.760
And it's kind of like,

19:08.760 --> 19:10.950
the tools you're having in your toolbox

19:10.950 --> 19:12.480
are much more powerful now, right?

19:12.480 --> 19:15.420
And I think we're just gonna find out a lot more things

19:15.420 --> 19:18.120
that we're able to do moving forward, right?

19:18.120 --> 19:19.923
So Norm, to you.

19:20.790 --> 19:24.300
We've talked about AI in autonomy

19:24.300 --> 19:26.550
and development and digital twins.

19:26.550 --> 19:29.310
Does it have any bearing in other robotics or AMRs

19:29.310 --> 19:32.520
or manufacturing inspections or other places?

19:32.520 --> 19:34.200
<v ->Sure, I'll come on to that,</v>

19:34.200 --> 19:36.870
but if you don't mind, before I do, just a couple comments

19:36.870 --> 19:39.690
about what Ossa and Raquel were talking about.

19:39.690 --> 19:40.523
<v ->Please.</v>

19:41.370 --> 19:44.130
<v ->One of the beauties of these foundation models too,</v>

19:44.130 --> 19:45.600
and you were alluding to this,

19:45.600 --> 19:47.430
but just to put a finer point on it,

19:47.430 --> 19:49.680
is that they can be useful

19:49.680 --> 19:53.340
not just for training the actual self-driving software,

19:53.340 --> 19:58.320
but actually being used to create the controllable scenarios

19:58.320 --> 20:00.630
against which you would then run a simulation.

20:00.630 --> 20:03.180
So just to build on that

20:03.180 --> 20:05.490
to try and make sure the point is clear,

20:05.490 --> 20:07.620
these foundation models can literally take

20:07.620 --> 20:09.360
just nine frames of data

20:09.360 --> 20:11.660
and then build out the rest of a driving scene

20:12.630 --> 20:15.930
and complete the rest of what you would expect would happen.

20:15.930 --> 20:18.000
But then, and you were referring to this

20:18.000 --> 20:19.770
when you said a neural simulator,

20:19.770 --> 20:22.170
when you apply what's called neural reconstruction,

20:22.170 --> 20:23.280
the field of AI,

20:23.280 --> 20:26.430
we take this now snippet that we have

20:26.430 --> 20:28.380
and now we recreate it

20:28.380 --> 20:31.410
in potentially thousands of different scenarios.

20:31.410 --> 20:34.440
So a drive that might have been in the day

20:34.440 --> 20:36.450
in the neighborhood

20:36.450 --> 20:39.090
could start out the different times of day

20:39.090 --> 20:40.680
to sunrise to sunset

20:40.680 --> 20:42.450
to the different environmental conditions,

20:42.450 --> 20:43.830
rain, snow, wind,

20:43.830 --> 20:45.840
to even taking that drive

20:45.840 --> 20:48.870
and actually having it turn into a drive on the highway.

20:48.870 --> 20:51.240
And this gives us so much promise

20:51.240 --> 20:55.230
to create the millions of scenarios that we need to test for

20:55.230 --> 20:56.550
to ensure that we also test

20:56.550 --> 20:58.620
for all these rare and dangerous corner cases.

20:58.620 --> 21:00.810
So there's just so much promise here

21:00.810 --> 21:02.310
and we've got some real leaders

21:02.310 --> 21:04.443
who are doing great work in the space.

21:05.610 --> 21:07.617
So I think the question was AI

21:07.617 --> 21:08.736
in manufacturing-
<v ->No, I mean, actually-</v>

21:08.736 --> 21:09.940
<v ->And robotics.</v>
<v ->It's extremely,</v>

21:09.940 --> 21:11.550
yeah, that's extremely important.

21:11.550 --> 21:13.350
I think that this is the key

21:13.350 --> 21:14.640
to what we're talking about here today.

21:14.640 --> 21:17.070
So thanks for adding to that and clarifying it.

21:17.070 --> 21:20.820
But yeah, in other forms of AMRs

21:20.820 --> 21:22.860
or other robotic areas,

21:22.860 --> 21:24.870
you know, we've talked about on-road things here,

21:24.870 --> 21:28.200
but this technology can be used in many places

21:28.200 --> 21:29.790
and is used in many places.

21:29.790 --> 21:32.190
So manufacturing inspection,

21:32.190 --> 21:35.040
manufacturing in general, other robotics.

21:35.040 --> 21:36.690
<v ->Yeah, let me speak to that.</v>

21:36.690 --> 21:38.520
Probably the easiest place to start

21:38.520 --> 21:43.520
is an AGR/AMV is effectively very, very similar

21:43.920 --> 21:45.900
to training an autonomous vehicle.

21:45.900 --> 21:49.260
You know, a robot that's going to transport parts around

21:49.260 --> 21:50.093
in a factory

21:50.093 --> 21:52.980
needs to be able to see what machines are in the factory,

21:52.980 --> 21:54.810
the proper path to take.

21:54.810 --> 21:57.180
And so this is actually quite similar

21:57.180 --> 21:59.250
to autonomous vehicles,

21:59.250 --> 22:03.810
but humanoids are a whole nother level of complexity.

22:03.810 --> 22:05.910
Being able to train a humanoid robot

22:05.910 --> 22:10.290
to complete tasks that we do that are extremely precise.

22:10.290 --> 22:14.760
Obviously autonomous vehicles have to be extremely precise,

22:14.760 --> 22:18.090
but a humanoid robot has to be able to pick and place things

22:18.090 --> 22:21.180
at such a level of precision and accuracy

22:21.180 --> 22:24.120
that the complexity of this is extremely difficult.

22:24.120 --> 22:26.970
And again, another place where these foundation models

22:26.970 --> 22:28.140
can be used to run through

22:28.140 --> 22:31.140
all the various different conditions.

22:31.140 --> 22:35.970
And so now imagine I have a humanoid robot,

22:35.970 --> 22:38.160
it's actually picking a part off,

22:38.160 --> 22:41.580
it's putting it into a bin for a good part

22:41.580 --> 22:43.710
or a bin for a bad part,

22:43.710 --> 22:45.390
and then you alluded to this,

22:45.390 --> 22:48.120
now I have AI-driven inspection

22:48.120 --> 22:49.770
that's actually viewing the part

22:49.770 --> 22:52.200
to determine did the robot actually do

22:52.200 --> 22:54.120
that task properly or not?

22:54.120 --> 22:56.400
Did it potentially place a part

22:56.400 --> 22:59.670
that was defective into the green box, not the red box,

22:59.670 --> 23:01.080
to oversimplify it?

23:01.080 --> 23:03.030
And so that's the power of the AI.

23:03.030 --> 23:07.800
So camera-based inspection, not just human-based inspection,

23:07.800 --> 23:10.830
which has improvements in the efficiency,

23:10.830 --> 23:13.200
the accuracy of the quality,

23:13.200 --> 23:15.270
but also, it'll speed up throughput too.

23:15.270 --> 23:18.660
So AI can be used for this as well.

23:18.660 --> 23:20.760
Probably sounding like a broken record.

23:20.760 --> 23:23.970
As you might imagine, a foundation model can help train

23:23.970 --> 23:27.630
all the various different combinations that you might see.

23:27.630 --> 23:30.063
So terrific opportunities there.

23:30.960 --> 23:32.220
And then a final comment,

23:32.220 --> 23:35.700
just building on some of the earlier comments that he made,

23:35.700 --> 23:39.930
you know, GPU accelerating a CAE or a CFD workload

23:39.930 --> 23:41.700
is super important.

23:41.700 --> 23:44.520
And in the space that we're going to with electric vehicles,

23:44.520 --> 23:45.840
the coefficient of drag

23:45.840 --> 23:47.940
to be able to get the most out of a battery

23:47.940 --> 23:49.560
is hugely important.

23:49.560 --> 23:52.650
And so what we're seeing many of our customers move to,

23:52.650 --> 23:54.810
and it was a small part of the keynote,

23:54.810 --> 23:57.630
but one part of the announcement we also made

23:57.630 --> 23:59.850
is a blueprint that we're doing in this space

23:59.850 --> 24:03.450
where you can actually take physics-based AI

24:03.450 --> 24:06.090
and run it in a digital twin

24:06.090 --> 24:10.560
with, you know, nines, if you will, levels of accuracy

24:10.560 --> 24:13.440
that approximate the same level of accuracy

24:13.440 --> 24:15.060
you get with CAE and CFD,

24:15.060 --> 24:19.200
but in real time, imagine seeing the coefficient of drag

24:19.200 --> 24:21.030
and moving it around on a part

24:21.030 --> 24:23.460
and seeing the various different combinations

24:23.460 --> 24:25.980
and iterating on the design

24:25.980 --> 24:30.980
and literally, you think, was it 24 hours to five seconds?

24:31.109 --> 24:33.300
<v Burkhard>Five seconds.</v>

24:33.300 --> 24:35.220
<v ->Okay, but now we're potentially taking months</v>

24:35.220 --> 24:36.480
out of the design cycle

24:36.480 --> 24:39.060
because we're iterating at high levels of accuracy.

24:39.060 --> 24:43.350
You still will put it through the final CAE and CFD

24:43.350 --> 24:45.360
to have 100% accuracy,

24:45.360 --> 24:47.820
but you can make many, many changes along the way

24:47.820 --> 24:50.550
that normally, it literally takes months out of the process.

24:50.550 --> 24:51.540
<v ->I'd love to build on that</v>

24:51.540 --> 24:53.820
because I think this world of physical AI

24:53.820 --> 24:55.350
requires physics AI,

24:55.350 --> 24:57.240
and if you think about self-driving,

24:57.240 --> 24:59.190
everything from inertia to gravity

24:59.190 --> 25:01.140
to wind speed are critical.

25:01.140 --> 25:03.153
And so for the AI to be able to generate that,

25:03.153 --> 25:07.110
that opens up a whole new era of speed for the industry.

25:07.110 --> 25:08.550
And I think we're just at the beginning

25:08.550 --> 25:10.773
of seeing the potential of physics AI.

25:11.850 --> 25:12.840
<v ->Now this is exciting.</v>

25:12.840 --> 25:15.210
And the more data you feed these models,

25:15.210 --> 25:16.320
the better they get, right?

25:16.320 --> 25:20.820
So having critical information is gonna be great to,

25:20.820 --> 25:22.680
these are gonna get stronger and stronger

25:22.680 --> 25:24.690
and the tool's gonna get stronger.

25:24.690 --> 25:25.770
So Burkhard, on that,

25:25.770 --> 25:26.850
why don't you tell us a little bit

25:26.850 --> 25:29.580
about how you're doing exactly what was just talked about.

25:29.580 --> 25:31.129
<v ->Oh, actually, we're doing it.</v>

25:31.129 --> 25:32.767
<v ->Yeah, yeah, that's what I mean.</v>

25:32.767 --> 25:33.690
<v ->Yeah, let's hear it.</v>

25:33.690 --> 25:36.240
<v ->Actually, Norman, we should talk.</v>

25:36.240 --> 25:39.063
You wouldn't believe, but it's actually working.

25:39.990 --> 25:44.310
So a digital wind tunnel to do a digital release

25:44.310 --> 25:46.113
is, of course, division, right?

25:47.280 --> 25:50.850
That instant information from iteration loop

25:50.850 --> 25:52.890
of the spoiler optimization

25:52.890 --> 25:57.210
allows you an instant iteration loop to optimize, yeah?

25:57.210 --> 25:59.670
That is just aerodynamics,

25:59.670 --> 26:01.533
but the structural optimization.

26:02.460 --> 26:05.220
Going into the virtual prototyping phase,

26:05.220 --> 26:07.410
replacing physical prototypes,

26:07.410 --> 26:10.710
which cost you a million per prototype,

26:10.710 --> 26:14.250
not just talking about compressing the timeline

26:14.250 --> 26:15.360
of the development process,

26:15.360 --> 26:17.040
probably not every time necessary,

26:17.040 --> 26:19.380
but the release of every car.

26:19.380 --> 26:22.170
And if it's just software and functionality,

26:22.170 --> 26:26.580
this has to be tested with these new modern AI models

26:26.580 --> 26:28.140
'cause with the lessons learned,

26:28.140 --> 26:30.750
as everyone knows from the personal life,

26:30.750 --> 26:33.510
with your experience, you do different decisions.

26:33.510 --> 26:36.000
So how do you train also this process

26:36.000 --> 26:39.720
of, let's say, software leads with lessons learned

26:39.720 --> 26:43.440
and information that you're not launching cars

26:43.440 --> 26:45.180
with software bugs anymore?

26:45.180 --> 26:47.190
So it's a lot of potential.

26:47.190 --> 26:49.620
We use it, back to the Scout Motors world,

26:49.620 --> 26:53.010
in regards to aerodynamics and structural analysis

26:53.010 --> 26:55.140
in the fatigue analysis.

26:55.140 --> 27:00.140
So we are expecting a digital release

27:00.270 --> 27:02.430
before we have the physical release.

27:02.430 --> 27:07.050
And that's replacing a lot of very expensive iteration loops

27:07.050 --> 27:08.490
through physical testing.

27:08.490 --> 27:10.020
We'll always have to proof

27:10.020 --> 27:13.530
because the customer is not driving models, digital models.

27:13.530 --> 27:16.080
The customer is going to drive beautiful cars.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.960
But to get to the point to release that

27:18.960 --> 27:21.180
in a very reliable and robust way,

27:21.180 --> 27:23.550
that is the toolbox we are using

27:23.550 --> 27:25.560
very successfully already, yeah?

27:25.560 --> 27:28.200
And again, back to the timing, I think at 24 hours,

27:28.200 --> 27:31.440
that was when we started with that simulation,

27:31.440 --> 27:33.960
now we had five seconds after 12 months.

27:33.960 --> 27:37.800
Now, talking with you about the right GPU power,

27:37.800 --> 27:40.503
this is instant information you can get.

27:41.490 --> 27:42.690
<v ->Yeah, it's exciting.</v>

27:42.690 --> 27:43.890
I know we've talked about,

27:43.890 --> 27:46.200
I've talked with many others including yourselves

27:46.200 --> 27:50.160
that these tools now, sometimes, not always,

27:50.160 --> 27:52.140
that first digital twin model

27:52.140 --> 27:56.070
can actually be extremely close to the first drivable model.

27:56.070 --> 27:59.400
I've heard people that are, you know, within

27:59.400 --> 28:00.720
a few percentiles

28:00.720 --> 28:04.440
of driver dynamics, feel, aerodynamics,

28:04.440 --> 28:05.670
even in the virtual world.

28:05.670 --> 28:06.510
Doesn't always happen,

28:06.510 --> 28:08.610
but the stronger these tools get,

28:08.610 --> 28:09.810
the more that will happen.

28:09.810 --> 28:10.643
Was there something you wanna add there?

28:10.643 --> 28:11.910
Go ahead.
<v ->I just had to say,</v>

28:11.910 --> 28:14.730
as an enthusiast who's been in automotive my whole life,

28:14.730 --> 28:17.160
and by the way, if anyone is in the audience

28:17.160 --> 28:17.993
that knows me well,

28:17.993 --> 28:19.950
likes to drive quite fast,

28:19.950 --> 28:21.750
probably shouldn't say that out loud,

28:21.750 --> 28:24.870
but the other thing that's super exciting to me

28:24.870 --> 28:26.900
on a personal and professional level

28:26.900 --> 28:28.230
is the virtual wind tunnel,

28:28.230 --> 28:31.260
which is exactly the right way to describe it.

28:31.260 --> 28:34.740
Imagine the future of Formula One and Formula E

28:34.740 --> 28:37.050
where, you know, they have so many regulations

28:37.050 --> 28:39.720
on what they're able to test and not test,

28:39.720 --> 28:42.840
but to be able to apply this physics-based AI

28:42.840 --> 28:45.300
and be able to iterate, not in race mind you,

28:45.300 --> 28:46.710
but, you know, post-race,

28:46.710 --> 28:47.790
to be able to learn from it

28:47.790 --> 28:50.143
and test out the various different combinations

28:50.143 --> 28:52.110
of the angle of the vehicle,

28:52.110 --> 28:53.790
this is gonna be really fun to watch.

28:53.790 --> 28:57.000
<v ->So I can say from a Pratt Miller perspective,</v>

28:57.000 --> 28:58.590
being in motorsports,

28:58.590 --> 29:00.960
that is already very exciting.

29:00.960 --> 29:02.520
In driver-in-the-loop simulators,

29:02.520 --> 29:03.990
being able to drive these things,

29:03.990 --> 29:05.760
development of a new car.

29:05.760 --> 29:08.940
One of the people I mentioned was one of our teams

29:08.940 --> 29:10.710
and they got to the track

29:10.710 --> 29:12.120
and drove the car for the first time

29:12.120 --> 29:15.090
and it was within 2, 3% of what it was supposed to be.

29:15.090 --> 29:16.800
So it really is amazing tools

29:16.800 --> 29:18.840
and they're only gonna get stronger, so, yeah.

29:18.840 --> 29:22.530
<v ->Yeah, so if I can add something to this,</v>

29:22.530 --> 29:24.357
you know, a great conversation

29:24.357 --> 29:27.150
and definitely all in on what you guys are saying,

29:27.150 --> 29:29.400
but I think one thing that we haven't talked about

29:29.400 --> 29:30.450
that is very exciting

29:30.450 --> 29:33.660
is that it's obvious digital twins are extremely important

29:33.660 --> 29:36.210
and have enabled, as you were saying,

29:36.210 --> 29:39.780
you know, massive unlocks for folks like yourself.

29:39.780 --> 29:42.840
But what is very, you know, even kind of the next level now

29:42.840 --> 29:43.673
that we are seeing

29:43.673 --> 29:47.130
is that these digital twins were built by humans before

29:47.130 --> 29:49.590
where you have, you know, humans, artists,

29:49.590 --> 29:53.310
creating, you know, super detailed car models, et cetera,

29:53.310 --> 29:57.660
that then you use to, you know, learn,

29:57.660 --> 29:59.010
you know, to run the simulations

29:59.010 --> 30:02.130
and use that training data to then do simulations.

30:02.130 --> 30:05.550
So still, the bottleneck was on the creation of the content.

30:05.550 --> 30:06.870
What is really exciting now

30:06.870 --> 30:10.020
is that we can create that content also automatically,

30:10.020 --> 30:11.700
and then suddenly you have,

30:11.700 --> 30:13.140
you know, the next generation of analog,

30:13.140 --> 30:16.113
which is all the simulations are grounded in reality.

30:16.950 --> 30:18.780
And, you know, we see so many things.

30:18.780 --> 30:19.980
You know, when we drive,

30:20.844 --> 30:24.690
we do commercial runs in Texas, you know, on a daily basis,

30:24.690 --> 30:25.890
every time that you are on the road,

30:25.890 --> 30:27.600
you see thousands and thousands of vehicles.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.460
So we can clone everything automatically

30:29.460 --> 30:32.940
and then that's automatically part of the simulator.

30:32.940 --> 30:34.140
So this really enables you

30:34.140 --> 30:36.090
to go to the next level of scale

30:36.090 --> 30:38.520
and with a level of realism that's unprecedented.

30:38.520 --> 30:41.220
And I think that is really, really exciting

30:41.220 --> 30:43.442
and, you know, not only for automotive,

30:43.442 --> 30:45.533
but all the applications beyond that,

30:45.533 --> 30:47.793
that is really gonna revolutionize the world.

30:50.161 --> 30:50.994
<v ->Well said.</v>

30:50.994 --> 30:51.827
<v ->No, that's great.</v>

30:51.827 --> 30:53.850
And I think we've got a little time left,

30:53.850 --> 30:56.310
but I'd like you all to give us kind of your summary

30:56.310 --> 30:59.400
of past, present, future in artificial intelligence

30:59.400 --> 31:02.430
and just general technology advancements.

31:02.430 --> 31:05.910
And, you know, the interesting part about this

31:05.910 --> 31:08.280
is it's not technology for technology's sake,

31:08.280 --> 31:10.320
this is really making a difference

31:10.320 --> 31:13.050
in people's lives and safety and a lot of other things.

31:13.050 --> 31:16.110
So if each one of you could give us a little bit

31:16.110 --> 31:16.943
of your perspective,

31:16.943 --> 31:18.150
where we've been, where we're going,

31:18.150 --> 31:19.950
and what to expect.

31:19.950 --> 31:22.290
<v ->Sure, I'll start and we'll go down the line.</v>

31:22.290 --> 31:24.690
I think hopefully if there's one thing that's clear

31:24.690 --> 31:26.940
either from this panel or from this week

31:26.940 --> 31:29.520
is that all the big boulders

31:29.520 --> 31:32.430
that previously prevented physical AI

31:32.430 --> 31:34.200
from manifesting in the real world,

31:34.200 --> 31:36.240
they've all been knocked down.

31:36.240 --> 31:38.070
This is real, this is now,

31:38.070 --> 31:41.157
we're launching this year and ready to do so,

31:41.157 --> 31:45.030
and it's on the backbone of decades of AI work,

31:45.030 --> 31:46.380
but it goes all the way back

31:46.380 --> 31:48.840
to the very first microchip from the 1950s.

31:48.840 --> 31:51.090
And so the history that got us here,

31:51.090 --> 31:53.400
and we're standing on the shoulders of giants,

31:53.400 --> 31:56.220
it's an overused phrase, but it's so true.

31:56.220 --> 31:58.050
And this era looking forward

31:58.050 --> 32:01.050
is, you know, one of the most exciting in our lifetime.

32:01.050 --> 32:03.390
And so I'm honored to be on the stage with this community

32:03.390 --> 32:05.040
and I just know the next several years

32:05.040 --> 32:08.310
are gonna blow all of our minds. (laughs)

32:08.310 --> 32:09.210
<v ->Yeah, thank you.</v>

32:10.050 --> 32:11.490
Yeah, different approach probably

32:11.490 --> 32:15.660
from the customer's perspective, product perspective,

32:15.660 --> 32:19.830
this is an opportunity which provides us a toolbox

32:19.830 --> 32:24.830
to deliver exactly what we envisioned at the beginning

32:24.960 --> 32:28.680
in regards to functionality and features

32:28.680 --> 32:31.920
and the capability of the product we are delivering.

32:31.920 --> 32:33.810
And this toolbox is helping us

32:33.810 --> 32:36.810
to understand better the precision

32:36.810 --> 32:39.600
and also the robustness of the product we are going deliver.

32:39.600 --> 32:41.940
So what the customer wants

32:41.940 --> 32:43.890
can be understood very early in the phase,

32:43.890 --> 32:47.100
for me it's a shift left in the development process

32:47.100 --> 32:49.470
which is going to be a revolution.

32:49.470 --> 32:51.000
You understand very well

32:51.000 --> 32:53.130
how to make the right decisions at the beginning,

32:53.130 --> 32:55.170
correct promptly decisions

32:55.170 --> 32:57.900
basically on an instant feedback loop

32:57.900 --> 33:01.290
from these ML-driven models,

33:01.290 --> 33:04.323
and that is a game changer and I love to be part of that.

33:06.420 --> 33:08.643
<v ->So as an AI scientist</v>

33:08.643 --> 33:10.920
that has been doing this for 25 years,

33:10.920 --> 33:12.600
you know, I fell in love with this idea

33:12.600 --> 33:15.930
of an artificial brain, you know, 25 years ago.

33:15.930 --> 33:18.106
So yes, I'm pretty old and-

33:18.106 --> 33:20.287
(Raquel laughs)
<v ->You look great.</v>

33:20.287 --> 33:21.570
(Ossa and Raquel laugh)

33:21.570 --> 33:24.874
<v ->Anyways, I try to, you know, yeah, whatever.</v>

33:24.874 --> 33:26.160
(Ossa and Raquel laugh)

33:26.160 --> 33:29.520
Anyways, yeah, so it was this idea, right?

33:29.520 --> 33:30.390
I was fascinated.

33:30.390 --> 33:31.530
Like, an artificial brain

33:31.530 --> 33:33.540
that can do tasks that humans can do.

33:33.540 --> 33:35.190
And there was a lot of research that was needed

33:35.190 --> 33:37.320
because the algorithms at the time

33:37.320 --> 33:39.660
were cool kind of prototypes,

33:39.660 --> 33:40.493
but there was nothing

33:40.493 --> 33:42.450
that you can really bring to the real world

33:42.450 --> 33:45.360
and see, you know, what we are seeing today.

33:45.360 --> 33:48.420
So the, you know, kind of the acceleration,

33:48.420 --> 33:50.610
massive acceleration and what we are seeing today,

33:50.610 --> 33:51.750
you know, as an AI scientist

33:51.750 --> 33:53.520
has been amazing to see.

33:53.520 --> 33:57.540
You cannot imagine what this has been personally.

33:57.540 --> 34:00.810
Now, as it relates to what we are doing at Waabi,

34:00.810 --> 34:03.330
so we are launching driverless this year,

34:03.330 --> 34:05.667
so where you will see our trucks with no human.

34:05.667 --> 34:06.840
I'm not talking about the demo.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.010
I'm talking about really something

34:08.010 --> 34:10.080
that you can commercialize.

34:10.080 --> 34:13.083
So, you know, it's great what we see ahead of us

34:13.083 --> 34:15.990
and, you know, trucks is really the first use case

34:15.990 --> 34:17.580
and we are not gonna stop there,

34:17.580 --> 34:18.660
whether it's robotaxis,

34:18.660 --> 34:20.970
humanoids, as, Norm, you mentioned before.

34:20.970 --> 34:22.860
Some very exciting use case.

34:22.860 --> 34:24.603
Warehouse robotics, you name it.

34:25.560 --> 34:27.450
The moment for physical AI is here

34:27.450 --> 34:29.730
and stay tuned because the physical world

34:29.730 --> 34:31.680
is about to change massively

34:31.680 --> 34:34.743
and unlock so many good things for humanity.

34:37.680 --> 34:39.000
<v ->Well, first of all,</v>

34:39.000 --> 34:40.800
happy to hear that all of us actually

34:40.800 --> 34:42.660
are saying it's about physical AI

34:42.660 --> 34:44.973
and that really is the path that we're on.

34:45.810 --> 34:47.310
I can't help myself,

34:47.310 --> 34:49.080
I'm not as smart as Raquel,

34:49.080 --> 34:52.440
so I didn't imagine artificial intelligence 25 years ago,

34:52.440 --> 34:55.200
but I will tell you, I was smart enough seven years ago

34:55.200 --> 34:56.100
to come to NVIDIA

34:56.100 --> 34:58.560
where I knew the future of artificial intelligence

34:58.560 --> 34:59.700
was going to be.

34:59.700 --> 35:03.480
<v ->You're smarter than me on that, you know? (laughs)</v>

35:03.480 --> 35:06.190
<v ->I'll leave maybe just one example</v>

35:06.190 --> 35:09.630
pairing artificial intelligence to digital twins

35:09.630 --> 35:11.970
and in this automotive context that I believe,

35:11.970 --> 35:14.790
by the way, there is some early work being done,

35:14.790 --> 35:16.500
can't name who's doing it yet,

35:16.500 --> 35:20.790
but imagine, we've talked about the power of AI,

35:20.790 --> 35:22.680
but imagine having a digital twin

35:22.680 --> 35:26.410
of literally every single vehicle that's on the road

35:27.330 --> 35:30.390
and monitoring the digital twin of that

35:30.390 --> 35:33.870
and identifying that maybe we have a fault in the vehicle,

35:33.870 --> 35:38.040
maybe we have something as simple as Apple updated today

35:38.040 --> 35:41.190
and now it's not working effectively in the vehicle

35:41.190 --> 35:42.985
or any number of even,

35:42.985 --> 35:44.880
(clears throat) excuse me, even quality faults

35:44.880 --> 35:46.320
in the vehicle.

35:46.320 --> 35:50.070
The power of AI is you can test the various combinations

35:50.070 --> 35:51.510
of how to solve for that problem

35:51.510 --> 35:53.220
and if software, for example,

35:53.220 --> 35:56.100
and oftentimes it can, solve it,

35:56.100 --> 35:59.280
you can actually test whether the software has solved it

35:59.280 --> 36:01.830
in the digital twin of the vehicle first.

36:01.830 --> 36:03.090
And when you know

36:03.090 --> 36:06.600
that you've actually solved the problem in the digital twin,

36:06.600 --> 36:09.570
now you actually pass that on to every one of the vehicles

36:09.570 --> 36:12.000
that are experiencing that same problem

36:12.000 --> 36:13.860
or as simple as that triggers

36:13.860 --> 36:16.290
now we know the software update will be effective

36:16.290 --> 36:18.030
and it will work.

36:18.030 --> 36:19.860
So just one simple example,

36:19.860 --> 36:23.190
but one that I think's gonna be very powerful for us

36:23.190 --> 36:26.430
in the future of autonomous vehicles on the road.

36:26.430 --> 36:30.450
So that power of AI interacting with digital twins

36:30.450 --> 36:32.880
and real-time digital twins

36:32.880 --> 36:34.890
and whether it's a vehicle on the road,

36:34.890 --> 36:36.990
a warehouse that's operating,

36:36.990 --> 36:39.060
and being able to identify a robot

36:39.060 --> 36:42.480
actually has to traverse boxes that fell off

36:42.480 --> 36:44.040
and it's gotta move around.

36:44.040 --> 36:46.380
So many examples here.

36:46.380 --> 36:48.150
<v ->Yeah, I mean, this is exciting</v>

36:48.150 --> 36:50.470
and this is why we all come to CES

36:51.720 --> 36:54.390
to hear what we just heard from this panel.

36:54.390 --> 36:55.683
It's inspiring to me.

36:56.790 --> 36:59.220
And as I'm sitting here hearing you talking,

36:59.220 --> 37:00.420
we've only got a few minutes left,

37:00.420 --> 37:02.820
but I'll throw one last piece out here

37:02.820 --> 37:06.030
that I think takes us to a whole nother level, right?

37:06.030 --> 37:09.660
We talk about simulation, foundation models, world models.

37:09.660 --> 37:12.540
We're now able to take the physical world

37:12.540 --> 37:15.480
and utilize it in a way we haven't been able to before.

37:15.480 --> 37:18.690
What I heard just now, too, that got me thinking

37:18.690 --> 37:20.940
is where else will this lead?

37:20.940 --> 37:24.730
The fact that we can come out with predictive models

37:25.740 --> 37:27.660
that have a high degree of confidence,

37:27.660 --> 37:29.160
more than probably ever before,

37:29.160 --> 37:30.750
especially in the physical world.

37:30.750 --> 37:32.250
And to maybe find a way

37:32.250 --> 37:37.250
to work in that physical world model, like you said,

37:37.620 --> 37:38.453
with wind tunnels

37:38.453 --> 37:41.190
and be able to change or see what the wind is gonna do

37:41.190 --> 37:45.150
or what the motorcycle coming around you may or may not do,

37:45.150 --> 37:46.410
that's a whole nother level.

37:46.410 --> 37:50.640
And will that also lead to how we develop our new designs

37:50.640 --> 37:52.200
for transportation systems

37:52.200 --> 37:54.420
and roads and cities and all that?

37:54.420 --> 37:56.880
So I think it really has a lot more power

37:56.880 --> 38:00.420
to change lives and improve lives for the average person,

38:00.420 --> 38:01.920
for persons with disabilities.

38:02.790 --> 38:06.243
There's a lot here that I think is very exciting.

38:07.830 --> 38:08.663
We have a couple more minutes

38:08.663 --> 38:10.323
if anybody wants to comment on that, but.

38:11.340 --> 38:12.540
<v ->I couldn't agree more.</v>

38:12.540 --> 38:15.180
We're in a new era where almost anything

38:15.180 --> 38:16.530
that's capital intensive

38:16.530 --> 38:18.780
will undergo fundamental change,

38:18.780 --> 38:22.230
from an investment cycle, from time to market.

38:22.230 --> 38:27.230
The speed of innovation is exponential at this point.

38:27.570 --> 38:30.810
So it's hard to predict what's five years from now,

38:30.810 --> 38:34.050
but I can imagine even this room would get built

38:34.050 --> 38:36.300
very differently five years from now, yeah.

38:36.300 --> 38:39.298
<v ->I think Raquel may know what's going on 20 years from now.</v>

38:39.298 --> 38:40.620
<v ->(laughs) And I'll bet on it too.</v>

38:40.620 --> 38:44.087
Whatever you say, Raquel, I'm in. (laughs)

38:44.087 --> 38:45.330
<v ->With that, I'd like to thank everybody here.</v>

38:45.330 --> 38:46.230
Thank you so much.

38:46.230 --> 38:48.600
This has been life-changing for me

38:48.600 --> 38:50.580
getting to meet you and hearing about all this.

38:50.580 --> 38:52.230
And thanks, everybody here,

38:52.230 --> 38:53.760
and we appreciate you coming here

38:53.760 --> 38:56.410
and sitting and listening to us and have a great CES.

38:57.605 --> 38:58.438
<v ->Thank you.</v>
<v ->Thanks.</v>

38:58.438 --> 38:59.364
<v ->Thanks.
(audience applauds)</v>

38:59.364 --> 39:01.947
(upbeat music)
