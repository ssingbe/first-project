1
00:00.000 --> 00:02.417
(calm music)

2
00:11.331 --> 00:12.448
<v ->My name's Mike Embrescia,</v>

3
00:12.448 --> 00:14.263
I am the Chief Development Officer

4
00:14.263 --> 00:15.540
for "Carnegie Robotics"

5
00:15.540 --> 00:18.021
based in Pittsburgh PA.

6
00:18.021 --> 00:20.456
We have a really cool name "Carnegie" before it,

7
00:20.456 --> 00:22.695
but it is not the university, okay?

8
00:22.695 --> 00:23.700
So, you know,

9
00:23.700 --> 00:24.700
half the room's gonna walk out,

10
00:24.700 --> 00:27.629
"Oh, I thought I was seeing someone CMU."

11
00:27.629 --> 00:28.785
We were actually spun out

12
00:28.785 --> 00:30.015
of Carnegie Mellon University,

13
00:30.015 --> 00:31.185
and we have a very close relationship,

14
00:31.185 --> 00:34.185
as does everybody on this panel here.

15
00:34.185 --> 00:37.932
But, with us up here are four colleagues

16
00:37.932 --> 00:39.794
from the Pittsburgh area,

17
00:39.794 --> 00:42.105
that are all focused in drones,

18
00:42.105 --> 00:44.545
marine, and military,

19
00:44.545 --> 00:48.743
and we're gonna get to them in just a second.

20
00:48.743 --> 00:49.583
Should I get to them in a second,

21
00:49.583 --> 00:51.284
or can I tell my story?

22
00:51.284 --> 00:53.014
I'm gonna tell my story first.

23
00:53.014 --> 00:54.246
So, you all are here,

24
00:54.246 --> 00:55.803
and you wanna you know,

25
00:55.803 --> 00:57.555
talk about autonomy et cetera,

26
00:57.555 --> 00:58.465
and I'm sure a lot of you

27
00:58.465 --> 00:59.643
have also heard about Pittsburgh,

28
00:59.643 --> 01:00.843
why Pittsburgh?

29
01:00.843 --> 01:03.538
You know, why is Pittsburgh a buzz globally

30
01:03.538 --> 01:04.810
with all things robotics?

31
01:04.810 --> 01:05.680
Well yeah, Carnegie Mellon

32
01:05.680 --> 01:06.550
has a lot to do with it,

33
01:06.550 --> 01:08.167
but I figured I'd give ya a quick story,

34
01:08.167 --> 01:11.426
I'll give you the quick 90-second,

35
01:11.426 --> 01:14.003
whenever people come into our building,

36
01:14.003 --> 01:15.240
what we like to share with them,

37
01:15.240 --> 01:17.317
and here's how it goes.

38
01:17.317 --> 01:18.204
Pittsburgh is the robotics

39
01:18.204 --> 01:19.041
capital of the world,

40
01:19.041 --> 01:20.081
we believe that very firmly

41
01:20.081 --> 01:21.159
and here's why.

42
01:21.159 --> 01:22.010
In the early '90s,

43
01:22.010 --> 01:23.800
CMU, Carnegie Mellon University

44
01:23.800 --> 01:25.822
and NASA put a bunch of money into a pot,

45
01:25.822 --> 01:27.446
now some people may correct me on this story,

46
01:27.446 --> 01:29.365
but this is just how we look at it.

47
01:29.365 --> 01:31.121
CMU and NASA put a bunch of money into a pot,

48
01:31.121 --> 01:32.755
they stirred that pot,

49
01:32.755 --> 01:34.537
and out, spit out the child,

50
01:34.537 --> 01:35.742
the "NREC",

51
01:35.742 --> 01:38.073
the "National Robotics Engineering Center",

52
01:38.073 --> 01:39.184
the "NREC",

53
01:39.184 --> 01:40.535
that is the...

54
01:40.535 --> 01:42.526
The large facility that houses

55
01:42.526 --> 01:45.306
the Carnegie Mellon Robotics effort.

56
01:45.306 --> 01:47.167
And so, the powers that be at the time,

57
01:47.167 --> 01:48.000
they said,

58
01:48.000 --> 01:48.921
"Where we wanna put this new facility?

59
01:48.921 --> 01:49.806
We wanna put it on campus?

60
01:49.806 --> 01:51.476
Nah, let's put it in the Lawrence Field

61
01:51.476 --> 01:53.726
District of Pittsburgh."

62
01:53.726 --> 01:55.457
"You mean that blighted,

63
01:55.457 --> 01:58.224
rundown former steel town

64
01:58.224 --> 01:59.145
that's about a mile

65
01:59.145 --> 02:01.084
and a half outside of Downtown Pittsburgh?

66
02:01.084 --> 02:02.662
You know all the steel companies left in the '70s

67
02:02.662 --> 02:03.609
and '80s?"

68
02:03.609 --> 02:04.806
"Yeah, that place."

69
02:04.806 --> 02:06.111
"You mean where the police cars,

70
02:06.111 --> 02:07.016
and the sirens,

71
02:07.016 --> 02:08.583
and people getting shot every other day,

72
02:08.583 --> 02:10.177
you mean that part of town?"

73
02:10.177 --> 02:11.651
"Yeah, that part of town?"

74
02:11.651 --> 02:12.769
"Well, why?"

75
02:12.769 --> 02:13.612
"Because they have

76
02:13.612 --> 02:15.222
all this amazing building stock.

77
02:15.222 --> 02:18.626
They had these massive warehouses

78
02:18.626 --> 02:19.736
left over from when steel

79
02:19.736 --> 02:22.466
and manufacturing was the mecca in Pittsburgh."

80
02:22.466 --> 02:23.299
"Great."

81
02:23.299 --> 02:24.563
So, NREC was established.

82
02:24.563 --> 02:25.725
In the early '90s,

83
02:25.725 --> 02:27.146
they had a director,

84
02:27.146 --> 02:29.121
coincidentally happened to be my CEO,

85
02:29.121 --> 02:30.531
and my current boss,

86
02:30.531 --> 02:32.856
who helped build the NREC

87
02:32.856 --> 02:35.238
to a few hundred people.

88
02:35.238 --> 02:37.472
And then, subsequently,

89
02:37.472 --> 02:39.613
Carnegie Mellon did something really neat,

90
02:39.613 --> 02:42.284
they established the world's first PhD

91
02:42.284 --> 02:44.371
and Masters Program in Robotics,

92
02:44.371 --> 02:46.038
"Ah, so that's why."

93
02:47.306 --> 02:48.901
Lot of folks from across the globe

94
02:48.901 --> 02:50.671
started to matriculate to Pittsburgh

95
02:50.671 --> 02:53.191
to get this new cutting-edge degree,

96
02:53.191 --> 02:55.649
so there's where you started to see this...

97
02:55.649 --> 02:58.317
This rumbling of activity in tech,

98
02:58.317 --> 03:00.681
and AI that really started to blossom

99
03:00.681 --> 03:02.837
in our backyard, right?

100
03:02.837 --> 03:03.920
And so today,

101
03:04.863 --> 03:07.873
we boast about 120 robotics companies up

102
03:07.873 --> 03:09.985
and down what the media likes to call

103
03:09.985 --> 03:12.023
"Robotics Row", right?

104
03:12.023 --> 03:13.244
Lot of the companies were there

105
03:13.244 --> 03:14.401
before there was a "row",

106
03:14.401 --> 03:15.791
the gentleman to my left here

107
03:15.791 --> 03:17.176
is one of those people,

108
03:17.176 --> 03:18.901
our company was certainly there

109
03:18.901 --> 03:19.966
before there was a "row",

110
03:19.966 --> 03:22.246
and there's a lot of upstarts here as well.

111
03:22.246 --> 03:24.481
But the reason I share that story with you,

112
03:24.481 --> 03:27.341
is because the four-people seated to my left,

113
03:27.341 --> 03:29.191
are four of the...

114
03:29.191 --> 03:31.546
Four of some of the premiere companies

115
03:31.546 --> 03:32.845
that we have in our backyard,

116
03:32.845 --> 03:34.051
so we're very happy to have them

117
03:34.051 --> 03:35.686
here in Vegas with us.

118
03:35.686 --> 03:36.641
So, without further adieu,

119
03:36.641 --> 03:38.218
I'm gonna introduce Sanjiv Singh

120
03:38.218 --> 03:42.931
who's the Founder CEO of "Near Earth Autonomy".

121
03:42.931 --> 03:46.182
I recently found out that Sanjiv was the first

122
03:46.182 --> 03:50.086
Masters in Robotics out of Carnegie Mellon,

123
03:50.086 --> 03:52.419
possibly the world, so um...

124
03:55.062 --> 03:56.563
We have Phil Hahn here,

125
03:56.563 --> 03:59.176
Phil was until recently,

126
03:59.176 --> 04:01.875
the Chief Strategy Officer for "AFWERX"

127
04:01.875 --> 04:03.555
based in Pittsburgh,

128
04:03.555 --> 04:05.881
who has, I believe as of this week,

129
04:05.881 --> 04:07.485
started a new role with Divergent,

130
04:07.485 --> 04:08.862
he can share all that about...

131
04:08.862 --> 04:10.605
All of that with you,

132
04:10.605 --> 04:13.346
also Lieutenant Colonel in the service.

133
04:13.346 --> 04:15.571
we have Xiaoyu Kaess,

134
04:15.571 --> 04:17.933
Co-founder and COO of "Aquatonomy".

135
04:17.933 --> 04:21.433
And we have Olga Pogoda from KEF Robotics,

136
04:22.691 --> 04:24.386
K-E-F Robotics here,

137
04:24.386 --> 04:25.645
wonderful drone company.

138
04:25.645 --> 04:28.019
So, here's our panel, guys.

139
04:28.019 --> 04:31.102
Hey, you done hearing me talk? Right.

140
04:32.773 --> 04:33.606
<v ->Keep it going.</v>

141
04:33.606 --> 04:34.863
<v ->Oh okay, you got it.</v>

142
04:34.863 --> 04:36.457
Xiaoyu, I'll start with you,

143
04:36.457 --> 04:39.140
because you're the nicest one to me today.

144
04:39.140 --> 04:39.981
(Xiaoyu laughing)

145
04:39.981 --> 04:40.814
Why don't you tell us

146
04:40.814 --> 04:41.822
a little bit about Aquatonomy?

147
04:41.822 --> 04:43.914
Now, full-transparency?

148
04:43.914 --> 04:44.950
I actually learned about your company

149
04:44.950 --> 04:46.300
watching a Sunday news program

150
04:46.300 --> 04:47.133
and said,

151
04:47.133 --> 04:48.905
"I really like what you guys are doing."

152
04:48.905 --> 04:50.208
And then, two days later,

153
04:50.208 --> 04:51.743
I got asked to do a panel with you.

154
04:51.743 --> 04:53.095
<v Xiaoyu>Oh, what an honor,</v>

155
04:53.095 --> 04:54.753
thank you, thank you.

156
04:54.753 --> 04:56.570
I'm Xiaoyu Kaess,

157
04:56.570 --> 04:59.276
co-founder and COO of Aquatonomy,

158
04:59.276 --> 05:02.337
at Aquatonomy, we're creating underwater drones

159
05:02.337 --> 05:06.329
to address the inspection of underwater assets,

160
05:06.329 --> 05:07.230
they're including,

161
05:07.230 --> 05:08.812
but not limited to dams,

162
05:08.812 --> 05:10.555
bridges, and ports,

163
05:10.555 --> 05:13.833
and we provide action-driven insights

164
05:13.833 --> 05:14.947
to help the owners

165
05:14.947 --> 05:17.762
make better maintenance decisions

166
05:17.762 --> 05:19.929
and strategize their cost,

167
05:21.718 --> 05:24.051
and get confident decisions,

168
05:26.207 --> 05:28.874
and get better financial-return.

169
05:31.622 --> 05:32.455
<v Mike>Great, thank you.</v>

170
05:32.455 --> 05:35.176
Olga, how 'bout you guys?

171
05:35.176 --> 05:36.264
<v ->Hi, my name is Olga,</v>

172
05:36.264 --> 05:39.706
I'm the Chief Operating Officer at KEF Robotics.

173
05:39.706 --> 05:43.123
At KEF, we work on GPS-denied navigation,

174
05:44.092 --> 05:47.259
so what we try to do is build software

175
05:48.632 --> 05:50.790
that leverages cameras,

176
05:50.790 --> 05:52.787
and other very low-cost,

177
05:52.787 --> 05:54.667
off-the-shelf censors,

178
05:54.667 --> 05:58.117
to get an aircraft from point "A" to point "B",

179
05:58.117 --> 05:58.967
and back,

180
05:58.967 --> 06:03.107
and then, maybe do something smart along the way.

181
06:03.107 --> 06:06.937
And we wanna do that in highly-contested

182
06:06.937 --> 06:10.520
GPS-denied communication jams environments.

183
06:11.586 --> 06:13.565
(Mike speaking softly)

184
06:13.565 --> 06:14.709
<v ->Well, it's great to be back in Vegas,</v>

185
06:14.709 --> 06:16.189
I spent a lot of my former years

186
06:16.189 --> 06:20.142
as a flight-test engineer out this way.

187
06:20.142 --> 06:21.200
To your point earlier,

188
06:21.200 --> 06:24.069
I need to add "former" in front of my role

189
06:24.069 --> 06:25.673
at AFWERX, I just...

190
06:25.673 --> 06:27.292
As of this week,

191
06:27.292 --> 06:31.639
transitioned out back to the private sector.

192
06:31.639 --> 06:33.853
AFWERX as a whole?

193
06:33.853 --> 06:35.473
It's the innovation,

194
06:35.473 --> 06:37.548
and investment arm of the air force

195
06:37.548 --> 06:39.415
and space force,

196
06:39.415 --> 06:40.248
so I spent the last four

197
06:40.248 --> 06:41.619
and a half years building that out

198
06:41.619 --> 06:45.759
in really the way that we work in the DoD

199
06:45.759 --> 06:48.722
to bridge the technology gap

200
06:48.722 --> 06:51.464
and work with commercial entities,

201
06:51.464 --> 06:52.932
to partner with the government

202
06:52.932 --> 06:54.776
and find pathways through,

203
06:54.776 --> 06:58.988
and I think a lot of the panelists here with me

204
06:58.988 --> 07:01.498
have experienced that process that we've built

205
07:01.498 --> 07:02.618
over the last four

206
07:02.618 --> 07:03.451
and a half years,

207
07:03.451 --> 07:06.114
and we've executed well over $5-billion

208
07:06.114 --> 07:08.518
in my time at AFWERX.

209
07:08.518 --> 07:09.548
I'm transitioning over

210
07:09.548 --> 07:12.668
to "Divergent Technologies",

211
07:12.668 --> 07:15.835
it's a advanced manufacturing company,

212
07:17.487 --> 07:20.001
started out in the automobile sector

213
07:20.001 --> 07:21.751
to 3D print vehicles,

214
07:23.697 --> 07:25.495
so Singer Vehicles is underneath that

215
07:25.495 --> 07:27.178
with super cars,

216
07:27.178 --> 07:28.663
so I do everything from Bugatti parts,

217
07:28.663 --> 07:31.736
and now I'm working with our former director

218
07:31.736 --> 07:33.569
at AFWERX Nate Diller,

219
07:34.438 --> 07:35.488
working through

220
07:35.488 --> 07:39.778
and developing the Aerospace &amp; Defense section

221
07:39.778 --> 07:41.945
of Divergent Technologies.

222
07:43.423 --> 07:45.581
<v ->Great, thanks Mike.</v>

223
07:45.581 --> 07:46.648
So, I'm Sanjiv Singh,

224
07:46.648 --> 07:48.523
I'm the CEO of "Near Earth Autonomy",

225
07:48.523 --> 07:49.356
what we do,

226
07:49.356 --> 07:50.668
is we build an autonomy stack

227
07:50.668 --> 07:52.097
for all kinds of aircraft,

228
07:52.097 --> 07:53.813
but we are focused on rotorcraft,

229
07:53.813 --> 07:56.983
and we're focused on logistic missions,

230
07:56.983 --> 08:01.029
so we have a big engagement with the DoD,

231
08:01.029 --> 08:02.650
especially the marine corp

232
08:02.650 --> 08:04.108
and the army,

233
08:04.108 --> 08:06.688
to work on various scales of aircraft.

234
08:06.688 --> 08:08.424
And our value proposition,

235
08:08.424 --> 08:10.584
I like to say is that we enable aircraft

236
08:10.584 --> 08:11.559
to fly safe,

237
08:11.559 --> 08:12.879
land safe,

238
08:12.879 --> 08:14.679
do it without GPS,

239
08:14.679 --> 08:16.499
even when things go wrong.

240
08:16.499 --> 08:17.669
And the idea is that,

241
08:17.669 --> 08:18.994
if the world were perfect,

242
08:18.994 --> 08:20.433
and the aircraft were perfect,

243
08:20.433 --> 08:21.266
then you know,

244
08:21.266 --> 08:22.249
you don't need any sensors,

245
08:22.249 --> 08:23.374
and you just take off,

246
08:23.374 --> 08:25.388
and fly some...

247
08:25.388 --> 08:26.221
Fly some...

248
08:26.221 --> 08:27.300
Going through some breadcrumbs,

249
08:27.300 --> 08:28.518
but in fact,

250
08:28.518 --> 08:30.064
the world is not perfect,

251
08:30.064 --> 08:32.564
all sorts of things in maps are not correct,

252
08:32.564 --> 08:33.675
you have weather,

253
08:33.675 --> 08:35.710
you have things break down on an aircraft,

254
08:35.710 --> 08:38.143
so what we want is autonomy,

255
08:38.143 --> 08:41.563
to be able to do what a pilot would do,

256
08:41.563 --> 08:43.566
which is to deal with the varying conditions

257
08:43.566 --> 08:44.600
on the aircraft.

258
08:44.600 --> 08:46.588
So, for different scales of aircraft,

259
08:46.588 --> 08:48.058
this matters differently,

260
08:48.058 --> 08:50.125
but especially if they're flying low,

261
08:50.125 --> 08:51.388
if they're gonna be...

262
08:51.388 --> 08:52.768
The root that's been given to them

263
08:52.768 --> 08:53.963
is gonna go through a tower,

264
08:53.963 --> 08:54.823
they should see the tower

265
08:54.823 --> 08:56.488
and fly around it, okay?

266
08:56.488 --> 08:58.108
So, the autonomy part we've been doing

267
08:58.108 --> 08:58.941
for a long time,

268
08:58.941 --> 09:01.678
and the big focus of our company right now

269
09:01.678 --> 09:04.123
is to make sure that the autonomy is there

270
09:04.123 --> 09:04.956
when you need it.

271
09:04.956 --> 09:07.408
So, autonomy is gonna keep you out of trouble,

272
09:07.408 --> 09:10.033
but how do you know that it's gonna be there?

273
09:10.033 --> 09:11.276
And that's what you need

274
09:11.276 --> 09:12.853
when you get to a larger aircraft,

275
09:12.853 --> 09:14.023
for example, if you're flying

276
09:14.023 --> 09:15.748
a Black Hawk autonomously,

277
09:15.748 --> 09:17.638
then you better be able to say

278
09:17.638 --> 09:18.935
to all the stakeholders like,

279
09:18.935 --> 09:21.804
"Look, here's why even if some

280
09:21.804 --> 09:23.759
of the main systems on the aircraft

281
09:23.759 --> 09:25.191
fail during flight,

282
09:25.191 --> 09:26.788
the aircraft is gonna be okay."

283
09:26.788 --> 09:28.801
So, that's the emphasis on our program,

284
09:28.801 --> 09:30.004
of our company,

285
09:30.004 --> 09:31.652
we develop this...

286
09:31.652 --> 09:32.541
This kind of software

287
09:32.541 --> 09:35.084
and hardware combination that,

288
09:35.084 --> 09:37.299
that aircraft use to do their mission.

289
09:37.299 --> 09:38.737
<v ->Thank you, that's wonderful.</v>

290
09:38.737 --> 09:40.721
So, a couple of ground rules

291
09:40.721 --> 09:43.083
that I did not mention at the top.

292
09:43.083 --> 09:43.916
First of all,

293
09:43.916 --> 09:45.274
I didn't share anything about Carnegie Robotics,

294
09:45.274 --> 09:46.107
if ya ask later,

295
09:46.107 --> 09:47.122
I'll tell ya.

296
09:47.122 --> 09:49.507
But, this is really about you guys.

297
09:49.507 --> 09:50.340
And trust me,

298
09:50.340 --> 09:51.173
I will tell you,

299
09:51.173 --> 09:53.457
'cause I'll talk a lot about what we do.

300
09:53.457 --> 09:54.977
Also, if you wanna go on social media,

301
09:54.977 --> 09:56.226
and you wanna start you know,

302
09:56.226 --> 09:58.282
saying amazing things about this panel,

303
09:58.282 --> 09:59.598
please tag everybody here,

304
09:59.598 --> 10:00.431
their names,

305
10:00.431 --> 10:01.264
and their companies,

306
10:01.264 --> 10:04.083
'cause we're selfish like that.

307
10:04.083 --> 10:06.286
So, the theme up here,

308
10:06.286 --> 10:07.274
and it just kinda hit...

309
10:07.274 --> 10:08.438
It kinda struck me this morning

310
10:08.438 --> 10:10.137
when we were having our pre-brief,

311
10:10.137 --> 10:13.166
that, with respect to autonomy,

312
10:13.166 --> 10:13.999
and drones,

313
10:13.999 --> 10:16.687
and heck, even AI these days,

314
10:16.687 --> 10:18.124
lot of the folks probably thought

315
10:18.124 --> 10:18.957
they were gonna come in here

316
10:18.957 --> 10:20.226
talking exclusively about

317
10:20.226 --> 10:22.211
commercial-type opportunities.

318
10:22.211 --> 10:26.200
However, there is a huge tilt towards defense,

319
10:26.200 --> 10:28.431
pretty much in everything that we do

320
10:28.431 --> 10:30.014
on this stage here,

321
10:31.460 --> 10:32.627
how does that,

322
10:33.696 --> 10:35.256
focusing on defense-work,

323
10:35.256 --> 10:38.196
how does that help get your product to market

324
10:38.196 --> 10:39.317
and help grow your business?

325
10:39.317 --> 10:40.150
Because after all,

326
10:40.150 --> 10:41.469
we are not non-profits.

327
10:41.469 --> 10:43.764
So Olga, help us understand that,

328
10:43.764 --> 10:46.451
I think we just had a conversation about that.

329
10:46.451 --> 10:47.332
<v ->Yeah, I mean,</v>

330
10:47.332 --> 10:49.270
I think we've seen over the years

331
10:49.270 --> 10:53.122
that the military is a great first customer.

332
10:53.122 --> 10:54.904
First of all,

333
10:54.904 --> 10:57.321
they have funding to help you

334
11:00.050 --> 11:02.365
take a very early prototype,

335
11:02.365 --> 11:05.631
to something that can be tested,

336
11:05.631 --> 11:07.395
even on the front lines,

337
11:07.395 --> 11:08.414
and there's very...

338
11:08.414 --> 11:09.969
Various programs that you can go through,

339
11:09.969 --> 11:12.956
and maybe we'll touch on them later.

340
11:12.956 --> 11:16.166
But, as we've seen throughout the years,

341
11:16.166 --> 11:17.724
you know GPS, right?

342
11:17.724 --> 11:19.841
Like, we're trying to replace GPS,

343
11:19.841 --> 11:21.544
but GPS itself,

344
11:21.544 --> 11:22.752
when it was first invented,

345
11:22.752 --> 11:25.308
it was first invented for the military,

346
11:25.308 --> 11:26.648
they were the first adopters,

347
11:26.648 --> 11:28.107
they were the first users

348
11:28.107 --> 11:29.857
before it hit the market.

349
11:29.857 --> 11:31.256
So, I think what we're seeing

350
11:31.256 --> 11:33.072
with a lot of different technologies

351
11:33.072 --> 11:37.072
is that the DoD is really good at testing things

352
11:38.836 --> 11:41.409
and being that first customer,

353
11:41.409 --> 11:44.107
when the commercial market

354
11:44.107 --> 11:46.645
is just not ready for your product yet,

355
11:46.645 --> 11:48.744
it may be in the future,

356
11:48.744 --> 11:50.889
and there's applications that exist,

357
11:50.889 --> 11:54.219
but it just needs time to get there,

358
11:54.219 --> 11:58.059
and that's kind of the space that I live in.

359
11:58.059 --> 12:00.507
So, I think that in the future,

360
12:00.507 --> 12:02.217
there'll be plenty of opportunity

361
12:02.217 --> 12:05.422
for our company to work with commercial airlines,

362
12:05.422 --> 12:06.505
with rotorcraft,

363
12:06.505 --> 12:11.320
with all different kinds of commercial customers,

364
12:11.320 --> 12:12.562
but right now,

365
12:12.562 --> 12:13.807
it's really defense.

366
12:13.807 --> 12:15.337
<v ->Right. And years ago I...</v>

367
12:15.337 --> 12:16.170
Thank you.

368
12:16.170 --> 12:18.963
Years ago, I learned about "Near Earth Autonomy",

369
12:18.963 --> 12:20.407
we had not yet know each other,

370
12:20.407 --> 12:22.177
and you had...

371
12:22.177 --> 12:23.935
It was published that you were doing

372
12:23.935 --> 12:25.811
some work with Boeing,

373
12:25.811 --> 12:28.347
and that put my antennae up

374
12:28.347 --> 12:30.580
because I always wanted to be a pilot,

375
12:30.580 --> 12:31.894
and Boeing makes airplanes,

376
12:31.894 --> 12:32.727
"So maybe I should go work

377
12:32.727 --> 12:34.620
for Near Earth Autonomy."

378
12:34.620 --> 12:36.780
But again, your business...

379
12:36.780 --> 12:39.105
You know, maybe we will, buddy.

380
12:39.105 --> 12:40.412
But your business is...

381
12:40.412 --> 12:41.280
(Mike laughing)

382
12:41.280 --> 12:42.789
Your business is really evolved

383
12:42.789 --> 12:44.956
to focus on military work,

384
12:45.827 --> 12:47.562
can you help explore that with everybody?

385
12:47.562 --> 12:50.981
<v ->Yeah, so like Olga said you know,</v>

386
12:50.981 --> 12:53.874
almost every aviation innovation

387
12:53.874 --> 12:54.987
has started with the military,

388
12:54.987 --> 12:56.441
and the idea is that if you look

389
12:56.441 --> 12:58.812
at the commercial world,

390
12:58.812 --> 13:02.127
commercial end-users don't want something

391
13:02.127 --> 13:03.762
that is sort of there,

392
13:03.762 --> 13:05.107
and comes with an engineer,

393
13:05.107 --> 13:06.637
but the military is willing to do that,

394
13:06.637 --> 13:07.947
so they...

395
13:07.947 --> 13:09.747
Big emphasis on robustness,

396
13:09.747 --> 13:11.937
big emphasis on performance,

397
13:11.937 --> 13:13.868
but not so much on the economics.

398
13:13.868 --> 13:15.207
So, the problem with the...

399
13:15.207 --> 13:17.667
With staking new technology is,

400
13:17.667 --> 13:18.852
straight to the commercial world

401
13:18.852 --> 13:21.687
is that it needs very deep pockets

402
13:21.687 --> 13:23.892
if you're going to make everything work,

403
13:23.892 --> 13:25.142
it has to be...

404
13:26.228 --> 13:27.206
It has to be feasible,

405
13:27.206 --> 13:28.497
it has to be easy to use,

406
13:28.497 --> 13:31.421
and it has to be economically viable,

407
13:31.421 --> 13:33.168
so all of those things are hard to make work

408
13:33.168 --> 13:34.332
at the beginning,

409
13:34.332 --> 13:37.182
to get this technology in a military setting

410
13:37.182 --> 13:39.142
where there is funding,

411
13:39.142 --> 13:41.046
there's a lower bar for success,

412
13:41.046 --> 13:42.759
and a higher tolerance for risk,

413
13:42.759 --> 13:45.564
this is what makes it much more easy to work,

414
13:45.564 --> 13:46.705
start with the military.

415
13:46.705 --> 13:48.567
And then of course these things migrate,

416
13:48.567 --> 13:50.947
like from the internet to GPS,

417
13:50.947 --> 13:53.472
to all sorts of other...

418
13:53.472 --> 13:55.377
Every aircraft that has been,

419
13:55.377 --> 13:57.146
except for one rotorcraft,

420
13:57.146 --> 13:59.438
has started with a military application.

421
13:59.438 --> 14:01.452
Right, and Xiaoyu when you

422
14:01.452 --> 14:03.372
and team got Aquatonomy off the ground,

423
14:03.372 --> 14:06.938
was there an emphasis on filling a gap?

424
14:06.938 --> 14:10.583
Filling a need for the military services

425
14:10.583 --> 14:12.703
with your product?

426
14:12.703 --> 14:15.367
<v ->Actually, our two technical co-founders</v>

427
14:15.367 --> 14:19.117
started their early career by solving complex

428
14:20.228 --> 14:23.291
national security challenges,

429
14:23.291 --> 14:24.819
one is Dr. Michael Cass,

430
14:24.819 --> 14:28.002
he dedicated 15-years of academic research

431
14:28.002 --> 14:29.832
on autonomous navigation,

432
14:29.832 --> 14:32.740
and mapping in GPS in night environments,

433
14:32.740 --> 14:35.439
and his work was used by the navy,

434
14:35.439 --> 14:36.272
the army,

435
14:36.272 --> 14:38.847
and founded by the Office of Naval Research,

436
14:38.847 --> 14:41.007
and army research labs at first,

437
14:41.007 --> 14:42.376
and his work is used

438
14:42.376 --> 14:44.561
in the International Space Station

439
14:44.561 --> 14:46.992
before we incorporated our company.

440
14:46.992 --> 14:49.340
Our second technical co-founder

441
14:49.340 --> 14:51.217
also dedicated his work

442
14:51.217 --> 14:53.500
in marine robotics collaboration,

443
14:53.500 --> 14:57.933
he was a award winner of Young Investigator Award

444
14:57.933 --> 14:59.374
by the navy...

445
14:59.374 --> 15:00.755
Office of Naval Research.

446
15:00.755 --> 15:02.574
And so, we're kind of testament

447
15:02.574 --> 15:06.574
of how national security needs drove innovation,

448
15:08.673 --> 15:10.098
that later we could use

449
15:10.098 --> 15:12.039
as a solid tactical foundation

450
15:12.039 --> 15:13.737
in commercial applications

451
15:13.737 --> 15:17.320
and we continue to observe this as a trend.

452
15:18.318 --> 15:21.401
National security applications drive,

453
15:22.978 --> 15:25.228
especially in defining old,

454
15:27.099 --> 15:29.504
pioneering use-cases

455
15:29.504 --> 15:30.562
and goals,

456
15:30.562 --> 15:31.895
and be a stable,

457
15:33.748 --> 15:35.704
predictable founding source

458
15:35.704 --> 15:37.766
for innovations to happen.

459
15:37.766 --> 15:40.766
<v ->Right. And, so with military work,</v>

460
15:41.999 --> 15:43.057
the requirements,

461
15:43.057 --> 15:44.706
there's a high-bar,

462
15:44.706 --> 15:46.929
middle-spec, middle-grade et cetera,

463
15:46.929 --> 15:49.176
so that translates well

464
15:49.176 --> 15:50.993
if ever the commercial markets

465
15:50.993 --> 15:52.003
ever were to take over,

466
15:52.003 --> 15:54.215
or integrate set product

467
15:54.215 --> 15:56.239
across their portfolio.

468
15:56.239 --> 15:57.768
So, I can't see a show of hands here

469
15:57.768 --> 16:00.872
of folks who have worked with military,

470
16:00.872 --> 16:03.680
or any defense conduit in any way,

471
16:03.680 --> 16:06.430
or form, but Phil Hahn at AFWERX,

472
16:07.427 --> 16:09.020
is accustomed to people like us

473
16:09.020 --> 16:10.740
beating down his door,

474
16:10.740 --> 16:12.379
asking for help

475
16:12.379 --> 16:15.049
and guidance, really we just want money,

476
16:15.049 --> 16:16.882
but he helps guide us,

477
16:18.076 --> 16:20.132
he and his folks would help guide us

478
16:20.132 --> 16:21.675
towards the right path

479
16:21.675 --> 16:23.821
of this particular program,

480
16:23.821 --> 16:25.219
this funding conduit,

481
16:25.219 --> 16:27.755
"Here's where the necessary players are,

482
16:27.755 --> 16:30.214
and here's where you have to go to achieve

483
16:30.214 --> 16:31.056
said project."

484
16:31.056 --> 16:32.526
So, can you help understand...

485
16:32.526 --> 16:33.519
Help everybody understand

486
16:33.519 --> 16:35.019
your side of the fence

487
16:35.019 --> 16:36.699
when you're dealing with people like us?

488
16:36.699 --> 16:37.532
<v ->Sure, yeah.</v>

489
16:37.532 --> 16:38.365
So, I mean,

490
16:38.365 --> 16:41.377
a lot of why AFWERX was founded,

491
16:41.377 --> 16:43.216
was to kind of bridge that gap

492
16:43.216 --> 16:47.051
of the commercial innovation to the...

493
16:47.051 --> 16:48.802
To the department,

494
16:48.802 --> 16:49.917
in our case,

495
16:49.917 --> 16:50.750
air force

496
16:50.750 --> 16:52.372
and space force.

497
16:52.372 --> 16:55.014
But, if you look back the...

498
16:55.014 --> 16:55.929
You know, the research labs,

499
16:55.929 --> 16:56.949
the DARPA's of the world,

500
16:56.949 --> 16:57.782
they still...

501
16:57.782 --> 16:59.169
They still have all all their projects

502
16:59.169 --> 17:00.684
and programs that they're working,

503
17:00.684 --> 17:02.103
but we really needed to tap into

504
17:02.103 --> 17:04.874
all of the amazing technology that was out there,

505
17:04.874 --> 17:07.144
we talked through the requirements process,

506
17:07.144 --> 17:09.725
the acquisition process in the...

507
17:09.725 --> 17:11.779
In the DoD is very slow,

508
17:11.779 --> 17:13.060
and a lot of times we have to have

509
17:13.060 --> 17:16.612
that very solid requirement at the forefront.

510
17:16.612 --> 17:19.185
And so, what we did at AFWERX,

511
17:19.185 --> 17:20.551
was we developed something called

512
17:20.551 --> 17:21.416
"The Open Topic"

513
17:21.416 --> 17:23.200
and this was more of a,

514
17:23.200 --> 17:25.185
"Come pitch the government,

515
17:25.185 --> 17:28.080
come show us what your technology is,

516
17:28.080 --> 17:29.381
we wanna be a partner,

517
17:29.381 --> 17:31.245
we don't need to be the only partner."

518
17:31.245 --> 17:32.654
I think in that aspect of it.

519
17:32.654 --> 17:33.690
And so, that has lead

520
17:33.690 --> 17:36.359
to different funding streams,

521
17:36.359 --> 17:37.575
different ways that you

522
17:37.575 --> 17:39.865
could get your foot in the door,

523
17:39.865 --> 17:40.698
get some...

524
17:40.698 --> 17:41.865
Get some of that you know,

525
17:41.865 --> 17:42.810
startup capital,

526
17:42.810 --> 17:45.570
get some funding early on,

527
17:45.570 --> 17:47.278
and then provide those opportunities,

528
17:47.278 --> 17:49.611
provide that foresight to...

529
17:51.148 --> 17:53.895
To showcase your technology

530
17:53.895 --> 17:56.037
to different parts of the DoD,

531
17:56.037 --> 17:57.464
that we could then pass that along.

532
17:57.464 --> 17:59.040
And so, that development life cycle

533
17:59.040 --> 18:01.680
was something that we built out at AFWERX

534
18:01.680 --> 18:03.525
and at the other innovation

535
18:03.525 --> 18:05.985
organizations in the DoD to really help

536
18:05.985 --> 18:07.110
with more of a...

537
18:07.110 --> 18:08.400
Think of it more as a partnership,

538
18:08.400 --> 18:10.515
instead of just an ownership aspect

539
18:10.515 --> 18:12.540
that the government is starting to play.

540
18:12.540 --> 18:14.005
<v ->Great. I'm gonna pick on you a little bit more,</v>

541
18:14.005 --> 18:16.081
so keep that mic.

542
18:16.081 --> 18:17.581
<v ->What we've seen,</v>

543
18:19.555 --> 18:22.630
the companies have seen the military evolve,

544
18:22.630 --> 18:23.880
and I'm gonna get off the military talk

545
18:23.880 --> 18:24.713
in a second.

546
18:24.713 --> 18:27.135
But, we've seen the necessary groups evolve

547
18:27.135 --> 18:31.540
from just a traditional RFI/RFP process,

548
18:31.540 --> 18:34.257
with evolutions of having an AFWERX,

549
18:34.257 --> 18:35.637
having a SOFWERX,

550
18:35.637 --> 18:38.997
DIU has been especially refreshing,

551
18:38.997 --> 18:40.394
the "Defensive Innovative Unit",

552
18:40.394 --> 18:42.540
which in translation,

553
18:42.540 --> 18:44.725
instead of going to the robust,

554
18:44.725 --> 18:46.768
$700-billion army website

555
18:46.768 --> 18:47.625
and looking at it,

556
18:47.625 --> 18:48.478
and you know it's...

557
18:48.478 --> 18:49.514
It's a massive,

558
18:49.514 --> 18:52.169
massive entity, the army.

559
18:52.169 --> 18:54.205
But, the DIU has unleashed

560
18:54.205 --> 18:55.575
a really interesting conduit

561
18:55.575 --> 18:59.100
where you go to a website with great gooey,

562
18:59.100 --> 19:00.523
great user interface,

563
19:00.523 --> 19:01.665
it's easy to navigate,

564
19:01.665 --> 19:04.480
it's modern, they put out a project,

565
19:04.480 --> 19:07.079
this is all new within the last couple of years,

566
19:07.079 --> 19:10.095
and instead of closing down your business

567
19:10.095 --> 19:10.968
for a couple of weeks to write

568
19:10.968 --> 19:13.038
this robusto proposal,

569
19:13.038 --> 19:15.021
they simply ask you for a five-page

570
19:15.021 --> 19:16.576
written proposal,

571
19:16.576 --> 19:18.326
or 15-slides, not 16,

572
19:19.569 --> 19:21.069
not 13, 15-slides.

573
19:22.521 --> 19:23.581
Ya hit "submit",

574
19:23.581 --> 19:25.203
they let you know within two or three-weeks

575
19:25.203 --> 19:26.400
whether or not you move on,

576
19:26.400 --> 19:30.178
and they have simply streamlined the process.

577
19:30.178 --> 19:32.902
So, how have you seen that evolve

578
19:32.902 --> 19:34.180
in your career,

579
19:34.180 --> 19:35.998
I mean, now your former career at AFWERX?

580
19:35.998 --> 19:37.608
You had a hand in helping

581
19:37.608 --> 19:39.756
generate that evolution.

582
19:39.756 --> 19:41.971
<v ->Yeah, the whole point coming into this</v>

583
19:41.971 --> 19:44.036
was understanding it through the eyes

584
19:44.036 --> 19:45.108
of the small business,

585
19:45.108 --> 19:46.352
through the eyes of the startup,

586
19:46.352 --> 19:49.501
through the eyes of the technologist.

587
19:49.501 --> 19:50.626
You know, before...

588
19:50.626 --> 19:51.886
Before really the DIU's

589
19:51.886 --> 19:54.689
and the AFWERX's of the world,

590
19:54.689 --> 19:55.562
playing in...

591
19:55.562 --> 19:56.395
Playing in the defense space

592
19:56.395 --> 19:58.790
was kinda taboo from that standpoint,

593
19:58.790 --> 20:00.729
like they didn't wanna invest...

594
20:00.729 --> 20:01.747
You know, venture capital

595
20:01.747 --> 20:04.179
actually told investors to not go

596
20:04.179 --> 20:05.286
work with the military,

597
20:05.286 --> 20:06.489
or work with the...

598
20:06.489 --> 20:08.721
Work with the Department,

599
20:08.721 --> 20:09.774
for the sole factor of,

600
20:09.774 --> 20:11.394
"It's just gonna take a long time,

601
20:11.394 --> 20:12.863
it's gonna suck resources."

602
20:12.863 --> 20:14.446
So, a big key point

603
20:15.879 --> 20:17.914
that we were trying to get to was,

604
20:17.914 --> 20:19.134
"How do we make this process quicker?

605
20:19.134 --> 20:20.514
How do we let them know

606
20:20.514 --> 20:21.935
whether we wanna play or not?

607
20:21.935 --> 20:23.533
And do we have the capital,

608
20:23.533 --> 20:26.843
and the funding that we can put in place,

609
20:26.843 --> 20:28.944
you know, for the technology companies,

610
20:28.944 --> 20:30.368
to run them through the life-cycle

611
20:30.368 --> 20:31.486
that is the...

612
20:31.486 --> 20:33.468
You know, the larger acquisition process

613
20:33.468 --> 20:35.051
in the department?"

614
20:36.121 --> 20:38.605
And it's not just military application,

615
20:38.605 --> 20:40.338
like we talked about dual use,

616
20:40.338 --> 20:43.843
you know, the title this is "dual use",

617
20:43.843 --> 20:46.903
and so, that was a real key factor

618
20:46.903 --> 20:48.640
into what we were looking at,

619
20:48.640 --> 20:50.203
'cause we don't want to necessarily

620
20:50.203 --> 20:51.687
be that end customer,

621
20:51.687 --> 20:53.306
because when you look through again,

622
20:53.306 --> 20:55.873
the acquisition life cycle

623
20:55.873 --> 20:57.480
in the department,

624
20:57.480 --> 20:59.038
there are valleys,

625
20:59.038 --> 21:00.389
there are cliffs,

626
21:00.389 --> 21:01.400
there are you know,

627
21:01.400 --> 21:03.145
we're in a CR right now,

628
21:03.145 --> 21:05.357
a Continue Resolution where the funding

629
21:05.357 --> 21:06.239
may not come,

630
21:06.239 --> 21:08.687
so we definitely look for those

631
21:08.687 --> 21:10.520
dual use technologies,

632
21:11.478 --> 21:14.805
to be able to have your private sector client,

633
21:14.805 --> 21:15.972
your commercial client,

634
21:15.972 --> 21:17.788
as well as working with...

635
21:17.788 --> 21:20.153
Working with the department to better develop

636
21:20.153 --> 21:21.493
your technology.

637
21:21.493 --> 21:22.433
<v ->And just super quick,</v>

638
21:22.433 --> 21:23.266
and then we'll...

639
21:23.266 --> 21:26.203
We'll evolve the discussion.

640
21:26.203 --> 21:27.297
More commercial?

641
21:27.297 --> 21:28.468
Xiaoyu, can you give us an example

642
21:28.468 --> 21:32.239
of if you have leverage any of these

643
21:32.239 --> 21:34.906
new form submittals for funding?

644
21:35.757 --> 21:37.756
Because after all,

645
21:37.756 --> 21:39.268
our businesses need to eat,

646
21:39.268 --> 21:40.727
and in order to get off of the ground,

647
21:40.727 --> 21:41.560
you need...

648
21:41.560 --> 21:43.229
Some of us need to find capital to go out there,

649
21:43.229 --> 21:45.957
to help fuel said projects.

650
21:45.957 --> 21:46.858
<v ->Yeah, definitely.</v>

651
21:46.858 --> 21:49.705
We actually recently won a contract

652
21:49.705 --> 21:53.094
from the US Army Corp of Engineers,

653
21:53.094 --> 21:55.438
to provide a technology that can be used

654
21:55.438 --> 21:57.271
to invest, to monitor,

655
22:01.109 --> 22:02.526
and inspect dams,

656
22:04.292 --> 22:07.224
and lochs in the Pittsburgh area.

657
22:07.224 --> 22:10.015
And the process was smooth as you said,

658
22:10.015 --> 22:12.550
you know, because it's improved

659
22:12.550 --> 22:13.383
based on the needs

660
22:13.383 --> 22:14.423
of the small businesses,

661
22:14.423 --> 22:18.096
and the contract is very easy to execute,

662
22:18.096 --> 22:21.276
and it really provides a stabilizing cash flow

663
22:21.276 --> 22:23.677
for us to further devolve our technology,

664
22:23.677 --> 22:28.251
and really focus on getting the technology out,

665
22:28.251 --> 22:32.723
rather than satisfying investors' requirements.

666
22:32.723 --> 22:33.556
So, this is a...

667
22:33.556 --> 22:36.187
This kind of a innovation in a governing space

668
22:36.187 --> 22:37.780
is really helpful,

669
22:37.780 --> 22:39.505
critical for innovation.

670
22:39.505 --> 22:40.338
<v ->Yeah.</v>

671
22:40.338 --> 22:41.185
<v ->And if I can add to that?</v>

672
22:41.185 --> 22:42.411
So, I mean that's a perfect example

673
22:42.411 --> 22:43.660
where it's...

674
22:43.660 --> 22:44.635
It's you know...

675
22:44.635 --> 22:46.675
You think you're working with the military,

676
22:46.675 --> 22:47.855
you're working with the army,

677
22:47.855 --> 22:49.523
it's not just you know,

678
22:49.523 --> 22:50.407
bombs and drones,

679
22:50.407 --> 22:52.120
and stuff that gonna you know,

680
22:52.120 --> 22:53.287
attack things,

681
22:54.188 --> 22:55.698
we have critical infrastructure,

682
22:55.698 --> 22:57.251
we have you know,

683
22:57.251 --> 22:58.084
the lochs,

684
22:58.084 --> 22:58.917
and the dams,

685
22:58.917 --> 22:59.750
and everything else.

686
22:59.750 --> 23:01.180
And so, finding the technologies,

687
23:01.180 --> 23:02.705
so we don't have to send a diver down

688
23:02.705 --> 23:03.538
to look at things,

689
23:03.538 --> 23:04.371
or you know...

690
23:04.371 --> 23:07.585
Those are the real reason of dual-use

691
23:07.585 --> 23:09.055
that we're looking at.

692
23:09.055 --> 23:10.360
You know, I don't wanna...

693
23:10.360 --> 23:11.915
I wanna make sure that everyone understands

694
23:11.915 --> 23:14.035
it's not just the weaponization

695
23:14.035 --> 23:16.209
of your technology, it is...

696
23:16.209 --> 23:19.475
It is how we can further build

697
23:19.475 --> 23:22.570
the national security industrial base.

698
23:22.570 --> 23:23.770
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

699
23:23.770 --> 23:25.150
The same with you Olga,

700
23:25.150 --> 23:26.733
you guys saw early,

701
23:28.192 --> 23:29.025
really quick bids

702
23:29.025 --> 23:30.355
that were able to help keep your...

703
23:30.355 --> 23:32.064
Get your company off of the ground,

704
23:32.064 --> 23:35.005
and you were leveraging simpler platforms

705
23:35.005 --> 23:36.727
as opposed to these large robust,

706
23:36.727 --> 23:39.697
government, scary proposals.

707
23:39.697 --> 23:41.405
<v Olga>Yeah, absolutely.</v>

708
23:41.405 --> 23:43.687
Congrats on your win by the way.

709
23:43.687 --> 23:46.100
But yeah, our business,

710
23:46.100 --> 23:48.115
we've been in business for six-years,

711
23:48.115 --> 23:50.365
and that is how we have won

712
23:51.666 --> 23:53.000
the majority of our contract,

713
23:53.000 --> 23:54.879
is through flexible,

714
23:54.879 --> 23:56.315
and these like new,

715
23:56.315 --> 23:57.535
smart operations,

716
23:57.535 --> 23:58.618
like SOFWERX,

717
23:59.574 --> 24:02.275
Army Applications Lab, AFFWERX.

718
24:02.275 --> 24:05.108
And we were able to apply quickly,

719
24:06.250 --> 24:07.506
get an answer quickly.

720
24:07.506 --> 24:10.435
And I think one of the biggest benefits

721
24:10.435 --> 24:14.464
is the reporting on it is so much easier

722
24:14.464 --> 24:16.189
than anything you've ever encountered,

723
24:16.189 --> 24:18.634
if you've ever applied for like an NSF grant,

724
24:18.634 --> 24:20.942
or anything like that,

725
24:20.942 --> 24:23.553
you know, the reporting on it is so easy,

726
24:23.553 --> 24:26.470
and the payout on it is very quick,

727
24:27.500 --> 24:29.903
and flexible as well.

728
24:29.903 --> 24:32.455
For example, for folks that have not

729
24:32.455 --> 24:33.584
worked with SOFWERX,

730
24:33.584 --> 24:35.696
I don't know that there's been a time

731
24:35.696 --> 24:37.372
in six-years that I've billed them,

732
24:37.372 --> 24:38.764
and they haven't turned around a payment

733
24:38.764 --> 24:39.801
in like three days.

734
24:39.801 --> 24:42.384
So yeah, lots of really amazing

735
24:43.704 --> 24:45.119
opportunities out there.

736
24:45.119 --> 24:46.534
<v ->Yeah, that's...</v>

737
24:46.534 --> 24:47.431
This is vital in order

738
24:47.431 --> 24:48.829
to get our businesses off the ground

739
24:48.829 --> 24:51.006
and keep them fed until they hit

740
24:51.006 --> 24:53.186
that magic button where they don't need

741
24:53.186 --> 24:54.364
the runway over here,

742
24:54.364 --> 24:57.138
where they have found the path to productivity

743
24:57.138 --> 24:58.549
into revenue generation,

744
24:58.549 --> 25:00.301
and then subsequently profit.

745
25:00.301 --> 25:03.078
So, I have something I wanna pitch to you

746
25:03.078 --> 25:04.564
about commercial...

747
25:04.564 --> 25:05.899
About transitioning to commercial,

748
25:05.899 --> 25:06.964
but I'll...

749
25:06.964 --> 25:09.199
I'll share a little of how

750
25:09.199 --> 25:10.474
we view it at Carnegie Robotics,

751
25:10.474 --> 25:11.391
so we've...

752
25:12.725 --> 25:15.004
The group up here views it as commercial

753
25:15.004 --> 25:15.837
and defense,

754
25:15.837 --> 25:17.342
and I'm sure you do the same, right?

755
25:17.342 --> 25:18.319
So, the revenue that we bring in,

756
25:18.319 --> 25:19.152
and the projects,

757
25:19.152 --> 25:20.160
and the programs that we work on,

758
25:20.160 --> 25:21.094
be it software,

759
25:21.094 --> 25:22.444
hardware, or just...

760
25:22.444 --> 25:23.277
Just a thing,

761
25:23.277 --> 25:25.264
just a product or an engineering service,

762
25:25.264 --> 25:27.059
we like to segment our revenues

763
25:27.059 --> 25:27.960
between commercial

764
25:27.960 --> 25:28.793
and defense.

765
25:28.793 --> 25:30.940
Now, how you break that down revenue-wise,

766
25:30.940 --> 25:32.682
or just hypothetically,

767
25:32.682 --> 25:35.222
commercial's the fun stuff, right?

768
25:35.222 --> 25:36.364
Those are the programs

769
25:36.364 --> 25:38.701
that you're working with a privately held...

770
25:38.701 --> 25:39.960
A private company,

771
25:39.960 --> 25:41.559
a publicly traded company or whatever,

772
25:41.559 --> 25:43.480
non-military, right?

773
25:43.480 --> 25:45.499
And you build a relationship,

774
25:45.499 --> 25:47.134
and you get that contract,

775
25:47.134 --> 25:47.996
you get that work,

776
25:47.996 --> 25:48.834
you get that collaboration,

777
25:48.834 --> 25:50.088
that partnership,

778
25:50.088 --> 25:51.614
and you know,

779
25:51.614 --> 25:52.596
ya gotta go through this

780
25:52.596 --> 25:53.689
master of services process

781
25:53.689 --> 25:56.194
where you're gonna arm wrestle over the IP,

782
25:56.194 --> 25:57.349
and the exclusivity,

783
25:57.349 --> 25:59.121
and the termination clauses,

784
25:59.121 --> 26:00.802
and basically who gets the kids

785
26:00.802 --> 26:02.736
in the divorce, right?

786
26:02.736 --> 26:05.298
Margins are higher in work like that,

787
26:05.298 --> 26:08.559
north of 10/15/20% margin 'cause it's cool,

788
26:08.559 --> 26:10.354
exciting work with a private,

789
26:10.354 --> 26:11.933
or a publicly traded company.

790
26:11.933 --> 26:14.507
Then you have defense work, right?

791
26:14.507 --> 26:15.784
I'm not saying that it's boring,

792
26:15.784 --> 26:16.662
because it's not,

793
26:16.662 --> 26:17.689
it's actually quite exhilarating

794
26:17.689 --> 26:19.275
and exciting, 'cause it leads to commercial

795
26:19.275 --> 26:21.344
in the future, right?

796
26:21.344 --> 26:25.427
You have to go through a difficult time sometimes

797
26:26.278 --> 26:28.945
to get said government contract,

798
26:29.805 --> 26:32.850
the margins on government work are much smaller,

799
26:32.850 --> 26:35.775
5%/6%/7%,

800
26:35.775 --> 26:38.895
but it's non-dilutive capital, right?

801
26:38.895 --> 26:40.227
It's non-dilutive capital.

802
26:40.227 --> 26:42.690
I know with our work we get pretty special

803
26:42.690 --> 26:44.306
intellectual property rights

804
26:44.306 --> 26:46.646
to help us build subsequent platforms.

805
26:46.646 --> 26:48.495
So, the reason that I share that with you,

806
26:48.495 --> 26:50.518
is because we have been successful

807
26:50.518 --> 26:52.200
as a company now at 15-years-old

808
26:52.200 --> 26:53.040
and growing,

809
26:53.040 --> 26:54.718
to create a diverse model,

810
26:54.718 --> 26:56.475
whereas years ago,

811
26:56.475 --> 26:57.420
our government

812
26:57.420 --> 27:00.326
and defense work was probably around 15/20%

813
27:00.326 --> 27:01.197
of our revenues,

814
27:01.197 --> 27:02.278
where now at the close

815
27:02.278 --> 27:03.812
of last year's about 50/50,

816
27:03.812 --> 27:05.986
so that is a diverse model, right?

817
27:05.986 --> 27:08.445
So, I share that with you because we believe that

818
27:08.445 --> 27:10.454
that's what we have to do as a company

819
27:10.454 --> 27:11.920
in order to...

820
27:11.920 --> 27:13.837
Listen, there could be,

821
27:15.105 --> 27:17.576
sadly, a global conflict,

822
27:17.576 --> 27:18.780
that could impact our business

823
27:18.780 --> 27:20.505
with private companies, right?

824
27:20.505 --> 27:23.070
There could be a presidential election

825
27:23.070 --> 27:23.903
just occurred,

826
27:23.903 --> 27:26.069
or there could be shifts in congress,

827
27:26.069 --> 27:27.945
Taylor and Travis may break up,

828
27:27.945 --> 27:28.950
I don't know,

829
27:28.950 --> 27:30.660
there's a lot of things that could occur

830
27:30.660 --> 27:32.564
that could impact the trajectory of our business,

831
27:32.564 --> 27:35.280
that's why we must be diverse at all times.

832
27:35.280 --> 27:36.850
So, I turn over to commercial,

833
27:36.850 --> 27:38.578
and I'm looking at you Sanjiv,

834
27:38.578 --> 27:40.110
you guys started on commercial,

835
27:40.110 --> 27:42.810
you were really working heavily in military,

836
27:42.810 --> 27:45.027
are there plans longterm

837
27:45.027 --> 27:47.655
to take your technologies,

838
27:47.655 --> 27:48.596
and to adapt them,

839
27:48.596 --> 27:50.548
and integrate them into the commercial world?

840
27:50.548 --> 27:51.685
<v ->That's great,</v>

841
27:51.685 --> 27:53.308
and since the topic of this panel

842
27:53.308 --> 27:54.418
is about dual-use,

843
27:54.418 --> 27:55.858
we think about this all the time,

844
27:55.858 --> 27:58.040
and it's a good thing to bring up.

845
27:58.040 --> 27:59.458
I'll tell you about

846
27:59.458 --> 28:02.541
a conference I went to in Huntsville,

847
28:03.385 --> 28:04.757
where the Army Aviation is,

848
28:04.757 --> 28:06.452
and what they talked about is that,

849
28:06.452 --> 28:09.062
we have three uses of drones,

850
28:09.062 --> 28:11.372
or unmanned aircraft,

851
28:11.372 --> 28:12.898
they called it,

852
28:12.898 --> 28:15.332
"Find it. Move it. Kill it." Okay?

853
28:15.332 --> 28:16.632
It's a little hard to take sometimes,

854
28:16.632 --> 28:18.692
is I love the brevity of it.

855
28:18.692 --> 28:20.759
The "it" is not the same thing, right?

856
28:20.759 --> 28:23.040
You don't move the thing that you find

857
28:23.040 --> 28:25.232
and then kill the thing that you moved,

858
28:25.232 --> 28:26.535
it's three missions, right?

859
28:26.535 --> 28:27.785
So now, that...

860
28:28.782 --> 28:29.627
Having said that,

861
28:29.627 --> 28:30.706
so the question is,

862
28:30.706 --> 28:33.333
"Where, if we're going to do

863
28:33.333 --> 28:36.102
a military kind of start,

864
28:36.102 --> 28:37.992
will we find a commercial use-case?"

865
28:37.992 --> 28:39.912
So, I'll tell you that the two cases,

866
28:39.912 --> 28:41.012
the "Find it"

867
28:41.012 --> 28:42.512
and the "Move it" part

868
28:42.512 --> 28:44.672
have commercial applications.

869
28:44.672 --> 28:48.404
The "Find it" may be a little bit more nuanced,

870
28:48.404 --> 28:49.887
because "Find it" might not be

871
28:49.887 --> 28:50.922
just find a target,

872
28:50.922 --> 28:52.067
but it's like finding something,

873
28:52.067 --> 28:53.162
a fault in there.

874
28:53.162 --> 28:56.237
So inspection is a big deal with drones,

875
28:56.237 --> 28:57.070
we can...

876
28:57.070 --> 29:00.539
We actually have a enterprise much like yours,

877
29:00.539 --> 29:01.372
like Thorough,

878
29:01.372 --> 29:03.151
we have a division called Proxim

879
29:03.151 --> 29:05.593
that is looking to inspect large aircraft

880
29:05.593 --> 29:07.412
with small drones, okay?

881
29:07.412 --> 29:10.216
And the idea is just like,

882
29:10.216 --> 29:12.407
you want to do all sorts of predictive analysis,

883
29:12.407 --> 29:15.272
you wanna be able to capture some data,

884
29:15.272 --> 29:17.011
we use these small drones that can fly around

885
29:17.011 --> 29:18.332
without any infrastructure,

886
29:18.332 --> 29:22.037
map a larger aircraft like the C-17,

887
29:22.037 --> 29:24.182
but also could be a A380,

888
29:24.182 --> 29:25.517
or a 777,

889
29:25.517 --> 29:28.934
787, and then be able to find the defects

890
29:29.912 --> 29:32.805
and deal with all of the sort of logist...

891
29:32.805 --> 29:34.920
The data analytics that's associated

892
29:34.920 --> 29:36.302
with containing aircraft,

893
29:36.302 --> 29:37.397
which is a very big deal,

894
29:37.397 --> 29:38.762
hard to do in the military

895
29:38.762 --> 29:40.437
for reasons of footprint,

896
29:40.437 --> 29:43.032
you know, the number of people involved,

897
29:43.032 --> 29:44.222
but also, very,

898
29:44.222 --> 29:46.273
very useful for the commercial side, okay?

899
29:46.273 --> 29:48.328
So, we have deployments in Doha,

900
29:48.328 --> 29:50.489
working with Emirates,

901
29:50.489 --> 29:51.557
and other places.

902
29:51.557 --> 29:52.890
Also at the same time,

903
29:52.890 --> 29:54.362
we're working with the US Air Force

904
29:54.362 --> 29:56.352
to inspect large aircraft.

905
29:56.352 --> 29:57.185
The other side,

906
29:57.185 --> 30:00.298
the "Move it" side is like an obvious thing,

907
30:00.298 --> 30:01.131
you know?

908
30:01.131 --> 30:01.964
We need DHL,

909
30:01.964 --> 30:04.007
UPS, you name it,

910
30:04.007 --> 30:06.012
FedEx want to move things,

911
30:06.012 --> 30:07.048
and the idea is that

912
30:07.048 --> 30:09.479
if you could move these things autonomously

913
30:09.479 --> 30:10.425
without somebody,

914
30:10.425 --> 30:12.797
and safely from "A" to "B",

915
30:12.797 --> 30:15.120
not the last mile,

916
30:15.120 --> 30:17.162
but the mid-mile,

917
30:17.162 --> 30:18.917
you could actually be able

918
30:18.917 --> 30:22.000
to meet the cost per kilo of a truck,

919
30:24.089 --> 30:24.922
and that's a very,

920
30:24.922 --> 30:26.792
very attractive kind of a proposition

921
30:26.792 --> 30:27.872
to be able to do that.

922
30:27.872 --> 30:28.742
So, all of these things

923
30:28.742 --> 30:30.239
are a little futuristic,

924
30:30.239 --> 30:32.192
they will take some time,

925
30:32.192 --> 30:35.859
The FA is not eager to be super progressive,

926
30:36.752 --> 30:38.263
or, progressive is the wrong word,

927
30:38.263 --> 30:39.096
"cutting edge"?

928
30:39.096 --> 30:41.747
Because they care deeply about safety,

929
30:41.747 --> 30:42.580
and you know,

930
30:42.580 --> 30:45.302
don't get a lot of benefit from making these...

931
30:45.302 --> 30:46.662
Accelerating these technologies,

932
30:46.662 --> 30:48.707
get their hand slapped when something bad happens.

933
30:48.707 --> 30:50.267
So, I think the...

934
30:50.267 --> 30:52.337
You know, we have to prove these technologies out

935
30:52.337 --> 30:54.242
before they enter commercial service,

936
30:54.242 --> 30:55.164
how we're gonna do that?

937
30:55.164 --> 30:55.997
Well you know,

938
30:55.997 --> 30:58.695
if you've had some technology flying

939
30:58.695 --> 31:00.569
for tens or hundreds of thousands

940
31:00.569 --> 31:02.483
of hours on a military setting,

941
31:02.483 --> 31:03.316
then you know,

942
31:03.316 --> 31:04.474
we might be able to make the case

943
31:04.474 --> 31:07.832
that it's okay to fly between Allan Town

944
31:07.832 --> 31:10.197
and Zelienople, think about that.

945
31:10.197 --> 31:11.647
<v ->Yeah, that's far away.</v>

946
31:11.647 --> 31:13.152
Thank you.

947
31:13.152 --> 31:15.367
Olga, the same with you guys,

948
31:15.367 --> 31:16.432
there's gonna be an evolution

949
31:16.432 --> 31:17.622
into the commercial space,

950
31:17.622 --> 31:18.457
so what kind...

951
31:18.457 --> 31:19.797
I mean, without giving away too much,

952
31:19.797 --> 31:22.194
and people tweeting it out,

953
31:22.194 --> 31:23.109
what can you share

954
31:23.109 --> 31:24.147
of what you're looking at

955
31:24.147 --> 31:26.183
in the commercial space?

956
31:26.183 --> 31:27.852
<v ->Yeah, I mean,</v>

957
31:27.852 --> 31:29.519
I think that for us,

958
31:30.372 --> 31:33.417
I agree with everything you said Sanjiv,

959
31:33.417 --> 31:34.377
you know, safety is very,

960
31:34.377 --> 31:35.627
very important.

961
31:36.519 --> 31:39.102
So, I see in the future, KEF...

962
31:39.942 --> 31:42.942
KEF's products being a backup system

963
31:43.870 --> 31:44.953
for you know,

964
31:45.938 --> 31:47.767
large aircraft, right?

965
31:47.767 --> 31:49.261
So, GPS fails,

966
31:49.261 --> 31:51.453
comms fail, pilot can't figure out

967
31:51.453 --> 31:53.453
how to land an aircraft,

968
31:54.458 --> 31:58.226
might not know where they are in air space,

969
31:58.226 --> 32:00.392
a system like ours could be able

970
32:00.392 --> 32:02.603
to lead that pilot home safely.

971
32:02.603 --> 32:04.710
So, this is in the future,

972
32:04.710 --> 32:07.109
right now, you know,

973
32:07.109 --> 32:08.326
we're having...

974
32:08.326 --> 32:09.753
We can see this all over the world,

975
32:09.753 --> 32:12.571
right now we can't even get a small drone

976
32:12.571 --> 32:15.382
from point "A" to point "B" without conflict,

977
32:15.382 --> 32:17.503
right now, there's been a ton of news

978
32:17.503 --> 32:19.586
about airplane accidents,

979
32:21.777 --> 32:25.391
and also just confusion in you know,

980
32:25.391 --> 32:27.428
GPS, so we need to solve

981
32:27.428 --> 32:31.011
these smaller problems first in my opinion.

982
32:32.128 --> 32:33.711
<v ->So, 10-years ago,</v>

983
32:35.546 --> 32:37.825
I remember, I think a lot of people can relate

984
32:37.825 --> 32:39.297
to this in the room.

985
32:39.297 --> 32:40.419
I remember going home,

986
32:40.419 --> 32:41.602
I saw a drone,

987
32:41.602 --> 32:42.435
then I went

988
32:42.435 --> 32:43.268
and told my wife,

989
32:43.268 --> 32:44.640
go, "Babe, I saw a drone."

990
32:44.640 --> 32:45.473
"Really?"

991
32:45.473 --> 32:46.581
"Yeah, I saw a drone."

992
32:46.581 --> 32:49.550
The dude had a little joystick,

993
32:49.550 --> 32:51.090
and he had a little camera on it,

994
32:51.090 --> 32:52.443
it was a GoPro,

995
32:52.443 --> 32:53.904
like the guys that jump off the mountain,

996
32:53.904 --> 32:55.483
like really, could see like perfectly

997
32:55.483 --> 32:56.318
crystal clear,

998
32:56.318 --> 32:58.071
"Oh, how about that."

999
32:58.071 --> 32:58.988
Fast-forward 10-years now,

1000
32:58.988 --> 33:01.229
everybody and their step sister has a drone,

1001
33:01.229 --> 33:03.355
and there's a drone company sprouting up,

1002
33:03.355 --> 33:04.854
probably 10 today,

1003
33:04.854 --> 33:06.385
in this room, right?

1004
33:06.385 --> 33:07.412
So, it's...

1005
33:07.412 --> 33:08.496
And I love that,

1006
33:08.496 --> 33:09.377
I love that innovation,

1007
33:09.377 --> 33:10.479
I love that entrepreneur spirit.

1008
33:10.479 --> 33:11.409
So, those are the challenges

1009
33:11.409 --> 33:13.591
that you dealt with in you know,

1010
33:13.591 --> 33:17.022
to try to find that unique value prop.

1011
33:17.022 --> 33:19.238
You know, we also saw it in autonomy

1012
33:19.238 --> 33:20.241
with military,

1013
33:20.241 --> 33:22.177
if you went 10-years-ago to an AUSA,

1014
33:22.177 --> 33:23.755
Association for US Army,

1015
33:23.755 --> 33:24.588
you walked in

1016
33:24.588 --> 33:26.268
and you were autotomizing a thing,

1017
33:26.268 --> 33:27.661
you were the belle at the ball,

1018
33:27.661 --> 33:29.441
today everybody's doing it.

1019
33:29.441 --> 33:31.419
So, our businesses are tasked

1020
33:31.419 --> 33:33.072
with constantly evolving

1021
33:33.072 --> 33:35.278
and finding that unique valued prop,

1022
33:35.278 --> 33:38.742
so in the Aquatonomy space, how...

1023
33:38.742 --> 33:40.613
How are you looking at the future?

1024
33:40.613 --> 33:41.470
Because right now you guys

1025
33:41.470 --> 33:45.553
are building software for cutting-edge processes,

1026
33:46.675 --> 33:48.034
but you're gonna see where you're gonna go

1027
33:48.034 --> 33:49.240
in the commercial space,

1028
33:49.240 --> 33:50.990
or is it the unknown?

1029
33:52.868 --> 33:55.317
<v ->It is actually not unknown,</v>

1030
33:55.317 --> 33:56.275
the reason I can say this

1031
33:56.275 --> 33:58.178
is because we're fortunate enough

1032
33:58.178 --> 33:59.589
to have very...

1033
33:59.589 --> 34:02.287
To fuel very early customer engagement,

1034
34:02.287 --> 34:03.850
even before our products are ready

1035
34:03.850 --> 34:06.255
to deeply understand

1036
34:06.255 --> 34:08.507
what the customer's paying points are,

1037
34:08.507 --> 34:09.722
what their needs are,

1038
34:09.722 --> 34:11.169
and how they will like solution

1039
34:11.169 --> 34:13.410
to work for them, both in...

1040
34:13.410 --> 34:16.783
Because we're in duel technology space,

1041
34:16.783 --> 34:17.999
we engage customer both

1042
34:17.999 --> 34:20.601
in the government sector,

1043
34:20.601 --> 34:22.906
and also in commercial sector.

1044
34:22.906 --> 34:23.743
Under water environments

1045
34:23.743 --> 34:26.305
are very difficult to reach,

1046
34:26.305 --> 34:28.015
navigate, there's no GPS,

1047
34:28.015 --> 34:31.151
and it presents a very different

1048
34:31.151 --> 34:32.559
set of challenges,

1049
34:32.559 --> 34:33.530
compared to land

1050
34:33.530 --> 34:34.929
and sky.

1051
34:34.929 --> 34:36.959
Amazingly, currently,

1052
34:36.959 --> 34:38.603
most of the underwater inspections

1053
34:38.603 --> 34:40.575
are still done by divers,

1054
34:40.575 --> 34:41.771
it is very dangerous,

1055
34:41.771 --> 34:42.618
and a hard...

1056
34:42.618 --> 34:44.868
Difficult work environment,

1057
34:47.289 --> 34:48.584
and it's also very expensive

1058
34:48.584 --> 34:50.291
because of the challenges.

1059
34:50.291 --> 34:52.543
By introducing autonomy,

1060
34:52.543 --> 34:53.803
as I said that we're specialized

1061
34:53.803 --> 34:55.980
in autonomous underwater navigation,

1062
34:55.980 --> 34:56.980
and mapping.

1063
34:59.036 --> 35:01.599
Especially in complex areas,

1064
35:01.599 --> 35:03.404
and even in turbulent water,

1065
35:03.404 --> 35:05.321
so by introducing autonomy,

1066
35:05.321 --> 35:07.488
we drastically accelerate,

1067
35:09.375 --> 35:12.937
and simplify underwater data collection.

1068
35:12.937 --> 35:15.705
And because of the localization technology

1069
35:15.705 --> 35:16.783
that we develop,

1070
35:16.783 --> 35:21.037
we're able to build 3D models that are accurate,

1071
35:21.037 --> 35:23.833
allowing the users to identify problems

1072
35:23.833 --> 35:25.228
and keep track of changes.

1073
35:25.228 --> 35:29.018
So, by introducing the cutting edge technology

1074
35:29.018 --> 35:30.012
in the industry,

1075
35:30.012 --> 35:32.908
we transform how things are done,

1076
35:32.908 --> 35:35.386
so that is the future that we're seeing.

1077
35:35.386 --> 35:36.219
<v ->I love it.</v>

1078
35:36.219 --> 35:37.883
I wanna jump really quick,

1079
35:37.883 --> 35:40.203
because we have five-minutes left,

1080
35:40.203 --> 35:41.391
to see if there's any questions,

1081
35:41.391 --> 35:42.639
if everybody's okay with that?

1082
35:42.639 --> 35:45.231
And we already got one,

1083
35:45.231 --> 35:46.223
go for it.

1084
35:46.223 --> 35:47.631
Do it buddy, shout it!

1085
35:47.631 --> 35:49.519
<v Aaron>Okay. Hi, my name's Aaron,</v>

1086
35:49.519 --> 35:52.431
so, I wonder how you all think about

1087
35:52.431 --> 35:55.439
the evolution of the ground control station?

1088
35:55.439 --> 35:57.422
I mean, some drones are big,

1089
35:57.422 --> 35:59.215
and maybe they're not gonna ever you know,

1090
35:59.215 --> 36:00.606
like send their...

1091
36:00.606 --> 36:02.623
Send what they're looking at or sensing

1092
36:02.623 --> 36:04.869
into a human at the ground,

1093
36:04.869 --> 36:07.889
but a lot of the smaller form drones you know,

1094
36:07.889 --> 36:10.591
the legacy is the come with some custom GCS,

1095
36:10.591 --> 36:11.509
and if that thing breaks,

1096
36:11.509 --> 36:13.317
then whatever the drone was doing,

1097
36:13.317 --> 36:14.580
it's you know kinda worthless.

1098
36:14.580 --> 36:15.954
So, how do you guys think about that?

1099
36:15.954 --> 36:17.157
How do you think about,

1100
36:17.157 --> 36:19.445
as a drone company,

1101
36:19.445 --> 36:20.641
what's your responsibility

1102
36:20.641 --> 36:22.576
to think about the network?

1103
36:22.576 --> 36:23.978
Or do you leave that to others?

1104
36:23.978 --> 36:25.848
Just looking for your thoughts.

1105
36:25.848 --> 36:27.600
<v ->Yeah, thank you.</v>

1106
36:27.600 --> 36:30.084
We decided that not only did we want

1107
36:30.084 --> 36:32.335
to actually work on the autonomy in the air,

1108
36:32.335 --> 36:36.082
but we wanted to create a whole ecosystem

1109
36:36.082 --> 36:38.415
for how drones could be used

1110
36:39.436 --> 36:40.881
to request for supplies,

1111
36:40.881 --> 36:43.045
to then monitor the aircraft

1112
36:43.045 --> 36:44.032
that actually deliver it,

1113
36:44.032 --> 36:45.317
to re-task them,

1114
36:45.317 --> 36:47.684
or doing anything that exceptional.

1115
36:47.684 --> 36:48.715
So, we created a thing

1116
36:48.715 --> 36:50.028
called "Push Button Delivery",

1117
36:50.028 --> 36:53.346
which sits on top of some standards

1118
36:53.346 --> 36:54.769
like 8TACK, okay?

1119
36:54.769 --> 36:55.696
So, "Push Button Delivery"

1120
36:55.696 --> 36:58.734
has exactly the amount of information

1121
36:58.734 --> 37:01.029
that a person in the field needs

1122
37:01.029 --> 37:03.167
for just the logistics task,

1123
37:03.167 --> 37:04.822
and you can imagine I think the way to do this

1124
37:04.822 --> 37:07.300
is not a confusing kind of a panel

1125
37:07.300 --> 37:09.656
with all sorts of status,

1126
37:09.656 --> 37:12.847
like somewhere in here with lots of tabs,

1127
37:12.847 --> 37:15.087
et cetera, to be able to look

1128
37:15.087 --> 37:16.345
at the different status,

1129
37:16.345 --> 37:18.482
you wanna know as the requester,

1130
37:18.482 --> 37:20.348
"Hey, I asked for something,

1131
37:20.348 --> 37:22.162
I asked for this in the field,

1132
37:22.162 --> 37:25.218
and now, how far away is it?"

1133
37:25.218 --> 37:26.976
And it's close by,

1134
37:26.976 --> 37:28.944
is it okay to land...

1135
37:28.944 --> 37:30.194
Loiter or land,

1136
37:30.194 --> 37:31.361
okay to land,

1137
37:31.361 --> 37:32.194
and if it's not,

1138
37:32.194 --> 37:33.280
if the person doesn't respond,

1139
37:33.280 --> 37:34.813
it has to make it's own mind up

1140
37:34.813 --> 37:35.869
whether she's okay to land,

1141
37:35.869 --> 37:36.945
or go back.

1142
37:36.945 --> 37:40.018
So, this is the idea of what we call

1143
37:40.018 --> 37:40.860
"Push Button Delivery",

1144
37:40.860 --> 37:42.530
and I think the idea of comms channels,

1145
37:42.530 --> 37:44.945
I think you wanna be completely transparent

1146
37:44.945 --> 37:46.818
to whatever is out there.

1147
37:46.818 --> 37:48.050
So, in our case,

1148
37:48.050 --> 37:49.407
we use mesh radios,

1149
37:49.407 --> 37:50.764
the ones that the marine corp uses,

1150
37:50.764 --> 37:53.794
we use some sort of a Satcom kind of thing

1151
37:53.794 --> 37:56.591
and any other kind of like cell service,

1152
37:56.591 --> 38:00.082
that's all built into a comms panel,

1153
38:00.082 --> 38:02.402
which is completely transparent to the user.

1154
38:02.402 --> 38:03.662
So, if you're...

1155
38:03.662 --> 38:05.630
If you're nowhere where there's infrastructure,

1156
38:05.630 --> 38:07.198
then you have a slower link, okay?

1157
38:07.198 --> 38:09.474
And the idea is that the person

1158
38:09.474 --> 38:12.391
on either end of the delivery thing

1159
38:13.458 --> 38:15.260
is gonna only look at very,

1160
38:15.260 --> 38:18.028
very low bandwidth kind of information

1161
38:18.028 --> 38:19.454
using all the information

1162
38:19.454 --> 38:20.834
that's already out there.

1163
38:20.834 --> 38:23.132
And so, you can get it faster,

1164
38:23.132 --> 38:24.642
or you can get it,

1165
38:24.642 --> 38:26.348
you know, whatever is the...

1166
38:26.348 --> 38:29.565
Is the mode that works the best at that time,

1167
38:29.565 --> 38:31.201
so that's just completely transparent,

1168
38:31.201 --> 38:32.432
we don't wanna take any kinda stake

1169
38:32.432 --> 38:34.290
into what kind of...

1170
38:34.290 --> 38:36.524
What kind of challenge should be used.

1171
38:36.524 --> 38:37.357
<v ->Thank you. Any...</v>

1172
38:37.357 --> 38:38.626
Anybody else, another question?

1173
38:38.626 --> 38:41.626
Oh. Enthusiastic in the front. Here.

1174
38:44.384 --> 38:45.794
<v Shonya>Hi, my name is Shonya,</v>

1175
38:45.794 --> 38:48.092
and my question was around a point

1176
38:48.092 --> 38:48.978
that you mentioned,

1177
38:48.978 --> 38:50.594
that the FA's being super cautious

1178
38:50.594 --> 38:51.667
with you know,

1179
38:51.667 --> 38:52.828
allowing commercialization

1180
38:52.828 --> 38:55.123
of technology like drones,

1181
38:55.123 --> 38:56.995
but then we see companies like Zipline,

1182
38:56.995 --> 38:59.256
Prime Air already building infrastructure

1183
38:59.256 --> 39:00.339
for you know,

1184
39:01.289 --> 39:03.718
delivery, last time delivery.

1185
39:03.718 --> 39:05.898
Do you have a metric

1186
39:05.898 --> 39:08.920
or a number of years where you can say,

1187
39:08.920 --> 39:10.056
"Okay, in these many years,

1188
39:10.056 --> 39:12.438
commercial drones are going to be

1189
39:12.438 --> 39:14.632
a normal thing in society."?

1190
39:14.632 --> 39:16.597
Or at least in the US.

1191
39:16.597 --> 39:17.430
<v ->We have to go,</v>

1192
39:17.430 --> 39:18.905
15-seconds or less,

1193
39:18.905 --> 39:20.383
answer it, 'cause I wanna get to work.

1194
39:20.383 --> 39:22.634
<v ->I don't think that there is any such thing,</v>

1195
39:22.634 --> 39:24.109
any prediction that works here,

1196
39:24.109 --> 39:25.882
I think it has to do with politics,

1197
39:25.882 --> 39:27.305
it has to do with a level of safety

1198
39:27.305 --> 39:30.243
our society decides it wants to, okay?

1199
39:30.243 --> 39:32.993
I can say more later if you like.

1200
39:34.670 --> 39:36.050
<v ->Who else?</v>

1201
39:36.050 --> 39:38.133
This person. That person.

1202
39:40.041 --> 39:41.414
<v Bob>Bob Kurt, Wilkins &amp; Barker.</v>

1203
39:41.414 --> 39:44.440
I had a quick question on the public panic,

1204
39:44.440 --> 39:46.716
the fever pitch over drone sightings

1205
39:46.716 --> 39:47.699
in the North East,

1206
39:47.699 --> 39:48.702
do you think that's going to be

1207
39:48.702 --> 39:50.894
good for business or bad for business,

1208
39:50.894 --> 39:52.008
and why?

1209
39:52.008 --> 39:53.021
<v ->Those were Olga's drones.</v>

1210
39:53.021 --> 39:55.153
(audience laughing)

1211
39:55.153 --> 39:59.460
<v ->Mike, you said you weren't gonna tell anybody.</v>

1212
39:59.460 --> 40:01.873
<v ->Olga, do you have a response to that, or?</v>

1213
40:01.873 --> 40:03.177
(Mike laughing)

1214
40:03.177 --> 40:04.532
<v ->I could just tell you at Thanksgiving,</v>

1215
40:04.532 --> 40:05.415
it was the sat with this.

1216
40:05.415 --> 40:06.583
"Those are your drones?"

1217
40:06.583 --> 40:07.524
"Those are your drones?"

1218
40:07.524 --> 40:08.720
Sorry, can't say.

1219
40:08.720 --> 40:09.601
If I ever told ya,

1220
40:09.601 --> 40:11.220
I'd have to shoot you.

1221
40:11.220 --> 40:14.772
I think that there's some hysteria here

1222
40:14.772 --> 40:16.692
about the kinds of drones,

1223
40:16.692 --> 40:18.000
and we just haven't gotten used to it,

1224
40:18.000 --> 40:19.268
just like self-driving cars,

1225
40:19.268 --> 40:22.606
this is a technology that has...

1226
40:22.606 --> 40:23.812
I mean, the technology works,

1227
40:23.812 --> 40:25.408
but there's a question of public acceptance,

1228
40:25.408 --> 40:27.044
it's just gonna take some time

1229
40:27.044 --> 40:29.461
for us to be able to do this.

1230
40:32.496 --> 40:34.110
<v Terran>Hey folks, my name is Terran.</v>

1231
40:34.110 --> 40:34.943
Very nice discussion,

1232
40:34.943 --> 40:36.976
I kind of have a very,

1233
40:36.976 --> 40:38.869
maybe like a general question for folks,

1234
40:38.869 --> 40:39.814
as someone who's worked on

1235
40:39.814 --> 40:41.139
autonomy systems in the past.

1236
40:41.139 --> 40:43.974
With the advent of where AI is going,

1237
40:43.974 --> 40:47.557
and all the innovations in AI specifically,

1238
40:48.790 --> 40:51.410
how fast are your guys' development cycles

1239
40:51.410 --> 40:53.314
for your stacks?

1240
40:53.314 --> 40:56.064
And, is there an AI tool,

1241
40:56.064 --> 40:58.262
or an AI system that you think

1242
40:58.262 --> 41:00.595
would make your work faster?

1243
41:03.278 --> 41:04.715
<v ->Let me give it to you again.</v>

1244
41:04.715 --> 41:05.548
Go for it.

1245
41:05.548 --> 41:06.966
<v ->Okay, so look,</v>

1246
41:06.966 --> 41:08.400
AI and machine learning

1247
41:08.400 --> 41:12.042
are sort of being conflated, right?

1248
41:12.042 --> 41:13.513
I don't know what you call AI,

1249
41:13.513 --> 41:14.825
but I'm betting that,

1250
41:14.825 --> 41:16.202
that is the case,

1251
41:16.202 --> 41:17.179
that it's machine learning.

1252
41:17.179 --> 41:18.504
We try as a company,

1253
41:18.504 --> 41:19.904
not to put any of that

1254
41:19.904 --> 41:22.266
into safety critical systems, okay?

1255
41:22.266 --> 41:24.182
Safety critical systems need a process,

1256
41:24.182 --> 41:26.180
it's that part I talked about,

1257
41:26.180 --> 41:27.733
about the assurance that you need

1258
41:27.733 --> 41:29.269
to prove to people that...

1259
41:29.269 --> 41:30.501
All the stakeholders, right?

1260
41:30.501 --> 41:31.916
That the user,

1261
41:31.916 --> 41:32.916
the sponsor,

1262
41:34.067 --> 41:35.270
and even the insurers

1263
41:35.270 --> 41:36.368
that this thing is gonna work.

1264
41:36.368 --> 41:39.026
And aviation has very establish standards,

1265
41:39.026 --> 41:43.573
170A/DO254, you can't skip those kinds of things,

1266
41:43.573 --> 41:44.512
if these things is gonna have

1267
41:44.512 --> 41:46.158
some sort of a lasting impact.

1268
41:46.158 --> 41:47.349
So you know,

1269
41:47.349 --> 41:49.037
hey you wanna use machine learning

1270
41:49.037 --> 41:51.939
to possible detect lung cancer early?

1271
41:51.939 --> 41:53.335
Go for it.

1272
41:53.335 --> 41:55.004
You know, you want it to detect

1273
41:55.004 --> 41:58.337
that your carburetor is potentially misfiring

1274
41:58.337 --> 41:59.894
ahead of time,

1275
41:59.894 --> 42:01.783
early warning,

1276
42:01.783 --> 42:03.632
or your tires are getting worn out?

1277
42:03.632 --> 42:04.465
Go for it,

1278
42:04.465 --> 42:05.354
you know, ahead of time.

1279
42:05.354 --> 42:07.510
But, to put it inside a decision loop,

1280
42:07.510 --> 42:09.366
I think is a mistake

1281
42:09.366 --> 42:10.620
and you know,

1282
42:10.620 --> 42:12.038
all of these people trying to think

1283
42:12.038 --> 42:14.598
that more data is gonna solve the problem,

1284
42:14.598 --> 42:16.822
just see how many years it is

1285
42:16.822 --> 42:18.260
before we have a million

1286
42:18.260 --> 42:20.886
Robotaxis running around.

1287
42:20.886 --> 42:22.518
That was promised many years ago,

1288
42:22.518 --> 42:23.590
I'm still waiting,

1289
42:23.590 --> 42:24.822
so I think, you know...

1290
42:24.822 --> 42:26.102
<v ->We take a similar approach.</v>

1291
42:26.102 --> 42:28.006
I know we're over time,

1292
42:28.006 --> 42:29.440
but if you wanna get up

1293
42:29.440 --> 42:30.273
and leave, you can leave,

1294
42:30.273 --> 42:31.749
but I know there's probably two more questions,

1295
42:31.749 --> 42:32.582
if you'd like?

1296
42:32.582 --> 42:33.457
Go ahead, sir.

1297
42:33.457 --> 42:34.454
Go ahead.

1298
42:34.454 --> 42:36.886
<v Audience Member>So, as a member</v>

1299
42:36.886 --> 42:40.300
of the RC model aircraft community,

1300
42:40.300 --> 42:42.408
once the Walmart drones came out,

1301
42:42.408 --> 42:45.288
basically the FA nearly killed the hobby.

1302
42:45.288 --> 42:46.820
So, seeing...

1303
42:46.820 --> 42:49.606
And it has a massive track record,

1304
42:49.606 --> 42:52.856
very long track record of no incidents.

1305
42:55.347 --> 42:57.302
So, keeping that in mind,

1306
42:57.302 --> 43:00.307
when I see this commercial drone...

1307
43:00.307 --> 43:02.629
(audio cutting out)

1308
43:02.629 --> 43:03.629
over cities,

1309
43:04.499 --> 43:07.446
I always think about this technology,

1310
43:07.446 --> 43:08.769
and then actually trying to get

1311
43:08.769 --> 43:12.610
the technology into the public sphere.

1312
43:12.610 --> 43:14.527
Something as simple as,

1313
43:17.558 --> 43:19.142
you don't have a camera,

1314
43:19.142 --> 43:20.370
it won't have video feeds,

1315
43:20.370 --> 43:21.939
you're gonna record those video feeds,

1316
43:21.939 --> 43:23.622
now what about,

1317
43:23.622 --> 43:25.078
you flew over someone's backyard

1318
43:25.078 --> 43:29.510
and they were sunbathing without any clothes,

1319
43:29.510 --> 43:30.343
you know?

1320
43:31.238 --> 43:33.277
Just simple stuff like that you know,

1321
43:33.277 --> 43:35.947
that's an extreme example, but...

1322
43:35.947 --> 43:36.880
And like for example,

1323
43:36.880 --> 43:38.320
wind turbines,

1324
43:38.320 --> 43:41.136
they fail not because of the technologies,

1325
43:41.136 --> 43:42.000
because of local...

1326
43:42.000 --> 43:45.237
(audience member speaking softly)

1327
43:45.237 --> 43:47.210
<v ->Yeah, thank you.</v>

1328
43:47.210 --> 43:50.528
<v Audience Member>So, the question was,</v>

1329
43:50.528 --> 43:51.445
is there...

1330
43:53.306 --> 43:54.189
What are...

1331
43:54.189 --> 43:56.987
What's in place to start addressing

1332
43:56.987 --> 43:59.168
those kind of concerns?

1333
43:59.168 --> 44:01.386
Whether it's amongst you,

1334
44:01.386 --> 44:04.672
or is there like a lobby group

1335
44:04.672 --> 44:07.245
that is starting to think about this,

1336
44:07.245 --> 44:10.160
and has to come up with education

1337
44:10.160 --> 44:11.072
for the politicians...

1338
44:11.072 --> 44:12.736
(audience member speaking softly)

1339
44:12.736 --> 44:13.968
<v ->Get him, Sanjiv!</v>

1340
44:13.968 --> 44:15.421
<v ->Oh jeez.</v>

1341
44:15.421 --> 44:16.480
<v ->Sorry rest of panel,</v>

1342
44:16.480 --> 44:18.288
I'm just gonna have Sanjiv just take 'em.

1343
44:18.288 --> 44:20.311
<v ->Okay, so there's a simple thing</v>

1344
44:20.311 --> 44:23.355
that I think the mayor of Pittsburgh,

1345
44:23.355 --> 44:24.703
the ex mayor of Pittsburgh said,

1346
44:24.703 --> 44:26.112
we we were talking about this,

1347
44:26.112 --> 44:26.945
and he said,

1348
44:26.945 --> 44:28.349
"Well, what is the rule

1349
44:28.349 --> 44:30.058
that you'd have to have,

1350
44:30.058 --> 44:31.926
what is the common sense idea

1351
44:31.926 --> 44:36.022
that if somebody put up a camera on your house,

1352
44:36.022 --> 44:37.648
looking into the neighbor's yard?"

1353
44:37.648 --> 44:38.481
You know?

1354
44:38.481 --> 44:41.552
The same thing should apply to drones, you know?

1355
44:41.552 --> 44:42.935
So, there's some common sense things

1356
44:42.935 --> 44:44.096
I think...

1357
44:44.096 --> 44:46.608
I'm not as worried about privacy

1358
44:46.608 --> 44:48.336
as I am with safety.

1359
44:48.336 --> 44:49.721
And here's the thing that I wanna say,

1360
44:49.721 --> 44:50.859
a little controversial,

1361
44:50.859 --> 44:53.947
the same things that we are working on

1362
44:53.947 --> 44:56.080
to keep these...

1363
44:56.080 --> 44:58.721
Make these aircraft fly safely,

1364
44:58.721 --> 45:00.283
even when things go wrong,

1365
45:00.283 --> 45:03.022
could be used in not so great uses.

1366
45:03.022 --> 45:05.961
If you have a low-flying aircraft

1367
45:05.961 --> 45:07.084
that can fly by itself,

1368
45:07.084 --> 45:08.404
that doesn't need any comms,

1369
45:08.404 --> 45:09.610
and doesn't need any GPS,

1370
45:09.610 --> 45:11.542
where could it not go, right?

1371
45:11.542 --> 45:13.700
So, I think that the safety issue

1372
45:13.700 --> 45:15.447
is a bigger issue right now,

1373
45:15.447 --> 45:16.688
both from the idea,

1374
45:16.688 --> 45:18.608
"What happens if it doesn't work,

1375
45:18.608 --> 45:19.775
and it falls?"

1376
45:20.997 --> 45:22.538
You know, somebody walking their dog,

1377
45:22.538 --> 45:24.368
and then a drone falls on them?

1378
45:24.368 --> 45:25.615
Okay, that's no good.

1379
45:25.615 --> 45:27.316
But, what if it also works?

1380
45:27.316 --> 45:28.879
What if it works really well?

1381
45:28.879 --> 45:31.471
That's also not that great in the hands...

1382
45:31.471 --> 45:33.255
In every set of hands.

1383
45:33.255 --> 45:35.669
So, I think there's safety issues on both sides

1384
45:35.669 --> 45:37.803
that are much bigger than the privacy issues,

1385
45:37.803 --> 45:41.743
which I think some common sense will sort out.

1386
45:41.743 --> 45:43.282
<v ->I'd like to end it there</v>

1387
45:43.282 --> 45:46.064
because we're over time,

1388
45:46.064 --> 45:47.981
and Sanjiv needs water.

1389
45:48.961 --> 45:50.063
But, we're gonna be sticking around,

1390
45:50.063 --> 45:51.008
if anybody has any questions,

1391
45:51.008 --> 45:51.841
wanna come up

1392
45:51.841 --> 45:52.737
and see us?

1393
45:52.737 --> 45:54.245
Please look up all of our companies,

1394
45:54.245 --> 45:55.300
"carnegierobotics.com',

1395
45:55.300 --> 45:56.194
"Near Earth Autonomy",

1396
45:56.194 --> 45:57.967
"Aquatonomy", "Divergent",

1397
45:57.967 --> 45:59.202
"KEF Robotics".

1398
45:59.202 --> 46:02.223
I'd be remise in not closing remark saying,

1399
46:02.223 --> 46:03.585
thank you, special thanks

1400
46:03.585 --> 46:06.820
to the Pittsburgh Technology Council,

1401
46:06.820 --> 46:08.257
and the Allegheny Conference

1402
46:08.257 --> 46:11.152
who are our two flagship entities,

1403
46:11.152 --> 46:13.183
and Pittsburgh who helped put this together,

1404
46:13.183 --> 46:15.125
we rely upon them for everything.

1405
46:15.125 --> 46:16.351
So, Pittsburgh Technology,

1406
46:16.351 --> 46:17.301
"pittsburghtech.org"

1407
46:17.301 --> 46:18.789
and Allegheny Conference

1408
46:18.789 --> 46:21.269
on community development.

1409
46:21.269 --> 46:22.255
Also, two things.

1410
46:22.255 --> 46:24.261
One, I gotta mention the

1411
46:24.261 --> 46:26.933
Brunswick Corporation booth,

1412
46:26.933 --> 46:28.405
because that's who are our partner is,

1413
46:28.405 --> 46:29.719
we developed the autonomy

1414
46:29.719 --> 46:32.159
for the large Boston Whaler that you'll see

1415
46:32.159 --> 46:32.992
right downstairs,

1416
46:32.992 --> 46:34.613
West Hall 6116.

1417
46:34.613 --> 46:36.907
And finally-finally,

1418
46:36.907 --> 46:39.643
all of this works because of collaboration

1419
46:39.643 --> 46:41.071
and partnership,

1420
46:41.071 --> 46:43.088
Pittsburgh is known as the robotics capital,

1421
46:43.088 --> 46:43.982
if you haven't been there,

1422
46:43.982 --> 46:46.163
please come, because it is a special place,

1423
46:46.163 --> 46:47.618
it's magnetic, it's electric,

1424
46:47.618 --> 46:50.385
everybody wants to be a part of it, right?

1425
46:50.385 --> 46:51.218
We have a friend

1426
46:51.218 --> 46:52.245
and a colleague who's sitting out here,

1427
46:52.245 --> 46:55.656
Dr. Amanda Scrowe from NAYA Systems,

1428
46:55.656 --> 46:57.382
NAYA's a competitor of ours, right?

1429
46:57.382 --> 46:58.946
It's probably the only two competitors in town,

1430
46:58.946 --> 47:00.125
but guess what?

1431
47:00.125 --> 47:01.211
We're friends,

1432
47:01.211 --> 47:03.375
and we are invested in each other's success,

1433
47:03.375 --> 47:04.693
so next year we'll have Amanda

1434
47:04.693 --> 47:05.797
sitting up here with us,

1435
47:05.797 --> 47:07.808
wherever you are Amanda.

1436
47:07.808 --> 47:09.285
And, all of these companies here

1437
47:09.285 --> 47:10.118
work together,

1438
47:10.118 --> 47:11.568
you've heard of Aurora,

1439
47:11.568 --> 47:13.434
the self-driving truck?

1440
47:13.434 --> 47:14.546
They are a partner of ours,

1441
47:14.546 --> 47:16.224
they were in our high bay you know,

1442
47:16.224 --> 47:17.600
using our water jet last week,

1443
47:17.600 --> 47:18.605
10-people, 12-people,

1444
47:18.605 --> 47:21.275
my facilities people brought them lunch, right?

1445
47:21.275 --> 47:23.120
This is who Pittsburgh is,

1446
47:23.120 --> 47:24.363
this is who we are,

1447
47:24.363 --> 47:25.856
we are not siloed,

1448
47:25.856 --> 47:27.898
and that's what makes us different,

1449
47:27.898 --> 47:28.731
and special.

1450
47:28.731 --> 47:30.302
Thank you, enjoy the rest of your conference.

1451
47:30.302 --> 47:31.689
(audience applauding)

1452
47:31.689 --> 47:34.106
(calm music)
