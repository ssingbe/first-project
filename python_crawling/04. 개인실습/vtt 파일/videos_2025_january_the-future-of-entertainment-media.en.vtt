00:00.000 --> 00:03.733
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:10.366 --> 00:12.733
- Hello, hello, hello.

00:12.733 --> 00:15.833
Welcome back to the AI House.

00:15.833 --> 00:17.733
I would like to encourage everybody,

00:17.733 --> 00:22.233
if you're coming in the
house, come on in the house.

00:22.233 --> 00:24.666
There are plenty of seats in the middle.

00:24.666 --> 00:27.433
I wanna encourage you
to find seats closer,

00:27.433 --> 00:29.733
if that is your thing.

00:29.733 --> 00:32.433
But you know how in the middle of the day,

00:32.433 --> 00:36.633
sometimes the energy
wanes just a little bit.

00:36.633 --> 00:38.166
You all know that?

00:38.166 --> 00:39.633
Well, not in this house.

00:39.633 --> 00:41.266
The energy is high,

00:41.266 --> 00:43.333
we're going to keep the energy high,

00:43.333 --> 00:47.733
and our next panel is sure to be amazing.

00:47.733 --> 00:50.966
And so I have another question for you.

00:50.966 --> 00:54.133
Lately, in this age of AI,

00:54.133 --> 00:58.966
where everybody is all
of a sudden an AI expert.

01:00.299 --> 01:03.566
It grinds my gears

01:03.566 --> 01:06.666
when I see, let's say, supermodels,

01:06.666 --> 01:09.766
who all of a sudden are now AI experts.

01:09.766 --> 01:12.866
Have you all seen something
similar out in the landscape?

01:12.866 --> 01:14.466
I see heads nodding yes.

01:14.466 --> 01:16.233
Well, guess what?

01:16.233 --> 01:19.633
Supermodels should not be AI experts.

01:19.633 --> 01:24.633
But what if your AI expert
looked like a supermodel?

01:25.833 --> 01:27.633
Would that make a difference?

01:27.633 --> 01:28.799
Well, guess what?

01:28.799 --> 01:32.433
We're gonna introduce
the supermodel of AI.

01:32.433 --> 01:34.266
Let me tell you a little bit about her,

01:34.266 --> 01:36.433
because she's moderating our next panel.

01:37.633 --> 01:40.833
Tiarne Hawkins, do you see
this beautiful specimen?

01:40.833 --> 01:44.466
She is the founder of You &amp; AI.

01:44.466 --> 01:47.533
15 years in digital transformation,

01:47.533 --> 01:50.133
seven years focused on AI,

01:50.133 --> 01:53.633
supporting AI innovation
with global tech leaders

01:53.633 --> 01:58.033
like Amazon, Google, Meta, OpenAI,

01:58.966 --> 02:02.133
and top enterprises all around the globe,

02:02.133 --> 02:04.599
specializing in AI enablement,

02:04.599 --> 02:08.433
and optimizing training data pipelines

02:08.433 --> 02:10.866
for well-known AI applications.

02:10.866 --> 02:13.833
Tiarne is also a passionate advocate

02:13.833 --> 02:17.499
for AI's responsible,
let me say that again,

02:17.499 --> 02:19.499
responsible use,

02:19.499 --> 02:23.099
focusing on AI for good, AI safety,

02:23.099 --> 02:26.799
and its positive societal impact.

02:27.899 --> 02:31.433
It's just you, Tiarne and AI.

02:31.433 --> 02:32.733
Let's go.

02:40.899 --> 02:42.166
- A little hard to live down.

02:42.166 --> 02:44.499
Hi everyone, my name's Tiarne Hawkins,

02:44.499 --> 02:48.233
and I am your host and
moderator of today's epic panel.

02:48.233 --> 02:49.466
We're gonna be discussing

02:49.466 --> 02:52.999
how artificial intelligence
is reshaping entertainment,

02:52.999 --> 02:55.499
but with that, don't
just take my word for it.

02:55.499 --> 02:57.599
I want to introduce our panel,

02:57.599 --> 02:59.999
with Brooke Siegel from Yahoo,

02:59.999 --> 03:02.333
please come up to the stage.

03:02.333 --> 03:05.833
Steven Keller from SiriusXM Media,

03:05.833 --> 03:06.833
H.B. Siegel,

03:06.833 --> 03:10.166
who's been Amazon, Pixar,
Waterfront, Silicon Graphics,

03:10.166 --> 03:14.099
and of course, Eric Pace,
from Cox Communications.

03:14.099 --> 03:17.999
(audience claps and cheers)

03:19.299 --> 03:22.033
So, let's begin, huh?

03:22.033 --> 03:25.566
We only have 37 minutes
left to go, (laughs)

03:25.566 --> 03:26.899
'cause of that wild introduction.

03:26.899 --> 03:27.733
Thank you, my love.

03:27.733 --> 03:29.599
Would each of you introduce yourselves,

03:29.599 --> 03:31.433
your experience in the AI space,

03:31.433 --> 03:33.366
and just a brief overview of who you are

03:33.366 --> 03:34.766
and what you're doing today?

03:36.633 --> 03:37.899
- I'll kick it off.

03:37.899 --> 03:39.466
Hi, I'm Brooke Siegel.

03:39.466 --> 03:42.566
I am the VP of content at Yahoo News.

03:42.566 --> 03:46.133
In that role, I oversee
the curation of our content

03:46.133 --> 03:48.733
from our vast network of publishers,

03:48.733 --> 03:50.466
our original content team,

03:50.466 --> 03:53.733
which creates editorial
across all platforms

03:53.733 --> 03:54.999
and our commerce team.

03:56.066 --> 03:58.333
Previously I was at
Hearst Magazines media,

03:58.333 --> 04:01.333
helping with the transformation
from print to digital.

04:01.333 --> 04:03.633
And, did you ask my interest in AI?

04:03.633 --> 04:07.299
- Yeah, let's go for it all.
- So I mean, I don't know,

04:07.299 --> 04:10.066
I think I am deeply
interested and obsessed,

04:10.066 --> 04:12.633
but also it is foisted upon me in not...

04:12.633 --> 04:15.766
I've always worked at the
intersection of content

04:15.766 --> 04:17.099
and how it's consumed.

04:17.099 --> 04:21.399
AI is going to be very much
a part of that in the future,

04:21.399 --> 04:23.733
and I want to embrace it.

04:23.733 --> 04:25.999
It's part of the reason
I wanted to join Yahoo

04:25.999 --> 04:30.433
because of the incredible
opportunity to utilize technology

04:30.433 --> 04:33.799
and media that not all
publishers have access to.

04:33.799 --> 04:34.799
- Love it. Steve?

04:35.699 --> 04:36.933
- I'm Steve Keller.

04:36.933 --> 04:40.566
I'm the Sonic Strategy
Director at Studio Resonate.

04:40.566 --> 04:44.899
Studio Resonate is an in-house,
audio first creative agency

04:44.899 --> 04:47.333
under the SiriusXM umbrella.

04:47.333 --> 04:50.033
So I work with brands that advertise

04:50.033 --> 04:52.099
on all of our platforms.

04:52.099 --> 04:54.566
When I tell people my title,
Sonic Strategy Director,

04:54.566 --> 04:56.066
usually two things happen.

04:56.066 --> 04:59.399
The first is, "It's a pretty
cool title," which it is,

04:59.399 --> 05:00.699
but then the next thing I hear is,

05:00.699 --> 05:02.933
"But what the hell do you do?"

05:02.933 --> 05:04.633
And so the easiest way I've come up

05:04.633 --> 05:06.299
with describing my job is to say,

05:06.299 --> 05:08.999
"I'm in the business of
taking sound science,

05:08.999 --> 05:10.833
blending it with sound art,

05:10.833 --> 05:15.333
to help our partners and
clients make sound decisions."

05:15.333 --> 05:17.199
So on the AI front,

05:18.033 --> 05:21.133
I'm definitely interested
in the application,

05:21.133 --> 05:23.066
a little less on the operational side,

05:23.066 --> 05:25.899
and more on how we might incorporate it

05:25.899 --> 05:27.866
into creative workflows.

05:27.866 --> 05:31.233
But given my background and
my training in psychology

05:31.233 --> 05:32.833
and the behavioral sciences,

05:32.833 --> 05:37.132
I'm even more concerned with
the implications of using AI

05:37.132 --> 05:42.132
and the impact on culture,
diversity, community.

05:42.699 --> 05:45.466
And so this is a fascinating time

05:45.466 --> 05:50.466
to be part of such quick
changes in the world.

05:50.732 --> 05:55.166
And I'm learning as I go,
as most of us are, I think.

05:55.166 --> 05:57.066
- [Tiarne] Yeah, like we all are. H.B.

05:57.066 --> 06:00.266
- Hi everybody, thank you for hosting us.

06:00.266 --> 06:02.132
My name is H.B. Siegel.

06:02.132 --> 06:04.732
I started on the very early days at Pixar

06:04.732 --> 06:06.199
when it was first formed,

06:06.199 --> 06:09.132
and I had a chance to work
at some notable companies

06:09.132 --> 06:10.932
and Wavefront,

06:10.932 --> 06:13.632
which developed an animation
system called Maya,

06:13.632 --> 06:15.032
which I was at the beginning of.

06:15.032 --> 06:17.199
And then Industrial Light &amp; Magic

06:17.199 --> 06:18.632
as Chief Technology Officer,

06:18.632 --> 06:21.399
where I got to work on
"Star Wars," "Men in Black,"

06:21.399 --> 06:23.432
"Jurassic Park," "Schindler's List,"

06:23.432 --> 06:26.199
and some less notable films.

06:26.199 --> 06:27.799
Most recently, I was at Amazon,

06:27.799 --> 06:30.799
where I ran a group called
the Department of Ideas,

06:30.799 --> 06:34.466
and we actually developed
crazy new innovative ideas

06:34.466 --> 06:35.866
and shared them,

06:35.866 --> 06:39.632
and hopefully some of them,
you know, became big things

06:39.632 --> 06:41.999
that will be exposed in years to come.

06:41.999 --> 06:45.432
And as far as my current interest in AI,

06:45.432 --> 06:49.532
I'm really fascinated by its
intersection with storytelling

06:49.532 --> 06:52.299
and ideation and creativity

06:52.299 --> 06:55.299
in what roles it can play
as a partner to humans,

06:55.299 --> 06:56.432
and hopefully that's some of the things

06:56.432 --> 06:58.666
we'll talk about.
- Great. Eric?

06:58.666 --> 07:00.699
- Hey, everybody. My name's Eric Pace.

07:00.699 --> 07:03.132
I am working at Cox Communications today,

07:03.132 --> 07:05.432
and I am the head of AI there.

07:05.432 --> 07:07.532
I spent many years in
Big Five, consulting,

07:07.532 --> 07:09.466
prior to joining Cox Communications,

07:09.466 --> 07:11.599
and then made the shift into industry

07:11.599 --> 07:12.999
where I really had the chance

07:12.999 --> 07:14.999
to get to own a lot of the ideas

07:14.999 --> 07:16.932
and things that we were putting together.

07:16.932 --> 07:18.732
And then about 60 days ago,

07:18.732 --> 07:21.699
the company decided that we
were gonna put a lot more focus

07:21.699 --> 07:22.532
in the AI space,

07:22.532 --> 07:24.399
and we created a dedicated organization

07:24.399 --> 07:29.132
to the spectrum of governance
to implementation for AI.

07:29.132 --> 07:31.066
And in the career, you
know, through consulting

07:31.066 --> 07:33.632
and a lot of the work that
we've done at Cox today,

07:33.632 --> 07:34.932
there's nothing more disruptive

07:34.932 --> 07:36.732
than what AI is doing right now,

07:36.732 --> 07:38.432
and I have spent my career

07:38.432 --> 07:40.632
infatuated with the disruptive nature

07:40.632 --> 07:42.632
of whatever we can get our hands on.

07:42.632 --> 07:44.732
And now I feel like I'm
in the greatest playground

07:44.732 --> 07:46.999
of all time.
- Yeah, absolutely.

07:46.999 --> 07:49.232
So all of the audience
needs to participate

07:49.232 --> 07:50.066
in this next.

07:50.066 --> 07:52.499
Yeah, I'm also gonna ask you
some difficult questions.

07:52.499 --> 07:55.532
I asked ChatGPT to form the best question

07:55.532 --> 07:59.966
to ask you all, which AI
experience you would prefer?

07:59.966 --> 08:01.932
Imagine this, it's Sunday afternoon,

08:01.932 --> 08:04.832
you are sitting down to
watch a movie or play a game,

08:04.832 --> 08:06.666
which would you prefer?

08:06.666 --> 08:08.966
An AI generated movie plot

08:08.966 --> 08:12.166
that adapts in real time
based on your preferences?

08:12.166 --> 08:15.332
A personalized character, again,

08:15.332 --> 08:18.332
that has the ability to
bond with you uniquely.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.266
An AI driven soundtrack

08:20.266 --> 08:22.532
that has the ability to change sound

08:22.532 --> 08:24.999
based on your mood or your preferences.

08:24.999 --> 08:27.266
Or lastly, a fully interactive movie

08:27.266 --> 08:29.666
where you can pick the story narrative.

08:29.666 --> 08:31.832
A show of hands, who would prefer

08:31.832 --> 08:34.766
an AI generated movie plot?

08:34.766 --> 08:36.699
Any hands? One person.

08:36.699 --> 08:38.466
Okay, two. All right.

08:38.466 --> 08:41.732
What about personalized characters?

08:41.732 --> 08:43.232
Okay. Wow.

08:43.232 --> 08:44.666
Didn't expect that.

08:44.666 --> 08:47.666
AI soundtrack, personalized music.

08:47.666 --> 08:49.566
Woo! All right.

08:49.566 --> 08:51.866
And what about a fully interactive movie

08:51.866 --> 08:54.066
where the film adjusts along the way?

08:54.966 --> 08:56.666
Oh, two. Double hand.

08:56.666 --> 08:58.799
Okay, girl! I see you.

08:58.799 --> 09:01.599
Okay, so enough about that.

09:01.599 --> 09:04.166
Thanks for participating,
I really appreciate it.

09:04.166 --> 09:06.166
I wanna get into our first question

09:06.166 --> 09:08.732
from each of your point of view,

09:08.732 --> 09:12.632
how do you see AI changing the
shape of media, entertainment

09:12.632 --> 09:15.666
and news for consumption
for consumers today?

09:18.332 --> 09:19.832
- Yeah, I don't mind starting,

09:19.832 --> 09:22.566
given that, you know,
the role that we play

09:22.566 --> 09:24.199
at Cox Communications, I think,

09:24.199 --> 09:27.099
is foundational and spectacular,

09:27.099 --> 09:29.566
primarily because we're the
service provider network

09:29.566 --> 09:32.999
that allows content providers,
creators, et cetera,

09:32.999 --> 09:35.299
to get their services, their creations,

09:35.299 --> 09:37.232
into the hands of our customers.

09:37.232 --> 09:38.299
And so we have spent,

09:38.299 --> 09:40.599
the last couple of years in particular,

09:40.599 --> 09:43.166
once we saw the surge of
internet usage really,

09:43.166 --> 09:45.299
and the consumption rise during COVID,

09:45.299 --> 09:47.199
we spent the last couple of years

09:47.199 --> 09:49.499
really infusing a lot of AI capabilities

09:49.499 --> 09:52.166
into the network that we put in place

09:52.166 --> 09:54.766
so that our customers can
experience all of the things

09:54.766 --> 09:57.599
that media and entertainment
ultimately delivers.

09:57.599 --> 09:59.466
And I think about that in three ways.

09:59.466 --> 10:00.532
There's the core network

10:00.532 --> 10:02.732
that ultimately delivers our services,

10:02.732 --> 10:05.599
that has to have a ton of
intelligence built into it

10:05.599 --> 10:08.266
just relative to the amount
of data that we process,

10:08.266 --> 10:09.832
and how much we have to ensure

10:09.832 --> 10:11.399
that the reliability of that network

10:11.399 --> 10:13.399
is at a level in which you can experience

10:13.399 --> 10:15.266
seamless entertainment.

10:15.266 --> 10:17.232
And then all the way into
the second part of it,

10:17.232 --> 10:18.466
which is in your home.

10:18.466 --> 10:20.532
Because once our network hits your house,

10:20.532 --> 10:22.866
then we don't have full control,

10:22.866 --> 10:24.232
but we have to be responsible

10:24.232 --> 10:26.266
for how the performance of the network

10:26.266 --> 10:28.732
or our internet in the home works as well.

10:28.732 --> 10:30.699
And the data that we can
get off of the devices

10:30.699 --> 10:34.666
just relative to performance
and signal strength

10:34.666 --> 10:38.166
also will benefit greatly
from AI's introduction

10:39.099 --> 10:42.132
with our ability to process
a magnificent amount of data.

10:42.132 --> 10:44.432
And then I'd say lastly,

10:44.432 --> 10:46.632
in terms of the actual customer experience

10:46.632 --> 10:48.332
and looking at customer preferences

10:48.332 --> 10:51.432
and thinking about a
customer lifecycle in which,

10:51.432 --> 10:54.199
from, you know, prospecting
in a learn phase,

10:54.199 --> 10:56.432
all the way through pay and serve.

10:56.432 --> 10:59.699
Our job really is to go
find all of the places

10:59.699 --> 11:02.732
in the customer lifecycle
that we can apply AI

11:02.732 --> 11:04.899
to expedite the customer's experience,

11:04.899 --> 11:07.365
back to the point that they
want to spend their time in,

11:07.365 --> 11:10.499
which is using or interacting
with the actual content.

11:10.499 --> 11:12.999
So there's a whole host
of opportunity out there

11:12.999 --> 11:14.899
relative to where we can put AI.

11:14.899 --> 11:18.132
And again, going back to the
excitement, waking up every day

11:18.132 --> 11:21.032
and having to choose where
we're gonna spend our time,

11:21.032 --> 11:24.365
given its endless at the
moment, is super exciting.

11:25.399 --> 11:27.932
- Yeah, kind of riff on that a little bit,

11:27.932 --> 11:29.965
actually, just a call back
to your initial question.

11:29.965 --> 11:33.032
- Yeah.
- I don't think I want the AIs

11:33.032 --> 11:35.699
to adjust their stories
to me in real time.

11:35.699 --> 11:39.765
I want to see bold,
interesting, unexpected stories

11:40.865 --> 11:42.232
that surprise me.

11:42.232 --> 11:44.065
And that's why I'm such a fan

11:44.065 --> 11:45.699
of the South Korean movie industry

11:45.699 --> 11:47.532
because they just don't care.

11:48.432 --> 11:50.432
They will take that story anywhere.

11:50.432 --> 11:51.732
They'll kill off the characters

11:51.732 --> 11:53.565
and the main character in the first scene,

11:53.565 --> 11:55.032
if that's what they need to do.

11:55.032 --> 11:58.432
And, you know, I would like our industry,

11:58.432 --> 12:00.932
our Hollywood industry, to
accept some of that boldness

12:00.932 --> 12:04.099
and maybe AI can help bring that to us.

12:04.099 --> 12:07.365
Regarding what you just posed to us,

12:07.365 --> 12:09.465
I think back to early days

12:09.465 --> 12:12.399
and watching John Lasseter
interview people at Pixar

12:12.399 --> 12:14.399
to become animators,

12:14.399 --> 12:18.165
and people would submit
portfolios and ideas,

12:18.165 --> 12:19.532
talking, "I know how to use this tool,

12:19.532 --> 12:20.899
I know how to use this tool."

12:20.899 --> 12:24.132
And he would say like,
"You can submit a portfolio

12:24.132 --> 12:26.599
with chalk and line drawings and pen,

12:26.599 --> 12:28.332
and we don't care about
what tools you can use

12:28.332 --> 12:30.999
because we can't teach
you to be an artist,

12:30.999 --> 12:32.932
but we can teach you
how to use the tools."

12:32.932 --> 12:35.899
And so I see people even
today applying for jobs,

12:35.899 --> 12:39.165
filling their portfolio with
a list of names of tools,

12:39.165 --> 12:40.599
and that's really not the way to go.

12:40.599 --> 12:42.399
You have to convince them you actually

12:42.399 --> 12:46.232
have a interior art skill
and have that skill.

12:46.232 --> 12:49.565
So when I think about that, I want...

12:50.499 --> 12:53.799
I think these tools are
gonna be enormously enabling

12:53.799 --> 12:56.565
for people to make a
variety of very beautiful,

12:56.565 --> 12:59.199
very mediocre assets,

12:59.199 --> 13:01.165
and there's gonna be a lot of them.

13:01.165 --> 13:03.865
So we're gonna be swimming
in this sea of candy

13:03.865 --> 13:08.299
of not very nutritious
content for a while.

13:08.299 --> 13:09.399
And maybe the AI will be helpful

13:09.399 --> 13:11.265
in even sorting that out as well.

13:11.265 --> 13:13.499
- Yeah, I like that. Steve?
- Just to-

13:13.499 --> 13:14.465
- Yeah, please.
- Build on that,

13:14.465 --> 13:16.499
I think that's why at Yahoo News,

13:16.499 --> 13:18.732
it's so important that it's AI

13:18.732 --> 13:22.665
and editors working together
to find that balance,

13:22.665 --> 13:25.899
to make sure that the content
is exceptional as it can be,

13:25.899 --> 13:27.999
and I think that partnership,

13:27.999 --> 13:30.332
that is going to enable us

13:30.332 --> 13:33.565
to really personalize the content

13:33.565 --> 13:35.432
in a way that's not just, you know,

13:35.432 --> 13:37.065
you talk about the empty...

13:37.065 --> 13:38.465
I don't know if you
called it empty calories,

13:38.465 --> 13:39.599
I'm gonna call it empty calories,

13:39.599 --> 13:41.499
or like the candy that you could feed

13:41.499 --> 13:43.532
and you do, you wanna give
the people what they want,

13:43.532 --> 13:45.899
but sometimes that is
gonna be empty calories.

13:45.899 --> 13:47.465
And you need to balance that,

13:47.465 --> 13:50.265
that need to know and what to know, right?

13:50.265 --> 13:52.532
Like what you wanna know
might be the empty calories,

13:52.532 --> 13:54.799
but then you have the
editorial perspective

13:54.799 --> 13:56.332
layered on top of that,

13:56.332 --> 13:58.832
that is gonna give you
what's happening in the world

13:58.832 --> 13:59.665
and what's important.

13:59.665 --> 14:01.165
And you really need the balance

14:01.165 --> 14:02.699
and the marriage of those two.

14:04.499 --> 14:06.599
- When I think in my world, in audio,

14:06.599 --> 14:09.665
I mean AI has been a
part of it for a while.

14:09.665 --> 14:12.065
If you think of the
digital streaming services

14:12.065 --> 14:15.332
that use AI as part of playlists,

14:15.332 --> 14:17.599
Pandora was one of the first ones

14:17.599 --> 14:20.299
with the music genome to use that.

14:20.299 --> 14:22.399
But as we get into generative AI

14:22.399 --> 14:24.332
and even more personalization,

14:24.332 --> 14:26.865
I do think that's a
double-edged sword too.

14:26.865 --> 14:30.465
To your point, if the
AI is always feeding us

14:30.465 --> 14:32.432
things that we like,

14:32.432 --> 14:36.532
how do we discover anything really new.

14:36.532 --> 14:39.765
In the news, more and more
we're having AI voices

14:39.765 --> 14:41.099
that are reading the news,

14:41.099 --> 14:42.999
and studies that are now showing

14:42.999 --> 14:45.599
that you're more cognitively engaged

14:45.599 --> 14:47.665
with a human voice with news,

14:47.665 --> 14:48.932
than an AI voice.
- Okay.

14:48.932 --> 14:52.865
- Which means more
disinformation can happen

14:52.865 --> 14:54.932
when you're not as engaged.

14:54.932 --> 14:57.932
But the last place for me
that's more interesting,

14:57.932 --> 15:01.999
is how AI can help us use sound

15:01.999 --> 15:05.965
in ways that really benefit our lives

15:05.965 --> 15:08.932
in health and wellness technologies

15:08.932 --> 15:13.199
that doctors can use to
prescribe a playlist,

15:13.199 --> 15:16.332
as opposed to just prescribing pharma,

15:16.332 --> 15:19.932
and ways that AI can kind of tailor sounds

15:19.932 --> 15:23.799
depending on moods that can
be really beneficial that way.

15:23.799 --> 15:26.565
So I think those are
fascinating developments

15:26.565 --> 15:29.332
that we're just starting to touch.

15:29.332 --> 15:32.332
- You know, sorry, in
this space in particular,

15:32.332 --> 15:34.899
you can't help but think
that in today's world

15:34.899 --> 15:36.332
we treat hallucination

15:36.332 --> 15:38.432
with the models as a four letter word,

15:38.432 --> 15:40.099
but when it comes to entertainment,

15:40.099 --> 15:42.865
hallucination can become
unexpected creativity,

15:42.865 --> 15:45.799
that produces things we never expected,

15:45.799 --> 15:47.932
and it becomes less
than a four letter word

15:47.932 --> 15:49.999
and more of a, you know,
a true creative partner

15:49.999 --> 15:51.232
that you never thought you had.

15:51.232 --> 15:53.432
- A lot of music was
composed with hallucination.

15:53.432 --> 15:57.065
So maybe it's just a
little more LSD in our AI

15:57.065 --> 15:58.299
and, you know, maybe it's a good thing.

15:58.299 --> 16:02.099
- Yeah, I did a report on audio illusions.

16:02.099 --> 16:02.999
It's a very interesting thing,

16:02.999 --> 16:05.065
but I'm actually really
hung up on the idea

16:05.065 --> 16:07.065
that the doctor might prescribe you

16:07.065 --> 16:09.465
10 minutes of Nicki Minaj "Super Bass"

16:09.465 --> 16:10.832
every morning or something.

16:10.832 --> 16:13.632
Is that prescribed music? Yeah, so.

16:13.632 --> 16:17.699
- Okay, so not that we wanna
start talking about LSD

16:17.699 --> 16:19.065
and music hallucinations,

16:19.065 --> 16:21.665
though that could be a really
entertaining company idea

16:21.665 --> 16:23.832
around a musical hallucination company.

16:23.832 --> 16:25.132
Choose your own adventure.

16:26.699 --> 16:30.199
Steven, you kind of touched
on this a little bit earlier,

16:30.199 --> 16:32.132
and so I'm gonna skip the
first part of your question.

16:32.132 --> 16:34.299
I'm gonna go straight to,
is there a potential for AI

16:34.299 --> 16:37.965
to create entirely new audio
experiences for listeners?

16:37.965 --> 16:39.565
If so, what does that look like?

16:40.465 --> 16:44.132
- Yeah, I think, you know, as humans,

16:44.132 --> 16:46.265
sometimes we're not aware of the impact

16:46.265 --> 16:48.798
that sound has on our perception.

16:48.798 --> 16:50.665
And so one area of research

16:50.665 --> 16:52.065
that I've been involved a lot

16:52.065 --> 16:54.965
is this idea of cross modal science,

16:54.965 --> 16:56.898
where our senses can be combined

16:56.898 --> 16:59.632
and one sense can hack another,
playing with things like,

16:59.632 --> 17:01.565
can I change your perception of how bitter

17:01.565 --> 17:03.765
or sweet a piece of chocolate tastes

17:03.765 --> 17:06.232
depending on what we're
putting in your ears.

17:06.232 --> 17:08.732
And so thinking about a connected home

17:08.732 --> 17:13.732
where AI may be able to adjust to volume,

17:14.298 --> 17:18.132
to mood, things where it could be designed

17:18.132 --> 17:22.665
to know who's at home, what's
appropriate content to hear,

17:24.632 --> 17:26.365
there's all kinds of fascinating ways,

17:26.365 --> 17:30.632
I think that in terms of
our consumption habits,

17:30.632 --> 17:33.198
AI can feed into it.

17:34.132 --> 17:36.032
Again, that's a two-edged sword,

17:36.032 --> 17:38.498
'cause I could also
argue on the other side

17:38.498 --> 17:41.098
that maybe that personalization

17:41.098 --> 17:44.398
and that kind of playing with our biases

17:44.398 --> 17:47.398
to move us in a particular direction

17:47.398 --> 17:50.198
could be used for for evil, so.

17:50.198 --> 17:52.232
- Can AI be used to change my lettuce

17:52.232 --> 17:54.798
to taste like chocolate? (laughs)

17:54.798 --> 17:56.065
- No.
- Please? Ah, okay.

17:56.065 --> 17:57.032
Damn it.

17:57.032 --> 18:01.198
Brooke, Yahoo News is known
for delivering timely,

18:01.198 --> 18:02.465
accurate news.

18:03.765 --> 18:07.132
How is AI changing the
way news is curated,

18:07.132 --> 18:08.932
reported and consumed?

18:10.365 --> 18:11.832
- I mean, it's such a big question.

18:11.832 --> 18:13.898
I feel like I could spend
the next 20 minutes on it,

18:13.898 --> 18:15.165
but I will keep it brief.

18:16.365 --> 18:19.432
One of the ways, and it's not
necessarily the most sexy,

18:19.432 --> 18:21.932
that I am really embracing AI,

18:21.932 --> 18:25.065
is using it to free up editors

18:25.065 --> 18:28.965
to work on more impactful,
creative content.

18:28.965 --> 18:31.498
So things like, that we
don't wanna think about,

18:31.498 --> 18:35.165
metadata and tagging, like
things that can be taken over

18:35.165 --> 18:36.298
and off their plate,

18:36.298 --> 18:38.765
so that they can be creating
more engaging content.

18:38.765 --> 18:40.998
So that's very exciting for me.

18:40.998 --> 18:42.365
I think also, you know,

18:42.365 --> 18:44.965
we have such a vast sea of publishers,

18:44.965 --> 18:47.132
we're talking about like

18:47.132 --> 18:49.365
where the line of personalization is.

18:49.365 --> 18:51.632
I think it gives us the opportunity

18:51.632 --> 18:55.732
to surface more diverse
publishers from our ecosystem

18:55.732 --> 19:00.032
so that we're giving
visibility to publishers

19:00.032 --> 19:02.198
that they might not have gotten otherwise.

19:03.465 --> 19:04.298
Another piece that I'm really...

19:04.298 --> 19:05.132
I mean, like I said,

19:05.132 --> 19:07.232
I could keep going on, but
that I'm really excited about

19:07.232 --> 19:09.632
is just, you know, our key takeaways

19:09.632 --> 19:10.698
that are on top of articles

19:10.698 --> 19:15.032
where you could generate
an AI summary of the story.

19:15.032 --> 19:16.665
What makes that distinct on Yahoo

19:16.665 --> 19:19.265
is that the content in that takeaway

19:19.265 --> 19:21.798
only comes from the article itself.

19:21.798 --> 19:22.998
It is a feature

19:22.998 --> 19:24.665
that was rigorously tested,

19:24.665 --> 19:27.165
the same way we rigorously
vet our publishers

19:27.165 --> 19:29.665
so that we could be
assured it has journalism

19:29.665 --> 19:31.598
that we all feel good
about and are proud of.

19:31.598 --> 19:34.532
And what has been surprising,
it's been not surprising,

19:34.532 --> 19:36.832
but exciting, a win-win-win for us,

19:36.832 --> 19:38.632
for the publishers and for the reader.

19:38.632 --> 19:40.532
People that read those summaries

19:40.532 --> 19:43.232
tend to spend more time on the article

19:43.232 --> 19:45.032
and they read deeper and engage more.

19:45.032 --> 19:48.298
So I just, I feel like the
opportunities are endless

19:48.298 --> 19:51.398
and we're excited to
continue to watch it evolve.

19:51.398 --> 19:53.832
- Wow, super exciting. Thank you.

19:53.832 --> 19:56.865
Eric, Cox Communications delivers content

19:56.865 --> 19:59.898
and services to millions of users.

19:59.898 --> 20:03.165
How are you seeing AI change your industry

20:03.165 --> 20:05.165
and what does it mean to your customers?

20:05.165 --> 20:07.832
- Yeah, I mean, I think there's
probably not a lot of...

20:07.832 --> 20:09.832
I think there's a lot
of use of AI even today

20:09.832 --> 20:11.732
that people don't realize is AI, right?

20:11.732 --> 20:14.032
And so, you know, today
in all of our homes,

20:14.032 --> 20:15.765
our customers are using voice remotes

20:15.765 --> 20:17.432
to access the content that they want.

20:17.432 --> 20:19.198
In a lot of ways, our products

20:19.198 --> 20:22.065
and services are the gateway
to the content that, you know,

20:22.065 --> 20:25.732
our customers are looking to
consume, that you guys provide.

20:25.732 --> 20:26.932
And I even think about

20:26.932 --> 20:27.932
where we're going in the future

20:27.932 --> 20:30.465
relative to what we're gonna
have to start looking after,

20:30.465 --> 20:32.132
like Steve was just talking about,

20:32.132 --> 20:34.632
a smart home that has become even smarter

20:34.632 --> 20:36.865
than what you think of it today,

20:36.865 --> 20:38.832
but the importance of
a lot of what you see

20:38.832 --> 20:40.965
around the floor even today at CES,

20:40.965 --> 20:43.532
around, you know, why
models are getting smaller

20:43.532 --> 20:44.865
and why they're, you know, coming up

20:44.865 --> 20:46.565
with things like on-device AI.

20:46.565 --> 20:49.465
Well, in those scenarios, you
want your home to be smart.

20:49.465 --> 20:51.965
You want those models to run
locally on those devices,

20:51.965 --> 20:53.765
because you don't want the
data that it's collecting

20:53.765 --> 20:55.965
and using sent somewhere else.

20:55.965 --> 20:57.898
And so, you know, there's a lot

20:57.898 --> 20:59.165
that I think is coming in the future

20:59.165 --> 21:02.165
relative to how you interact
with our devices today, right?

21:02.165 --> 21:05.065
Today I use my remote
to do a voice search,

21:05.065 --> 21:06.932
but it's very keyword based, right?

21:06.932 --> 21:08.798
In the future, it'll
be very semantic based,

21:08.798 --> 21:12.232
and when you pair that with
some of the personalization

21:12.232 --> 21:15.532
that comes in the future,
you'll be able to ask it for,

21:15.532 --> 21:17.098
you know, horror movies
that are appropriate

21:17.098 --> 21:18.732
for your 16-year-old,

21:18.732 --> 21:20.632
that maybe don't have a lot of, you know,

21:20.632 --> 21:22.232
certain types of scenes
in them, et cetera.

21:22.232 --> 21:25.532
And then if we get to a point
where the content itself

21:25.532 --> 21:26.765
is tailored personally, maybe, you know,

21:26.765 --> 21:28.798
you can tell it to avoid
showing me the things

21:28.798 --> 21:30.332
that I don't wanna see
in those movies also.

21:30.332 --> 21:32.098
But all of that has to be tailored

21:32.098 --> 21:34.098
through the gateway
that we provide, right?

21:34.098 --> 21:35.332
Whether it's the set top box,

21:35.332 --> 21:38.265
whether it's the smart
home panel, et cetera.

21:38.265 --> 21:39.965
- Yeah, I love that.

21:39.965 --> 21:43.132
H.B, you have been in
the storytelling arena

21:43.132 --> 21:45.032
for such a long time.

21:45.032 --> 21:48.332
Talk me through how AI is
transforming storytelling

21:48.332 --> 21:49.665
from your personal opinion.

21:50.898 --> 21:51.932
- Sure, I can talk a little bit

21:51.932 --> 21:53.465
briefly about the historical perspective

21:53.465 --> 21:55.265
of some of my current projects.

21:55.265 --> 21:57.198
One that I really was interested in

21:57.198 --> 22:00.598
when I first had access to some
of these more powerful tools

22:00.598 --> 22:02.298
was content creation

22:02.298 --> 22:04.465
and game creation with AIs.

22:04.465 --> 22:05.632
And I started on this process

22:05.632 --> 22:07.398
of designing my own game with it

22:07.398 --> 22:11.098
in a collaborative session with ChatGPT.

22:11.098 --> 22:14.798
And what became fascinating
to me was, it was, so...

22:14.798 --> 22:16.231
First of all, it was so amnesiac

22:16.231 --> 22:18.798
it would forget about what
we were talking about a lot.

22:18.798 --> 22:21.165
So, but once I feel like I conquered that,

22:21.165 --> 22:24.265
it was so interested in
participating in all aspects

22:24.265 --> 22:25.998
of this game creation process,

22:25.998 --> 22:29.998
even when I tried to like
hammer it down in some area,

22:29.998 --> 22:31.198
like for instance,

22:31.198 --> 22:33.065
I would actually have it design some parts

22:33.065 --> 22:35.565
of the game engine and it
would start to get that right

22:35.565 --> 22:38.098
and then I'd say, well now
let's walk through this scene

22:38.098 --> 22:40.831
that I've created, this world,

22:40.831 --> 22:42.565
and it would start to edit the world

22:42.565 --> 22:46.431
and adjust it as I was trying
to debug the game engine part.

22:46.431 --> 22:47.865
And I kept correcting it

22:47.865 --> 22:51.198
and I realized, you know, maybe
I'm fighting uphill on this.

22:51.198 --> 22:52.765
Maybe the act of...

22:52.765 --> 22:54.931
Maybe I'm thinking about content creation

22:54.931 --> 22:58.131
and engine creation in a too rigid way

22:58.131 --> 23:02.765
and maybe AI foretell way of interacting

23:02.765 --> 23:06.931
with categories of jobs
that don't even exist today.

23:06.931 --> 23:08.831
- Fascinating.
- And maybe I'm just seeing

23:08.831 --> 23:12.431
the beginning of that with
this personal scenario.

23:12.431 --> 23:14.831
- Yeah, that's absolutely fascinating.

23:14.831 --> 23:17.698
Steve, back to you again.

23:17.698 --> 23:18.931
We'd love to understand

23:18.931 --> 23:22.531
how you think AI is gonna
change recommendation engines.

23:22.531 --> 23:24.631
You touched on it a
little bit before, around,

23:24.631 --> 23:27.198
if you're always being
served the same thing

23:27.198 --> 23:28.365
over and over and over again,

23:28.365 --> 23:30.131
will you experience things

23:30.131 --> 23:32.798
outside of what an engine's recommending?

23:32.798 --> 23:35.398
So what is the right balance in that

23:35.398 --> 23:38.031
and how do you foresee that unfolding?

23:38.031 --> 23:40.065
- I mean, I think that the AI potentially

23:40.065 --> 23:44.931
would be smart enough that
if you begin to prompt it

23:44.931 --> 23:47.831
for, you know, I want
to hear something new

23:47.831 --> 23:49.265
that I haven't heard-
- Yeah.

23:49.265 --> 23:53.565
- Before, and in a particular genre.

23:55.098 --> 23:58.198
I think that the
opportunity for it to work

23:58.198 --> 24:01.665
as a discovery engine is there.

24:01.665 --> 24:04.598
The question is whether we as humans

24:04.598 --> 24:06.731
would tap into that as much,

24:06.731 --> 24:09.165
or would we just be lazy,

24:09.165 --> 24:11.531
taking in what it serves us,

24:11.531 --> 24:13.531
because we like things that are familiar.

24:13.531 --> 24:16.598
- Yeah.
- And so, again,

24:16.598 --> 24:18.431
I think there's this delicate balance

24:18.431 --> 24:21.565
between what the AI is capable of,

24:21.565 --> 24:25.431
but in terms of our
humanity and our behavior,

24:25.431 --> 24:28.065
how that's gonna be shaped in the process,

24:28.065 --> 24:30.931
and I think that's the more
interesting question to me

24:30.931 --> 24:32.665
that I don't see, you know,

24:32.665 --> 24:33.865
we don't have enough research yet.

24:33.865 --> 24:34.731
- [Tiarne] Yeah, we don't
have the answer to that.

24:34.731 --> 24:37.665
- I think it is such
an important question,

24:38.898 --> 24:41.931
and that in some sense we do have control

24:41.931 --> 24:44.031
over what the algorithm is servicing.

24:44.031 --> 24:47.731
So Yahoo, last spring bought Artifact,

24:47.731 --> 24:49.698
and what's exciting about the algorithm

24:49.698 --> 24:51.931
is how truly nuanced it is.

24:51.931 --> 24:55.098
I am not an engineer, so I
always picture it like a DJ

24:55.098 --> 24:58.431
for sound folks that like,
there's just knobs you could turn

24:58.431 --> 24:59.898
and you could turn up discovery,

24:59.898 --> 25:01.698
you could turn up what's new.

25:01.698 --> 25:04.331
And I think that is a
tremendous responsibility

25:04.331 --> 25:05.631
of finding that balance

25:05.631 --> 25:09.465
so that you're surfacing not
just what people want to see,

25:09.465 --> 25:12.931
but what they need to see or
should see or might excite

25:12.931 --> 25:16.098
or interest them in ways
that they hadn't yet known.

25:16.098 --> 25:19.865
- Well, and just to riff on that too,

25:19.865 --> 25:24.865
part of the problem as well
is, who is delivering the AI

25:24.998 --> 25:26.698
and what are their agendas?

25:26.698 --> 25:29.131
Because then when we get
into a world where it's like,

25:29.131 --> 25:33.431
okay, we're priming the AI to
give you this kind of content

25:33.431 --> 25:36.365
because we know we're gonna
get this kind of a response

25:36.365 --> 25:37.965
from you, you know?

25:37.965 --> 25:41.131
And again, it's a loop

25:41.131 --> 25:42.631
that we can very easily get into.

25:42.631 --> 25:44.431
- Yeah, there might be
conflicting interest

25:44.431 --> 25:47.598
between those multiple
parties about what we want

25:47.598 --> 25:49.065
that person to hear.
- Yeah.

25:49.065 --> 25:51.631
- I mean, you may even
get into a place where,

25:51.631 --> 25:54.965
you know, given the race
to organize your data

25:54.965 --> 25:56.098
as an important factor

25:56.098 --> 25:57.831
of how you go accomplish
all of this AI stuff.

25:57.831 --> 25:59.298
Like, we're never gonna get to a point

25:59.298 --> 26:01.965
where we organize all of the
world's data so perfectly,

26:01.965 --> 26:03.031
and then what happens is,

26:03.031 --> 26:04.531
we're gonna continue to leverage AI

26:04.531 --> 26:06.431
to sift through the unstructured data

26:06.431 --> 26:09.331
that's out there at the
scale and speed that it can.

26:09.331 --> 26:10.365
And the challenges is,

26:10.365 --> 26:13.165
you don't know what's in
your unstructured data.

26:13.165 --> 26:15.898
And so you've gotta be real careful about,

26:15.898 --> 26:17.498
you know, what it's
ultimately going to serve up.

26:17.498 --> 26:20.598
So that layer of responsibility
becomes super important.

26:21.665 --> 26:24.898
- Well, data's also biased,
so we know that, right?

26:24.898 --> 26:26.465
It's a point of view.

26:26.465 --> 26:27.498
Talking about bias.

26:27.498 --> 26:29.331
That leads me to our next question,

26:29.331 --> 26:32.098
and I would love to take the
opportunity to ask you, Brooke,

26:32.098 --> 26:35.231
how do you ensure that AI
tools that are being used,

26:35.231 --> 26:38.065
maintain journalistic integrity

26:38.065 --> 26:41.265
and avoid some of the biases,
from your personal opinion?

26:41.265 --> 26:46.131
- I mean, first, it is that
balance between AI and editors.

26:46.131 --> 26:48.398
I think you need human involvement,

26:48.398 --> 26:50.831
that you need to find the balance.

26:50.831 --> 26:53.865
You can't just let the AI run the show.

26:54.865 --> 26:57.498
One of the advantages
we have at Yahoo News

26:57.498 --> 27:02.431
is because we have such a vast
array of premium publishers,

27:02.431 --> 27:05.431
in terms of bias, we have
almost every perspective

27:05.431 --> 27:07.665
on every topic that you could think of.

27:07.665 --> 27:09.598
So then it's up to an editor

27:09.598 --> 27:11.465
to curate the various perspectives

27:11.465 --> 27:13.831
so that you're not seeing
it through just one lens.

27:13.831 --> 27:15.131
But I think it's just something

27:15.131 --> 27:17.765
that you have to have rigor around.

27:17.765 --> 27:21.231
And to go back to, you know,
who's in control of that.

27:21.231 --> 27:24.098
Like, you have to make it a priority

27:24.098 --> 27:25.131
for how you're using it.

27:25.131 --> 27:27.398
And it's a responsibility,
especially in news,

27:27.398 --> 27:30.565
and one Yahoo News has
taken incredibly seriously.

27:30.565 --> 27:33.031
- It's gonna be a real challenge.

27:33.031 --> 27:34.298
It's not too bad now,

27:34.298 --> 27:38.031
before the world of AGI,
general intelligence.

27:39.331 --> 27:43.865
It's not as clear about how
you manage intelligences

27:43.865 --> 27:45.665
that are 10 or a hundred
or a thousand times

27:45.665 --> 27:46.831
smarter than you are,

27:47.698 --> 27:51.098
and we'll see how that all plays out.

27:51.098 --> 27:52.664
- Eric, coming for you next,

27:52.664 --> 27:55.531
where do you see some
of the inherent biases

27:55.531 --> 27:58.231
in your world of delivering
content and services?

27:58.231 --> 28:00.398
What are some of the risk and concerns

28:00.398 --> 28:01.464
that keep you up at night?

28:01.464 --> 28:03.931
- Yeah, I think the
risks are just inherent

28:03.931 --> 28:05.031
in the unknown nature

28:05.031 --> 28:06.731
of what all of these things can do.

28:06.731 --> 28:10.164
And ultimately, with the ubiquitous access

28:10.164 --> 28:13.331
that people have to AI inside
our company and outside,

28:13.331 --> 28:14.664
you just never know what's gonna happen,

28:14.664 --> 28:16.564
and so I feel like we...

28:16.564 --> 28:18.398
We thankfully took a step

28:18.398 --> 28:20.731
a year and a half ago or so

28:20.731 --> 28:22.531
in terms of one of our first initiatives

28:22.531 --> 28:24.931
was to put in place some
responsible AI practices,

28:24.931 --> 28:26.131
and I've heard a lot about that today.

28:26.131 --> 28:28.931
The last panel was all about
scaling responsible AI,

28:28.931 --> 28:30.098
which I love.

28:30.098 --> 28:32.598
And you know, core tenets of everything

28:32.598 --> 28:36.331
that we do ensure that the AI that we use

28:36.331 --> 28:37.464
or the AI that we create

28:37.464 --> 28:40.364
ultimately falls under four principles.

28:40.364 --> 28:42.998
It it has to be governed,
it has to be harmless,

28:42.998 --> 28:45.498
it has to be secure and
it has to be monitored.

28:45.498 --> 28:46.764
- Yeah.
- And if you don't do

28:46.764 --> 28:47.731
any of those four things,

28:47.731 --> 28:49.231
plus the whole host of other things,

28:49.231 --> 28:51.264
then you can't do it,

28:51.264 --> 28:54.031
because the risks are too
great relative to, you know,

28:54.031 --> 28:57.798
not the necessary probability
of something happening,

28:57.798 --> 28:59.631
because all it has to happen is once.

28:59.631 --> 29:00.931
- Yeah.
- And that's it.

29:02.031 --> 29:02.864
- Yeah, I love that.

29:02.864 --> 29:04.464
H.B, I wanted to talk a little bit

29:04.464 --> 29:07.064
about maintaining the
right creative balance

29:07.064 --> 29:10.198
between humans and machine.

29:10.198 --> 29:13.464
As a storyteller, how do
you see that playing out?

29:13.464 --> 29:16.198
How do we ensure that if
we do go down the road

29:16.198 --> 29:18.698
of hyper personalized content, story,

29:18.698 --> 29:20.831
how do we keep humans involved in that?

29:20.831 --> 29:22.831
What is your thoughts on that?

29:22.831 --> 29:24.631
- Where we are today

29:24.631 --> 29:26.464
and where we've been for several years,

29:26.464 --> 29:27.498
especially during the days

29:27.498 --> 29:31.831
I was very heavily involved with CGI, was,

29:31.831 --> 29:35.798
the AI will be extraordinary
at relatively repetitive tools

29:35.798 --> 29:38.998
like helping with motion capture,

29:38.998 --> 29:42.098
wire removal, script
support and things that,

29:42.098 --> 29:43.398
you know, in terms of, you know,

29:43.398 --> 29:45.931
you take a series like "Game of Thrones"

29:45.931 --> 29:46.931
with hundreds of characters,

29:46.931 --> 29:49.531
you know, and they forget
that they killed off somebody

29:49.531 --> 29:52.331
in scene, you know, three, episode four,

29:52.331 --> 29:53.898
and then two months later they want him

29:53.898 --> 29:55.531
to say something to somebody else.

29:55.531 --> 29:56.464
Now the AI can prompt you,

29:56.464 --> 29:57.931
"No, we killed that person off."

29:57.931 --> 30:00.531
So that doesn't sound
like a real world case,

30:00.531 --> 30:01.964
but it could very well.

30:01.964 --> 30:03.898
So, I think it's gonna be like having

30:03.898 --> 30:06.531
an extraordinarily talented intern.

30:06.531 --> 30:08.498
- Yeah.
- I saw something,

30:08.498 --> 30:12.764
I saw a story where they
helped one of the people

30:12.764 --> 30:14.331
cleaning in the restaurant,

30:14.331 --> 30:16.664
they asked her if she'd
help like slice up potatoes.

30:16.664 --> 30:18.231
And turned out she was an amazing chef,

30:18.231 --> 30:19.731
that she had moved here
from another country

30:19.731 --> 30:21.398
and she transformed that restaurant.

30:21.398 --> 30:22.898
And what we're gonna find with the AI is,

30:22.898 --> 30:24.931
it's gonna be better and
better at some of these things

30:24.931 --> 30:28.331
that we don't think it's
capable of and it's gonna shine.

30:28.331 --> 30:30.264
Now the question is,

30:30.264 --> 30:32.731
right now where we are
today, these stories,

30:32.731 --> 30:34.831
clearly, you see they don't have

30:34.831 --> 30:38.898
as much emotional intelligence
or depth or human...

30:38.898 --> 30:41.231
AI's haven't experienced, you know,

30:41.231 --> 30:42.698
human pains and wisdom.

30:42.698 --> 30:44.564
So they don't have life experiences

30:44.564 --> 30:45.798
to be able to tell these things.

30:45.798 --> 30:46.998
But the question is,

30:46.998 --> 30:49.631
are we gonna be able to distinguish them

30:49.631 --> 30:51.398
in the years going forward?

30:51.398 --> 30:54.631
And we're not gonna know
them when we see them.

30:54.631 --> 30:56.264
We're gonna know the ones that are poor,

30:56.264 --> 30:58.798
but are we even gonna recognize
the ones that are good?

30:58.798 --> 30:59.631
- Yeah.
- My partner

30:59.631 --> 31:01.431
is a notable plastic surgeon,

31:01.431 --> 31:06.331
and you know, people can see
not good plastic surgery,

31:06.331 --> 31:09.298
but really good plastic
surgery is beautiful.

31:09.298 --> 31:11.098
It's flawless, like,
you can't see anything.

31:11.098 --> 31:14.531
So are we gonna see the same
thing with storytelling,

31:14.531 --> 31:17.131
where the story is gonna
have real depth and beauty

31:17.131 --> 31:21.831
and we just won't know what
role AI played in those?

31:21.831 --> 31:23.731
- The question is, how would
you feel in the audience

31:23.731 --> 31:26.998
if you were interacting with
a fully generated AI story

31:26.998 --> 31:27.831
you didn't know?

31:27.831 --> 31:29.864
Would that make you feel good, bad,

31:29.864 --> 31:32.698
if you had time to really think about...

31:32.698 --> 31:34.831
Does it need to be announced
that you're interacting

31:34.831 --> 31:35.964
with an AI driven...

31:35.964 --> 31:38.798
Show of hands actually,
who is in the camp of AI,

31:38.798 --> 31:39.931
you need to interact with something

31:39.931 --> 31:42.731
and you need to know that it's
AI versus you wouldn't, okay.

31:42.731 --> 31:45.498
And what about AI not making itself known

31:45.498 --> 31:46.998
and you wouldn't mind.

31:47.998 --> 31:49.764
Okay, so the majority still.

31:49.764 --> 31:50.664
It's really good to see,

31:50.664 --> 31:53.064
I always like to get
audience participation,

31:53.064 --> 31:54.831
so just know that, if you're
coming to one of my talks.

31:54.831 --> 31:58.164
- I mean, I do think that right now

31:58.164 --> 31:59.831
AI doesn't have taste, and-

32:01.731 --> 32:03.164
- Neither do a lot of humans.

32:03.164 --> 32:04.364
- Yes, that's true,

32:04.364 --> 32:06.831
but like, that's why when
we're building a team,

32:06.831 --> 32:09.364
I'm looking for someone with
strong editorial judgment.

32:09.364 --> 32:13.264
AI could not tell you who was
best dressed at the Globes,

32:13.264 --> 32:16.864
that was Zendaya, and you...

32:16.864 --> 32:19.864
And so I think that's why
it's the importance of,

32:19.864 --> 32:21.331
you know, in any storytelling,

32:21.331 --> 32:24.231
having that editorial judgment layered on,

32:24.231 --> 32:26.131
I think it will continue to evolve

32:26.131 --> 32:27.464
and we'll need to evolve with it,

32:27.464 --> 32:30.398
but right now, I feel like
we could still sniff it out.

32:30.398 --> 32:31.564
- So let's stay on that for a second,

32:31.564 --> 32:34.831
'cause one of your questions
is around looking ahead

32:34.831 --> 32:37.264
and seeing how AI will
evolve in your industry.

32:37.264 --> 32:39.264
What are some of your
thoughts around that?

32:41.298 --> 32:43.898
- I mean, I would've had one answer

32:43.898 --> 32:45.364
before like walking the floor,

32:45.364 --> 32:47.131
and now like my brain is kind of...

32:47.131 --> 32:49.864
I'm like, we're gonna have robot dogs

32:49.864 --> 32:52.231
that will deliver your newspaper.

32:52.231 --> 32:54.331
I think voice is really,
really interesting.

32:54.331 --> 32:56.931
I think it's interesting
what you said about...

32:56.931 --> 33:01.498
That people don't enjoy
interacting with an AI voice.

33:01.498 --> 33:03.331
I'm chatting with ChatGPT all day.

33:03.331 --> 33:06.964
I think that if that was a
conversation that was out loud,

33:08.364 --> 33:09.864
I mean, not to like,

33:09.864 --> 33:10.764
I feel like everyone's always like,

33:10.764 --> 33:12.031
"And my kid..."

33:12.031 --> 33:16.531
But my Gen Alpha kid, like
anytime he's talking to a phone,

33:16.531 --> 33:18.231
it's always through voice.

33:19.064 --> 33:20.431
I don't know if he could type or spell,

33:20.431 --> 33:22.831
but that's a story for another time.

33:23.664 --> 33:26.131
So I do think that the interface

33:26.131 --> 33:27.697
in which we engage with news,

33:27.697 --> 33:28.831
like you were talking about,

33:28.831 --> 33:30.797
did the "Game of Thrones" character die?

33:30.797 --> 33:34.264
You know, is being able to
ask questions about the news

33:34.264 --> 33:35.797
and get responses

33:35.797 --> 33:37.364
and be able to go deeper

33:37.364 --> 33:38.931
in the way that you would with search,

33:38.931 --> 33:41.697
I think will be, you know,

33:41.697 --> 33:43.431
an interesting evolution.
- Yeah.

33:43.431 --> 33:45.897
- I mean, my child is
growing up in a world

33:45.897 --> 33:47.597
and I watch her interact with things

33:47.597 --> 33:49.064
that aren't voice enabled today,

33:49.064 --> 33:52.897
and she is genuinely surprised
when it doesn't respond

33:52.897 --> 33:54.397
when she asks it a question.

33:54.397 --> 33:55.797
She's like, "Dad, this thing's broken."

33:55.797 --> 33:59.231
I'm like, "No, that just doesn't do that."

33:59.231 --> 34:01.064
- Do you know the
changing point for me was,

34:01.064 --> 34:03.864
I travel a lot for work
and Alexa's in my house,

34:03.864 --> 34:05.164
and when I come home,

34:05.164 --> 34:07.364
I normally get scared
turning on the lights.

34:07.364 --> 34:09.464
Like clearly no one's in my building,

34:09.464 --> 34:11.364
clearly no one's in my apartment,

34:11.364 --> 34:13.097
but there's that one moment
when you open the door

34:13.097 --> 34:15.631
and you're like, "Hello,
is anybody there?"

34:15.631 --> 34:19.231
And for me, Alexa is just,
"Hey Alexa, like I'm home.

34:19.231 --> 34:20.431
Turn the lights on," whatever it may be,

34:20.431 --> 34:22.031
Alexa lights on and-

34:22.031 --> 34:23.631
- You just turned the lights on.

34:24.864 --> 34:27.264
- Anyway, device triggers.

34:27.264 --> 34:30.597
But that was the moment I realized,

34:30.597 --> 34:32.997
because I felt not afraid,

34:32.997 --> 34:36.564
that I had already formed
some sort of attachment

34:36.564 --> 34:37.831
or feeling,

34:37.831 --> 34:40.397
to feeling like there was someone with me,

34:40.397 --> 34:41.631
even though it wasn't a someone,

34:41.631 --> 34:43.564
and that's a device that doesn't have

34:43.564 --> 34:45.397
conversational application

34:45.397 --> 34:47.497
where I can talk back and
forth for long periods of time.

34:47.497 --> 34:50.531
So Steven, what are you
seeing next in the field?

34:50.531 --> 34:52.131
What are you most excited about?

34:54.264 --> 34:56.264
- Well, I think that there's some

34:56.264 --> 34:59.397
real interesting opportunities
for applications.

34:59.397 --> 35:00.597
Like let's say if I'm listening

35:00.597 --> 35:03.764
to a Neil deGrasse Tyson podcast

35:03.764 --> 35:05.631
and he's talking about wormholes

35:05.631 --> 35:06.764
and I want to know more,

35:06.764 --> 35:10.597
I can say, "Hey Neil, tell
me more about wormholes."

35:10.597 --> 35:12.797
And he can have a cloned voice

35:12.797 --> 35:17.064
that will then kind of give
me more information, you know?

35:17.064 --> 35:20.797
I think that's a really
interesting application.

35:21.997 --> 35:25.864
I think, again, this world of healthcare

35:25.864 --> 35:27.131
is fascinating to me.

35:27.131 --> 35:29.797
I think there are some really interesting

35:29.797 --> 35:30.897
developments there.

35:30.897 --> 35:32.797
And also automotive.

35:32.797 --> 35:35.397
I mean, keep your eye on automotive,

35:35.397 --> 35:38.131
'cause I think that's where
the really interesting tech

35:38.131 --> 35:39.131
is being developed.

35:39.131 --> 35:41.297
You have automobiles that they're creating

35:41.297 --> 35:43.197
more and more immersive environments

35:43.197 --> 35:45.697
as we get closer to self-driving.

35:45.697 --> 35:48.397
The vehicle isn't just
about transportation,

35:48.397 --> 35:51.364
it can be about entertainment,
it can be about work,

35:51.364 --> 35:54.064
it can be about relaxation,

35:54.064 --> 35:55.564
and all the different ways

35:55.564 --> 35:59.797
that even now vehicles are using sound.

35:59.797 --> 36:01.831
Knowing from biometric data,

36:01.831 --> 36:04.997
what kind of mood you're
in, tailoring things.

36:04.997 --> 36:08.331
If it senses you are getting
ready to fall asleep,

36:08.331 --> 36:10.831
there can be an audio component for that.

36:10.831 --> 36:13.064
If you're experiencing motion sickness,

36:13.064 --> 36:14.931
I mean we already have this,

36:14.931 --> 36:17.697
we have a soundscape that can
counteract motion sickness.

36:17.697 --> 36:18.797
- Yeah.
- So I think

36:18.797 --> 36:21.197
those kinds of things are
really fascinating to me.

36:21.197 --> 36:25.064
Probably more so than listening
to music in the background,

36:25.064 --> 36:26.797
'cause I'd rather just grab a vinyl album

36:26.797 --> 36:28.097
and put it on the turntable.

36:28.097 --> 36:30.431
- Yeah, that's fascinating.
I'd like an interactive book.

36:30.431 --> 36:32.731
You know, when you read a book
from your favorite author,

36:32.731 --> 36:33.631
there's certain chapters

36:33.631 --> 36:35.731
you wanna spend more time in, you know?

36:35.731 --> 36:36.564
And there's certain chapters

36:36.564 --> 36:39.997
you'd just rather skip. (laughs)

36:39.997 --> 36:43.497
H.B, what about yourself?
Where do you see the future?

36:43.497 --> 36:46.797
- Well, notwithstanding a couple
of decades of making movies

36:46.797 --> 36:49.031
with really terrible endings

36:49.031 --> 36:51.997
related to humanoid
robots in and around us.

36:51.997 --> 36:53.897
If you set that aside for a moment,

36:54.764 --> 36:57.331
that's I think what
I'm most excited about,

36:57.331 --> 37:01.331
seeing these agile,
humanoid robots in the house

37:01.331 --> 37:04.297
that somebody can buy,
will just transform society

37:04.297 --> 37:06.631
in ways that we can't even imagine.

37:06.631 --> 37:08.064
You know, age tech.

37:09.331 --> 37:11.164
Having a robot that can help, you know,

37:11.164 --> 37:13.797
bring you to the bathroom,

37:13.797 --> 37:15.397
you know, do some light cooking,

37:15.397 --> 37:17.797
drive you somewhere in a conventional car.

37:17.797 --> 37:21.931
You don't need a, you know,
a special car to do it.

37:21.931 --> 37:24.264
Go up and down the
stairs, carry, lifting...

37:24.264 --> 37:26.764
It's gonna be just tremendous

37:26.764 --> 37:28.964
for how the world will change

37:28.964 --> 37:33.597
with that being readily
available and priced well.

37:33.597 --> 37:35.697
I'm fascinated by a lot of the same ones

37:35.697 --> 37:37.964
that you guys have mentioned as well.

37:37.964 --> 37:42.031
I think the tedium of
kind of the min maxing

37:42.031 --> 37:43.697
that people like to do,

37:43.697 --> 37:46.831
like just planning efficient
flights and travel,

37:46.831 --> 37:49.597
things that travel agents might
have done for us in the past

37:49.597 --> 37:52.164
that we've now given up
and we don't even know.

37:52.164 --> 37:53.097
And there's a whole generation

37:53.097 --> 37:55.897
that doesn't even know that
that even existed, you know?

37:56.931 --> 37:58.331
We will be able to have again.
- Yeah.

37:58.331 --> 38:01.564
- And it'll work and it'll
follow your patterns.

38:01.564 --> 38:04.497
It'll min max the way
you want it to be done,

38:04.497 --> 38:05.931
for what you're trying to optimize.

38:05.931 --> 38:08.931
- Recipes for dinner, I like AI for that.

38:09.897 --> 38:13.231
- Just cooking the dinner.

38:13.231 --> 38:15.564
- My partner and I have this foodie diet.

38:15.564 --> 38:18.031
So we roll, there's five dice,

38:18.031 --> 38:19.064
it gives you the ingredients.

38:19.064 --> 38:22.997
We can go to AI and say, "Gimme
a three course French meal

38:22.997 --> 38:24.297
that I can cook at home,

38:24.297 --> 38:26.831
and a bottle of wine
with these ingredients."

38:26.831 --> 38:28.197
And it does a really good job.

38:28.197 --> 38:29.597
And the recipes-
- And it will give you

38:29.597 --> 38:32.097
an appropriate soundtrack to your cooking.

38:32.097 --> 38:33.664
- Yes, it will do that as well.

38:34.497 --> 38:36.164
- I had it basically inventing...

38:36.164 --> 38:38.431
I had it inventing cocktails on the fly.

38:38.431 --> 38:39.397
- Yes.
- And I would make

38:39.397 --> 38:40.431
whatever it told me to make,

38:40.431 --> 38:43.164
and it seemed good.

38:43.164 --> 38:44.997
- Your partner walks in
and you're in a bad mood.

38:44.997 --> 38:47.431
They just know it's like,
dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

38:47.431 --> 38:50.064
as they get closer to
you, you're in trouble.

38:51.097 --> 38:52.864
What about yourself, Steven?

38:52.864 --> 38:54.364
- Yeah, I'll keep it brief

38:54.364 --> 38:56.630
given the clock is ticking here, right?

38:57.964 --> 39:00.864
I think I am enjoying very much the fact

39:00.864 --> 39:03.564
that the world is redefining
the term personalization.

39:03.564 --> 39:05.530
- Yeah.
- And I love the fact

39:05.530 --> 39:07.530
that we have a prime opportunity

39:07.530 --> 39:10.297
to sit in the middle of
how we ultimately market

39:10.297 --> 39:11.964
and communicate to our customers,

39:12.797 --> 39:15.297
how they consume content

39:15.297 --> 39:16.697
in terms of media and entertainment,

39:16.697 --> 39:20.064
and how we deliver those
services to them in the home.

39:20.064 --> 39:23.797
Making that triangle as
seamless as possible,

39:23.797 --> 39:24.864
ultimately has to be done

39:24.864 --> 39:27.130
because it's gonna be an expectation.

39:27.130 --> 39:29.230
But leveraging all of these
things that, you know,

39:29.230 --> 39:32.630
come out every day that you
didn't know existed 12 hours ago

39:32.630 --> 39:35.364
is the most exciting thing that
I think sits in front of us,

39:35.364 --> 39:37.397
and it's what gets me
outta bed every morning

39:37.397 --> 39:40.297
and running to the office.
- Yeah.

39:40.297 --> 39:43.497
Yeah, I think personalization
is quite interesting,

39:43.497 --> 39:45.430
and I know we're pretty much outta time,

39:45.430 --> 39:47.964
because we've put people
in categories, right?

39:47.964 --> 39:49.964
For quite so long, personas.

39:49.964 --> 39:50.830
One more person comes to me

39:50.830 --> 39:53.830
with persona marketing
architecture, I will freak out.

39:53.830 --> 39:55.264
But I think we've got the opportunity

39:55.264 --> 39:57.797
to go so much further past that,

39:57.797 --> 40:00.630
so much deeper into the human experience

40:00.630 --> 40:02.730
and create things that
are destined for that.

40:02.730 --> 40:04.497
- Everything will be a segment of one.

40:04.497 --> 40:05.830
- Yeah, absolutely.

40:05.830 --> 40:09.497
So listen, everybody please
follow these amazing speakers.

40:09.497 --> 40:11.464
Not only are they pioneering the space,

40:11.464 --> 40:14.064
but they are just a wealth of knowledge.

40:14.064 --> 40:15.497
Thank you for joining our session.

40:15.497 --> 40:17.864
Thank you to our MCs who are amazing,

40:17.864 --> 40:19.897
and thank you to Modev
for hosting us today.

40:19.897 --> 40:22.197
We truly appreciate the
opportunity to speak to all.

40:22.197 --> 40:23.397
Enjoy CES.
- Thank you.

40:23.397 --> 40:25.430
- [MC] Let's give them
a round of applause.

40:25.430 --> 40:29.164
(upbeat instrumental music)
