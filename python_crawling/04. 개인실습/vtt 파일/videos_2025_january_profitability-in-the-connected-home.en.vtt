00:00.409 --> 00:02.992
(upbeat music)

00:10.290 --> 00:12.570
I am Elizabeth Parks, the President and CMO</v>

00:12.570 --> 00:13.590
of Parks Associates.

00:13.590 --> 00:16.920
We're excited to have this conversation also

00:16.920 --> 00:20.280
to host our 19th Annual Connection Summit.

00:20.280 --> 00:23.190
We invite you all to join us at our networking reception

00:23.190 --> 00:25.260
this evening if you're interested

00:25.260 --> 00:28.020
and want to send a enormous shout out

00:28.020 --> 00:29.880
to our sponsors of this event.

00:29.880 --> 00:34.770
So thank you to these companies for sharing their support

00:34.770 --> 00:39.570
for this sessions today and our evening reception.

00:39.570 --> 00:41.550
We're gonna be talking about profitability

00:41.550 --> 00:42.630
in the connected home.

00:42.630 --> 00:44.190
This is a hot topic, right?

00:44.190 --> 00:47.100
How to make money and stay in business.

00:47.100 --> 00:49.620
And we've got an amazing lineup of speakers

00:49.620 --> 00:51.690
who are gonna share some of their experiences

00:51.690 --> 00:55.740
that they've had in managing the bottom line,

00:55.740 --> 00:58.890
as well as maintaining innovation

00:58.890 --> 01:01.800
and shifting business models.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.890
So again, I welcome you, I am the President

01:04.890 --> 01:06.510
and CMO of Parks Associates.

01:06.510 --> 01:10.410
We're celebrating our 39th year in business this year,

01:10.410 --> 01:14.820
and so thank you if you are part of our events or research,

01:14.820 --> 01:17.580
we very much appreciate your support.

01:17.580 --> 01:21.420
And I wanna start off by just setting the stage for you all

01:21.420 --> 01:23.730
before we go into questions.

01:23.730 --> 01:25.800
There are so many different players

01:25.800 --> 01:28.230
that are in the connected home space,

01:28.230 --> 01:30.270
and the smart home, of course,

01:30.270 --> 01:32.280
is part of the connected home.

01:32.280 --> 01:34.830
Lots and lots of companies who are vying

01:34.830 --> 01:38.070
for the consumer's attention, for their money,

01:38.070 --> 01:41.520
and ultimately for the subscription service

01:41.520 --> 01:44.280
that the consumer could have in their home depending

01:44.280 --> 01:46.320
on what they're buying.

01:46.320 --> 01:50.580
Making money in this market is interesting

01:50.580 --> 01:53.550
and requires a lot of thinking,

01:53.550 --> 01:58.230
requires a lot of investments, costs, and strategies.

01:58.230 --> 02:00.900
It is also completely dependent on a lot

02:00.900 --> 02:03.330
of partnerships and understanding

02:03.330 --> 02:06.930
how these ecosystems can work together

02:06.930 --> 02:08.460
in a converging market.

02:08.460 --> 02:11.160
And that really is what Parks Associates is about,

02:11.160 --> 02:14.190
understanding where the opportunity lies

02:14.190 --> 02:16.890
between intersecting ecosystems

02:16.890 --> 02:20.070
that are converging ultimately in the name

02:20.070 --> 02:22.110
of the experience for the consumer.

02:22.110 --> 02:25.290
So that's what we'll be talking about today

02:25.290 --> 02:27.990
and we encourage you all to read some

02:27.990 --> 02:29.640
of the research that we've produced.

02:29.640 --> 02:31.920
There is a lot of free data on our website

02:31.920 --> 02:34.350
in understanding the different business models

02:34.350 --> 02:37.200
and how to go to market with new products.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.330
I would like to start off with brief intros.

02:39.330 --> 02:42.330
We have really, a great lineup of speakers

02:42.330 --> 02:45.210
to address this topic coming from different areas

02:45.210 --> 02:47.460
of the consumer market.

02:47.460 --> 02:50.790
And so we're gonna start off with 30 second introductions

02:50.790 --> 02:53.160
and then go into Q&amp;A.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.360
And so we'll start here.

02:54.360 --> 02:55.405
Travis, if you would introduce yourself.

02:55.405 --> 02:59.790
<v ->All right, yeah, I'm Travis Hockersmith, I work for Vizio.</v>

02:59.790 --> 03:03.030
I oversee the team

03:03.030 --> 03:05.190
that works on monetization of our platform.

03:05.190 --> 03:07.650
So we've transformed our business model

03:07.650 --> 03:09.360
over the past five years or so

03:09.360 --> 03:12.720
from a company that makes money when we sell TVs

03:12.720 --> 03:16.290
to a company that makes money when you use your TV.

03:16.290 --> 03:19.140
And that's what my team's really been focused on

03:19.140 --> 03:22.950
and we've built a fairly large recurring revenue business

03:22.950 --> 03:24.213
over the past five years.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.580
<v Elizabeth>Great, thank you for being here.</v>

03:26.580 --> 03:27.930
Melissa, welcome back.

03:27.930 --> 03:30.000
<v ->Thank you Elizabeth, good morning everybody.</v>

03:30.000 --> 03:32.100
My name is Melissa Andresko.

03:32.100 --> 03:36.240
I am the chief brand ambassador at Lutron Electronics.

03:36.240 --> 03:38.040
For those of you not familiar with Lutron,

03:38.040 --> 03:40.530
we are the company that brought dimmers

03:40.530 --> 03:41.880
to the world, light dimmers,

03:41.880 --> 03:45.570
and have today involved into a very robust smart home

03:45.570 --> 03:47.220
and smart building business.

03:47.220 --> 03:48.720
And I'm very happy to be here

03:48.720 --> 03:51.120
and thank you for spending your morning with us.

03:52.050 --> 03:54.660
<v ->Hi everyone, my name is Agnes Lorenz.</v>

03:54.660 --> 03:57.780
I do brand and partner support at Zooz.

03:57.780 --> 04:00.330
We are a Z-Wave manufacturer.

04:00.330 --> 04:04.050
We produce quality smart home devices,

04:04.050 --> 04:09.050
anything from dimmers, switches, also relays and sensors.

04:09.090 --> 04:12.330
We're focused on providing a comprehensive ecosystem

04:12.330 --> 04:15.060
for everybody to use using the latest technology.

04:15.060 --> 04:18.960
We have over 35 devices on the market today,

04:18.960 --> 04:22.563
most of them using the latest Z-Wave long range technology.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.710
<v ->]Elizabeth] Great, thanks for being here, Jake, welcome.</v>

04:25.710 --> 04:27.420
<v Jake>Thanks Elizabeth, welcome as well.</v>

04:27.420 --> 04:29.070
Thank you for having me.

04:29.070 --> 04:31.230
For the audience, my name is Jake Alamat.

04:31.230 --> 04:34.350
I manage the home and life business for Silicon Labs.

04:34.350 --> 04:37.020
For those of you unfamiliar with Silicon Labs,

04:37.020 --> 04:38.220
our entire business is

04:38.220 --> 04:42.000
around building semiconductor solutions for IOT Edge nodes.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.200
So we've been in the IOT almost forever,

04:46.200 --> 04:47.640
since it's kind of been around.

04:47.640 --> 04:51.420
And what we focus on is building optimized,

04:51.420 --> 04:55.560
secure solutions and services to enable device makers

04:55.560 --> 05:00.000
and ecosystems to add value and bring unique solutions

05:00.000 --> 05:01.530
and use cases to the market.

05:01.530 --> 05:03.150
So thank you for having me,

05:03.150 --> 05:05.490
appreciate being a part of this panel.

05:05.490 --> 05:06.840
<v Elizabeth>Great, Laura, welcome.</v>

05:06.840 --> 05:09.420
<v ->Hi everybody, thanks for having me today.</v>

05:09.420 --> 05:10.320
I'm Laura Mitchell.

05:10.320 --> 05:12.870
I'm the CEO of GrandCare Systems.

05:12.870 --> 05:16.980
We are a software company that utilizes a variety

05:16.980 --> 05:20.790
of hardware solutions, including like a touchscreen

05:20.790 --> 05:24.150
and several sensors to help individuals primarily

05:24.150 --> 05:26.700
with disabilities or older adults

05:26.700 --> 05:28.290
remain independent at home.

05:28.290 --> 05:31.110
So establishing remote supports

05:31.110 --> 05:33.990
and things like that to utilize touchscreen based

05:33.990 --> 05:37.620
and sensor-based technologies, nice to be here.

05:37.620 --> 05:39.090
<v ->Great, thank you for joining us.</v>

05:39.090 --> 05:40.920
Okay, so we have a lot of different perspectives.

05:40.920 --> 05:42.570
I wanna start and just talk

05:42.570 --> 05:47.160
about the hardware model really changing.

05:47.160 --> 05:48.840
And so Travis, we're gonna start here.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.550
Can you give us an idea

05:50.550 --> 05:54.480
of how Vizio has navigated this shift that we've seen

05:54.480 --> 05:57.780
in the past, I don't know, 18 to 30 months

05:57.780 --> 06:00.990
with moving from being a television company

06:00.990 --> 06:02.670
to being so much more?

06:02.670 --> 06:04.480
<v ->Yeah, it really starts</v>

06:05.610 --> 06:07.560
with transforming the company into more

06:07.560 --> 06:09.570
of a software company.

06:09.570 --> 06:13.500
Historically, we made great TVs at a great price

06:13.500 --> 06:15.903
and we were very hardware focused.

06:16.920 --> 06:19.050
People would buy a TV, plug in their cable box,

06:19.050 --> 06:20.460
whatever the case may be.

06:20.460 --> 06:24.870
As the world moved to streaming services,

06:24.870 --> 06:28.890
it provided a huge opportunity to be the operating system

06:28.890 --> 06:32.070
that people use when they turn on their TV to go

06:32.070 --> 06:35.190
to all the content you expect, all the apps that you expect.

06:35.190 --> 06:37.560
And they're really interesting business models

06:37.560 --> 06:40.260
in running that part of the business.

06:40.260 --> 06:42.000
We make money from advertising,

06:42.000 --> 06:45.210
we make money from subscriptions.

06:45.210 --> 06:47.550
We found all sorts of ways

06:47.550 --> 06:49.953
to monetize when you turn the TV on.

06:50.790 --> 06:53.070
And that's been the real transformation.

06:53.070 --> 06:56.651
It's been a completely different company now

06:56.651 --> 06:59.940
than it was in the past, just in terms of the type

06:59.940 --> 07:02.820
of people we employ, the number of engineers that work

07:02.820 --> 07:05.823
for us, the number of people that work,

07:06.780 --> 07:09.600
talking with advertising clients and selling

07:09.600 --> 07:12.030
to advertising clients, the number of people

07:12.030 --> 07:16.020
who work with the major apps in the ecosystem.

07:16.020 --> 07:20.010
So it's really been a whole company transformation from,

07:20.010 --> 07:22.590
I guess the simplest way to put it's from a hardware company

07:22.590 --> 07:24.720
to an integrated company

07:24.720 --> 07:27.573
that is predominantly software driven.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.240
<v Elizabeth>And that's this hardware as a service model</v>

07:30.240 --> 07:32.550
that we've been talking about for years now at parks.

07:32.550 --> 07:37.550
And I know that Jake at Silicon Labs is really working

07:37.560 --> 07:40.830
to help many hardware companies realize

07:40.830 --> 07:42.420
that they can become so much more.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.310
We are in a world of transformation

07:44.310 --> 07:49.170
and so this hardware is now dependent upon so much more

07:49.170 --> 07:51.780
and there is revenue that is getting attached to that.

07:51.780 --> 07:53.490
So Jay, can you explain a little bit

07:53.490 --> 07:54.780
about how this is working

07:54.780 --> 07:57.900
when you all are approaching different companies as they try

07:57.900 --> 08:01.353
to transform themselves as Vizio is currently doing?

08:02.412 --> 08:04.800
<v ->Yeah, at Silicon Labs, as you said,</v>

08:04.800 --> 08:07.560
Elizabeth, we support tens of thousands

08:07.560 --> 08:09.810
of customers all building unique devices.

08:09.810 --> 08:14.810
And we see many strong use cases today

08:16.050 --> 08:20.010
and many strong use cases coming in the future

08:20.010 --> 08:23.520
that are really driving new electronics companies

08:23.520 --> 08:26.670
to either shift their model like Travis is talking about,

08:26.670 --> 08:30.330
or build new features and use cases.

08:30.330 --> 08:32.370
And really the folks that we see

08:32.370 --> 08:35.460
that are successful in this, they're folks

08:35.460 --> 08:40.460
that they focus on how do I add a unique value

08:41.070 --> 08:44.970
to the consumer that isn't just viewed as a nice to have,

08:44.970 --> 08:48.690
but it becomes viewed as a must have, right?

08:48.690 --> 08:51.360
So talking about aging in place, right,

08:51.360 --> 08:55.830
where people want that, that freedom to be able

08:55.830 --> 08:57.270
to stay in their home and not go

08:57.270 --> 08:59.370
to a different community or anything like that.

08:59.370 --> 09:02.730
Having the tools to be able to go control that

09:02.730 --> 09:06.480
and be able to stay in a place that you want to be

09:06.480 --> 09:09.570
or extending even into medical monitoring

09:09.570 --> 09:11.910
like you see with diabetes management today.

09:11.910 --> 09:13.980
So the folks that we see

09:13.980 --> 09:16.380
that are really successful here are looking

09:16.380 --> 09:19.600
at how do I add value

09:21.120 --> 09:23.920
with my own product and across the ecosystem

09:24.810 --> 09:27.123
that is gonna align to consumer's needs?

09:28.140 --> 09:29.850
The folks that we see that have challenges

09:29.850 --> 09:32.370
in this are the folks that really try

09:32.370 --> 09:34.650
to go it on their own for everything

09:34.650 --> 09:36.120
because they build in a lot

09:36.120 --> 09:37.953
of complexity in their products.

09:39.330 --> 09:42.000
It saps resources away from them being able

09:42.000 --> 09:46.140
to focus on what value can I provide

09:46.140 --> 09:48.390
and not only what value can I provide,

09:48.390 --> 09:51.480
but how do I communicate that to a non-technical audience?

09:51.480 --> 09:56.430
So it's pretty exciting the landscape that's out there

09:56.430 --> 09:57.780
and how it's evolving

09:57.780 --> 10:00.240
and I think there's a lot of opportunities for folks

10:00.240 --> 10:03.600
to really build good, strong businesses off of it,

10:03.600 --> 10:05.070
but they need to be thinking in a way

10:05.070 --> 10:09.390
of how do I add value on an ongoing basis?

10:09.390 --> 10:10.410
What's that service?

10:10.410 --> 10:13.320
What's that thing that becomes a must have to drive?

10:13.320 --> 10:15.030
<v Elizabeth>And is there a reality</v>

10:15.030 --> 10:19.290
that a subscription service is necessary in today's world

10:19.290 --> 10:23.640
with hardware or that it's important

10:23.640 --> 10:27.510
in terms of long-term future of products?

10:27.510 --> 10:29.880
<v ->I don't think that it has to be there.</v>

10:29.880 --> 10:33.573
I think it depends on what you're trying to go do.

10:35.449 --> 10:36.723
A lot of companies today,

10:38.040 --> 10:42.000
they'll have tiered offerings where they'll have a doorbell

10:42.000 --> 10:43.590
and a lock or a light

10:43.590 --> 10:45.690
that you can all put together in your home

10:45.690 --> 10:46.740
and make that work.

10:46.740 --> 10:50.070
And if you're fine managing that yourself,

10:50.070 --> 10:51.240
you don't need any,

10:51.240 --> 10:54.000
a subscription actually becomes counterproductive

10:54.000 --> 10:56.490
at that point because then what am I paying for?

10:56.490 --> 10:57.390
Really what they care

10:57.390 --> 11:00.600
about in that case is do I trust the brand, right?

11:00.600 --> 11:01.680
Is this gonna be reliable?

11:01.680 --> 11:04.500
Is this gonna be appliance that I can keep for a long time?

11:04.500 --> 11:07.320
But there's things that you can go do above

11:07.320 --> 11:10.650
and beyond that where it could become a monitoring service

11:10.650 --> 11:14.010
either for security, either for energy efficiency

11:14.010 --> 11:15.480
where somebody can say, "Hey look,

11:15.480 --> 11:17.700
I'll save you 50% on your bill

11:17.700 --> 11:20.280
and here's the ROI you get for giving me that money."

11:20.280 --> 11:23.340
But it has to be tied to a tangible use case.

11:23.340 --> 11:24.630
And as you can see,

11:24.630 --> 11:27.780
it doesn't always have to be a subscription.

11:27.780 --> 11:31.740
The focus has to be on, in my opinion

11:31.740 --> 11:35.670
and in our opinion is how am I adding unique value

11:35.670 --> 11:40.050
and how am I putting all my time, energy, and effort there?

11:40.050 --> 11:43.170
<v ->Okay, great, and how are we gonna get consumers</v>

11:43.170 --> 11:45.510
to get the idea of AI

11:45.510 --> 11:48.960
and artificial intelligence in their home products?

11:48.960 --> 11:51.333
And so Agnes, I'll come to you on this one.

11:52.830 --> 11:55.710
When talking about the different products

11:55.710 --> 11:57.240
that you all have in the home

11:57.240 --> 12:00.870
and the level of AI that is being injected,

12:00.870 --> 12:03.180
what is the consumer response to this

12:03.180 --> 12:08.180
and why does the AI become so important

12:08.220 --> 12:11.520
to driving the profitability and the future

12:11.520 --> 12:13.110
of those different products when we look

12:13.110 --> 12:14.880
at the market today?

12:14.880 --> 12:17.340
<v ->Yeah, I think you have to follow the money, right?</v>

12:17.340 --> 12:21.930
All the money in tech is going to AI development right now

12:21.930 --> 12:24.750
and there's a huge opportunity in the smart home.

12:24.750 --> 12:27.270
I think that what we're seeing right now

12:27.270 --> 12:30.690
with companies like Josh AI, what it's very easy to interact

12:30.690 --> 12:32.490
with, smart home is just a preview.

12:32.490 --> 12:34.620
It's hopefully going to happen.

12:34.620 --> 12:36.600
One of the biggest barriers that we've seen

12:36.600 --> 12:38.760
with consumers is that nobody has time

12:38.760 --> 12:40.800
to create if then scenarios

12:40.800 --> 12:43.470
or rules to create automations.

12:43.470 --> 12:46.980
Some of that falls on the backs of installers right now

12:46.980 --> 12:49.260
and that really drives that industry.

12:49.260 --> 12:51.450
But in the future, what we're going

12:51.450 --> 12:54.450
to see is there will be large action models

12:54.450 --> 12:57.290
for smart homes similar to self-driving for cars today.

12:57.290 --> 12:59.610
We're going to see the homes

12:59.610 --> 13:01.050
suggesting what needs to be done.

13:01.050 --> 13:04.590
Wouldn't it be nice to unpack a sensor, set it up,

13:04.590 --> 13:06.060
do a shadow valve, set it up,

13:06.060 --> 13:09.330
and then the automation is set up for you, right?

13:09.330 --> 13:10.500
You don't have to do anything.

13:10.500 --> 13:14.340
So that's the future, in terms of platform development,

13:14.340 --> 13:16.470
whoever's here doing software,

13:16.470 --> 13:18.540
that's absolutely where you should be focusing on,

13:18.540 --> 13:21.360
how to bypass that rural creation process

13:21.360 --> 13:24.810
and deliver really smart suggestions

13:24.810 --> 13:26.820
and solutions for your customers.

13:26.820 --> 13:30.360
If you're a hardware developer like us for example,

13:30.360 --> 13:32.250
what we need to start looking at is something

13:32.250 --> 13:34.860
that I think Silicon Labs is seen already.

13:34.860 --> 13:36.990
I know that you guys were helping a customer

13:36.990 --> 13:40.080
develop a smoke sensor that would tell the difference

13:40.080 --> 13:43.710
between an incense smoke and actual fire smoke, right?

13:43.710 --> 13:46.560
So compute on the edge where sensors

13:46.560 --> 13:49.110
and controls are getting smarter

13:49.110 --> 13:51.660
with machine learning algorithms

13:51.660 --> 13:53.760
that just have the type of power

13:53.760 --> 13:55.890
to bring us to the next level

13:55.890 --> 13:57.420
and really deliver that experience

13:57.420 --> 14:00.690
because at the end of the day, just like as Jake mentioned,

14:00.690 --> 14:03.720
what you make money on is user experience.

14:03.720 --> 14:04.950
<v ->Yeah, and I think a lot of what you're talking</v>

14:04.950 --> 14:09.180
about is this new term we're we're seeing Agentic AI,

14:09.180 --> 14:13.620
this autonomous coordination that's going on

14:13.620 --> 14:15.780
with all of the intelligence.

14:15.780 --> 14:18.010
And so that is a new term

14:18.900 --> 14:23.370
that parks has been seeing, Google using it quite a bit.

14:23.370 --> 14:28.110
The idea that the coordination is all built in and happening

14:28.110 --> 14:29.910
because of the intelligence coming

14:29.910 --> 14:32.880
from the different devices or sensors,

14:32.880 --> 14:35.100
whatever data is there.

14:35.100 --> 14:38.070
So it's very interesting thinking about it that way.

14:38.070 --> 14:41.460
Melissa would love to hear from you on some of Lutron's view

14:41.460 --> 14:45.810
and how you all are building the experience

14:45.810 --> 14:47.640
for consumers at home.

14:47.640 --> 14:50.160
<v ->Yeah, so I think today a lot</v>

14:50.160 --> 14:52.260
of consumers I think are starting

14:52.260 --> 14:54.330
with one smart home product

14:54.330 --> 14:56.280
that is solving a problem for them.

14:56.280 --> 15:00.150
I don't know that there's this broad group of consumers

15:00.150 --> 15:01.950
who have their whole smart home sort

15:01.950 --> 15:03.150
of laid out ahead of time.

15:03.150 --> 15:04.830
I think there's a lot of tech enthusiasts

15:04.830 --> 15:06.990
who are probably operating that way,

15:06.990 --> 15:09.180
but I think the average consumer is starting

15:09.180 --> 15:10.197
with a singular product.

15:10.197 --> 15:12.330
And that might be a voice assistant,

15:12.330 --> 15:14.490
it might be a smart doorbell or a camera,

15:14.490 --> 15:17.040
something that is gonna solve a very distinct problem

15:17.040 --> 15:21.000
in their household or enhance their lifestyle, excuse me.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.160
And then I think that the whole works

15:23.160 --> 15:25.470
with aspect is sort of the bonus.

15:25.470 --> 15:27.630
And I think that again, they're starting

15:27.630 --> 15:28.740
with one product.

15:28.740 --> 15:31.830
They're understanding the integration possibilities

15:31.830 --> 15:34.140
with whether it's lights or shades

15:34.140 --> 15:37.920
or adding additional devices, whether it's audio.

15:37.920 --> 15:39.510
So it's very interesting

15:39.510 --> 15:42.720
because we're seeing a lot of attachment sales very quickly

15:42.720 --> 15:45.990
and I think Amazon in particular does a very good job.

15:45.990 --> 15:48.240
Once you purchase one smart home product,

15:48.240 --> 15:50.370
it starts suggesting other things that work.

15:50.370 --> 15:53.340
So it's exciting to sort of see how this is evolving.

15:53.340 --> 15:55.650
But yeah, we find especially

15:55.650 --> 15:58.860
with our Caseta smart lighting system,

15:58.860 --> 16:01.470
people are starting there and then adding on.

16:01.470 --> 16:04.650
So it's been exciting to see that evolution.

16:04.650 --> 16:05.640
<v Elizabeth>Yeah, I think the smart home</v>

16:05.640 --> 16:07.560
really ends up being about the experience.

16:07.560 --> 16:11.640
A lot of people don't understand what they might not have

16:11.640 --> 16:12.473
until they have it.

16:12.473 --> 16:13.500
<v ->Exactly.</v>
<v ->Same thing</v>

16:13.500 --> 16:14.580
with a smart television,

16:14.580 --> 16:17.250
you don't know what you don't know until you get one

16:17.250 --> 16:18.480
and then you're wowed by it.

16:18.480 --> 16:22.110
And so a lot of these things are moving to the experience

16:22.110 --> 16:23.850
and then that integration.

16:23.850 --> 16:26.100
There's also a really important play though when we think

16:26.100 --> 16:29.340
about healthcare and accessibility

16:29.340 --> 16:32.280
and just making technology for everybody

16:32.280 --> 16:34.380
and making it very useful.

16:34.380 --> 16:35.790
And so Laura, I would love for you

16:35.790 --> 16:38.310
to share a little bit more about some of the things

16:38.310 --> 16:41.310
that you all are doing with the reality

16:41.310 --> 16:45.090
of devices moving into services

16:45.090 --> 16:47.580
and how they're really helping consumers.

16:47.580 --> 16:51.900
<v ->Yeah, sure, so we serve primarily individuals living</v>

16:51.900 --> 16:54.180
with intellectual and developmental disabilities

16:54.180 --> 16:56.070
as well as older adults.

16:56.070 --> 16:58.380
And our technology is designed

16:58.380 --> 17:02.190
to help create the least restrictive environment possible

17:02.190 --> 17:05.580
so that that individual can attain a certain amount

17:05.580 --> 17:06.510
of independence.

17:06.510 --> 17:08.490
And that can be a different story depending on

17:08.490 --> 17:11.700
where they're, we try to meet them where they're at.

17:11.700 --> 17:14.127
And our technology is just a vehicle to provide that.

17:14.127 --> 17:16.740
And it's really not about the technology,

17:16.740 --> 17:21.090
it's about amplifying existing caregivers to help them

17:21.090 --> 17:25.620
to not only provide remote supports

17:25.620 --> 17:29.550
and care for individuals either in a hybrid model,

17:29.550 --> 17:32.610
I mean, GrandCare is not going to make your bed

17:32.610 --> 17:34.530
or help you shower,

17:34.530 --> 17:38.220
but what GrandCare does do is it can walk you

17:38.220 --> 17:41.460
through your day, it can help break down complicated tasks.

17:41.460 --> 17:44.349
It can say, here's a video on how to shave, here's a video

17:44.349 --> 17:46.950
of you getting ready for work,

17:46.950 --> 17:48.450
here are how to do those things.

17:48.450 --> 17:52.170
And so providing independence one step further to allow

17:52.170 --> 17:57.170
that individual to achieve independence and success.

17:57.660 --> 18:00.000
Meanwhile, remote caregivers

18:00.000 --> 18:04.140
who may have previously been man on man model, right?

18:04.140 --> 18:05.880
And we don't have enough caregivers

18:05.880 --> 18:08.518
and as we limit immigration,

18:08.518 --> 18:10.560
the problem's going to get worse.

18:10.560 --> 18:13.770
So these individuals don't have enough caregivers

18:13.770 --> 18:15.270
and they wanna be independent.

18:15.270 --> 18:16.777
Most people aren't saying,

18:16.777 --> 18:20.100
"I'd really love somebody to be in my home 24/7."

18:20.100 --> 18:24.390
So they want to have as much independence as possible

18:24.390 --> 18:28.160
and using technology, using Zooz, using Lutron, using all

18:28.160 --> 18:33.060
of these technologies together, interoperable of course,

18:33.060 --> 18:36.960
to allow that individual to live their best life.

18:36.960 --> 18:39.720
And of course in the safest way possible. Melissa,

18:39.720 --> 18:41.040
<v Elizabeth>Melissa, did you wanna add anything?</v>

18:41.040 --> 18:44.760
I know you're part of the health tech care foundationally.

18:44.760 --> 18:47.520
<v ->Yeah, so the Consumer Technology Association</v>

18:47.520 --> 18:48.660
has their foundation

18:48.660 --> 18:52.050
and the foundation is based on really helping those

18:52.050 --> 18:55.110
with disabilities and seniors use technology for good,

18:55.110 --> 18:57.690
help them restore those found freedoms

18:57.690 --> 18:58.860
that they may have lost.

18:58.860 --> 19:00.750
And it's been fascinating to me

19:00.750 --> 19:03.930
to hear personal stories from our customers.

19:03.930 --> 19:07.080
Lutron makes motorized window shades, for example,

19:07.080 --> 19:08.250
and we have a device

19:08.250 --> 19:09.990
that you could actually put

19:09.990 --> 19:12.150
on your wheelchair or your scooter.

19:12.150 --> 19:14.940
And I had the good fortune of meeting the family

19:14.940 --> 19:17.550
who both the husband and wife were wheelchair bound

19:17.550 --> 19:21.090
and they said, "We haven't opened our window shades in eight

19:21.090 --> 19:24.060
and a half years because it's difficult for us

19:24.060 --> 19:27.420
to stand up and twist the mini blinds open

19:27.420 --> 19:29.610
and now we have these motorized shades

19:29.610 --> 19:31.170
and we can have sunlight come in."

19:31.170 --> 19:33.540
And just hearing powerful stories like that,

19:33.540 --> 19:34.860
that we all take for granted

19:34.860 --> 19:37.230
and knowing that this concept of technology

19:37.230 --> 19:39.720
for good is helping people to your point,

19:39.720 --> 19:42.390
stay in their homes longer, give them these freedoms.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.190
It's just such a powerful thing to watch.

19:44.190 --> 19:46.320
And I think that's gonna be a really important thing

19:46.320 --> 19:49.230
for 2025 and I'll address that.

19:49.230 --> 19:50.340
I know that's our last question,

19:50.340 --> 19:51.810
but we can talk more about that,

19:51.810 --> 19:53.460
but yeah, I think this whole concept

19:53.460 --> 19:55.830
of just helping people age in place

19:55.830 --> 19:59.430
more efficiently and effectively is just fascinating.

19:59.430 --> 20:01.260
<v ->Well, yeah, and healthcare really is for everybody</v>

20:01.260 --> 20:02.880
and not just the older people.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.400
Everybody can use technology

20:05.400 --> 20:07.410
to understand what's going on with their health

20:07.410 --> 20:09.030
and then leverage other devices

20:09.030 --> 20:11.640
to understand what's going on in their environment.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.350
And that really is what a lot

20:13.350 --> 20:16.830
of the connected home, the IOT space is about.

20:16.830 --> 20:20.070
What is going on in the environment, what are the tools

20:20.070 --> 20:24.900
that I can use to access different content, to access apps.

20:24.900 --> 20:27.630
We know the television is still the centerpiece of the home

20:27.630 --> 20:31.590
and we see the smart home being connected to the TV

20:31.590 --> 20:33.120
and in fact, this is the vision

20:33.120 --> 20:35.790
that Tricia Parks our founder had back

20:35.790 --> 20:37.140
in the eighties, right?

20:37.140 --> 20:40.800
The whole home experience bringing together controls,

20:40.800 --> 20:44.310
security, automation with the largest screen

20:44.310 --> 20:47.100
and intertwining those in the name of the experience.

20:47.100 --> 20:49.950
So, there really is a lot that's grown up

20:49.950 --> 20:53.370
and still we're, might say

20:53.370 --> 20:57.660
that we're in the early stages of this really exploding.

20:57.660 --> 21:00.450
So part of the challenge though in profitability is

21:00.450 --> 21:01.770
that ability to scale.

21:01.770 --> 21:05.400
And so I wanna see if we can just go down very quickly here

21:05.400 --> 21:06.810
and then we'll move to the next topic

21:06.810 --> 21:08.490
of what's your best advice

21:08.490 --> 21:10.170
that you'd give a company who's looking

21:10.170 --> 21:15.170
to scale their hardware or their software services?

21:16.290 --> 21:18.660
<v ->I think fundamentally, I mean you've gotta have a lot</v>

21:18.660 --> 21:21.220
of devices out there, obviously in order to scale any

21:21.220 --> 21:22.770
of these business models,

21:22.770 --> 21:25.923
but you've gotta make it really easy to use,

21:26.757 --> 21:28.680
especially in connected TV,

21:28.680 --> 21:30.870
there's a lot of options for consumers.

21:30.870 --> 21:32.310
If you don't like how your TV works,

21:32.310 --> 21:35.190
you can buy a $20 dongle and plug it in

21:35.190 --> 21:37.320
and it's a completely different experience.

21:37.320 --> 21:40.650
So you have to deliver an experience that consumers trust

21:40.650 --> 21:45.363
and love and connect with over time.

21:46.410 --> 21:49.263
In the absence of that, there's really no way to scale.

21:50.550 --> 21:53.190
<v ->And I think it's also too just about, just to reinforce</v>

21:53.190 --> 21:55.620
what you're saying, just about providing that value,

21:55.620 --> 21:58.830
what is that long-term commitment to the product

21:58.830 --> 22:01.470
and making sure that when you're buying it,

22:01.470 --> 22:02.700
you don't feel like you're gonna have

22:02.700 --> 22:04.620
to replace it every 18 months,

22:04.620 --> 22:07.800
that this company's gonna support your journey

22:07.800 --> 22:09.090
with this product in your home.

22:09.090 --> 22:11.790
So I think it's really about what is that value proposition

22:11.790 --> 22:14.640
to the consumer so that they are committed

22:14.640 --> 22:16.563
to staying with it long term?

22:18.090 --> 22:21.150
<v ->I would add that if you are a small company scaling,</v>

22:21.150 --> 22:24.630
which is essentially what we've been for the past 10 years,

22:24.630 --> 22:26.760
it's important to pay attention

22:26.760 --> 22:28.560
to your channels, who you're trying to reach.

22:28.560 --> 22:31.680
If you're trying to reach consumers, we see more

22:31.680 --> 22:33.510
of them going direct to manufacture

22:33.510 --> 22:36.420
and you're competing with companies that are selling direct.

22:36.420 --> 22:37.830
So Amazon comes to mind,

22:37.830 --> 22:40.980
but then you have to keep in mind that Amazon

22:40.980 --> 22:45.360
is kind of high fee environment right now.

22:45.360 --> 22:48.450
So it's important to build your channels if you're going

22:48.450 --> 22:50.190
to go after the consumer directly.

22:50.190 --> 22:52.140
Think of how you can do that so

22:52.140 --> 22:54.720
that you can control the pricing so that you can control

22:54.720 --> 22:57.243
that after purchase experience.

22:57.243 --> 22:59.430
And then if you're going after professionals,

22:59.430 --> 23:01.500
what we're learning we really need

23:01.500 --> 23:03.300
to start developing relationships

23:03.300 --> 23:04.590
in the distribution channel.

23:04.590 --> 23:07.530
So it's going to be different depending on your strategy,

23:07.530 --> 23:10.290
but that is a key factor of your success,

23:10.290 --> 23:14.010
is how are you going to distribute the product?

23:14.010 --> 23:16.680
So that part of the experience today,

23:16.680 --> 23:18.150
most people buy online,

23:18.150 --> 23:20.880
so that e-commerce factor is very important.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.550
So you need to make sure that you partner with people

23:22.550 --> 23:25.950
or you provide an experience of what people expect today,

23:25.950 --> 23:27.390
which is fast shipment

23:27.390 --> 23:30.603
of exactly what they're trying to buy.

23:31.950 --> 23:34.590
<v ->Full alignment with what the panelists said here.</v>

23:34.590 --> 23:38.070
I mean, the only other thing I'd add on top of it is

23:38.070 --> 23:42.150
leverage partners, leverage ecosystems,

23:42.150 --> 23:43.980
don't reinvent the wheel.

23:43.980 --> 23:46.080
There are plenty of that are out there

23:46.080 --> 23:47.850
that can get you onto the cloud,

23:47.850 --> 23:51.480
can get you into every ecosystem, can help you manufacture,

23:51.480 --> 23:56.010
can help you build your devices, do that as much

23:56.010 --> 23:58.320
as you can so that way you're not redoing

23:58.320 --> 23:59.910
any of the me too stuff.

23:59.910 --> 24:02.310
You're thinking about how do I add unique value?

24:02.310 --> 24:03.420
How do I make it easy?

24:03.420 --> 24:05.190
How do I build out my channel network,

24:05.190 --> 24:07.410
how do I offer that unique thing?

24:07.410 --> 24:11.010
And there's tons of resources out there in the market

24:11.010 --> 24:12.720
to enable y'all to go do that,

24:12.720 --> 24:14.793
so that would be my biggest advice.

24:15.630 --> 24:18.120
<v ->Yes to everything that has already been said.</v>

24:18.120 --> 24:20.010
I would only add as a software company,

24:20.010 --> 24:23.820
interoperability is king because your clients

24:23.820 --> 24:26.580
and consumers and caregivers don't wanna log

24:26.580 --> 24:30.270
into 17 different things in order to set up rules here

24:30.270 --> 24:32.250
and to be notified there.

24:32.250 --> 24:36.600
So really stopping with the proprietary thing

24:36.600 --> 24:41.550
and trying to work with OpenAPI's ability

24:41.550 --> 24:42.840
to work with other people.

24:42.840 --> 24:46.260
I mean, and that's really the winner in this space

24:46.260 --> 24:49.050
from a software standpoint, is going to be somebody

24:49.050 --> 24:52.920
with a dashboard that everybody can access.

24:52.920 --> 24:57.060
Everybody can easily, kind of what Qualcomm was doing

24:57.060 --> 25:00.720
with the two 2net platform maybe like 10 years ago,

25:00.720 --> 25:04.140
but I would say not hardware based, software based

25:04.140 --> 25:07.170
and allowing everyone to work together.

25:07.170 --> 25:08.910
<v ->Great comments on interoperability.</v>

25:08.910 --> 25:11.400
And we do have a session later today

25:11.400 --> 25:13.260
that we'll be addressing that.

25:13.260 --> 25:17.310
Let's talk though about customer engagement and stickiness

25:17.310 --> 25:20.280
and keeping that consumer buying

25:20.280 --> 25:23.910
within the same product ecosystem or buying more.

25:23.910 --> 25:25.410
Travis, what are some of the ways

25:25.410 --> 25:27.660
that you all are measuring engagement

25:27.660 --> 25:31.920
and feeling good about what's happening with your customers?

25:31.920 --> 25:34.560
<v ->Yeah, the fundamental metric that we look at</v>

25:34.560 --> 25:38.700
for our business now, we call ARPU average revenue per user.

25:38.700 --> 25:43.380
So we know on average how much every TV

25:43.380 --> 25:47.730
that's plugged into a wall out there is returning

25:47.730 --> 25:49.500
in terms of revenue.

25:49.500 --> 25:51.473
And that's kind of our metric

25:54.690 --> 25:56.520
that we're constantly monitoring,

25:56.520 --> 25:58.410
but the things that you have to do

25:58.410 --> 26:03.240
to drive that metric all revolve around delivering services

26:03.240 --> 26:07.530
that people want to use over and over and over again.

26:07.530 --> 26:10.200
The majority of our revenue on our platform comes

26:10.200 --> 26:12.600
in the form of advertising revenue.

26:12.600 --> 26:15.120
So it's not necessarily subscription revenue

26:15.120 --> 26:17.940
where someone's paying $20 a month or whatever

26:17.940 --> 26:19.230
and they forget that they're paying it

26:19.230 --> 26:20.850
and you keep billing their credit card.

26:20.850 --> 26:24.210
Like we actually have to have people watching the right kind

26:24.210 --> 26:26.280
of content on our platform day in

26:26.280 --> 26:28.830
and day out in order to move that metric.

26:28.830 --> 26:31.440
So we're obsessed

26:31.440 --> 26:33.960
with the consumer experience on our platform

26:33.960 --> 26:36.903
because it's what drives the business.

26:37.800 --> 26:40.380
<v ->I love that, obsessed with the consumer experience.</v>

26:40.380 --> 26:45.300
That's perfect, any other comments that anybody wants

26:45.300 --> 26:49.080
to make on being able to keep a customer sticky?

26:49.080 --> 26:51.000
Does that mean you're sending them notifications

26:51.000 --> 26:53.100
all the time to remind them to use your service?

26:53.100 --> 26:57.420
Or Melissa, what does that look like at Lutron as far

26:57.420 --> 26:59.490
as customer engagement goes?

26:59.490 --> 27:02.190
<v ->Yeah, so we are also obsessed with customer engagement.</v>

27:02.190 --> 27:03.720
I love that you said that.

27:03.720 --> 27:08.670
Yeah, the customer is the center of our universe.

27:08.670 --> 27:12.000
And so anytime we're developing products,

27:12.000 --> 27:13.410
we're looking back at the feedback

27:13.410 --> 27:15.900
and we're constantly thinking about, okay,

27:15.900 --> 27:17.820
what is the lifecycle of this product?

27:17.820 --> 27:21.420
Lutron's founder Joel Spira, one of the things he was

27:21.420 --> 27:23.190
so passionate about was making sure

27:23.190 --> 27:25.980
that our products were not only functional,

27:25.980 --> 27:26.970
but also beautiful.

27:26.970 --> 27:29.100
And he designed them from the outside in

27:29.100 --> 27:31.770
and his big thing was always about, we wanna make sure

27:31.770 --> 27:35.610
that our products can be used by a 5-year-old,

27:35.610 --> 27:37.830
by a 50-year-old, by a 90-year-old.

27:37.830 --> 27:42.030
And so sometimes our product development cycle

27:42.030 --> 27:43.020
took a little bit longer

27:43.020 --> 27:43.853
because he wanted

27:43.853 --> 27:45.990
to make sure like the tactile feel was correct

27:45.990 --> 27:48.300
and that if you have somebody in your home,

27:48.300 --> 27:50.100
they kind of understand exactly

27:50.100 --> 27:52.500
how the product is gonna work and how it's gonna work well.

27:52.500 --> 27:55.350
So for us it's really about just making sure

27:55.350 --> 27:58.380
that we are listening to our customers,

27:58.380 --> 28:00.840
we're making sure we're pushing out updates appropriately,

28:00.840 --> 28:04.080
and we do stay in touch with our customers via newsletters

28:04.080 --> 28:06.660
and whether it's suggesting different ways to integrate

28:06.660 --> 28:09.390
with our systems and just helping to really enhance

28:09.390 --> 28:10.920
that lifestyle experience.

28:10.920 --> 28:13.320
And again, it's all about solving problems.

28:13.320 --> 28:16.320
So any way that we can help people make life just a little

28:16.320 --> 28:20.100
bit easier through technology, it's a win-win for everybody.

28:20.100 --> 28:21.570
<v ->Okay, great, Agnes,</v>

28:21.570 --> 28:24.900
maybe you can comment a little bit on pricing strategies

28:24.900 --> 28:29.010
and how you think different price points

28:29.010 --> 28:33.660
can attract different types of customers and any suggestions

28:33.660 --> 28:35.070
to the audience as they think

28:35.070 --> 28:38.313
about how they're pricing their services and products.

28:39.150 --> 28:40.680
<v ->That's always a struggle, right?</v>

28:40.680 --> 28:42.030
Setting the right price

28:42.030 --> 28:45.030
and especially if you're working with partners

28:45.030 --> 28:46.950
or you're coming from market to market.

28:46.950 --> 28:48.900
So what we've seen working with,

28:48.900 --> 28:50.280
we also have an e-commerce stores,

28:50.280 --> 28:52.440
we've worked with different brands trying to come

28:52.440 --> 28:53.520
from Europe, for example.

28:53.520 --> 28:55.890
They're very strong in Europe, they're coming to the US

28:55.890 --> 28:58.560
and they set this higher price point

28:58.560 --> 29:01.560
because according to them, once you set a lower price,

29:01.560 --> 29:03.660
you can never lower it again.

29:03.660 --> 29:05.790
Anybody that has lived in the US knows

29:05.790 --> 29:07.620
that you can absolutely lower a price

29:07.620 --> 29:09.840
and you can go very, very low, right?

29:09.840 --> 29:12.450
Especially around the holidays, which is almost always,

29:12.450 --> 29:16.920
so that's why I said it's key to be open, first of all

29:16.920 --> 29:19.770
to have control over pricing as well so we can quickly pivot

29:19.770 --> 29:22.710
and to be open to try different strategies.

29:22.710 --> 29:23.760
What we're seeing a lot,

29:23.760 --> 29:26.640
and especially in the e-commerce sector, is

29:26.640 --> 29:31.530
that sometimes a customer will tolerate a higher price

29:31.530 --> 29:33.570
as long as they don't have to pay for shipping, right?

29:33.570 --> 29:35.550
They hate paying for shipping,

29:35.550 --> 29:37.290
but they don't necessarily realize

29:37.290 --> 29:39.180
that the shipping is not actually free.

29:39.180 --> 29:40.380
It's built into the price.

29:40.380 --> 29:43.590
So we've tried to be more transparent about that

29:43.590 --> 29:46.860
and charge more for shipping and that did not work.

29:46.860 --> 29:49.335
So you have to kind

29:49.335 --> 29:53.250
of watch and learn how customers are reacting to pricing.

29:53.250 --> 29:55.800
But definitely keep in mind that going market to market,

29:55.800 --> 29:58.560
there's different cultures around pricing

29:58.560 --> 30:00.240
and different cultures around commerce.

30:00.240 --> 30:03.600
So if you're planning to scale, either coming from the US

30:03.600 --> 30:05.310
to Europe or to Asia,

30:05.310 --> 30:08.790
there's going to be different local factors that you have

30:08.790 --> 30:09.623
to keep in mind.

30:09.623 --> 30:11.100
And this is where partnering

30:11.100 --> 30:12.930
with the right people comes into play, right?

30:12.930 --> 30:15.030
So talk to people, ask questions,

30:15.030 --> 30:17.460
see what other people are doing

30:17.460 --> 30:21.600
and that's what's going to drive success for you, I think.

30:21.600 --> 30:22.830
<v ->Okay, great comments.</v>

30:22.830 --> 30:24.480
Let's switch and talk a little bit

30:24.480 --> 30:27.630
about the cloud and the edge, right?

30:27.630 --> 30:31.230
All these hardware products have a lot of data now

30:31.230 --> 30:35.310
that's being collected behind the scenes, incredible amounts

30:35.310 --> 30:37.500
of data, probably people don't even know what to do with

30:37.500 --> 30:40.380
so much data, data everywhere.

30:40.380 --> 30:43.260
And this idea of data moving into the cloud

30:43.260 --> 30:46.710
or data staying on the edge of the hardware.

30:46.710 --> 30:50.942
Jake, I wanna see if you can address this for us.

30:50.942 --> 30:55.942
Where's the world going and why does the cloud matter

30:56.310 --> 30:58.710
and what should companies be careful

30:58.710 --> 31:03.150
with when they're thinking about the cloud versus the edge?

31:03.150 --> 31:04.830
<v ->So thank you.</v>

31:04.830 --> 31:09.830
Big picture, all this cloud to edge stuff means is

31:09.900 --> 31:12.210
adding more decision making capability

31:12.210 --> 31:16.620
and more functionality at the device level versus having

31:16.620 --> 31:20.430
to do that processing in a centralized set

31:20.430 --> 31:22.740
of cloud servers that are out there.

31:22.740 --> 31:26.400
And that's really, really exciting,

31:26.400 --> 31:29.340
not only for, we already talked a little bit about some

31:29.340 --> 31:31.020
of the personalized experiences

31:31.020 --> 31:33.810
and the new use cases that you can bring,

31:33.810 --> 31:35.640
but it does address some of the things

31:35.640 --> 31:37.950
that you brought up even in the question, right?

31:37.950 --> 31:40.410
A lot of folks are worried about, "Hey,

31:40.410 --> 31:42.600
I'm talking about something in my kitchen

31:42.600 --> 31:44.700
and I get an ad on Facebook for that

31:44.700 --> 31:47.880
because my phone overheard it," right?

31:47.880 --> 31:52.053
People are worried about their own data, their own privacy,

31:52.920 --> 31:54.180
doing more AI.

31:54.180 --> 31:56.160
All AI does is it gives you the ability

31:56.160 --> 31:59.190
to do more stuff without having to go to the cloud

31:59.190 --> 32:02.370
that gives users not only new use cases

32:02.370 --> 32:03.750
and more personalized experiences,

32:03.750 --> 32:07.890
but it keeps the data in their own area.

32:07.890 --> 32:11.610
It prevents them from the whole house shutting down

32:11.610 --> 32:14.010
when your broadband goes out, right?

32:14.010 --> 32:16.080
And then for this is all about profit

32:16.080 --> 32:17.433
for the device makers.

32:18.750 --> 32:20.940
People fail to realize and they do

32:20.940 --> 32:22.320
after they start deploying it,

32:22.320 --> 32:25.860
we've put AI into a lot of our edge node products

32:25.860 --> 32:27.120
for the last couple years now.

32:27.120 --> 32:28.140
So we're starting to see a lot

32:28.140 --> 32:29.940
of these use cases go into production.

32:29.940 --> 32:32.700
They're also seeing lower costs on their end, right?

32:32.700 --> 32:35.580
Where yeah, they can get that data to go see

32:35.580 --> 32:37.770
how things are being used so that way they can figure out

32:37.770 --> 32:40.260
how to build better experiences and better products.

32:40.260 --> 32:43.140
But they don't have to spend as much money on cloud storage,

32:43.140 --> 32:45.390
they don't have to worry about latencies,

32:45.390 --> 32:50.390
they don't have to bear a lot of that cost

32:50.730 --> 32:53.670
and support that's required to go navigate those things.

32:53.670 --> 32:58.350
So there's real cost benefits for companies

32:58.350 --> 33:00.390
that actually implement it to their bottom line

33:00.390 --> 33:03.060
for that kind of, not front end use case,

33:03.060 --> 33:05.520
but kind of backend support area.

33:05.520 --> 33:09.000
But there's real benefits in terms of privacy,

33:09.000 --> 33:13.170
in terms of resiliency from networks going out,

33:13.170 --> 33:16.140
in terms of personalized experiences and and and.

33:16.140 --> 33:17.520
And we're just at the beginning of this,

33:17.520 --> 33:19.770
it's gonna be really, really exciting

33:19.770 --> 33:21.900
to see how it all plays out.

33:21.900 --> 33:24.090
<v ->Great Comments, does anybody else wanna comment</v>

33:24.090 --> 33:27.420
on cloud versus edge?

33:27.420 --> 33:28.833
Anybody? Okay.

33:30.030 --> 33:32.130
Let's talk a little bit more

33:32.130 --> 33:35.520
about the service platform

33:35.520 --> 33:40.520
and the idea that you end up having a platform with a spoke,

33:40.560 --> 33:42.690
whether it be devices or content,

33:42.690 --> 33:46.020
you have something that is an enabler

33:46.020 --> 33:50.100
of connections of revenue, of new applications.

33:50.100 --> 33:51.420
And so Travis,

33:51.420 --> 33:55.380
can you explain a little bit more about the Vizio platform

33:55.380 --> 33:59.340
and in the future beyond just the content side,

33:59.340 --> 34:03.180
you mentioned all of the advertising dollars,

34:03.180 --> 34:05.670
what else is coming next?

34:05.670 --> 34:08.130
<v ->Yeah, fundamentally right now most</v>

34:08.130 --> 34:09.090
of our revenue comes

34:09.090 --> 34:12.870
from helping our viewers find content through advertising.

34:12.870 --> 34:15.633
So Disney Plus is promoting content, whatever,

34:16.470 --> 34:21.000
or things that look like TV ads within content,

34:21.000 --> 34:23.820
a company trying to sell a product.

34:23.820 --> 34:28.620
But we will continue to focus on those areas,

34:28.620 --> 34:32.550
but we do see a huge opportunity with the TV being kind

34:32.550 --> 34:35.340
of the center of the connected home,

34:35.340 --> 34:36.780
the biggest screen in the house

34:36.780 --> 34:39.090
and connecting the TV

34:39.090 --> 34:41.970
with all the other devices around the house.

34:41.970 --> 34:45.900
We haven't made a tremendous amount of progress there yet,

34:45.900 --> 34:48.360
but it's definitely a focus area for us.

34:48.360 --> 34:51.060
And I think it's a, people have this like connection

34:51.060 --> 34:52.320
with their living room TV

34:52.320 --> 34:56.220
and we really do believe that it can become a hub

34:56.220 --> 34:57.573
for the smart home.

34:58.560 --> 35:00.810
<v ->And we believe that too at Parks Associates.</v>

35:00.810 --> 35:02.790
So we think you're on the right track there.

35:02.790 --> 35:05.550
And I mean, if you're watching Roku, right?

35:05.550 --> 35:07.590
Roku is a streaming media device

35:07.590 --> 35:11.730
and they have a home security system at Walmart.

35:11.730 --> 35:15.510
So the television as the main screen can do a lot

35:15.510 --> 35:18.480
of different things, including on the health side

35:18.480 --> 35:20.790
and the ability to communicate with people

35:20.790 --> 35:24.270
through the television in an interactive way.

35:24.270 --> 35:28.050
Laura, let's shift over to you a little bit

35:28.050 --> 35:31.080
and see if you can share more about the platform view

35:31.080 --> 35:34.800
and why this is so important in the business that you're in

35:34.800 --> 35:37.950
of helping people manage their homes,

35:37.950 --> 35:41.700
especially if they have certain disabilities

35:41.700 --> 35:45.840
or inabilities to do various things.

35:45.840 --> 35:48.570
<v ->Well I think the idea is utilizing technology</v>

35:48.570 --> 35:51.720
to not only meet them where they're at,

35:51.720 --> 35:54.240
but make it so that they don't have to do anything in order

35:54.240 --> 35:55.850
to engage with it.

35:55.850 --> 35:59.760
20 years ago when we started GrandCare, it was all about,

35:59.760 --> 36:01.320
we had some competitors

36:01.320 --> 36:03.210
that were just doing the connected home,

36:03.210 --> 36:06.360
that were just doing monitoring and telehealth,

36:06.360 --> 36:07.193
things like that.

36:07.193 --> 36:08.760
And tho those are things we do as well,

36:08.760 --> 36:10.950
but we thought it was so important

36:10.950 --> 36:14.220
that we didn't just serve them a big plate of vegetables,

36:14.220 --> 36:16.620
that there was something in it for them.

36:16.620 --> 36:19.020
And so that speaking to the stickiness

36:19.020 --> 36:23.910
that they would have keep coming to the TV, the touchscreen,

36:23.910 --> 36:26.340
whatever it is, and not only would it help them

36:26.340 --> 36:28.380
with their activities of daily living,

36:28.380 --> 36:31.920
but there would also be engaging content on there for them.

36:31.920 --> 36:34.800
Some of the individuals that we serve right now

36:34.800 --> 36:37.350
for some reason or another may not have access

36:37.350 --> 36:38.850
to smart devices.

36:38.850 --> 36:42.690
And so in using technology,

36:42.690 --> 36:47.690
you can provide a safer environment for them to engage

36:47.850 --> 36:50.850
with maybe YouTube video on trains

36:50.850 --> 36:53.520
or maybe they love "M*A*S*H"

36:53.520 --> 36:55.230
or "Little House on the Prairie",

36:55.230 --> 36:58.080
but they don't have access to a smart connected device

36:58.080 --> 37:00.360
to engage with those things.

37:00.360 --> 37:03.240
So I think there's using technology

37:03.240 --> 37:04.980
and our system is a little different

37:04.980 --> 37:07.980
because we have to not only serve the end user,

37:07.980 --> 37:10.650
which is the individual that is being cared for,

37:10.650 --> 37:13.470
but also the caregiver that is providing that care.

37:13.470 --> 37:17.580
So the stickiness and everything comes in two points.

37:17.580 --> 37:20.130
One is the make sure it's easy for the caregiver

37:20.130 --> 37:22.410
to monitor and set up and do all those things,

37:22.410 --> 37:24.690
but most importantly that the user is engaged

37:24.690 --> 37:26.940
and they want to use the technology.

37:26.940 --> 37:28.980
<v ->Okay, great comments, thank you for that.</v>

37:28.980 --> 37:31.470
I wanna end, we just have a few minutes left.

37:31.470 --> 37:34.140
I do wanna talk a little bit about interoperability.

37:34.140 --> 37:36.810
We know Matter has promised a lot

37:36.810 --> 37:39.000
and made a lot of progress,

37:39.000 --> 37:42.930
but differentiation is still critical for companies

37:42.930 --> 37:44.190
to stand out in the market.

37:44.190 --> 37:48.040
And so Jake, I wanna see if you can comment on

37:49.151 --> 37:51.660
what's different about today's standards

37:51.660 --> 37:53.760
and then Melissa, we'll go to you next,

37:53.760 --> 37:55.500
and then Agnes as well.

37:55.500 --> 37:57.060
<v ->So for those of you that don't know,</v>

37:57.060 --> 37:59.670
Matter is a technology that is set

37:59.670 --> 38:02.880
to enable interoperability between IOT edge nodes

38:02.880 --> 38:06.240
and interoperability between different app ecosystems.

38:06.240 --> 38:09.330
So theoretically you buy one device, you use that device,

38:09.330 --> 38:13.200
you can use any app you want, you can have that talk

38:13.200 --> 38:16.740
to other devices so long as they're Matter compatible.

38:16.740 --> 38:18.510
What's really exciting about this

38:18.510 --> 38:21.180
and what's different now is the momentum

38:21.180 --> 38:24.150
and the buy-in that this has from the industry

38:24.150 --> 38:27.180
and it being proven out, like it takes a long time

38:27.180 --> 38:30.663
to build out a wireless technology and a wireless ecosystem.

38:32.040 --> 38:33.870
It's not perfect from day one,

38:33.870 --> 38:38.490
but this has the backing of the biggest cloud companies.

38:38.490 --> 38:39.960
It has the biggest backing

38:39.960 --> 38:44.880
of a lot of the broadband operators in US and Europe

38:44.880 --> 38:46.740
and it's starting to come into Asia and all that.

38:46.740 --> 38:49.770
So that means it's going to come

38:49.770 --> 38:50.940
and it's going to evolve

38:50.940 --> 38:53.937
and a lot of people get bent outta shape of,

38:53.937 --> 38:57.750
"Oh my God, well I'm not gonna have value

38:57.750 --> 38:59.940
by having my own proprietary protocol

38:59.940 --> 39:03.480
or having my own specialized ecosystem."

39:03.480 --> 39:06.450
Well it's the wrong way to look at it in my opinion, right?

39:06.450 --> 39:10.200
This thing offers a massive amount of benefits

39:10.200 --> 39:13.230
of problems that you don't have to solve anymore in terms

39:13.230 --> 39:15.900
of device security, in terms of attestation, in terms

39:15.900 --> 39:17.640
of how do you get everything to work on.

39:17.640 --> 39:20.760
So that frees the market

39:20.760 --> 39:23.310
to do unique and creative things,

39:23.310 --> 39:25.950
to focus on all the things we've been talking

39:25.950 --> 39:28.650
about on this panel about why,

39:28.650 --> 39:31.290
how do people become successful in this space?

39:31.290 --> 39:34.830
So in my opinion, the folks that are gonna be successful

39:34.830 --> 39:36.150
here are gonna be the ones

39:36.150 --> 39:39.300
that take advantage of the benefits

39:39.300 --> 39:40.890
that these things provide

39:40.890 --> 39:45.030
and then build on top of it their own capabilities,

39:45.030 --> 39:49.770
their own experience to really add value to consumers

39:49.770 --> 39:52.230
and to help them build their system

39:52.230 --> 39:55.470
from one or two devices they might buy at Walmart

39:55.470 --> 39:58.440
to go add a full set of lights or a full set

39:58.440 --> 40:00.840
of locks or cameras or switches.

40:00.840 --> 40:03.330
<v ->Yep, okay, great comments there.</v>

40:03.330 --> 40:05.280
Melissa, did you wanna add anything to that?

40:05.280 --> 40:08.130
<v ->Yeah, sure, so Lutron is very supportive</v>

40:08.130 --> 40:10.770
of the Matter movement and it makes a lot

40:10.770 --> 40:13.770
of sense in helping people advance their smart home journey.

40:14.760 --> 40:16.980
Today, we are actually on the Board

40:16.980 --> 40:19.320
of the Connected Standards Alliance who's helping

40:19.320 --> 40:21.210
to bring Matter to the masses.

40:21.210 --> 40:24.060
We do not have any Matter compliant products today

40:24.060 --> 40:28.180
because we actually do have a proprietary RF technology

40:29.070 --> 40:30.450
that we call Clear Connect.

40:30.450 --> 40:33.300
And we today have what is known

40:33.300 --> 40:36.270
as the most connected smart lighting control system

40:36.270 --> 40:37.103
on the market.

40:37.103 --> 40:40.650
So for now, we don't have to use Matter at the moment,

40:40.650 --> 40:44.340
but again, as I said earlier, we are customer obsessed

40:44.340 --> 40:46.440
and if our customers are asking for it,

40:46.440 --> 40:48.510
then that's something we're gonna address down the road.

40:48.510 --> 40:52.230
But there's definitely room for both Matter

40:52.230 --> 40:55.110
and proprietary in the market, I believe so.

40:55.110 --> 40:57.990
<v ->Okay, Agnes, you have a quick comment?</v>

40:57.990 --> 41:00.540
<v ->Yeah, I have so much to say about this.</v>

41:00.540 --> 41:03.300
This is something that's close to my heart

41:03.300 --> 41:05.340
because I come from the trenches of that, right?

41:05.340 --> 41:08.490
And every single day we have to answer why this doesn't work

41:08.490 --> 41:12.330
with that and we use Z-Wave, which is actually something

41:12.330 --> 41:14.940
that not in theory, thank you for being transparent, Jake,

41:14.940 --> 41:16.470
that theoretically this should happen

41:16.470 --> 41:21.090
with Matter, in reality, Z-Wave has had QR scanning

41:21.090 --> 41:23.520
and adding devices easily just based

41:23.520 --> 41:24.690
on the technology, right?

41:24.690 --> 41:27.240
So you can add a Z-Wave device to any Z-Wave hub

41:27.240 --> 41:29.010
and it will work, not only that,

41:29.010 --> 41:31.020
it has standardized command classes.

41:31.020 --> 41:33.720
So that means that you can do much, much more today

41:33.720 --> 41:35.160
with Z-Wave can do with Matter.

41:35.160 --> 41:37.860
That's today obviously, but that's the protocol that we use

41:37.860 --> 41:41.460
and we find that it's much easier for us as a manufacturer

41:41.460 --> 41:43.860
to have that because we don't have to figure out

41:43.860 --> 41:48.030
so many different things around just creating a device

41:48.030 --> 41:51.180
that will say A, B and C, motion detection, I don't know,

41:51.180 --> 41:53.520
temperature detection, anything like that.

41:53.520 --> 41:55.530
It's already built into the protocol,

41:55.530 --> 42:00.375
but still we need to do a lot to make sure that the devices

42:00.375 --> 42:03.660
that we make display correctly on many different platforms.

42:03.660 --> 42:06.990
So if I release a motion sensor today,

42:06.990 --> 42:09.330
I release 20 or 30 products

42:09.330 --> 42:11.700
because that motion sensor will display differently

42:11.700 --> 42:13.740
on smart things, that motion sensor will display

42:13.740 --> 42:14.970
differently on home assistant.

42:14.970 --> 42:16.950
And that means I need to go and work

42:16.950 --> 42:20.070
with every single platform on that experience.

42:20.070 --> 42:22.320
So that's why there's a lot of work to do,

42:22.320 --> 42:25.380
whether you're choosing Matter, Z-Wave, or any protocol,

42:25.380 --> 42:27.940
the key for us is to focus on improving those

42:29.077 --> 42:30.510
experiences and not expect people

42:30.510 --> 42:32.700
to choose one platform and stick with it.

42:32.700 --> 42:33.870
There's not gonna be a winner,

42:33.870 --> 42:37.320
although home assistant is pretty much killing it.

42:37.320 --> 42:39.210
There's going to be different platforms out there

42:39.210 --> 42:40.650
and we need as manufacturers

42:40.650 --> 42:42.300
and as companies in the industry need

42:42.300 --> 42:44.343
to do the hard work of integration.

42:45.270 --> 42:46.440
<v ->Okay, great comments there.</v>

42:46.440 --> 42:47.720
And ultimately all

42:47.720 --> 42:52.590
of this technology is creating more options for consumers.

42:52.590 --> 42:54.630
The smart home, moving into the mass market.

42:54.630 --> 42:57.840
I was a little upset to see a headline that called

42:57.840 --> 42:59.700
the Smart Home gadgets again,

42:59.700 --> 43:02.190
'cause I thought we had passed that stage,

43:02.190 --> 43:03.810
but I just saw it last week.

43:03.810 --> 43:06.210
We don't think we're talking about gadgets anymore.

43:06.210 --> 43:09.930
We really believe we're talking about lifestyles,

43:09.930 --> 43:11.640
we're talking about people's family.

43:11.640 --> 43:14.250
We're talking about people's health, their safety,

43:14.250 --> 43:16.560
their security, their lighting,

43:16.560 --> 43:18.510
their entertainment preferences.

43:18.510 --> 43:21.810
All of these things are built on the foundation

43:21.810 --> 43:25.200
of the internet, connectivity, and the integration

43:25.200 --> 43:29.790
and convergence among many, many ecosystems in the home,

43:29.790 --> 43:31.680
markets that equal billions

43:31.680 --> 43:33.720
and billions and billions of dollars.

43:33.720 --> 43:37.230
So the smart home is not a gadget at all.

43:37.230 --> 43:41.040
And I would like to thank our speakers

43:41.040 --> 43:42.900
for their great comments today.

43:42.900 --> 43:46.080
If you would please give them a round of applause.

43:46.080 --> 43:51.080
Thank you all for being here.
(audience clapping)

43:51.263 --> 43:53.930
(upbeat music)
