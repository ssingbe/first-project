1
00:00.100 --> 00:02.683
(upbeat music)

2
00:10.544 --> 00:12.480
<v ->Hi, everyone.</v>

3
00:12.480 --> 00:14.790
I hope you're all enjoying your time at CES so far.

4
00:14.790 --> 00:16.440
I know I am.

5
00:16.440 --> 00:17.640
My name is Cassie McGrath.

6
00:17.640 --> 00:19.260
I'm a reporter with "Healthcare Brew",

7
00:19.260 --> 00:21.210
and I'll have our panelists

8
00:21.210 --> 00:22.740
introduce themselves in a moment.

9
00:22.740 --> 00:23.760
We're going to be talking about

10
00:23.760 --> 00:25.510
regenerative medicine this morning.

11
00:26.760 --> 00:28.980
<v ->Hi, everyone, my name's Jason Haider.</v>

12
00:28.980 --> 00:31.770
I'm the founder and CEO of Xenco Medical.

13
00:31.770 --> 00:35.760
We are a orthopedic and spinal technology company.

14
00:35.760 --> 00:39.990
We have a wide portfolio of technologies

15
00:39.990 --> 00:43.890
ranging from preoperative planning software

16
00:43.890 --> 00:46.080
to postoperative monitoring software

17
00:46.080 --> 00:47.640
to biomimetic implants.

18
00:47.640 --> 00:49.830
And I'm very excited to talk about

19
00:49.830 --> 00:51.900
regenerative medicine with you all today.

20
00:51.900 --> 00:53.580
<v Cassie>Thank you.</v>

21
00:53.580 --> 00:55.200
<v ->Yes, hi, everybody.</v>

22
00:55.200 --> 00:56.610
I'm Veerle Dhaenens.

23
00:56.610 --> 01:00.000
I'm the general manager for global therapy innovation

24
01:00.000 --> 01:02.340
at Terumo Blood and Cell Technologies.

25
01:02.340 --> 01:03.630
At our company,

26
01:03.630 --> 01:06.420
we believe in the power of blood and cells

27
01:06.420 --> 01:08.520
to bring better treatment

28
01:08.520 --> 01:10.920
and better outcomes for patients.

29
01:10.920 --> 01:14.730
In fact, we see blood and cells as having healing power,

30
01:14.730 --> 01:16.710
and this is going close together

31
01:16.710 --> 01:18.060
with the topic of today

32
01:18.060 --> 01:20.640
in speaking about regenerative medicine.

33
01:20.640 --> 01:21.810
Looking forward to it.

34
01:21.810 --> 01:23.430
<v ->Awesome, thank you both.</v>

35
01:23.430 --> 01:25.290
So, as an upcoming form of medicine,

36
01:25.290 --> 01:27.120
I thought the best place to get started would be

37
01:27.120 --> 01:29.100
if you can both provide an overview

38
01:29.100 --> 01:31.950
of the current state of regenerative medicine.

39
01:31.950 --> 01:34.923
What are the key trends in development shaping the field?

40
01:36.810 --> 01:41.220
<v ->Well, I think that we're in a 1965 moment,</v>

41
01:41.220 --> 01:42.900
and I'm very excited about that.

42
01:42.900 --> 01:44.880
And what I mean by that is,

43
01:44.880 --> 01:46.530
and I'm sure a lot of you

44
01:46.530 --> 01:49.500
are very familiar with Moore's Law.

45
01:49.500 --> 01:53.070
1965 was a year that Gordon Moore

46
01:53.070 --> 01:55.920
published Moore's Law, famously.

47
01:55.920 --> 01:59.130
And he correctly anticipated

48
01:59.130 --> 02:02.280
the exponential growth in computing power,

49
02:02.280 --> 02:06.300
the doubling of the number of transistors per microchip

50
02:06.300 --> 02:07.980
every two years.

51
02:07.980 --> 02:09.570
And what it did was,

52
02:09.570 --> 02:12.810
it not only spawned the microchip revolution,

53
02:12.810 --> 02:15.150
but it spawned all these other industries

54
02:15.150 --> 02:16.410
that have changed our world,

55
02:16.410 --> 02:18.130
from the internet industry

56
02:19.110 --> 02:21.690
to the personal computing industry to AI

57
02:21.690 --> 02:23.610
that we're seeing today.

58
02:23.610 --> 02:26.340
And I think that the thing that was important

59
02:26.340 --> 02:29.040
about that microchip revolution

60
02:29.040 --> 02:33.150
was that it was a convergence of multiple disparate fields

61
02:33.150 --> 02:36.870
that had to reach a certain level of sophistication

62
02:36.870 --> 02:41.040
in order to realize that kind of exponential growth.

63
02:41.040 --> 02:43.050
And regenerative medicine,

64
02:43.050 --> 02:45.390
I think, is at that point in 2025.

65
02:45.390 --> 02:48.660
So, 50 years from now, when we look back,

66
02:48.660 --> 02:53.660
we're gonna see that 3D printing from 1984 to today

67
02:54.060 --> 02:56.310
has grown by leaps and bounds.

68
02:56.310 --> 03:00.030
When you look at gene editing just starting in 1973

69
03:00.030 --> 03:03.720
with recombinant DNA, Herb Boyer, Stanley Cohen,

70
03:03.720 --> 03:05.070
and you see where we are today,

71
03:05.070 --> 03:06.780
that's another industry

72
03:06.780 --> 03:10.590
that's reached immense sophistication.

73
03:10.590 --> 03:13.110
You look at protein folding theory.

74
03:13.110 --> 03:17.460
Now, AlphaFold is doing Christian Anfinsen's work

75
03:17.460 --> 03:19.230
on its own.

76
03:19.230 --> 03:24.030
If you look at in silico trials,

77
03:24.030 --> 03:26.430
AI has enabled

78
03:26.430 --> 03:29.970
not only computational and modeling techniques,

79
03:29.970 --> 03:33.240
but it could transform regenerative medicine

80
03:33.240 --> 03:35.910
in the sense that it will dissolve BEAR's entry.

81
03:35.910 --> 03:39.060
So, I think that the state of regenerative medicine

82
03:39.060 --> 03:41.340
is at an inflection point.

83
03:41.340 --> 03:43.860
I think that it's a 1965 moment

84
03:43.860 --> 03:46.650
and we're going to see all these disparate fields

85
03:46.650 --> 03:50.310
coming together to create a new reality for all of us.

86
03:50.310 --> 03:51.750
<v ->Exciting, thank you.</v>

87
03:51.750 --> 03:53.100
<v ->Yeah, I agree to that.</v>

88
03:53.100 --> 03:56.790
In fact, it has an immense potential to redefine

89
03:56.790 --> 04:01.110
how we cure or how we treat and even cure diseases,

90
04:01.110 --> 04:03.000
and very complex diseases.

91
04:03.000 --> 04:05.520
And I see a lot of advancements happening

92
04:05.520 --> 04:08.463
in stem cell research,

93
04:10.619 --> 04:13.650
in cell and gene therapy in general.

94
04:13.650 --> 04:15.000
Just in December,

95
04:15.000 --> 04:19.170
the FDA approved the first mesenchymal stem cell therapy

96
04:19.170 --> 04:20.003
to treat

97
04:21.090 --> 04:23.820
steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease

98
04:23.820 --> 04:24.660
in children.

99
04:24.660 --> 04:28.980
So, this is an immense path forward.

100
04:28.980 --> 04:31.350
We also see a lot of research ongoing,

101
04:31.350 --> 04:33.750
and we discussed about it in iPSCs.

102
04:33.750 --> 04:36.810
And iPSCs, the beauty is that those cells

103
04:36.810 --> 04:39.930
can be programmed in any type of cell,

104
04:39.930 --> 04:42.180
and that gives the potential to treat

105
04:42.180 --> 04:46.620
diabetes, Parkinson's, cardiac conditions.

106
04:46.620 --> 04:48.690
So, lots of good things happening.

107
04:48.690 --> 04:51.900
Also, more known, the CAR T space,

108
04:51.900 --> 04:55.260
so the engineered immune cells to treat cancers

109
04:55.260 --> 04:57.360
going into other disease areas,

110
04:57.360 --> 04:59.880
like immune diseases, gene therapies.

111
04:59.880 --> 05:03.000
So, in fact, personalized medicine becomes reality.

112
05:03.000 --> 05:04.623
It's not only an aspiration.

113
05:06.090 --> 05:08.070
AI will help.

114
05:08.070 --> 05:11.910
It can predict the behavior of the cell.

115
05:11.910 --> 05:13.560
But there is also challenges,

116
05:13.560 --> 05:17.130
and the challenges are the accessibility,

117
05:17.130 --> 05:18.750
the affordability of the treatment.

118
05:18.750 --> 05:21.720
And that's where there are a lot of efforts ongoing

119
05:21.720 --> 05:24.660
to make those productions and manufacturing processes

120
05:24.660 --> 05:27.090
more scalable, more cost effective.

121
05:27.090 --> 05:30.000
And this is going to have a tremendous impact

122
05:30.000 --> 05:34.110
on bringing those transformative therapies to the patients.

123
05:34.110 --> 05:34.950
<v ->Yeah, great!</v>

124
05:34.950 --> 05:36.210
Thank you both.

125
05:36.210 --> 05:38.130
So, with that update on the field,

126
05:38.130 --> 05:40.440
can you each share what your companies

127
05:40.440 --> 05:42.960
are focusing on in regenerative medicine

128
05:42.960 --> 05:45.150
and if possible, have any patient stories,

129
05:45.150 --> 05:46.770
real-life examples come to mind

130
05:46.770 --> 05:48.920
that illustrate the work that you're doing?

131
05:50.190 --> 05:53.280
<v ->Well, what we're focusing on is two things.</v>

132
05:53.280 --> 05:57.000
We're trying to cascade regeneration

133
05:57.000 --> 05:59.373
and we're trying to calibrate regeneration.

134
06:00.960 --> 06:03.240
In terms of cascading regeneration,

135
06:03.240 --> 06:04.800
what we've done is, last year,

136
06:04.800 --> 06:08.730
we commercialized a product called the TrabeculeX Continuum.

137
06:08.730 --> 06:11.820
And what that entails is two separate technologies.

138
06:11.820 --> 06:16.020
One is a biomaterial designed to promote bone growth,

139
06:16.020 --> 06:19.410
and that's delivered in the operating room.

140
06:19.410 --> 06:23.280
The second is an AI-enabled physical therapy platform

141
06:23.280 --> 06:26.610
that's designed to harness the principles

142
06:26.610 --> 06:28.260
of mechanotransduction,

143
06:28.260 --> 06:30.300
which, some of you may know,

144
06:30.300 --> 06:32.430
all of our cells are mechanosensitive.

145
06:32.430 --> 06:35.370
So, the forces and stresses that you apply

146
06:35.370 --> 06:38.280
will translate into biochemical signals

147
06:38.280 --> 06:39.780
releasing growth factors

148
06:39.780 --> 06:42.840
and amplifying the impact of the biomaterial.

149
06:42.840 --> 06:45.450
So, we definitely thought that there was a lack

150
06:45.450 --> 06:47.820
of longitudinal interventions,

151
06:47.820 --> 06:50.670
and that's why we wanted to cascade regeneration,

152
06:50.670 --> 06:52.830
starting with the intraoperative phase,

153
06:52.830 --> 06:55.530
continuing on to the postoperative phase.

154
06:55.530 --> 06:57.600
And we found tremendous success in that.

155
06:57.600 --> 07:01.830
We're measuring the Orebro musculoskeletal pain scores

156
07:01.830 --> 07:03.780
of the patients who've been treated so far.

157
07:03.780 --> 07:08.193
We found a 17% reduction in severe pain self-reporting.

158
07:09.180 --> 07:11.070
The next thing we're working on is something

159
07:11.070 --> 07:12.780
we'll submit to the FDA this year,

160
07:12.780 --> 07:15.960
and that's our attempt to calibrate regeneration.

161
07:15.960 --> 07:20.960
Veerle mentioned the holy grail of true patient specificity,

162
07:21.210 --> 07:25.770
but until we get to that ultimate gold standard,

163
07:25.770 --> 07:29.220
what we're trying to do is empower our surgeons

164
07:29.220 --> 07:32.400
to be able to tailor these interventions

165
07:32.400 --> 07:35.493
in a more appropriate way for each patient.

166
07:36.870 --> 07:39.840
One of the biggest challenges in our space

167
07:39.840 --> 07:44.550
is the variety of bone mineral density profiles of patients.

168
07:44.550 --> 07:46.410
And what happens is,

169
07:46.410 --> 07:49.320
surgeons will choose a certain implant,

170
07:49.320 --> 07:51.480
and then, in the operating theater,

171
07:51.480 --> 07:55.680
they'll choose some kind of mix of biomaterials

172
07:55.680 --> 07:59.880
to incorporate into the cavity that's in the implant.

173
07:59.880 --> 08:02.430
But it's not a precise science,

174
08:02.430 --> 08:06.360
and that's why you have this variability in fusion rates.

175
08:06.360 --> 08:08.760
So, what we're doing is a twofold process.

176
08:08.760 --> 08:13.760
One is 3D printing a titanium inner body.

177
08:13.830 --> 08:17.070
And so, we're matching the bone density profiles,

178
08:17.070 --> 08:18.660
changing the lattice structure

179
08:18.660 --> 08:21.210
so that patients who are osteoporotic

180
08:21.210 --> 08:23.760
have a different lattice structure, osteopenic,

181
08:23.760 --> 08:27.180
and patients with regular bone mineral density profiles

182
08:27.180 --> 08:29.850
have a more stiff implant

183
08:29.850 --> 08:32.370
so that you can prevent adjacent segment disease,

184
08:32.370 --> 08:35.070
so that the forces are applied properly.

185
08:35.070 --> 08:39.030
And then, what we're doing is we wanna harness bioprinting.

186
08:39.030 --> 08:41.700
We've had success using a hydrogel

187
08:41.700 --> 08:43.800
that will serve as a carrier,

188
08:43.800 --> 08:47.760
and that hydrogel is carrying demineralized bone matrix.

189
08:47.760 --> 08:51.150
And demineralized bone matrix includes growth factors,

190
08:51.150 --> 08:56.010
and that's usually incorporated in the operating theater.

191
08:56.010 --> 09:00.693
The problem with biomaterials is that if you use too many,

192
09:02.460 --> 09:06.180
the patient could result in ectopic bone formation,

193
09:06.180 --> 09:07.410
and that's bone growth

194
09:07.410 --> 09:09.333
where you don't necessarily want it.

195
09:10.170 --> 09:13.350
But by using the power of bioprinting

196
09:13.350 --> 09:15.150
and calibrating regeneration,

197
09:15.150 --> 09:19.440
we can offer surgeons a spectrum of implants

198
09:19.440 --> 09:22.140
that are not only different in their density,

199
09:22.140 --> 09:24.390
but they're different in the amount of growth factors

200
09:24.390 --> 09:25.290
that they each provide.

201
09:25.290 --> 09:28.140
And so, we're hoping that that kind of calibration

202
09:28.140 --> 09:30.600
empowers surgeons to have better outcomes,

203
09:30.600 --> 09:33.060
more predictable outcomes

204
09:33.060 --> 09:34.980
until we get to the true holy grail

205
09:34.980 --> 09:37.410
of patient-specific medicine.

206
09:37.410 --> 09:38.700
<v ->Wow, fascinating, thank you.</v>

207
09:38.700 --> 09:39.960
Right.

208
09:39.960 --> 09:43.590
<v ->Yeah, and Cassie, you asked for a patient story.</v>

209
09:43.590 --> 09:45.450
I want to talk about Julius,

210
09:45.450 --> 09:50.450
and he had 50% of his body burned.

211
09:52.260 --> 09:55.560
And then, there is not a lot you can do as a doctor.

212
09:55.560 --> 10:00.560
Now, with our automated cell expansion system

213
10:01.740 --> 10:05.073
and a small sample of skin of Julius,

214
10:06.090 --> 10:08.610
a biotech company was able

215
10:08.610 --> 10:11.490
to manufacture bioengineered skin.

216
10:11.490 --> 10:14.283
And now, Julius is having a normal life.

217
10:15.180 --> 10:18.330
And this is fantastic, if you hear that.

218
10:18.330 --> 10:21.030
And it's bringing that automation

219
10:21.030 --> 10:24.690
that brings a predictability to consistency,

220
10:24.690 --> 10:29.010
which is foundational to scale those therapies

221
10:29.010 --> 10:30.630
and bring them to patients.

222
10:30.630 --> 10:34.860
And it's also very critical to get regulatory approvals

223
10:34.860 --> 10:37.023
for these therapies going forward.

224
10:38.220 --> 10:41.760
And then you spoke about, yeah, personalized medicine.

225
10:41.760 --> 10:43.893
That's another focus area we have,

226
10:44.970 --> 10:46.770
and the example I'm going to give

227
10:46.770 --> 10:50.553
is the example of sickle cell disease.

228
10:51.420 --> 10:53.520
Patients with sickle cell disease

229
10:53.520 --> 10:58.230
have abnormal formation of their red blood cells.

230
10:58.230 --> 10:59.670
They're forming as a sickle.

231
10:59.670 --> 11:02.310
And so, the oxygen transport in the body

232
11:02.310 --> 11:04.080
is not as it should be,

233
11:04.080 --> 11:07.290
meaning they have organ failure, stroke,

234
11:07.290 --> 11:09.480
so very severe complications.

235
11:09.480 --> 11:13.170
So, we have technology that filters out

236
11:13.170 --> 11:16.830
specifically those defect red blood cells,

237
11:16.830 --> 11:20.190
and they are replaced by normal and healthy cells

238
11:20.190 --> 11:21.393
from healthy donors.

239
11:22.350 --> 11:24.180
So, imagine this.

240
11:24.180 --> 11:25.080
If you are going,

241
11:25.080 --> 11:28.290
and we are going to learn more about genomics,

242
11:28.290 --> 11:31.530
about the role specific cells are playing,

243
11:31.530 --> 11:34.560
the applications are endless.

244
11:34.560 --> 11:37.620
We can look more and more to filter out more selectively

245
11:37.620 --> 11:39.930
cells that play a role in diseases,

246
11:39.930 --> 11:43.500
and yeah, ultimately come to more personalized medicine

247
11:43.500 --> 11:46.650
adapted to that specific patient condition.

248
11:46.650 --> 11:47.793
<v ->Thank you, wow!</v>

249
11:48.960 --> 11:51.060
So many conversations at CES, of course,

250
11:51.060 --> 11:52.350
revolve around the future,

251
11:52.350 --> 11:55.980
so let's talk the future of regenerative medicine.

252
11:55.980 --> 11:58.050
Any technological advancements

253
11:58.050 --> 12:00.720
that you expect in the next five to 10 years,

254
12:00.720 --> 12:03.000
and do you have an idea of a rough timeline

255
12:03.000 --> 12:05.163
of when you expect to see this progress?

256
12:06.510 --> 12:08.700
<v ->Well, something I'm very excited about,</v>

257
12:08.700 --> 12:10.830
well, in our space,

258
12:10.830 --> 12:14.400
so much of what comes to market

259
12:14.400 --> 12:16.650
is controlled by the regulatory bodies,

260
12:16.650 --> 12:18.360
and for good reason.

261
12:18.360 --> 12:20.970
And I'm incredibly excited about

262
12:20.970 --> 12:23.880
the advancement of in silico trials

263
12:23.880 --> 12:27.000
and the acceptance of in silico trials

264
12:27.000 --> 12:29.460
by some of these regulatory bodies.

265
12:29.460 --> 12:32.670
In October of last year,

266
12:32.670 --> 12:35.850
there was a seminal moment, in my opinion.

267
12:35.850 --> 12:39.510
The FDA released a report

268
12:39.510 --> 12:42.690
from the New Alternative Methods Subcommittee.

269
12:42.690 --> 12:44.520
And in that report,

270
12:44.520 --> 12:48.720
they accepted that in silico trials

271
12:48.720 --> 12:51.240
would be an inevitability.

272
12:51.240 --> 12:56.240
And what that does is it lowers the barrier to entry

273
12:56.280 --> 12:58.830
for smaller teams that may be innovative,

274
12:58.830 --> 13:00.750
that have the technical skill.

275
13:00.750 --> 13:02.640
And this is five years out,

276
13:02.640 --> 13:06.390
it's not something that I see happening in the next year.

277
13:06.390 --> 13:10.110
But by using the power and sophistication

278
13:10.110 --> 13:13.140
of modeling and computational techniques

279
13:13.140 --> 13:16.050
and using virtual patient populations

280
13:16.050 --> 13:18.810
that are provided by the FDA,

281
13:18.810 --> 13:21.480
we're going to see an efflorescence

282
13:21.480 --> 13:23.760
of technological breakthroughs,

283
13:23.760 --> 13:28.760
because there isn't a barrier to entry relative to,

284
13:29.520 --> 13:32.310
anchored in clinical trials

285
13:32.310 --> 13:35.580
where legacy companies that are almost 200 years old

286
13:35.580 --> 13:37.503
are the sources of innovation.

287
13:38.760 --> 13:41.130
I think, if you go further out,

288
13:41.130 --> 13:44.430
we were talking about patient-specific medicine,

289
13:44.430 --> 13:48.540
these virtual populations may be more patient-specific.

290
13:48.540 --> 13:53.250
And so, you can run thousands of interventions,

291
13:53.250 --> 13:56.610
pharmacological interventions, surgical interventions

292
13:56.610 --> 14:00.210
on digital twins of a specific patient

293
14:00.210 --> 14:01.680
and see if that's going to,

294
14:01.680 --> 14:03.810
which one of those is going to guarantee

295
14:03.810 --> 14:05.700
the kind of outcome that you're looking for,

296
14:05.700 --> 14:08.490
instead of this approximation.

297
14:08.490 --> 14:11.700
I think a lot of this is controlled

298
14:11.700 --> 14:13.290
by the regulatory authorities,

299
14:13.290 --> 14:15.240
and I think that, like I said,

300
14:15.240 --> 14:17.190
the FDA's report in October,

301
14:17.190 --> 14:21.150
and also, the NIH put out a report in February,

302
14:21.150 --> 14:24.360
they call it novel alternative methods.

303
14:24.360 --> 14:27.930
I think that's also another very promising sign

304
14:27.930 --> 14:30.510
that we're going to,

305
14:30.510 --> 14:33.960
the pace of regulatory approvals will start to catch up

306
14:33.960 --> 14:35.580
with the pace of innovation.

307
14:35.580 --> 14:37.440
And I think that's going to transform

308
14:37.440 --> 14:39.570
the regenerative medicine landscape

309
14:39.570 --> 14:42.630
and it's going to bring a lot of things to market

310
14:42.630 --> 14:43.713
that we haven't seen.

311
14:44.700 --> 14:45.900
<v Cassie>Thank you.</v>

312
14:45.900 --> 14:48.990
<v ->Yeah, and I like you bring up the in silico clinical trial</v>

313
14:48.990 --> 14:51.930
and the digital twins.

314
14:51.930 --> 14:54.930
I want to bring it a bit back about what I believe

315
14:54.930 --> 14:56.580
is that a big difference that we'll give

316
14:56.580 --> 15:00.000
is that when we can make those processes

317
15:00.000 --> 15:02.040
more predictable and consistent,

318
15:02.040 --> 15:04.290
and it also brings digital in there.

319
15:04.290 --> 15:07.800
So, we are looking into digital modelings

320
15:07.800 --> 15:09.450
and creating digital twins

321
15:09.450 --> 15:12.150
to understand better the processes that are needed

322
15:12.150 --> 15:14.013
to get those therapies produced.

323
15:15.330 --> 15:17.391
And that will also help to accelerate

324
15:17.391 --> 15:20.250
those regulatory approvals.

325
15:20.250 --> 15:24.000
It will enhance the way we can scale the production,

326
15:24.000 --> 15:26.070
but will also make it more easy,

327
15:26.070 --> 15:29.220
and even looking to bring those manufacturing

328
15:29.220 --> 15:32.280
and development processes closer to the patient,

329
15:32.280 --> 15:34.560
meaning the patient has better access.

330
15:34.560 --> 15:39.180
And so, we are able to increase the accessibility,

331
15:39.180 --> 15:40.503
affordability,

332
15:41.580 --> 15:45.180
look in the future that we have less treatment disparities

333
15:45.180 --> 15:49.320
and inequalities of those regenerative medicines

334
15:49.320 --> 15:50.460
in the future as well.

335
15:50.460 --> 15:52.260
So, that's what I see happening

336
15:52.260 --> 15:54.900
in the five to 10 coming years.

337
15:54.900 --> 15:56.460
<v ->Thank you.</v>

338
15:56.460 --> 15:58.620
Yeah, it's hard to talk about healthcare right now

339
15:58.620 --> 16:01.020
without AI coming into the conversation,

340
16:01.020 --> 16:03.000
especially here at CES.

341
16:03.000 --> 16:06.723
So, how do you see AI transforming regenerative medicine?

342
16:08.130 --> 16:09.930
<v ->Well, I think just building off</v>

343
16:09.930 --> 16:13.320
of our last topic, in silico trials,

344
16:13.320 --> 16:16.680
I think a lot of this is accelerated by AI,

345
16:16.680 --> 16:18.660
the granularity that you're seeing,

346
16:18.660 --> 16:21.660
the ability to capture the physiology

347
16:21.660 --> 16:24.420
to create these hyperrealistic digital twins.

348
16:24.420 --> 16:26.700
Right now, there are four virtual patients

349
16:26.700 --> 16:29.430
that the FDA provides,

350
16:29.430 --> 16:32.580
and there are actually 600 applications

351
16:32.580 --> 16:35.040
using those digital twins.

352
16:35.040 --> 16:37.290
Right now, there's only four of them,

353
16:37.290 --> 16:41.670
but AI has really made that possible.

354
16:41.670 --> 16:45.030
I also think that AI is going to be,

355
16:45.030 --> 16:47.400
we've already seen the impact of AlphaFold,

356
16:47.400 --> 16:51.210
but if we look at off-target effects,

357
16:51.210 --> 16:55.230
if AI can help design better guide RNAs,

358
16:55.230 --> 16:59.340
what will that do for realizing the promise of gene editing

359
16:59.340 --> 17:03.120
and how is that going to expand across multiple fields?

360
17:03.120 --> 17:07.323
We were talking about MSCs before the panel.

361
17:08.790 --> 17:12.177
If AI can can help design better guide RNAs

362
17:12.177 --> 17:16.080
and we can someday get to a gold standard

363
17:16.080 --> 17:18.510
of off-the-shelf MSCs,

364
17:18.510 --> 17:21.960
if we can control HLA proteins

365
17:21.960 --> 17:24.090
so that they're downregulated

366
17:24.090 --> 17:27.930
and that patients won't reject some of these MSCs,

367
17:27.930 --> 17:32.640
we could actually create a much more scalable

368
17:32.640 --> 17:35.370
regenerative medicine portfolio for patients,

369
17:35.370 --> 17:40.220
and we won't be limited by bone marrow aspiration,

370
17:42.390 --> 17:47.100
spinning MSCs in the operating theater.

371
17:47.100 --> 17:50.280
I think that gene editing could hold that promise,

372
17:50.280 --> 17:52.860
but I think AI is the real enabler of that

373
17:52.860 --> 17:55.383
so that we can have better guide RNAs.

374
17:56.430 --> 18:00.300
But I think I'm most excited about in silico trials

375
18:00.300 --> 18:02.490
and I think AI makes that possible.

376
18:02.490 --> 18:03.540
<v Cassie>Thank you.</v>

377
18:04.620 --> 18:06.510
<v ->Yeah, and we spoke about MSCs,</v>

378
18:06.510 --> 18:09.570
and it's the iPSCs that will enable it as off the shelf

379
18:09.570 --> 18:11.703
and endless possibilities.

380
18:13.590 --> 18:18.590
AI is also going to accelerate the predictability.

381
18:18.690 --> 18:21.120
And I wanted to give an example

382
18:21.120 --> 18:23.760
from the cell and gene therapy space

383
18:23.760 --> 18:27.210
because we are playing there and collaborating in many ways.

384
18:27.210 --> 18:31.500
We are enabling the cell collections from blood

385
18:31.500 --> 18:32.700
as a starting material

386
18:32.700 --> 18:35.310
for the development of cell therapies.

387
18:35.310 --> 18:39.060
And also, there, we can use AI and data

388
18:39.060 --> 18:41.430
to increase the predictability.

389
18:41.430 --> 18:45.420
We have worked with a healthcare center in South Dakota,

390
18:45.420 --> 18:48.000
where we were analyzing and helping to analyze

391
18:48.000 --> 18:49.920
their cell collection data

392
18:49.920 --> 18:53.130
to create a prediction algorithm.

393
18:53.130 --> 18:55.530
And that prediction algorithm allows us

394
18:55.530 --> 18:58.680
to calculate more accurately

395
18:58.680 --> 19:00.660
the volume of blood that is needed

396
19:00.660 --> 19:03.780
to reach the target dose of cells

397
19:03.780 --> 19:08.673
and the yield needed of cells to create the right therapy.

398
19:09.900 --> 19:13.020
And they were able to increase their success rate

399
19:13.020 --> 19:15.720
from 47% to 92%.

400
19:15.720 --> 19:18.570
Can you imagine how many more critically ill patients

401
19:18.570 --> 19:20.160
we can help by doing that?

402
19:20.160 --> 19:24.120
So, AI is really an enabler to make that happen,

403
19:24.120 --> 19:26.763
analysis of the data at larger scale.

404
19:27.990 --> 19:29.580
Just like I already mentioned,

405
19:29.580 --> 19:32.730
also using it for digital twin development

406
19:32.730 --> 19:35.460
for process in development as well.

407
19:35.460 --> 19:38.370
So, yeah, I see a lot of potential there

408
19:38.370 --> 19:41.250
to accelerate access to treatments.

409
19:41.250 --> 19:42.083
<v ->Thank you.</v>

410
19:43.560 --> 19:45.690
We know that the COVID-19 pandemic

411
19:45.690 --> 19:48.990
accelerated the adoption of new medical technologies.

412
19:48.990 --> 19:52.470
And I know we've talked a bit about regulatory bodies,

413
19:52.470 --> 19:53.610
the FDA so far,

414
19:53.610 --> 19:57.090
but do you think that there's a possibility

415
19:57.090 --> 19:59.580
that the FDA may be more open-minded

416
19:59.580 --> 20:02.880
to accelerating technologies like regenerative medicine

417
20:02.880 --> 20:04.620
as a result of some of the shifts

418
20:04.620 --> 20:06.360
we've seen in recent years?

419
20:06.360 --> 20:09.540
And have any of the changes in recent years

420
20:09.540 --> 20:13.203
allowed your companies to accelerate innovation?

421
20:15.270 --> 20:16.103
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

422
20:16.103 --> 20:20.580
I think COVID-19 was an incredible accelerator.

423
20:20.580 --> 20:25.230
It was obviously deeply tragic in a lot of ways,

424
20:25.230 --> 20:27.880
but Project Warp Speed

425
20:28.770 --> 20:32.910
and how vaccine developers, by necessity,

426
20:32.910 --> 20:35.220
had to use simulation and modeling

427
20:35.220 --> 20:40.220
to go through thousands of different vaccine iterations

428
20:40.260 --> 20:42.840
and gauge through simulation

429
20:42.840 --> 20:46.800
how T cells and B cells would respond

430
20:46.800 --> 20:48.660
to the different vaccines,

431
20:48.660 --> 20:52.860
gave proof to the FDA and other regulatory bodies

432
20:52.860 --> 20:55.890
that simulation and computational methods

433
20:55.890 --> 21:00.420
had reached a very advanced level of sophistication.

434
21:00.420 --> 21:04.170
And I think you're seeing that now only five years away,

435
21:04.170 --> 21:07.800
the fact that they've even floated the idea

436
21:07.800 --> 21:11.430
of creating an office for novel alternative methods.

437
21:11.430 --> 21:14.520
And I think that's due in large part to COVID-19

438
21:14.520 --> 21:18.060
and the use of these computational methods

439
21:18.060 --> 21:20.730
by the vaccine developers.

440
21:20.730 --> 21:23.580
In terms of how we would use it,

441
21:23.580 --> 21:27.270
we are very excited about using FEA

442
21:27.270 --> 21:29.910
with some of these virtual patients

443
21:29.910 --> 21:32.760
and accelerating our timeline so that we can run

444
21:32.760 --> 21:37.760
multiple different regulatory approvals in parallel,

445
21:38.580 --> 21:40.500
and so that we don't have that bottleneck

446
21:40.500 --> 21:43.860
of putting a lot of our effort into one.

447
21:43.860 --> 21:47.700
I think that the fact that the FDA has accepted that

448
21:47.700 --> 21:51.330
and that they've actually laid out a methodology

449
21:51.330 --> 21:56.310
for what they would deem appropriate in terms of testing

450
21:56.310 --> 21:59.430
helps accelerate a lot of different innovations,

451
21:59.430 --> 22:01.770
and that's something that we wanna leverage.

452
22:01.770 --> 22:03.210
<v Cassie>Thank you.</v>

453
22:03.210 --> 22:05.640
<v ->Yeah, and the FDA has done a lot of effort</v>

454
22:05.640 --> 22:07.050
to be more flexible,

455
22:07.050 --> 22:08.580
so they have programs now

456
22:08.580 --> 22:11.070
to expedite the regulatory pathway.

457
22:11.070 --> 22:13.710
They have RMAT designation

458
22:13.710 --> 22:15.933
specifically for regenerative medicine,

459
22:16.920 --> 22:20.790
and also, they have more guidance documents published.

460
22:20.790 --> 22:22.920
Now, what we experienced

461
22:22.920 --> 22:26.310
was during COVID itself at firsthand.

462
22:26.310 --> 22:28.290
In fact, in March, 2020,

463
22:28.290 --> 22:32.400
we were the first medical device.

464
22:32.400 --> 22:37.400
We got first emergency use approval for a medical device

465
22:37.680 --> 22:41.073
to treat COVID patients with respiratory failure.

466
22:42.210 --> 22:44.430
It was a technology to specifically

467
22:44.430 --> 22:46.950
remove cytokines from the blood

468
22:46.950 --> 22:49.170
and give the filtered blood again to the patient.

469
22:49.170 --> 22:52.290
So, we really experienced it firsthand

470
22:52.290 --> 22:56.130
of what was possible and what the FDA is making possible.

471
22:56.130 --> 22:59.790
And then, more recently, based on guidance papers,

472
22:59.790 --> 23:04.790
we are able to provide better process development support

473
23:05.190 --> 23:08.310
to make sure that manufacturing is done

474
23:08.310 --> 23:10.650
according to GMP requirements,

475
23:10.650 --> 23:12.930
both in the clinical and in the commercial space.

476
23:12.930 --> 23:16.260
So, this is helping our customers,

477
23:16.260 --> 23:20.880
bringing their stem cell transplants faster to patients.

478
23:20.880 --> 23:25.137
And we have examples in neurogenerative medicine

479
23:25.137 --> 23:26.550
and many other applications.

480
23:26.550 --> 23:30.000
So, it's great to see how that can help.

481
23:30.000 --> 23:30.990
<v ->Thank you, yep.</v>

482
23:30.990 --> 23:32.730
We have time for one last question,

483
23:32.730 --> 23:34.860
so I thought I'd bring it full circle.

484
23:34.860 --> 23:36.300
At the top of our conversation,

485
23:36.300 --> 23:37.980
you mentioned 1965,

486
23:37.980 --> 23:42.690
and in talking about recent acceleration

487
23:42.690 --> 23:45.870
in technologies from telemedicine to AI,

488
23:45.870 --> 23:49.500
do you believe that we're at another major inflection point

489
23:49.500 --> 23:51.810
in technology adoption and healthcare?

490
23:51.810 --> 23:54.060
And how do you see regenerative medicine

491
23:54.060 --> 23:55.863
fitting into this larger picture?

492
23:57.300 --> 23:58.200
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

493
23:58.200 --> 24:02.700
I think that we are definitely at an inflection point,

494
24:02.700 --> 24:05.730
and I think that regenerative medicine

495
24:05.730 --> 24:08.190
is at the center of this.

496
24:08.190 --> 24:11.070
And I think that in order for something

497
24:11.070 --> 24:13.860
to be at the center of an inflection point,

498
24:13.860 --> 24:18.860
it needs to depend on a convergence of multiple technologies

499
24:19.260 --> 24:23.160
and offer something truly unique to all of those

500
24:23.160 --> 24:25.320
and make use of those.

501
24:25.320 --> 24:26.153
I mentioned that,

502
24:26.153 --> 24:29.880
like you said earlier on in our conversation,

503
24:29.880 --> 24:34.880
I think that we're going to spawn multiple industries,

504
24:35.160 --> 24:38.490
at least six, from regenerative medicine.

505
24:38.490 --> 24:41.400
And this inflection point is going to make use

506
24:41.400 --> 24:43.080
of disparate technologies

507
24:43.080 --> 24:48.080
that have more or less developed in silos from one another.

508
24:48.810 --> 24:52.500
And I'm very confident

509
24:52.500 --> 24:54.450
that we're all gonna benefit from this

510
24:54.450 --> 24:56.370
within the next five to 10 years.

511
24:56.370 --> 24:57.810
And I think, hopefully,

512
24:57.810 --> 24:59.760
if all of us are around in 50 years,

513
24:59.760 --> 25:02.160
well, we may make it for another 50.

514
25:02.160 --> 25:05.250
So, very, very optimistic about that.

515
25:05.250 --> 25:06.870
<v Cassie>Thank you.</v>

516
25:06.870 --> 25:08.673
<v ->Yeah, I'm aligned with that.</v>

517
25:10.380 --> 25:12.660
We also see that the technology adoption

518
25:12.660 --> 25:16.110
is happening earlier, early in the research.

519
25:16.110 --> 25:17.670
An example is we are partnering

520
25:17.670 --> 25:19.830
with the CiRA Foundation in Japan

521
25:19.830 --> 25:24.300
to be able to advance bringing iPSC-based therapies

522
25:24.300 --> 25:26.763
faster from the lab into the clinic.

523
25:27.960 --> 25:29.010
And it all comes together.

524
25:29.010 --> 25:32.430
We see that regenerative medicine is maturing.

525
25:32.430 --> 25:34.950
Access will become more easily.

526
25:34.950 --> 25:37.020
And I see that in the bigger picture,

527
25:37.020 --> 25:39.600
this is going hand in hand, what we see,

528
25:39.600 --> 25:43.650
like the impact of AI on the empowerment of patients

529
25:43.650 --> 25:45.840
to be part of their treatment decision.

530
25:45.840 --> 25:48.240
And if you take all of that together,

531
25:48.240 --> 25:49.770
I see we are going

532
25:49.770 --> 25:53.403
to a more democratized healthcare in the future.

533
25:54.420 --> 25:55.253
<v ->Thank you, panel,</v>

534
25:55.253 --> 25:57.180
and thank you to the audience for joining us.

535
25:57.180 --> 25:58.830
If you'd like to continue the conversation,

536
25:58.830 --> 25:59.850
please find us in the hall,

537
25:59.850 --> 26:01.788
and enjoy the rest of the conference.

538
26:01.788 --> 26:03.462
(audience clapping)

539
26:03.462 --> 26:06.129
(upbeat music)
