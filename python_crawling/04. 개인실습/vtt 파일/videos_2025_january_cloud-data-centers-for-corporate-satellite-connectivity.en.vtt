00:00.253 --> 00:03.420
(bright upbeat music)

2
00:10.680 --> 00:11.580
<v ->Well, good afternoon all.</v>

3
00:11.580 --> 00:14.310
Thank you for joining us for the third installment

4
00:14.310 --> 00:16.263
in the Novaspace panels here at CES.

5
00:17.850 --> 00:20.820
This panel is going to cover cloud and data centers

6
00:20.820 --> 00:22.980
for corporate satellite connectivity.

7
00:22.980 --> 00:25.740
My name is Dara Panahy. I'm a partner with Milbank, LLP.

8
00:25.740 --> 00:28.290
It's a law firm, it's not a military bank.

9
00:28.290 --> 00:30.240
I lead the firm's Space Business practice

10
00:30.240 --> 00:31.980
and the Transportation and Space Group

11
00:31.980 --> 00:34.200
out of the Washington, DC office.

12
00:34.200 --> 00:35.490
Just to frame the discussion

13
00:35.490 --> 00:38.580
before I quickly introduce the speakers,

14
00:38.580 --> 00:41.280
satellites currently are a small

15
00:41.280 --> 00:44.970
but essential part of the connectivity network ecosystem.

16
00:44.970 --> 00:47.910
Satellites are growing as part of that system forecasted

17
00:47.910 --> 00:52.500
to exceed about 50 terabits per second of capacity by 2026,

18
00:52.500 --> 00:55.230
which is roughly doubling in two years.

19
00:55.230 --> 00:58.140
Increasingly, cloud and data service providers,

20
00:58.140 --> 01:00.210
including AWS, Microsoft,

21
01:00.210 --> 01:03.720
BT, Orange, AT&amp;T, NTT, Lumen, TIM,

22
01:03.720 --> 01:06.480
and also others, some of them here,

23
01:06.480 --> 01:10.470
are relying on satellite networks for their services,

24
01:10.470 --> 01:12.450
current generation satellites,

25
01:12.450 --> 01:15.180
whether they operate in low Earth orbit

26
01:15.180 --> 01:16.890
or medium Earth orbit,

27
01:16.890 --> 01:19.500
we call it LEO and MEO in the satellite business,

28
01:19.500 --> 01:23.010
as well as GEO, less so there, geostationary orbit.

29
01:23.010 --> 01:26.400
They do provide connectivity with some trade-offs.

30
01:26.400 --> 01:29.370
In MEO and LEO, you have latency, or delay,

31
01:29.370 --> 01:31.770
of between 150 to 50 milliseconds

32
01:31.770 --> 01:35.070
for the space to Earth leg.

33
01:35.070 --> 01:37.980
And all of these different orbits involve trade-offs

34
01:37.980 --> 01:41.460
between coverage, speed, and system complexity.

35
01:41.460 --> 01:44.130
But there are today numerous live 5G networks

36
01:44.130 --> 01:46.320
that are connecting via satellites to the cloud,

37
01:46.320 --> 01:47.730
and we'll get a little bit into that as well

38
01:47.730 --> 01:49.290
and a few other topics.

39
01:49.290 --> 01:50.880
So with us, we're very lucky

40
01:50.880 --> 01:52.773
to have a very distinguished panel.

41
01:53.640 --> 01:56.220
Far to the end of the seats here is,

42
01:56.220 --> 01:58.110
Retired Major General Clint Crosier.

43
01:58.110 --> 02:00.630
He's director of Aerospace and Satellite

44
02:00.630 --> 02:03.870
at Amazon Web Services, has been leading

45
02:03.870 --> 02:07.260
the global aerospace and satellite businesses at AWS,

46
02:07.260 --> 02:09.780
and providing customers with cloud solutions

47
02:09.780 --> 02:10.980
and space missions.

48
02:10.980 --> 02:13.860
Prior to AWS, he spent 33 years

49
02:13.860 --> 02:16.650
with the Air Force / Space Force,

50
02:16.650 --> 02:17.580
and I'll embarrass him.

51
02:17.580 --> 02:19.110
He has been generally credited

52
02:19.110 --> 02:21.153
as the architect of the Space Force.

53
02:22.140 --> 02:23.940
Next to him, Rika Nakazawa,

54
02:23.940 --> 02:27.870
she's the Chief Commercial Innovation Officer at NTT.

55
02:27.870 --> 02:31.680
A senior technology leader, VC investor, bestselling author,

56
02:31.680 --> 02:35.280
with expertise in technology driven transformation.

57
02:35.280 --> 02:36.840
In her current role, she focuses

58
02:36.840 --> 02:39.360
on advanced commercial and sustainable initiatives

59
02:39.360 --> 02:41.790
for NTT Space satellite innovations,

60
02:41.790 --> 02:43.950
while also leading key global initiatives

61
02:43.950 --> 02:47.580
that integrate NTT's R &amp; D investments.

62
02:47.580 --> 02:51.480
Next to her, Dr. Sunghee Lee, he's the CEO of Contec.

63
02:51.480 --> 02:53.880
He spent more than 16 years before that

64
02:53.880 --> 02:56.940
at the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, KARI,

65
02:56.940 --> 03:00.090
which is a significant global aerospace organization.

66
03:00.090 --> 03:02.883
He contributed to major Korean space projects,

67
03:04.230 --> 03:05.790
and also serves as a visiting researcher

68
03:05.790 --> 03:08.250
at the Carleton College on CubeSat missions.

69
03:08.250 --> 03:11.520
He recently founded Contec to advance satellite technology

70
03:11.520 --> 03:14.370
and innovative solutions in the industry.

71
03:14.370 --> 03:15.330
So we're gonna dive right in

72
03:15.330 --> 03:18.240
to a few topical based discussions,

73
03:18.240 --> 03:19.073
and we'll have a couple

74
03:19.073 --> 03:21.030
of pauses along the way for audience questions

75
03:21.030 --> 03:23.910
or contributions if you'd like to jump in.

76
03:23.910 --> 03:26.310
So let's start at the high level,

77
03:26.310 --> 03:28.410
jumping into structural pros and cons

78
03:28.410 --> 03:31.920
of connecting cloud and data centers via satellite

79
03:31.920 --> 03:34.290
versus other modalities, whether it be fiber

80
03:34.290 --> 03:36.600
or other terrestrial solutions, as well

81
03:36.600 --> 03:38.310
as any emerging technologies you think will

82
03:38.310 --> 03:40.230
enhance the proposition and efficiency

83
03:40.230 --> 03:43.020
of using space as a connectivity node.

84
03:43.020 --> 03:45.550
Who wanted to jump in first on that?

85
03:45.550 --> 03:47.910
<v ->I'll go first?</v>
<v ->Go ahead, please.</v>

86
03:47.910 --> 03:49.760
<v ->Okay, thank you for your questions.</v>

87
03:50.670 --> 03:54.450
Actually, I just would like to explain

88
03:54.450 --> 03:58.770
with one example in South Korea.

89
03:58.770 --> 04:00.840
In case of South Korea, we have a lot

90
04:00.840 --> 04:05.520
of the great optical network, 99%,

91
04:05.520 --> 04:07.740
in that case actually, we don't need

92
04:07.740 --> 04:10.980
to make the communication with the satellite,

93
04:10.980 --> 04:14.850
but, because, in case of SpaceX, they just try

94
04:14.850 --> 04:18.150
to provide their service in South Korea.

95
04:18.150 --> 04:21.180
But it's just Elon Musk. Sad, I guess.

96
04:21.180 --> 04:23.280
South Korea market is not good,

97
04:23.280 --> 04:28.260
but the other countries, like Southeast Asian area, in case

98
04:28.260 --> 04:32.280
of Indonesia or the other country, is a lot of island.

99
04:32.280 --> 04:35.183
In that case, not great, the optical network.

100
04:35.183 --> 04:39.540
In that case, we needed to have the satellite communication

101
04:39.540 --> 04:44.460
to provide the cloud access or the internet service.

102
04:44.460 --> 04:49.460
So in terms of this, satellite connectivity is quite useful

103
04:51.060 --> 04:52.710
to provide the internet service

104
04:52.710 --> 04:56.583
to the whole of the people, whole of the area.

105
04:58.235 --> 05:03.235
Also, actually we just use any kind of the video content

106
05:05.730 --> 05:09.060
or the education, hospital.

107
05:09.060 --> 05:13.380
So it is quite a great convenience

108
05:13.380 --> 05:14.820
for the whole of people.

109
05:14.820 --> 05:17.790
The other way take is,

110
05:17.790 --> 05:22.790
if we just have some problem, the fiber optical line,

111
05:22.890 --> 05:24.000
the satellite communication,

112
05:24.000 --> 05:28.470
quite great backup infrastructure.

113
05:28.470 --> 05:31.683
One of the example, maybe last year is,

114
05:33.180 --> 05:36.570
in China, the fishing boat,

115
05:36.570 --> 05:41.340
they just cut the ocean fiber optical line,

116
05:41.340 --> 05:43.500
nearby the Taiwan area.

117
05:43.500 --> 05:45.870
In the case, Taiwan government, okay,

118
05:45.870 --> 05:49.500
we just make the backup communication with the satellite.

119
05:49.500 --> 05:52.618
So for this reason, actually satellite communication,

120
05:52.618 --> 05:55.200
satellite connectivity is quite useful.

121
05:55.200 --> 05:57.990
But we also have some of the drawback.

122
05:57.990 --> 06:02.990
So limited bandwidth, also more delay.

123
06:03.150 --> 06:05.730
So for this reason, as I know, the AWS,

124
06:05.730 --> 06:10.730
you just co-work with the Unibap or the D-Orbit,

125
06:11.640 --> 06:14.700
to serve this kind of the issue,

126
06:14.700 --> 06:18.570
though maybe in the near future, maybe AWS,

127
06:18.570 --> 06:21.270
we just make this kind of the solution also.

128
06:21.270 --> 06:23.479
Yeah, that is my perspective.

129
06:23.479 --> 06:24.312
<v ->Thank you.</v>

130
06:24.312 --> 06:26.100
<v ->Yeah, I think, so it's important.</v>

131
06:26.100 --> 06:28.920
This is a very broad topic, right?

132
06:28.920 --> 06:31.740
If you go to the website for this session,

133
06:31.740 --> 06:33.480
there's a couple sentences describing,

134
06:33.480 --> 06:35.640
but really you could unpack it in so many ways.

135
06:35.640 --> 06:37.860
So I think it's important to parse it

136
06:37.860 --> 06:39.930
in a way that's gonna be relevant for your business

137
06:39.930 --> 06:41.073
or for your customer.

138
06:42.300 --> 06:44.580
Power of three, to simplify it,

139
06:44.580 --> 06:47.010
I think there's one segment which is,

140
06:47.010 --> 06:48.270
all right, so data center

141
06:48.270 --> 06:52.020
and computing in space for a space economy use.

142
06:52.020 --> 06:54.600
So in space, what are the challenges?

143
06:54.600 --> 06:55.980
What are the opportunities?

144
06:55.980 --> 06:58.710
The second one is terrestrial, non-terrestrial.

145
06:58.710 --> 07:01.590
So a very obvious one there

146
07:01.590 --> 07:03.810
for some of us is Earth observation.

147
07:03.810 --> 07:07.380
So what role do data centers either terrestrially

148
07:07.380 --> 07:09.840
or eventually data centers in space?

149
07:09.840 --> 07:11.280
And that's by the way, not going

150
07:11.280 --> 07:13.650
to be the big monolithic structures

151
07:13.650 --> 07:16.560
that you see in Arizona being lofted into orbit.

152
07:16.560 --> 07:18.570
Well, I don't think so anyway.

153
07:18.570 --> 07:21.420
So re-imagining data centers is part of the narrative,

154
07:21.420 --> 07:23.820
but that terrestrial, non-terrestrial is

155
07:23.820 --> 07:25.680
how do we take Earth observation images,

156
07:25.680 --> 07:28.200
which is a tremendous amount of data, not just optically,

157
07:28.200 --> 07:31.500
but other variety data formats that are now being able

158
07:31.500 --> 07:33.720
to be detected with remote sensing,

159
07:33.720 --> 07:36.000
and being able to use that here on Earth

160
07:36.000 --> 07:38.130
for a variety of use cases.

161
07:38.130 --> 07:40.110
And then the third segment,

162
07:40.110 --> 07:43.260
or the third dimension to think about data centers

163
07:43.260 --> 07:46.080
and computing in space is really the energy challenge

164
07:46.080 --> 07:47.700
that we have with AI.

165
07:47.700 --> 07:50.610
So NTT, we're a significant provider

166
07:50.610 --> 07:51.840
in the data center business.

167
07:51.840 --> 07:52.673
So this is something

168
07:52.673 --> 07:55.080
that we're thinking about very, very carefully is

169
07:55.080 --> 07:57.720
that the demands of AI and compute,

170
07:57.720 --> 07:59.580
and by the way, I'm former Nvidia,

171
07:59.580 --> 08:02.310
I worked on a team that was the mobile group,

172
08:02.310 --> 08:04.980
that was Tegra, which is now some of the foundation

173
08:04.980 --> 08:06.930
of what's in Nvidia today.

174
08:06.930 --> 08:09.180
And by the way, no, I did not hold onto my stock

175
08:09.180 --> 08:11.520
when I left in 2010, so please don't ask me.

176
08:11.520 --> 08:13.020
It's a very sore topic.

177
08:13.020 --> 08:14.790
Although of course I'm a big fan of Jensen,

178
08:14.790 --> 08:16.230
and I know he really was able

179
08:16.230 --> 08:18.330
to kick things off here at CES.

180
08:18.330 --> 08:22.860
But the idea is that how can we use space ecosystem

181
08:22.860 --> 08:25.140
to help solve for some of these challenges?

182
08:25.140 --> 08:27.660
Because as AI, agentic AI,

183
08:27.660 --> 08:31.590
and that just becomes a natural fabric of how we use compute

184
08:31.590 --> 08:33.060
and digital economies of the future.

185
08:33.060 --> 08:35.550
And by the way, 2 billion people around the world,

186
08:35.550 --> 08:37.500
still not even really online yet.

187
08:37.500 --> 08:38.970
And as they come online,

188
08:38.970 --> 08:40.440
how are we gonna manage all of that?

189
08:40.440 --> 08:44.370
And thinking about the space in orbit as something

190
08:44.370 --> 08:47.160
that can help us address that is going to be key.

191
08:47.160 --> 08:49.560
Of course, what is going to be a major barrier to that is

192
08:49.560 --> 08:51.780
if it gets too darn crowded up there, if it's true

193
08:51.780 --> 08:53.430
that we have a hundred thousand LEO

194
08:53.430 --> 08:56.220
or satellites in orbit by the year 2030,

195
08:56.220 --> 08:57.780
it's going to be very, very crowded.

196
08:57.780 --> 09:00.000
And I think that's gonna create some significant challenges.

197
09:00.000 --> 09:01.410
But I just wanted to kind

198
09:01.410 --> 09:05.250
of explain how I think about this topic.

199
09:05.250 --> 09:06.600
It's very wide,

200
09:06.600 --> 09:08.310
but if we simplify it to those three areas,

201
09:08.310 --> 09:10.380
I think becomes a little bit easier in terms

202
09:10.380 --> 09:14.100
of drilling down on specific, not rabbit holes,

203
09:14.100 --> 09:16.683
maybe more grooves of the record I'll say.

204
09:17.700 --> 09:18.533
<v ->Yeah, thank you.</v>

205
09:18.533 --> 09:20.580
It's a pleasure to be here at CES.

206
09:20.580 --> 09:22.770
It's my first time here at CES,

207
09:22.770 --> 09:25.380
and so thank you to Contec for inviting me,

208
09:25.380 --> 09:27.540
and Novaspace for inviting me.

209
09:27.540 --> 09:29.833
And then my friends, Dr. Lee at Contec

210
09:29.833 --> 09:31.653
and Rika Nakazawa at NTT,

211
09:31.653 --> 09:35.160
it's a privilege to be with you on the stage here too.

212
09:35.160 --> 09:37.530
I think this is a really, really interesting topic,

213
09:37.530 --> 09:40.350
which is one of the reasons I was excited to be here.

214
09:40.350 --> 09:41.580
I think the integration

215
09:41.580 --> 09:44.490
of these technologies is inevitable, right?

216
09:44.490 --> 09:48.270
Between space and satcom and cloud

217
09:48.270 --> 09:49.860
and data and data centers,

218
09:49.860 --> 09:53.100
the integration is already occurring, but it's inevitable.

219
09:53.100 --> 09:55.050
And it's inevitable for a couple of reasons.

220
09:55.050 --> 09:58.920
One, we will never use as a people on the planet Earth,

221
09:58.920 --> 10:02.100
we will never use space less tomorrow

222
10:02.100 --> 10:03.810
than we use it today, right?

223
10:03.810 --> 10:06.660
If we just go back and look over time, we have continued

224
10:06.660 --> 10:08.790
to use space in more and more ways.

225
10:08.790 --> 10:10.710
There are so many ways we use space today

226
10:10.710 --> 10:13.800
that we didn't even envision 10 years ago, 15 years ago,

227
10:13.800 --> 10:17.550
30 years ago, including using space data on your phone

228
10:17.550 --> 10:20.310
to figure out the best way to get from your hotel

229
10:20.310 --> 10:22.770
to the Las Vegas Convention Center here today, right?

230
10:22.770 --> 10:24.750
We never anticipated that.

231
10:24.750 --> 10:26.460
When space was born,

232
10:26.460 --> 10:29.760
it was born primarily as a means to collect intelligence

233
10:29.760 --> 10:31.410
and to provide communications.

234
10:31.410 --> 10:33.270
And then we've seen the explosion

235
10:33.270 --> 10:35.040
of the way we use space technology

236
10:35.040 --> 10:38.520
and space capability today that will only increase.

237
10:38.520 --> 10:40.473
It will never get less than.

238
10:41.310 --> 10:42.570
When I look at the cloud,

239
10:42.570 --> 10:45.450
and I'm privileged to work for Amazon Web Services,

240
10:45.450 --> 10:48.210
a leading cloud provider in the world,

241
10:48.210 --> 10:50.940
we will never consume less cloud

242
10:50.940 --> 10:53.460
in the world than we do today, I don't believe so.

243
10:53.460 --> 10:55.620
We have all understood the power

244
10:55.620 --> 10:57.360
of cloud-based technologies,

245
10:57.360 --> 10:59.760
whether it's artificial intelligence, machine learning,

246
10:59.760 --> 11:03.420
advanced data analytics, quantum computing, micro computing,

247
11:03.420 --> 11:04.770
whatever the case may be.

248
11:04.770 --> 11:07.440
There are so many extraordinary technologies today

249
11:07.440 --> 11:09.240
that really can only be harvested

250
11:09.240 --> 11:11.940
and leveraged at scale on the cloud.

251
11:11.940 --> 11:13.170
We will never, as a people,

252
11:13.170 --> 11:16.830
use less cloud tomorrow than we do today.

253
11:16.830 --> 11:19.050
So when we bring those together, we recognize

254
11:19.050 --> 11:21.510
that we've got these multi technologies

255
11:21.510 --> 11:24.930
that are all coming together in a unique fashion and fabric,

256
11:24.930 --> 11:26.520
and they go so well together,

257
11:26.520 --> 11:29.670
because they enable the growth of each other.

258
11:29.670 --> 11:33.660
Space and space data will enable the growth of the cloud,

259
11:33.660 --> 11:35.430
and the cloud will enable the growth

260
11:35.430 --> 11:37.650
of what we use for space and space data.

261
11:37.650 --> 11:39.870
So it's just an exciting time.

262
11:39.870 --> 11:44.013
I really appreciate Rika's point about the space economy.

263
11:44.880 --> 11:47.340
Some people call it space for space

264
11:47.340 --> 11:50.550
versus space for terrestrial or space for Earth,

265
11:50.550 --> 11:53.250
because those are two very unique markets

266
11:53.250 --> 11:55.173
that we see right now today.

267
11:57.030 --> 12:00.480
Today and in the near term, most of the processing,

268
12:00.480 --> 12:02.520
the vast majority of the processing

269
12:02.520 --> 12:05.730
of space data, goes on today on the earth.

270
12:05.730 --> 12:08.190
And that has been okay to this point,

271
12:08.190 --> 12:11.160
but as we're bringing more and more data down,

272
12:11.160 --> 12:14.100
and we require less and less latency,

273
12:14.100 --> 12:16.020
and more and more bandwidth, we're gonna have

274
12:16.020 --> 12:19.320
to make a choice about whether we wanna process in orbit.

275
12:19.320 --> 12:21.420
And I appreciate Dr. Lee's reference

276
12:21.420 --> 12:23.460
to the demonstration we did

277
12:23.460 --> 12:26.130
with our friends at D-Orbit two years ago

278
12:26.130 --> 12:29.850
where we put an on orbit edge computing capability

279
12:29.850 --> 12:33.000
on a D-Orbit satellite and demonstrated that that works.

280
12:33.000 --> 12:36.270
And we reduced downlink requirements by 42%

281
12:36.270 --> 12:39.450
by processing on orbit rather than pushing it to the ground.

282
12:39.450 --> 12:41.190
So we're gonna see more and more of that.

283
12:41.190 --> 12:44.010
And then, I'll turn over the microphone here,

284
12:44.010 --> 12:46.530
but as we look at the space economy,

285
12:46.530 --> 12:49.140
or space for space, as we think

286
12:49.140 --> 12:51.930
about in-orbit satellite servicing,

287
12:51.930 --> 12:54.630
in-orbit space manufacturing,

288
12:54.630 --> 12:56.940
asteroid mining, space tourism,

289
12:56.940 --> 12:58.920
moving through the Artemis program

290
12:58.920 --> 13:00.960
onto the moon and then onto Mars,

291
13:00.960 --> 13:04.440
the number of use cases for cloud

292
13:04.440 --> 13:07.080
and satellite technology in the space economy,

293
13:07.080 --> 13:10.320
I think will ultimately outpace what we're using space

294
13:10.320 --> 13:13.080
for here on the earth over time, decades from now.

295
13:13.080 --> 13:15.630
But those are just two really powerful ways

296
13:15.630 --> 13:16.463
to think about it.

297
13:16.463 --> 13:18.690
And Rika, I appreciate you teeing those two up.

298
13:18.690 --> 13:20.700
<v ->Actually since you brought up space tourism.</v>

299
13:20.700 --> 13:22.590
Do you mind Dara if I ask the audience a question?

300
13:22.590 --> 13:24.225
<v ->Go right ahead, please.</v>

301
13:24.225 --> 13:25.560
<v ->I'm just curious,</v>

302
13:25.560 --> 13:27.300
because I'm starting to ask this question,

303
13:27.300 --> 13:28.800
not just at dinner parties anymore,

304
13:28.800 --> 13:31.470
but forums like this, by show of hands, how many

305
13:31.470 --> 13:34.470
of you are interested in going to the moon

306
13:34.470 --> 13:35.870
if you could go to the moon?

307
13:38.340 --> 13:39.300
Okay.

308
13:39.300 --> 13:40.842
<v ->About half.</v>
<v ->Yeah, about half.</v>

309
13:40.842 --> 13:41.790
<v ->About half, maybe about half.</v>

310
13:41.790 --> 13:42.623
<v ->Great. Thank you.</v>

311
13:42.623 --> 13:43.830
I was just curious. Thanks.

312
13:43.830 --> 13:45.413
<v ->Not at all.</v>
<v ->Depends on price.</v>

313
13:46.520 --> 13:47.640
<v ->Depends on price point.</v>

314
13:47.640 --> 13:49.020
<v ->That's usually my next question is</v>

315
13:49.020 --> 13:52.020
what is the maximum disposable income amount you would

316
13:52.020 --> 13:54.120
pay today to go to space?

317
13:54.120 --> 13:58.642
And the number that I've gotten mostly is $10,000.

318
13:58.642 --> 14:00.693
<v ->$10,000. Hmm.</v>

319
14:01.950 --> 14:03.650
<v ->How much would you pay? Maximum.</v>

320
14:04.957 --> 14:06.330
<v ->Maximum is 1 million.</v>
<v ->1 million?</v>

321
14:06.330 --> 14:08.070
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Wow.</v>

322
14:08.070 --> 14:09.738
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->All right. Thank you.</v>

323
14:09.738 --> 14:12.570
<v ->Well, Rika, since you kindly went in uncharted territory,</v>

324
14:12.570 --> 14:17.400
let's ask you to talk a little bit about today,

325
14:17.400 --> 14:20.400
space to Earth, tangible applications.

326
14:20.400 --> 14:22.140
NTT's got a few solutions

327
14:22.140 --> 14:24.390
that's either in testing or deployed.

328
14:24.390 --> 14:26.370
There's NTT network in a box.

329
14:26.370 --> 14:28.170
I think it's probably got a more formal name than that,

330
14:28.170 --> 14:29.970
but that's the name I go with.

331
14:29.970 --> 14:33.720
And then NTT is part of a very interesting demonstration

332
14:33.720 --> 14:37.800
ongoing in conjunction with JSAT, a satellite operator,

333
14:37.800 --> 14:40.950
Aalto, a HAPS provider, and trying

334
14:40.950 --> 14:43.230
to look at traditional and non-traditional space

335
14:43.230 --> 14:45.960
and aerospace solutions to providing connectivity.

336
14:45.960 --> 14:48.390
Love to hear about some of the tangible applications

337
14:48.390 --> 14:51.840
in terms of how we connect corporate and other solutions.

338
14:51.840 --> 14:54.180
<v ->Yeah, and thanks for doing the homework. That's awesome.</v>

339
14:54.180 --> 14:57.840
So yes, network in a box. We affectionately call it the NIB.

340
14:57.840 --> 15:01.320
It is private 5G, private wireless network in a box.

341
15:01.320 --> 15:02.490
So it's about the size

342
15:02.490 --> 15:06.420
of maybe the refrigerator you have in your Vegas hotel,

343
15:06.420 --> 15:08.520
times two, depending on the size

344
15:08.520 --> 15:10.470
of the fridge, but roughly that.

345
15:10.470 --> 15:14.280
And the team at NTT Data, we're working

346
15:14.280 --> 15:16.890
with SES as a partner around that.

347
15:16.890 --> 15:18.660
So Mobile World Congress, we showcase that.

348
15:18.660 --> 15:20.880
For any of you going to MWC next year,

349
15:20.880 --> 15:22.860
you'll see the next iteration of that.

350
15:22.860 --> 15:24.840
But that's all about with MEO satellite

351
15:24.840 --> 15:27.210
to terrestrial and backhaul.

352
15:27.210 --> 15:28.740
But more specifically, a couple

353
15:28.740 --> 15:30.000
of the other advanced initiatives

354
15:30.000 --> 15:31.140
that we're working on, are really

355
15:31.140 --> 15:33.450
around terrestrial, non-terrestrial connectivity.

356
15:33.450 --> 15:35.700
The session before this was about connected vehicle,

357
15:35.700 --> 15:38.070
which is one of the use case areas,

358
15:38.070 --> 15:40.740
or business case areas, that is of great interest

359
15:40.740 --> 15:42.180
of terrestrial, non-terrestrial.

360
15:42.180 --> 15:44.850
So being able to use 3GPP standards

361
15:44.850 --> 15:48.300
to enable narrow band IoT connectivity in remote locations,

362
15:48.300 --> 15:52.260
which of course, SpaceX has already been working on.

363
15:52.260 --> 15:55.260
And there's already I think, Chinese entities

364
15:55.260 --> 15:57.720
that have been demonstrating 6G direct to satellite.

365
15:57.720 --> 15:59.640
So there's a lot of interesting developments

366
15:59.640 --> 16:01.950
that are happening around terrestrial, non-terrestrial.

367
16:01.950 --> 16:04.200
But the area that I've been spending most of my time on,

368
16:04.200 --> 16:06.840
because one of my other areas is sustainability,

369
16:06.840 --> 16:10.290
just in general of where sustainability hits the business

370
16:10.290 --> 16:13.260
and commercial road, is Earth observation.

371
16:13.260 --> 16:14.520
So about three months ago,

372
16:14.520 --> 16:16.560
World Economic Forum in Deloitte did a study.

373
16:16.560 --> 16:18.720
They said that Earth observation has the opportunity

374
16:18.720 --> 16:22.110
to unlock $700 billion worth of value.

375
16:22.110 --> 16:23.970
Earth observation has been predominantly

376
16:23.970 --> 16:27.810
in the domain of military and intelligence

377
16:27.810 --> 16:30.450
for reasons that are around geopolitical

378
16:30.450 --> 16:34.530
and just tracking movement of vehicles, people,

379
16:34.530 --> 16:36.120
and machinery around the world.

380
16:36.120 --> 16:38.100
But really Earth observation is

381
16:38.100 --> 16:40.860
around leveraging the advances that are happening

382
16:40.860 --> 16:43.710
in remote sensing satellites to be able

383
16:43.710 --> 16:46.080
to find commercial applications,

384
16:46.080 --> 16:48.060
private sector applications,

385
16:48.060 --> 16:49.830
which at NTT we've been looking at.

386
16:49.830 --> 16:51.060
We've launched a new group

387
16:51.060 --> 16:53.940
within NTT called Marble Visions, which is an ode

388
16:53.940 --> 16:55.950
to the blue marble image that was taken

389
16:55.950 --> 16:58.030
in 1972 by Apollo 17,

390
16:58.030 --> 16:59.940
where the astronauts looked at the earth

391
16:59.940 --> 17:02.100
and they said, that looks really fragile,

392
17:02.100 --> 17:03.720
and they called it the blue marble.

393
17:03.720 --> 17:06.330
And hence Marble Visions is our ode to that.

394
17:06.330 --> 17:09.090
And so we're working on a vertically integrated solution,

395
17:09.090 --> 17:12.660
which is all around putting satellites in orbit in 2026,

396
17:12.660 --> 17:14.640
Earth observation, with some partners,

397
17:14.640 --> 17:19.347
and being able to readily capture optical, SAR,

398
17:19.347 --> 17:22.650
hyperspectral, multispectral, variety of data images

399
17:22.650 --> 17:24.570
around geographic footprints,

400
17:24.570 --> 17:26.910
and being able to integrate, institute data,

401
17:26.910 --> 17:30.150
so from IoT devices or from machine vision cameras,

402
17:30.150 --> 17:33.390
and create a dynamic digital twin,

403
17:33.390 --> 17:35.520
which sounds very Star Trek holography.

404
17:35.520 --> 17:37.830
But we do believe that that is going to be something

405
17:37.830 --> 17:40.050
that will be coming in the very near future.

406
17:40.050 --> 17:42.630
And those are some of the areas that we're investing in.

407
17:42.630 --> 17:47.100
And for us, when we talk about the space ecosystem,

408
17:47.100 --> 17:50.130
it's not science fiction stuff, it's a natural extension

409
17:50.130 --> 17:51.900
of what NTT does today

410
17:51.900 --> 17:54.630
around connectivity, data, and intelligence.

411
17:54.630 --> 17:57.330
So it's a natural extension of that fabric.

412
17:57.330 --> 18:00.300
And last summer we announced C89.

413
18:00.300 --> 18:04.290
C stands for constellation, Constellation 89 being the name

414
18:04.290 --> 18:06.600
that we're giving for all the different initiatives

415
18:06.600 --> 18:07.920
that NTT is driving.

416
18:07.920 --> 18:10.740
And we spend three and a half billion dollars

417
18:10.740 --> 18:12.480
on R &amp; D every year.

418
18:12.480 --> 18:15.420
And a part of that is around space and satellite ecosystem.

419
18:15.420 --> 18:16.830
So if there's anybody that would like

420
18:16.830 --> 18:18.600
to learn more about what we're doing there,

421
18:18.600 --> 18:20.880
because it doesn't take the village anymore,

422
18:20.880 --> 18:25.440
it takes the whole cosmic, space system to make this happen,

423
18:25.440 --> 18:28.264
we'd love to talk to anybody afterwards, thank you.

424
18:28.264 --> 18:29.340
<v ->Thank you, Rika.</v>

425
18:29.340 --> 18:31.110
Clint, if we can pull on that thread a little bit,

426
18:31.110 --> 18:32.130
we'd love to hear some more sort

427
18:32.130 --> 18:36.330
of practical, tangible examples of the concept.

428
18:36.330 --> 18:39.960
I know AWS has spent a lot of time solving for on-premise,

429
18:39.960 --> 18:42.660
edge focused solutions, aggregation solutions,

430
18:42.660 --> 18:43.860
localized processing.

431
18:43.860 --> 18:45.240
If you could share some

432
18:45.240 --> 18:47.280
of these containerized, if you will, solutions

433
18:47.280 --> 18:50.760
with the audience, give them a lay person's sense

434
18:50.760 --> 18:53.400
of how this is working and connected by satellite,

435
18:53.400 --> 18:54.540
I think that'd be very helpful.

436
18:54.540 --> 18:56.160
<v ->Yeah, thank you. Happy to do that.</v>

437
18:56.160 --> 18:59.130
So I will tell you, four years ago, AWS sort

438
18:59.130 --> 19:01.140
of looked out across this industry

439
19:01.140 --> 19:02.520
and saw a lot of this growth

440
19:02.520 --> 19:04.770
that we're talking about right now today.

441
19:04.770 --> 19:06.870
And the first sort of foray

442
19:06.870 --> 19:09.810
into the dedicated space mission,

443
19:09.810 --> 19:12.810
now we've been supporting space organizations, like NASA,

444
19:12.810 --> 19:17.100
at AWS for over a decade, but four years ago we came up

445
19:17.100 --> 19:19.530
with a dedicated space focus mission,

446
19:19.530 --> 19:22.170
and we launched the AWS Ground Station.

447
19:22.170 --> 19:24.360
And the idea behind AWS Ground Station,

448
19:24.360 --> 19:28.410
with ground station as a service, was simply, one,

449
19:28.410 --> 19:30.660
there aren't enough ground stations out there

450
19:30.660 --> 19:32.100
or won't be over time.

451
19:32.100 --> 19:34.170
And we're seeing that right now, even today.

452
19:34.170 --> 19:35.640
When you look at the number of satellites

453
19:35.640 --> 19:38.520
that'll be on orbit in the next 5 years, 10 years,

454
19:38.520 --> 19:41.670
the ground system industry will tell you

455
19:41.670 --> 19:45.270
that we're concerned about the capacity that we can process

456
19:45.270 --> 19:46.680
through all the ground stations.

457
19:46.680 --> 19:48.420
So it was an additive value

458
19:48.420 --> 19:50.130
to the ground station total capacity.

459
19:50.130 --> 19:53.130
But more importantly, more importantly, the value

460
19:53.130 --> 19:54.930
behind the AWS Ground Station was

461
19:54.930 --> 19:56.130
we built the ground station

462
19:56.130 --> 19:59.910
such that they're directly connected into the AWS cloud.

463
19:59.910 --> 20:01.800
So we created even four years ago,

464
20:01.800 --> 20:04.380
the very first direct connectivity

465
20:04.380 --> 20:08.100
from satellite on orbit data into the AWS cloud.

466
20:08.100 --> 20:11.550
So Earth observation companies like Capella and BlackSky

467
20:11.550 --> 20:14.790
and others that are using the AWS Ground Station have been

468
20:14.790 --> 20:18.390
for some years porting their data directly from space

469
20:18.390 --> 20:20.220
into the AWS cloud to be able

470
20:20.220 --> 20:23.100
to process near instantaneously,

471
20:23.100 --> 20:27.510
and get reduced latency, increased security, et cetera.

472
20:27.510 --> 20:30.000
So that's one of the things, even going back four years ago,

473
20:30.000 --> 20:31.170
we started seeing the need

474
20:31.170 --> 20:34.200
for direct connect capability from space into the cloud

475
20:34.200 --> 20:35.553
or into data centers.

476
20:36.450 --> 20:39.480
Two years later, we partnered with one of our partners

477
20:39.480 --> 20:43.110
and friends, SES systems, SES satellites,

478
20:43.110 --> 20:47.220
where SES built the first direct connect capability

479
20:47.220 --> 20:49.050
from their satellites.

480
20:49.050 --> 20:50.790
So what I described previously

481
20:50.790 --> 20:54.480
with AWS Ground Station was an Earth observation satellite

482
20:54.480 --> 20:57.630
downloading its Earth observation data into the cloud.

483
20:57.630 --> 21:00.807
SES is a satcom provider, satellite communications.

484
21:00.807 --> 21:03.480
And so we built the first partnership with SES

485
21:03.480 --> 21:06.870
where we directly connected their satcom satellites

486
21:06.870 --> 21:11.100
into the AWS cloud to let you port any data you wanted,

487
21:11.100 --> 21:13.560
whether it was Earth observation or other.

488
21:13.560 --> 21:16.440
And so with those direct connect capabilities from SES

489
21:16.440 --> 21:19.860
into the AWS cloud, we and SES were able

490
21:19.860 --> 21:22.170
to support companies like shipping companies,

491
21:22.170 --> 21:25.350
and mining companies, and oil platforms,

492
21:25.350 --> 21:27.720
remote locations that typically

493
21:27.720 --> 21:30.450
don't have global connectivity are now connected

494
21:30.450 --> 21:32.850
into the AWS cloud via satellite.

495
21:32.850 --> 21:35.160
And so we've been doing that for a couple years.

496
21:35.160 --> 21:38.850
So as we've been exploring basic connectivity

497
21:38.850 --> 21:40.200
between space and cloud,

498
21:40.200 --> 21:42.900
and have been doing that for a couple years,

499
21:42.900 --> 21:46.860
my friend Dr. Lee mentioned, and Dara, you mentioned,

500
21:46.860 --> 21:48.990
moving into edge computing.

501
21:48.990 --> 21:50.760
So let me touch that briefly.

502
21:50.760 --> 21:53.430
AWS has really pioneered edge computing

503
21:53.430 --> 21:55.530
over the last 10 or 12 years.

504
21:55.530 --> 21:57.840
And basically when we think of edge computing,

505
21:57.840 --> 21:59.430
I know a lot of people use the term,

506
21:59.430 --> 22:01.650
but the way we think about edge computing,

507
22:01.650 --> 22:05.220
if you aren't computing in a data center,

508
22:05.220 --> 22:06.810
then you're doing edge computing, right?

509
22:06.810 --> 22:09.030
That's the basic definition.

510
22:09.030 --> 22:10.110
You're either computing

511
22:10.110 --> 22:12.540
inside a cloud computing data center,

512
22:12.540 --> 22:13.770
and if you're not computing

513
22:13.770 --> 22:15.810
inside a cloud computing data center,

514
22:15.810 --> 22:17.250
you're doing edge computing.

515
22:17.250 --> 22:21.780
Now, sometime that edge compute might be across the street

516
22:21.780 --> 22:25.440
at a business, it might be 20 miles away connected

517
22:25.440 --> 22:27.840
by fiber or optical or other,

518
22:27.840 --> 22:32.070
or it might be an oil platform

519
22:32.070 --> 22:34.230
or a remote agriculture facility

520
22:34.230 --> 22:38.223
or an IoT device out on a ship, commercial shipping.

521
22:39.060 --> 22:41.070
So for a decade, AWS is focused

522
22:41.070 --> 22:43.160
on developing edge computing capabilities.

523
22:43.160 --> 22:46.740
In other words, it's too costly and difficult

524
22:46.740 --> 22:49.830
for our customers to move their data to the cloud,

525
22:49.830 --> 22:53.070
so rather we will push the cloud to their data.

526
22:53.070 --> 22:54.270
So we built a whole set

527
22:54.270 --> 22:57.900
of edge computing infrastructure with Outposts and others

528
22:57.900 --> 23:00.450
that push the cloud infrastructure capability

529
23:00.450 --> 23:03.843
to where the data is to make it easier for our customers.

530
23:04.770 --> 23:08.460
Our customers that we're talking about today just so happen,

531
23:08.460 --> 23:12.210
to operate off the surface of the planet in many ways.

532
23:12.210 --> 23:14.010
So as we're thinking about edge computing,

533
23:14.010 --> 23:16.890
it's a natural progression to move edge computing

534
23:16.890 --> 23:20.967
from off the terrestrial planet Earth and into space.

535
23:20.967 --> 23:23.910
And so Dr. Lee mentioned, we did a demonstration,

536
23:23.910 --> 23:25.560
an experiment about two years ago

537
23:25.560 --> 23:27.180
with our friends at D-Orbit

538
23:27.180 --> 23:29.310
where we built a cloud computing package

539
23:29.310 --> 23:31.140
that we had to modify, by the way,

540
23:31.140 --> 23:33.420
because satellites have SWAP limitations,

541
23:33.420 --> 23:34.560
size, weight, and power.

542
23:34.560 --> 23:36.960
So we had to build a purpose-built capability

543
23:36.960 --> 23:39.540
that went on D-Orbit satellite and D-Orbit launched it.

544
23:39.540 --> 23:42.480
And then we ran the experiment for edge computing.

545
23:42.480 --> 23:43.313
One of the other thing,

546
23:43.313 --> 23:45.990
and as I said, it demonstrated 42% decrease

547
23:45.990 --> 23:49.620
in downlink requirements, which saves a lot of time, energy,

548
23:49.620 --> 23:53.190
and money in processing unnecessary bandwidth.

549
23:53.190 --> 23:54.960
The other tangible example

550
23:54.960 --> 23:56.940
that we did, was quite exciting, was we partnered

551
23:56.940 --> 23:59.160
with our friends at Axiom Space.

552
23:59.160 --> 24:02.460
And on the very first ever Axiom mission, Ax-1,

553
24:02.460 --> 24:04.530
last year, year and a half ago,

554
24:04.530 --> 24:07.475
Axiom launched what we call an AWS Snowcone.

555
24:07.475 --> 24:09.900
A snowcone is a commercial off the shelf capability

556
24:09.900 --> 24:12.180
that you can order, you can buy it,

557
24:12.180 --> 24:15.300
you can employ it, there's some modifications happening

558
24:15.300 --> 24:17.880
to it now, but it has been available

559
24:17.880 --> 24:20.550
for commercial off the shelf capabilities,

560
24:20.550 --> 24:23.520
and we built that such that it was rugged enough

561
24:23.520 --> 24:25.140
that you could put it in the mail

562
24:25.140 --> 24:27.330
and send it to remote locations.

563
24:27.330 --> 24:30.330
When we built it at AWS, we didn't realize it was so rugged

564
24:30.330 --> 24:31.860
we would actually be able to get it

565
24:31.860 --> 24:34.920
through NASA's space flight qualification program.

566
24:34.920 --> 24:36.090
But we did.

567
24:36.090 --> 24:38.700
We spent seven months doing shock, and vibration,

568
24:38.700 --> 24:40.980
and thermal, and acoustic testing, and everything else,

569
24:40.980 --> 24:42.960
and it passed NASA's requirements

570
24:42.960 --> 24:45.690
for in-flight space capability.

571
24:45.690 --> 24:48.630
So we launched that onto the International Space Station,

572
24:48.630 --> 24:52.560
and we've run a number of experiments with customers

573
24:52.560 --> 24:55.410
like SpiderOak and the banking industry,

574
24:55.410 --> 24:58.740
and other companies, including in Japan

575
24:58.740 --> 25:02.427
that are supporting, JAXA, on what edge computing

576
25:02.427 --> 25:04.950
and space means in an on orbit space station.

577
25:04.950 --> 25:06.120
So those are a couple of things

578
25:06.120 --> 25:08.730
that we've been working on over the last couple of years.

579
25:08.730 --> 25:11.250
<v ->Thank you. That's very helpful and a very nice transition.</v>

580
25:11.250 --> 25:13.890
Dr. Lee, you've been doing some very interesting work

581
25:13.890 --> 25:15.600
in terms of using, you know,

582
25:15.600 --> 25:18.600
relatively low cost pedestrian devices

583
25:18.600 --> 25:20.370
to connect into IoT solutions.

584
25:20.370 --> 25:21.780
Love to hear about what you're doing

585
25:21.780 --> 25:23.490
and where you see that going.

586
25:23.490 --> 25:26.310
<v ->Yeah, but actually for the space based connectivity,</v>

587
25:26.310 --> 25:28.803
just to provide the various application,

588
25:29.730 --> 25:34.440
not only the IoT service, also observation data, relay,

589
25:34.440 --> 25:38.583
also the 5GNTN or D2D service,

590
25:39.450 --> 25:42.087
actually I'm also the CEO of the APSI.

591
25:42.087 --> 25:45.990
The APSI, I just would like to do one examples,

592
25:45.990 --> 25:48.570
we just manufacturing the satellite mobile phone.

593
25:48.570 --> 25:52.410
We just co-work with the direct communication and Inmarsat.

594
25:52.410 --> 25:56.040
So nowadays, our partner just suggested,

595
25:56.040 --> 25:58.350
why don't you make the MBI IoT

596
25:58.350 --> 25:59.790
on the satellite mobile phone?

597
25:59.790 --> 26:02.490
We just try to make a certain standard.

598
26:02.490 --> 26:07.490
So in the near future, I think, now with the 5G,

599
26:07.890 --> 26:10.590
in the near future, we just have the service

600
26:10.590 --> 26:13.320
for the 6GNTN, stuff like that.

601
26:13.320 --> 26:16.890
In that case, actually space based connectivity just

602
26:16.890 --> 26:21.890
provide the 24 hours, 365 days, D2D service, over the world.

603
26:24.630 --> 26:29.010
So I think, for this reason that we just try

604
26:29.010 --> 26:31.440
to make the certain standard

605
26:31.440 --> 26:36.440
with our Korea Electric Telecommunication Institute

606
26:36.450 --> 26:38.280
maybe the three years later,

607
26:38.280 --> 26:41.910
maybe we be just make our standard

608
26:41.910 --> 26:44.580
with the other country.

609
26:44.580 --> 26:49.170
So yeah, in the case we just have the more,

610
26:49.170 --> 26:53.910
the useful space based connectivity with our mobile phone.

611
26:53.910 --> 26:56.310
We just provide the D2D service.

612
26:56.310 --> 26:58.293
Also in terms of IoT service,

613
26:59.370 --> 27:03.830
in case of the Singapore, also in South Korea, the ministry

614
27:03.830 --> 27:05.957
of the transportation, they just try to make some

615
27:05.957 --> 27:09.390
of the IoT sensor, whole smart city.

616
27:09.390 --> 27:12.120
Or when satellite passed by our country,

617
27:12.120 --> 27:16.260
we just scanning whole of the IoT data with the satellite.

618
27:16.260 --> 27:18.870
And the satellite just also dropped down,

619
27:18.870 --> 27:23.730
drop the whole data to the data center, the ground station,

620
27:23.730 --> 27:25.590
and then we just correct,

621
27:25.590 --> 27:27.780
then we just analysis those current data

622
27:27.780 --> 27:31.833
with the space connectivity service, yeah.

623
27:32.940 --> 27:34.980
<v ->Please, Rika, go ahead.</v>

624
27:34.980 --> 27:38.400
<v ->Since you mentioned our collaboration with JSAT,</v>

625
27:38.400 --> 27:41.370
there is also this, it's not a new technology.

626
27:41.370 --> 27:43.740
Optical data relay is not a new thing,

627
27:43.740 --> 27:45.690
but in the space sector it's going

628
27:45.690 --> 27:46.980
to create some breakthroughs,

629
27:46.980 --> 27:49.650
because optical data relay, so we have a partnership

630
27:49.650 --> 27:52.230
with JSAT, a venture called Space Compass.

631
27:52.230 --> 27:55.050
So it's a joint venture between NTT and JSAT.

632
27:55.050 --> 27:56.310
And the idea is to be able

633
27:56.310 --> 27:58.230
to do optical data relay in space,

634
27:58.230 --> 28:00.300
which will bring down the latency

635
28:00.300 --> 28:01.680
and increase the throughput,

636
28:01.680 --> 28:04.800
and also obviate some of the challenges we have with RF,

637
28:04.800 --> 28:08.130
and being able to bring things back down to Earth.

638
28:08.130 --> 28:11.280
So there's the optical data relay innovation.

639
28:11.280 --> 28:14.100
And then the other piece that we are also looking at is

640
28:14.100 --> 28:17.580
in the high altitude platform system orbit.

641
28:17.580 --> 28:21.030
So it's really about a multi orbit strategy and connectivity

642
28:21.030 --> 28:23.460
and being able to have sort

643
28:23.460 --> 28:26.670
of a high availability consideration across multi orbit.

644
28:26.670 --> 28:29.070
So for us, we're working on HAPS,

645
28:29.070 --> 28:31.080
high altitude platform system devices

646
28:31.080 --> 28:33.660
with, there's a couple of providers,

647
28:33.660 --> 28:36.120
you know who they are if you're in the ecosystem.

648
28:36.120 --> 28:38.400
And so we do believe that HAPS is also

649
28:38.400 --> 28:40.470
gonna bring some very important breakthroughs

650
28:40.470 --> 28:43.410
as it relates to the private sector applications

651
28:43.410 --> 28:46.830
around, again, remote sensing and Earth observation.

652
28:46.830 --> 28:50.400
So I just wanted to make sure I mentioned those things too.

653
28:50.400 --> 28:51.233
<v ->Thank you, Rika.</v>

654
28:51.233 --> 28:52.830
We're gonna jump into a couple more topics,

655
28:52.830 --> 28:54.090
but I was gonna do a pause now

656
28:54.090 --> 28:57.000
to see if there's any questions, anything audience wanted

657
28:57.000 --> 28:59.130
to add on what we've covered so far.

658
28:59.130 --> 29:00.600
If you do, please raise your hands.

659
29:00.600 --> 29:01.890
We have lights pointed at our eyes.

660
29:01.890 --> 29:03.340
It's a little hard to see up.

661
29:06.630 --> 29:08.100
Okay, we'll move on.

662
29:08.100 --> 29:10.830
Rika, you alluded to this, part

663
29:10.830 --> 29:13.350
of the current explosive growth in data centers

664
29:13.350 --> 29:15.510
and AI/ML applications is

665
29:15.510 --> 29:17.910
that it's placing some significant strain

666
29:17.910 --> 29:20.970
on terrestrial networks, computational resources, storage,

667
29:20.970 --> 29:23.040
power generation, and the like,

668
29:23.040 --> 29:28.040
how can space-based enabled data centers, compute,

669
29:28.560 --> 29:29.550
and other solutions,

670
29:29.550 --> 29:34.550
how can that have essentially a positive, innovative sort

671
29:35.040 --> 29:38.130
of impact on trying to solve that on the planet,

672
29:38.130 --> 29:39.660
and also enables space to space

673
29:39.660 --> 29:43.380
and space to beyond type solutions, which may sound esoteric

674
29:43.380 --> 29:46.593
and sort of Star Wars now, but may not be as much?

675
29:47.430 --> 29:48.660
You wanna start with that Rika?

676
29:48.660 --> 29:51.090
<v ->Yeah, the energy consumption that's needed.</v>

677
29:51.090 --> 29:53.280
So as I mentioned, when I was at Nvidia

678
29:53.280 --> 29:55.560
and we were working on the Tegra chip,

679
29:55.560 --> 29:56.940
first it was GoForce,

680
29:56.940 --> 29:59.490
which is a discreet GPU on a board in a phone.

681
29:59.490 --> 30:02.730
And then we moved to an application processor architecture.

682
30:02.730 --> 30:04.140
The problem was the heat

683
30:04.140 --> 30:07.140
and energy consumption envelope, which are related,

684
30:07.140 --> 30:09.750
because when you have this high compute,

685
30:09.750 --> 30:11.550
that creates a tremendous amount of heat.

686
30:11.550 --> 30:14.220
So you need energy as well to cool things down.

687
30:14.220 --> 30:16.740
So there's a lot of innovations happening in data centers

688
30:16.740 --> 30:18.375
to be able to address that challenge.

689
30:18.375 --> 30:21.300
But regardless, there is an expectation depending

690
30:21.300 --> 30:22.950
on who you talk to, which analysts you talked to

691
30:22.950 --> 30:26.130
around this, that the energy consumption is gonna far

692
30:26.130 --> 30:28.800
outweigh the ability to provide those energy resources.

693
30:28.800 --> 30:31.860
So there's some interesting things

694
30:31.860 --> 30:33.750
that are happening in the nuclear energy space.

695
30:33.750 --> 30:35.880
So that's coming back up again,

696
30:35.880 --> 30:38.130
thinking about how we can meet those demands.

697
30:38.130 --> 30:40.770
But in the meantime, some of the other ideas,

698
30:40.770 --> 30:42.510
and a couple of interesting startups

699
30:42.510 --> 30:45.300
that are working on this and VCs that are funding them, is

700
30:45.300 --> 30:46.500
around the idea of being able

701
30:46.500 --> 30:50.730
to bring the data center high compute capabilities

702
30:50.730 --> 30:52.350
into space, because it's kind

703
30:52.350 --> 30:54.900
of cold up there, most of space.

704
30:54.900 --> 30:57.720
So except when you get near the sun, but regardless,

705
30:57.720 --> 30:59.100
and the sun has a part to play in this,

706
30:59.100 --> 31:02.490
because sun can provide energy, right?

707
31:02.490 --> 31:04.230
So solar energy, being able to do that.

708
31:04.230 --> 31:07.380
So there's some interesting work happening

709
31:07.380 --> 31:11.700
on how do we put sort of these micro data center concepts

710
31:11.700 --> 31:15.840
that can also have solar panel arrays attached to them.

711
31:15.840 --> 31:19.050
And if you can angle these data centers in such a way

712
31:19.050 --> 31:23.610
to have 24 hour access or exposure to solar panel,

713
31:23.610 --> 31:24.690
now you're starting to be able

714
31:24.690 --> 31:28.170
to have the idea of heat sink using components

715
31:28.170 --> 31:30.600
and physics that's beyond me at the moment.

716
31:30.600 --> 31:31.980
I hope I'll get there soon,

717
31:31.980 --> 31:35.310
but it's to be able to use the natural situation

718
31:35.310 --> 31:39.660
in space along with the solar energy supply

719
31:39.660 --> 31:42.480
to be able to enable the compute that's needed.

720
31:42.480 --> 31:44.130
And then of course, it's a matter

721
31:44.130 --> 31:46.230
of thinking about the ground station ecosystem

722
31:46.230 --> 31:49.410
that also needs to start evolving and taking shape.

723
31:49.410 --> 31:52.350
And, you know, I just wanna give a plug to Clint

724
31:52.350 --> 31:54.630
and his team at AWS, you know,

725
31:54.630 --> 31:56.640
such an easy partner to work with,

726
31:56.640 --> 31:58.230
because they're so progressive

727
31:58.230 --> 32:00.420
thinking about what do we do together

728
32:00.420 --> 32:01.800
to co-innovate around this.

729
32:01.800 --> 32:03.300
And so I think it really is

730
32:03.300 --> 32:05.040
about bringing all these players together

731
32:05.040 --> 32:06.810
that are leaning in to the process.

732
32:06.810 --> 32:09.060
And with Blue Origin, by the way, of getting ready

733
32:09.060 --> 32:11.040
to have a milestone month, I'm sure

734
32:11.040 --> 32:13.170
that Amazon in general is very excited

735
32:13.170 --> 32:15.390
about what the future is going to hold.

736
32:15.390 --> 32:19.839
But data centers in space, by some people's estimates,

737
32:19.839 --> 32:22.530
is going to happen within the next, you know, five

738
32:22.530 --> 32:24.270
to 10 years potentially.

739
32:24.270 --> 32:28.260
And so, it starts to relieve some of the demands

740
32:28.260 --> 32:30.540
around energy and some of the heat issues.

741
32:30.540 --> 32:32.940
Also from a cost perspective,

742
32:32.940 --> 32:34.920
there are some calculations that are done.

743
32:34.920 --> 32:37.380
If you just look up cost of data centers in space,

744
32:37.380 --> 32:38.610
you'll find some calculations

745
32:38.610 --> 32:41.970
that have been done about the total cost of ownership

746
32:41.970 --> 32:45.390
of running data centers in space, is apparently much less

747
32:45.390 --> 32:47.340
than if you're trying to build it terrestrially.

748
32:47.340 --> 32:50.160
So we'll see how this all, how the dust settles on it,

749
32:50.160 --> 32:53.850
but it's a pretty sexy cool area to keep an eye on.

750
32:53.850 --> 32:55.410
<v ->Yeah, if I can piggyback on that, Rika,</v>

751
32:55.410 --> 32:57.210
and thanks for the kind words,

752
32:57.210 --> 33:01.080
and NTT is a wonderful organization to work with as well,

753
33:01.080 --> 33:03.150
but as we think about data centers in space,

754
33:03.150 --> 33:05.190
micro data centers, you made a good point earlier.

755
33:05.190 --> 33:07.650
You know, we shouldn't jump directly to, you know,

756
33:07.650 --> 33:10.410
we think about a very large scale data center here on Earth

757
33:10.410 --> 33:12.180
and what it looks like and suddenly we're trying

758
33:12.180 --> 33:14.070
to lift that into space, that has all sorts

759
33:14.070 --> 33:15.540
of issues associated with it.

760
33:15.540 --> 33:18.900
However, when you think about micro data centers,

761
33:18.900 --> 33:20.940
you could have a single satellite

762
33:20.940 --> 33:23.370
or a 10 ball constellation of satellites

763
33:23.370 --> 33:26.130
that could in fact serve the basic function

764
33:26.130 --> 33:28.620
of a micro data center in space depending

765
33:28.620 --> 33:30.450
on what the use case is, right?

766
33:30.450 --> 33:33.270
So you start small based on the use cases

767
33:33.270 --> 33:34.560
and you grow from there.

768
33:34.560 --> 33:38.670
And that's focusing on the space

769
33:38.670 --> 33:41.430
for Earth capabilities that you were talking about.

770
33:41.430 --> 33:44.450
Now if I turn my lens and I think about space for space,

771
33:44.450 --> 33:47.010
so the space economy, as an example,

772
33:47.010 --> 33:50.340
right now today NASA's perseverance Rover is operating

773
33:50.340 --> 33:52.830
on the surface of Mars and it's beaming data,

774
33:52.830 --> 33:55.590
300 million miles all the way back to Earth.

775
33:55.590 --> 33:58.500
And it's being processed on the AWS cloud

776
33:58.500 --> 34:02.550
so that the rover can be given instructions on where to go

777
34:02.550 --> 34:04.590
and where to drill and what analysis to do

778
34:04.590 --> 34:08.100
in its next set of passes.

779
34:08.100 --> 34:11.640
Think about that, a 300 million mile journey from Mars

780
34:11.640 --> 34:13.710
to the earth to process the data to send it down

781
34:13.710 --> 34:16.680
to Mars again, as we grow all these future missions,

782
34:16.680 --> 34:19.290
again, human encampments on the moon,

783
34:19.290 --> 34:20.730
human encampments on Mars,

784
34:20.730 --> 34:23.340
asteroid mining, in-space manufacturing,

785
34:23.340 --> 34:26.910
we simply cannot afford to port all the data back to Earth

786
34:26.910 --> 34:29.400
and process it and then push it back to space again.

787
34:29.400 --> 34:31.530
We're going to have to have cloud computing

788
34:31.530 --> 34:34.410
and advanced technology capabilities available on orbit.

789
34:34.410 --> 34:37.560
And so that's what starts to look like micro data centers

790
34:37.560 --> 34:39.900
on an international space station

791
34:39.900 --> 34:43.050
or on an Axiom space station, my friends at Axiom,

792
34:43.050 --> 34:46.230
or amongst the first set of infrastructure

793
34:46.230 --> 34:49.500
and habitat on the moon as we do human encampments,

794
34:49.500 --> 34:51.840
how do we store and process data on the surface

795
34:51.840 --> 34:54.390
of the moon rather than having to port it back?

796
34:54.390 --> 34:56.340
So these things have a number of areas

797
34:56.340 --> 34:57.660
where they all tie together

798
34:57.660 --> 35:01.110
and come back together again, which is really interesting.

799
35:01.110 --> 35:04.080
Rika also mentioned optical,

800
35:04.080 --> 35:06.900
which I think is just a really exciting technology,

801
35:06.900 --> 35:09.480
and we're gonna see the optical industry grow

802
35:09.480 --> 35:11.670
by leaps and bounds in the coming years.

803
35:11.670 --> 35:14.280
Not only optical inter satellite links,

804
35:14.280 --> 35:16.200
but optical space to ground links,

805
35:16.200 --> 35:17.760
because of the data requirements

806
35:17.760 --> 35:20.370
and improvements as you described a moment ago.

807
35:20.370 --> 35:22.920
So that's one that we're very excited about,

808
35:22.920 --> 35:25.470
but my friend, Dr. Lee, mentioned as well,

809
35:25.470 --> 35:27.510
direct to device capabilities.

810
35:27.510 --> 35:28.620
And then you start to think

811
35:28.620 --> 35:33.060
about the virtualization requirements for direct to device.

812
35:33.060 --> 35:37.200
And this is where optical and micro data centers

813
35:37.200 --> 35:41.070
and direct to device and virtualization all comes in,

814
35:41.070 --> 35:43.920
because we can't live in the same environment in the past

815
35:43.920 --> 35:47.220
where we hardwired radios to satellites

816
35:47.220 --> 35:48.990
to ground systems, right?

817
35:48.990 --> 35:52.440
We won't be able to interop from GEO to LEO to MEO

818
35:52.440 --> 35:56.130
from IR to SAR and every, from satcom.

819
35:56.130 --> 35:58.860
And so we're going to have to continue

820
35:58.860 --> 36:00.780
to develop more software-defined radios,

821
36:00.780 --> 36:02.100
software-defined networks,

822
36:02.100 --> 36:03.690
software-defined network management,

823
36:03.690 --> 36:06.150
software integration systems,

824
36:06.150 --> 36:08.280
and we're working a number of those at AWS.

825
36:08.280 --> 36:10.530
So those are some of the underlying technologies

826
36:10.530 --> 36:11.970
that are gonna be required.

827
36:11.970 --> 36:15.000
And then finally, my friend, Rika, mentioned digital twin.

828
36:15.000 --> 36:17.280
I just wanna make a quick note on digital twin.

829
36:17.280 --> 36:19.710
We believe digital twin is going to be critical

830
36:19.710 --> 36:22.350
to managing all of these networks for the future.

831
36:22.350 --> 36:24.630
You're talking about making a digital twin of the earth,

832
36:24.630 --> 36:27.120
which can be powerful in so many ways,

833
36:27.120 --> 36:31.657
but now think about the micro data centers,

834
36:32.640 --> 36:34.770
think about the satellite connectivity,

835
36:34.770 --> 36:37.560
think about the earth to space systems,

836
36:37.560 --> 36:38.910
the ground link systems,

837
36:38.910 --> 36:40.980
all the satellites that'll be interconnected.

838
36:40.980 --> 36:44.670
And how do you simulate that? How do you virtualize that?

839
36:44.670 --> 36:47.430
How do you visualize that? How do you orchestrate that?

840
36:47.430 --> 36:50.250
How do you optimize that for optical interface

841
36:50.250 --> 36:51.600
amongst all those device?

842
36:51.600 --> 36:55.290
And so we're doing a lot of work building out digital twins

843
36:55.290 --> 36:59.910
of network capacity that's modeling between constellations

844
36:59.910 --> 37:02.250
and ground stations, and ground systems,

845
37:02.250 --> 37:04.260
and multi-data paths,

846
37:04.260 --> 37:07.020
so that we can leverage digital twin capability

847
37:07.020 --> 37:09.360
to make the best decisions about how to build

848
37:09.360 --> 37:12.990
and operate those complex multi systems.

849
37:12.990 --> 37:14.648
And that's really exciting too.

850
37:14.648 --> 37:15.751
<v ->Collision avoidance.</v>

851
37:15.751 --> 37:18.300
<v ->Collision avoidance, I mean, again, when we talk</v>

852
37:18.300 --> 37:20.940
about there's some 9,000 satellites on orbit today,

853
37:20.940 --> 37:23.460
and we're gonna have 50 to 100 satellites on orbit

854
37:23.460 --> 37:27.000
by 2030 depending on the study, the sheer magnitude,

855
37:27.000 --> 37:30.570
and by the way, time, latency requirements, right?

856
37:30.570 --> 37:33.300
You can't afford, when you quadruple the number

857
37:33.300 --> 37:35.370
of satellites on orbit, you can't afford

858
37:35.370 --> 37:39.240
to do all your orbital deconfliction on the ground in two

859
37:39.240 --> 37:42.690
to four hours when you're talking about that number

860
37:42.690 --> 37:44.250
of satellites suddenly operating

861
37:44.250 --> 37:45.810
in essentially the same space.

862
37:45.810 --> 37:47.670
Now space is big, I get it.

863
37:47.670 --> 37:49.020
But we have to be really careful

864
37:49.020 --> 37:50.490
about space flight management,

865
37:50.490 --> 37:52.800
if we're gonna ensure space is sustainable

866
37:52.800 --> 37:54.540
for the future and ensure sustainability.

867
37:54.540 --> 37:58.200
<v ->Yeah, if anyone's flying United back or anytime soon,</v>

868
37:58.200 --> 38:00.990
there's a documentary called "Wild Wild Space."

869
38:00.990 --> 38:02.460
I highly recommend you watch it,

870
38:02.460 --> 38:04.350
and please don't start freaking out

871
38:04.350 --> 38:06.330
when you hear about the Kessler effect.

872
38:06.330 --> 38:07.690
I'll just leave that there. So.

873
38:07.690 --> 38:08.523
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Thank you, Rika.</v>

874
38:08.523 --> 38:10.590
<v ->Space is still big, but it's gonna get smaller</v>

875
38:10.590 --> 38:12.060
and smaller as we proliferate more

876
38:12.060 --> 38:13.170
and more satellites on orbit,

877
38:13.170 --> 38:16.590
and digital twins, virtualization, network management,

878
38:16.590 --> 38:20.010
reduced latency and on orbit processing in many ways,

879
38:20.010 --> 38:21.630
automated threat detection,

880
38:21.630 --> 38:23.970
automated collision maneuver avoidance,

881
38:23.970 --> 38:25.830
are gonna be key to the future.

882
38:25.830 --> 38:26.885
<v ->Thank you.</v>

883
38:26.885 --> 38:27.718
For those of you interested in, you know,

884
38:27.718 --> 38:29.490
the reality or soon to be reality

885
38:29.490 --> 38:31.620
of in-space processing data centers,

886
38:31.620 --> 38:33.570
look up a company called Lumen Orbit.

887
38:33.570 --> 38:35.460
Look up the EU's program called ASCEND,

888
38:35.460 --> 38:37.560
which is a live study with Thales Alenia Space

889
38:37.560 --> 38:40.140
to see how quickly this can be deployed.

890
38:40.140 --> 38:41.850
We're out of time, but I would like to wrap up

891
38:41.850 --> 38:45.633
with one very short answer from each one of you.

892
38:46.620 --> 38:48.870
You're in Vegas. This is where people make wishes.

893
38:48.870 --> 38:51.120
Take some gambles, things happen, they don't.

894
38:52.050 --> 38:54.360
Your wishlist, a single technology

895
38:54.360 --> 38:58.770
or a single innovation that you think will be a game changer

896
38:58.770 --> 39:01.560
for the role of space and satellite

897
39:01.560 --> 39:04.950
in enabling compute data centers or the cloud.

898
39:04.950 --> 39:08.160
Let's start with you Dr. Lee. Short answer.

899
39:08.160 --> 39:09.513
<v ->Short answer is,</v>

900
39:12.390 --> 39:13.323
how can I say?

901
39:16.395 --> 39:17.880
How can we just try

902
39:17.880 --> 39:20.910
to design and manufacture in the new rocket

903
39:20.910 --> 39:25.910
to launch the in-space data center, yeah?

904
39:26.190 --> 39:27.570
<v ->All right, so better, cheaper,</v>

905
39:27.570 --> 39:29.370
more powerful access to space.

906
39:29.370 --> 39:31.013
<v ->Right.</v>
<v ->All right, Rika?</v>

907
39:31.013 --> 39:35.160
<v ->I think it has to be an agentic AI touchstone that is able</v>

908
39:35.160 --> 39:39.390
to parse all the data that's gonna come from remote sensing,

909
39:39.390 --> 39:42.840
Earth observation, that will tell industries and companies

910
39:42.840 --> 39:46.473
and governments how to manage for climate resilience.

911
39:48.240 --> 39:50.160
<v ->I agree with both of those answers.</v>

912
39:50.160 --> 39:51.900
I think those are wonderful answers.

913
39:51.900 --> 39:54.420
My head initially went to what we're spending a lot

914
39:54.420 --> 39:57.870
of time on at AWS, and that's generative AI

915
39:57.870 --> 40:00.150
or generative artificial intelligence.

916
40:00.150 --> 40:04.260
We are in early days of AI, just basic AI, right?

917
40:04.260 --> 40:07.560
Traditional AI, we're in early days, and it blows me away.

918
40:07.560 --> 40:10.707
It's extraordinary the ways that NTT, and Contec,

919
40:10.707 --> 40:12.210
and other companies are starting

920
40:12.210 --> 40:14.400
to use capabilities like AI, ML,

921
40:14.400 --> 40:16.740
and now we think about generative AI,

922
40:16.740 --> 40:18.720
which is AI on steroids

923
40:18.720 --> 40:21.390
and the ability to develop wholly new concepts

924
40:21.390 --> 40:24.180
and thought processes with our artificial intelligence.

925
40:24.180 --> 40:27.513
That's super exciting for what it portends for the future.

926
40:28.380 --> 40:29.213
<v ->Thank you.</v>

927
40:29.213 --> 40:32.160
Well, audience, please join me in thanking Sunghee, Rika,

928
40:32.160 --> 40:33.853
and Clint for this wonderful panel.

929
40:33.853 --> 40:35.286
(audience claps)

930
40:35.286 --> 40:38.453
(bright upbeat music)
