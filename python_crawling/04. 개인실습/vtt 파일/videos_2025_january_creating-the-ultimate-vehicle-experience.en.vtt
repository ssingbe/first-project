00:00.312 --> 00:02.979
(upbeat music)

00:10.800 --> 00:13.140
<v Chris>Well, we're in session three now of Connect2Car,</v>

00:13.140 --> 00:15.150
celebrating our 25th anniversary.

00:15.150 --> 00:17.700
How many of you were in the last session?

00:17.700 --> 00:18.533
Excellent.

00:18.533 --> 00:21.052
This is gonna be even better.

00:21.052 --> 00:23.340
(audience laughing)

00:23.340 --> 00:27.510
Because Matt Jones is here to moderate.

00:27.510 --> 00:30.150
Mr. Global from Ford.

00:30.150 --> 00:35.150
And I met Matt at Angelo's Pizza in New York City.

00:35.280 --> 00:37.200
He was speaking at our Connect2Car

00:37.200 --> 00:38.670
that we did in New York City,

00:38.670 --> 00:42.120
and I watched him down a pizza that had pineapple on it.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.816
So, those of you that are purest-

00:43.816 --> 00:44.790
<v Matt>Pineapple and pepperoni.</v>

00:44.790 --> 00:45.840
<v Chris>Pineapple and pepperoni.</v>

00:45.840 --> 00:48.060
They actually work well together,

00:48.060 --> 00:50.400
even though it's in New York City

00:50.400 --> 00:51.570
and we're having pineapple pizza.

00:51.570 --> 00:55.530
But, Matt, this is gonna be a great panel.

00:55.530 --> 00:57.990
I'm gonna look forward to this one as well.

00:57.990 --> 01:01.140
So, Matt, I'm gonna let you take this one away.

01:01.140 --> 01:01.973
<v ->I appreciate it.</v>

01:01.973 --> 01:03.480
Thank you so much.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.313
Thanks for joining,

01:04.313 --> 01:07.140
especially after joining Ellis in the previous panel.

01:07.140 --> 01:09.284
You may have noticed me run up to the stage

01:09.284 --> 01:10.860
and swap out with Chris.

01:10.860 --> 01:14.160
I was just getting briefed by my PR person from Ford.

01:14.160 --> 01:16.770
So today I will not have opinions,

01:16.770 --> 01:20.220
but I will subtly indicate where I have opinions.

01:20.220 --> 01:22.410
Help me with this as an audience.

01:22.410 --> 01:23.823
It's really important to me.

01:24.810 --> 01:25.860
But more important to me,

01:25.860 --> 01:27.840
I'm just gonna be moderating this panel,

01:27.840 --> 01:29.070
which is really asking the questions,

01:29.070 --> 01:31.350
trying to turn it into a conversation

01:31.350 --> 01:35.940
more than just a set of fixed answers that we've got.

01:35.940 --> 01:38.940
Because if we think about what we're talking about,

01:38.940 --> 01:40.413
this is like experience.

01:41.250 --> 01:44.220
This is what we will have, what our families will have,

01:44.220 --> 01:45.420
what our friends will have.

01:45.420 --> 01:47.340
Everything that we're looking at

01:47.340 --> 01:49.263
in automotive in the future years.

01:50.400 --> 01:53.820
And if you just rewind 20 years, and believe it or not,

01:53.820 --> 01:57.544
I think this is, like, my 19th or 20th CES.

01:57.544 --> 01:59.940
If you look at what was on the market there

01:59.940 --> 02:03.450
with Chris and the aftermarket and Sony head units coming in

02:03.450 --> 02:04.623
and where we are now,

02:05.550 --> 02:07.650
and if you think about where we are potentially going

02:07.650 --> 02:09.120
with autonomous vehicles,

02:09.120 --> 02:11.550
all the extra entertainment systems,

02:11.550 --> 02:14.490
Scout today announcing satellite communications

02:14.490 --> 02:15.323
in the vehicles,

02:15.323 --> 02:18.450
there's an awful long way that we've still got to go.

02:18.450 --> 02:19.920
But this is technology,

02:19.920 --> 02:21.480
and hopefully from the panel today,

02:21.480 --> 02:22.770
we're gonna hear about

02:22.770 --> 02:24.600
what we've achieved in the last 20 years,

02:24.600 --> 02:26.600
we should be able to do 10 times faster.

02:28.020 --> 02:31.500
And in reality, we have to 'cause our expectations,

02:31.500 --> 02:33.630
you've heard me say it a thousand times,

02:33.630 --> 02:36.963
are really being set by the mobile device experiences,

02:37.860 --> 02:39.600
the different digital technologies

02:39.600 --> 02:41.370
we're seeing in other industries.

02:41.370 --> 02:44.370
So how can we leverage that and move forwards together?

02:44.370 --> 02:46.680
But enough of the introduction.

02:46.680 --> 02:48.990
Rebeca, would you like to introduce yourself first?

02:48.990 --> 02:49.823
<v ->For sure.</v>

02:49.823 --> 02:51.060
Thank you, everyone, for being here.

02:51.060 --> 02:53.490
Very happy to be here, Matt, and everybody.

02:53.490 --> 02:54.720
My name is Rebeca Delgado.

02:54.720 --> 02:57.260
I'm the CTO for Intel Automotive.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.816
At Intel, we're very focused on how to accelerate

02:59.816 --> 03:02.759
what we're calling software-defined done right

03:02.759 --> 03:05.708
precisely to enable these new experiences

03:05.708 --> 03:09.360
that our consumers and customers crave.

03:09.360 --> 03:11.430
So very excited to be here today

03:11.430 --> 03:13.680
and, you know, having some of these

03:13.680 --> 03:17.043
very important conversations on how we get there together.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.136
<v ->Hi, everybody.</v>

03:20.136 --> 03:21.900
Thanks again, yes, for being here.

03:21.900 --> 03:23.310
My name is Parrish Hanna.

03:23.310 --> 03:26.582
I'm a director within the Capgemini automotive practice

03:26.582 --> 03:28.380
in North America.

03:28.380 --> 03:31.260
We're leading management and technology consultancy

03:31.260 --> 03:34.350
that combines strategy, technology, data science,

03:34.350 --> 03:37.830
creative design and engineering expertise,

03:37.830 --> 03:41.213
hopefully coming out with innovative outputs.

03:41.213 --> 03:42.810
I'm fortunate 'cause I get to work

03:42.810 --> 03:44.730
on kind of transformative,

03:44.730 --> 03:47.745
innovative topics with OEMs and tier ones,

03:47.745 --> 03:51.253
in particular, next gen vehicles, ecosystems,

03:51.253 --> 03:53.670
experience roadmaps, those kind of things,

03:53.670 --> 03:56.580
everything we're gonna be touching upon

03:56.580 --> 03:58.560
and how fast it's gonna go.

03:58.560 --> 04:01.050
I have a formal background in industrial product design

04:01.050 --> 04:01.950
and software development.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.110
So the physical-digital sweet spot

04:04.110 --> 04:06.336
is definitely where I like to play.

04:06.336 --> 04:08.370
And over my 30-year career,

04:08.370 --> 04:10.477
I've worked for a handful of corporations

04:10.477 --> 04:12.346
and consulting companies,

04:12.346 --> 04:14.010
covering a couple different verticals,

04:14.010 --> 04:16.860
including consumer electronics, telecom, and automotive.

04:16.860 --> 04:18.660
So, thankful to be here.

04:18.660 --> 04:20.889
Always happy to fill the 2025 cup

04:20.889 --> 04:24.055
with optimism and inspiration and hard work.

04:24.055 --> 04:26.283
So, thanks.

04:27.390 --> 04:28.410
<v ->Hi, everyone.</v>

04:28.410 --> 04:29.460
I'm Arianne Walker.

04:29.460 --> 04:32.070
I'm the chief evangelist for Amazon Smart Vehicles.

04:32.070 --> 04:33.675
I'm thrilled to be here today.

04:33.675 --> 04:36.061
And we really, you probably know,

04:36.061 --> 04:39.780
are focused on the in-vehicle experience.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.220
So inside the cabin of the car,

04:41.220 --> 04:44.460
specifically around the voice assistant

04:44.460 --> 04:46.189
and really working on collaborating

04:46.189 --> 04:48.030
with automakers and suppliers

04:48.030 --> 04:51.210
to create great experiences for customers

04:51.210 --> 04:53.140
so that they can be productive and entertained

04:53.140 --> 04:54.773
while on the drive.

04:54.773 --> 04:58.140
I'll just mention one specific example quickly,

04:58.140 --> 05:00.090
well, I'm sure we'll talk more about it as we go.

05:00.090 --> 05:03.636
But we launched with BMW last year

05:03.636 --> 05:06.306
their intelligent personal assistant,

05:06.306 --> 05:10.020
which is built on the Alexa Custom Assistant technology

05:10.020 --> 05:12.030
or what we call ACA.

05:12.030 --> 05:15.930
And that has been, you know, wonderful for customers,

05:15.930 --> 05:17.965
but we're taking it now to the next level,

05:17.965 --> 05:22.080
adding in large language models and generative AI.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.090
And that'll be coming later this year.

05:24.090 --> 05:25.410
But we're at CES,

05:25.410 --> 05:27.180
so you don't have to wait to see it.

05:27.180 --> 05:29.880
You can actually see it in action in the Venetian

05:29.880 --> 05:32.100
if you get a chance to go over there

05:32.100 --> 05:33.587
where we're actually showing off

05:33.587 --> 05:36.870
how we can sort of level up these experiences,

05:36.870 --> 05:39.270
particularly around the space in navigation,

05:39.270 --> 05:41.610
trip planning, and points of interest

05:41.610 --> 05:43.860
to really be able to leverage all the great technology

05:43.860 --> 05:45.813
for a fantastic customer experience.

05:47.850 --> 05:50.730
<v ->And rounding it out is, my name is Tim Yerdon.</v>

05:50.730 --> 05:52.650
I am with SAE ITC,

05:52.650 --> 05:54.930
which is industry technology consortia,

05:54.930 --> 05:58.260
which is an affiliate of the broader SAE family,

05:58.260 --> 06:01.140
which is really focused on bringing industry together

06:01.140 --> 06:02.430
to solve industry problems.

06:02.430 --> 06:04.830
So when you think about large technical problems

06:04.830 --> 06:07.710
that a company, whether it be a tier one or a tier two

06:07.710 --> 06:09.420
or within the ecosystem

06:09.420 --> 06:11.730
as we'll talk about in a little bit,

06:11.730 --> 06:13.350
they wouldn't solve on their own.

06:13.350 --> 06:16.050
How does somebody like SAE as a family

06:16.050 --> 06:17.460
bring these companies together

06:17.460 --> 06:20.880
to actually develop best practices, write standards?

06:20.880 --> 06:22.590
So we're not doing iterative work,

06:22.590 --> 06:25.410
wasting precious engineering resources

06:25.410 --> 06:27.420
and competing against one another.

06:27.420 --> 06:29.580
It's how do we move faster quicker

06:29.580 --> 06:33.630
and deploy technology in a way that is very experiential.

06:33.630 --> 06:35.490
So with that...

06:35.490 --> 06:36.510
<v ->Well, following that,</v>

06:36.510 --> 06:38.520
I guess, Tim, we're gonna go to you first.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.080
And if you think about my introduction

06:40.080 --> 06:43.410
where we've got all of these rapidly evolving experiences,

06:43.410 --> 06:45.780
you've just heard from the panelists that we've got a range

06:45.780 --> 06:49.890
of different parts of this massive automotive ecosystem.

06:49.890 --> 06:52.140
I think everybody here knows that without silicon,

06:52.140 --> 06:54.360
without software, without the cloud,

06:54.360 --> 06:57.360
without tier ones, without OEMs, there's nothing.

06:57.360 --> 07:01.320
How do we foster and actually drive the collaboration

07:01.320 --> 07:03.600
across all of these different parts, Tim?

07:03.600 --> 07:04.680
<v ->Yeah, great question.</v>

07:04.680 --> 07:06.390
And, you know, I think for many of us

07:06.390 --> 07:07.500
that have been in this industry

07:07.500 --> 07:09.720
or around this industry for a long period of time,

07:09.720 --> 07:12.780
the traditional hierarchy old model is dying.

07:12.780 --> 07:15.510
You know, the pyramid structure of, you know, the OEM

07:15.510 --> 07:17.697
to the tier one, to the tier two,

07:17.697 --> 07:19.980
to the various service providers is going away

07:19.980 --> 07:21.480
for, you know, multiple reasons.

07:21.480 --> 07:23.370
Back to what you mentioned about adopting

07:23.370 --> 07:26.130
a lot of the consumer electronic best practices.

07:26.130 --> 07:28.080
We have to work in an ecosystem,

07:28.080 --> 07:30.660
and those ecosystems are made up

07:30.660 --> 07:32.607
of multiple players of different skills

07:32.607 --> 07:35.100
and different technologies and different disciplines

07:35.100 --> 07:36.600
that all have to come together

07:36.600 --> 07:40.440
to make these end-to-end solutions work in a meaningful way.

07:40.440 --> 07:42.330
And we have to change our business models,

07:42.330 --> 07:43.650
we have to change our engineering

07:43.650 --> 07:45.990
and our internal operating structures

07:45.990 --> 07:48.780
to be able to adapt to these methods and ways.

07:48.780 --> 07:51.297
Otherwise, we're just gonna be doing it the same old way

07:51.297 --> 07:53.070
and not delivering at the speed

07:53.070 --> 07:55.440
that, you know, other global markets around the world

07:55.440 --> 07:56.273
may be moving.

07:56.273 --> 08:00.656
So, we really need to, you know, abide by those principles

08:00.656 --> 08:03.333
to be successful as an industry holistically.

08:05.370 --> 08:06.591
<v ->Yeah, I'll jump in.</v>

08:06.591 --> 08:09.300
You know, we really think,

08:09.300 --> 08:10.710
I sort of mentioned this in the introduction,

08:10.710 --> 08:13.200
but we really think about how we work with automakers

08:13.200 --> 08:14.733
and suppliers as a collaboration

08:14.733 --> 08:17.520
that's sort of critical to our business.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.140
You may know, you know, we started out

08:19.140 --> 08:21.030
by bringing Alexa into cars,

08:21.030 --> 08:23.550
which was, you know, our homegrown solution,

08:23.550 --> 08:24.900
you know, that we brought to bear

08:24.900 --> 08:27.360
on inside the vehicle cabin.

08:27.360 --> 08:28.590
But we've sort of pivoted

08:28.590 --> 08:29.970
and shifted the way we think about this

08:29.970 --> 08:32.760
to really be sort of, I'm gonna say truly collaborative.

08:32.760 --> 08:34.590
Of course we were working with automakers before,

08:34.590 --> 08:38.100
but now we've shifted so that what we're doing

08:38.100 --> 08:40.621
is we are creating the foundation

08:40.621 --> 08:43.200
and the building blocks of that technology.

08:43.200 --> 08:44.610
'Cause that's the stuff that is hard

08:44.610 --> 08:47.160
for individual automakers to do on their own, right?

08:47.160 --> 08:48.380
And so the way we think about it

08:48.380 --> 08:50.190
is we wanna bring the best of Amazon

08:50.190 --> 08:51.420
to bear on the experience

08:51.420 --> 08:53.040
and have the automakers and suppliers

08:53.040 --> 08:55.170
bring the best of what they have to offer.

08:55.170 --> 08:58.410
And together, we can create these really great experiences.

08:58.410 --> 09:02.227
So, as I said, we think about those building blocks for,

09:02.227 --> 09:06.090
I'll use ACA again, Alexa Custom Assistant, as the example.

09:06.090 --> 09:08.220
But we created those building blocks

09:08.220 --> 09:10.320
so that the automakers and the suppliers

09:10.320 --> 09:12.960
can actually create the customization piece

09:12.960 --> 09:14.850
so that the technology really feels

09:14.850 --> 09:16.530
like an extension of the vehicle

09:16.530 --> 09:19.110
rather than just adding something to the vehicle,

09:19.110 --> 09:20.490
you know, that already exists.

09:20.490 --> 09:24.120
So the automakers are able to, on this technology,

09:24.120 --> 09:26.910
create a custom wake word, a custom voice,

09:26.910 --> 09:28.350
and those customized experiences,

09:28.350 --> 09:30.870
those value adds to be unique for their brand,

09:30.870 --> 09:33.856
their vehicles, their customers.

09:33.856 --> 09:36.570
And we continue to invest and innovate

09:36.570 --> 09:37.980
so that we sort of keep pace

09:37.980 --> 09:40.320
with the changing consumer expectations,

09:40.320 --> 09:42.300
you know, as you said, right, with mobile devices

09:42.300 --> 09:44.040
always changing, always staying updated.

09:44.040 --> 09:46.193
So thinking about how we do that with over the air updates

09:46.193 --> 09:48.300
and making sure that those experiences

09:48.300 --> 09:52.380
stay current and are great for our end customers.

09:52.380 --> 09:53.250
<v ->Yeah.</v>

09:53.250 --> 09:54.533
And one of the things,

09:54.533 --> 09:55.366
and Parrish we've discussed this

09:55.366 --> 09:56.970
over and over again over the previous years.

09:56.970 --> 09:59.640
It's great to say there's this collaboration,

09:59.640 --> 10:01.517
but, like, what do you collaborate on?

10:01.517 --> 10:04.051
We've got all these pre-competitive things that,

10:04.051 --> 10:07.380
do we need 20 different operating systems in a vehicle?

10:07.380 --> 10:10.050
Do we need the APIs all to be different?

10:10.050 --> 10:13.110
And then we've got these massively competitive things,

10:13.110 --> 10:15.420
which are the experience.

10:15.420 --> 10:18.300
And some of the less software savvy companies

10:18.300 --> 10:20.970
perceive that anything that you could possibly need

10:20.970 --> 10:23.343
to deliver an amazing experience is all IP.

10:24.737 --> 10:25.980
Where where do you see this going?

10:25.980 --> 10:27.630
How could we actually collaborate?

10:27.630 --> 10:28.463
<v ->Yeah.</v>

10:28.463 --> 10:31.798
And, you know, it's IP and then maybe the battle

10:31.798 --> 10:33.750
even internal to the OEMs

10:33.750 --> 10:35.310
where I need to be on the first surface,

10:35.310 --> 10:38.280
or I need my feature front and present, right?

10:38.280 --> 10:40.020
So I'll take a different spin

10:40.020 --> 10:41.910
and I think maybe it's the mindset, right?

10:41.910 --> 10:44.580
And coming into it

10:44.580 --> 10:47.220
as a kind of joint storytelling group, right?

10:47.220 --> 10:48.870
So I think it's setting expectations

10:48.870 --> 10:51.117
with multiple suppliers,

10:51.117 --> 10:54.060
you know, true partnership and what does that mean?

10:54.060 --> 10:55.290
So there's new business models

10:55.290 --> 10:57.210
and other things that Tim referred to.

10:57.210 --> 11:01.020
But for me, you know, I slant towards consumer centricity

11:01.020 --> 11:03.752
and holistic understanding of how people think and behave

11:03.752 --> 11:07.410
and their emotional response.

11:07.410 --> 11:08.730
And I think it's storytelling

11:08.730 --> 11:13.730
and I think it's a really detailed curation, right?

11:13.740 --> 11:15.750
And who is it that does that curation?

11:15.750 --> 11:17.940
I don't think there's a lot of people that can do that,

11:17.940 --> 11:20.887
but, you know, it's the agreement of,

11:20.887 --> 11:22.440
"Okay, we're gonna be in these lanes

11:22.440 --> 11:24.480
and we're gonna have these roles.

11:24.480 --> 11:26.070
But our end goal is to do this."

11:26.070 --> 11:28.980
And I think I'm a broken record

11:28.980 --> 11:30.570
on saying we don't create experiences,

11:30.570 --> 11:33.000
we create the opportunity for experiences.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.710
So on the back end too now,

11:34.710 --> 11:36.750
we know what's working and not working.

11:36.750 --> 11:38.100
We know constant,

11:38.100 --> 11:40.140
with ability to constantly improve.

11:40.140 --> 11:42.467
So again, all that mindset of decoupling

11:42.467 --> 11:46.174
and iteration and true collaboration,

11:46.174 --> 11:47.820
knowing that in the end,

11:47.820 --> 11:49.920
it's gonna be positive for everybody,

11:49.920 --> 11:51.300
particularly the consumer,

11:51.300 --> 11:54.030
you know, I think that mindset.

11:54.030 --> 11:56.053
<v ->And if we have that mindset of collaboration,</v>

11:56.053 --> 11:58.170
but we've also got this mindset

11:58.170 --> 12:01.754
of rapid iteration, rapid release,

12:01.754 --> 12:04.436
what is it that we can be doing as an industry

12:04.436 --> 12:06.300
across all of these different companies,

12:06.300 --> 12:08.910
across all of these different open source alliances,

12:08.910 --> 12:11.400
SAE, COVESA, all of these others

12:11.400 --> 12:14.062
to actually foster that collaboration

12:14.062 --> 12:16.770
outside the contracts in some ways.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.630
And maybe that's Tim, maybe that's Parrish,

12:18.630 --> 12:19.630
maybe that's Rebeca.

12:20.550 --> 12:22.023
<v ->So I'll jump in here.</v>

12:23.760 --> 12:27.063
And I'm gonna dial up a little bit the spiciness level here.

12:27.930 --> 12:30.608
The realities that automotive has been, as an industry,

12:30.608 --> 12:33.494
a very siloed technology industry

12:33.494 --> 12:36.330
because we do have very differentiated requirements

12:36.330 --> 12:38.400
attached to security and safety, right?

12:38.400 --> 12:41.399
At the end of the day, each one of our products

12:41.399 --> 12:45.210
deal with the safety and security of human life, right?

12:45.210 --> 12:46.110
That being said,

12:46.110 --> 12:51.110
as the human-centric experience of the vehicle

12:52.800 --> 12:54.840
requires all this collaboration,

12:54.840 --> 12:59.213
back to your point, Matt, of competence and competency

12:59.213 --> 13:02.250
and technology and IP across the board,

13:02.250 --> 13:04.650
what I like to encourage the automotive industry,

13:04.650 --> 13:08.580
although it's tends to be not in our DNA,

13:08.580 --> 13:10.290
but other industries,

13:10.290 --> 13:12.900
the way that they've del delivered this opportunity

13:12.900 --> 13:15.624
for value and experience and innovation

13:15.624 --> 13:17.610
has been done already, right?

13:17.610 --> 13:22.610
So for us to see these massive technology players

13:23.160 --> 13:26.404
that deliver content and human experiences,

13:26.404 --> 13:29.100
the opportunity to create that value

13:29.100 --> 13:32.670
resides in the software defined architectures.

13:32.670 --> 13:34.440
And that's literally the technical term

13:34.440 --> 13:36.882
for that re-architecture of those technologies

13:36.882 --> 13:40.532
that allowed for the internet and the telco companies

13:40.532 --> 13:45.532
to truly cooperate on how to allow every ecosystem player

13:46.020 --> 13:50.550
to deliver value in their areas of expertise

13:50.550 --> 13:52.740
so that then the innovation cycles

13:52.740 --> 13:55.140
could then be rapidly iterated towards, right?

13:55.140 --> 14:00.030
So it's a very painful transformation that we're all facing.

14:00.030 --> 14:04.230
But at the end of the day, the encouraging element here

14:04.230 --> 14:06.903
is that it's been done in other industries successfully.

14:06.903 --> 14:10.410
We've been doing this in automotive as well already, right?

14:10.410 --> 14:13.140
We've adopted, you know, very enthusiastically

14:13.140 --> 14:14.613
things like ethernet, right?

14:16.620 --> 14:21.360
But for this technologies to exist from scratch

14:21.360 --> 14:23.670
would be absolutely massive investment.

14:23.670 --> 14:25.719
So the encouraging thing here

14:25.719 --> 14:27.510
is that a lot of these transformations

14:27.510 --> 14:28.980
have happened in other industries,

14:28.980 --> 14:32.028
and we can borrow enthusiastically from those practices

14:32.028 --> 14:35.470
of open platform approach

14:35.470 --> 14:40.470
that then allow us to deliver value in this layered mindset.

14:41.550 --> 14:43.350
<v ->Just maybe to add a little bit to this,</v>

14:43.350 --> 14:47.130
because, obviously, it's what I do and what we do at SAE.

14:47.130 --> 14:49.440
But there's those that collaborate

14:49.440 --> 14:51.120
and there's those that talk about collaboration,

14:51.120 --> 14:53.670
and all the stage are people that actually do collaboration,

14:53.670 --> 14:54.720
which is great.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.490
Because we can have things on the shelves,

14:56.490 --> 14:58.110
we can have all these different organizations.

14:58.110 --> 14:59.670
But if you don't bring people together

14:59.670 --> 15:01.230
to solve the problems,

15:01.230 --> 15:03.300
and, you know, it's quite a sight

15:03.300 --> 15:06.420
when we have our meetings on virtually or in the room

15:06.420 --> 15:08.580
and I see multiple OEMs, multiple tiers,

15:08.580 --> 15:10.380
multiple service providers,

15:10.380 --> 15:13.740
all for, at first, usually discussing and arguing,

15:13.740 --> 15:16.110
and then eventually collaborating,

15:16.110 --> 15:17.250
writing best practices,

15:17.250 --> 15:19.200
and then ultimately developing standards.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.630
And this is where we need to get to.

15:21.630 --> 15:23.494
Not everything needs a standard,

15:23.494 --> 15:24.750
but, you know, the things that are proprietary

15:24.750 --> 15:26.760
and beneficial for your individual companies,

15:26.760 --> 15:27.720
they have to stay that way.

15:27.720 --> 15:30.277
But there's so many things underneath the layer of,

15:30.277 --> 15:32.730
you know, the iceberg under the waterline

15:32.730 --> 15:36.300
that we can do and make sure are in a place

15:36.300 --> 15:39.000
where we're not doing this redundant engineering work

15:39.000 --> 15:39.960
that we all struggle with.

15:39.960 --> 15:42.720
And I think that is the way of the future.

15:42.720 --> 15:45.720
If we can, you know, have the right mindset to move forward,

15:45.720 --> 15:47.020
that's the difficult part.

15:48.360 --> 15:49.620
<v ->Anecdotal story time.</v>

15:49.620 --> 15:53.880
So, you know, and it's actually that forced collaboration,

15:53.880 --> 15:56.310
and sometimes it has to be part of your performance review.

15:56.310 --> 15:58.410
It has to be part of your KPIs.

15:58.410 --> 16:01.294
I mean, my experience in some companies

16:01.294 --> 16:02.940
where there was this dogma

16:02.940 --> 16:04.710
and people just didn't show up collaboratively

16:04.710 --> 16:08.460
and multidisciplinary, they no longer had a cubicle.

16:08.460 --> 16:09.990
They had a seat like this

16:09.990 --> 16:12.390
at the big **** table we'd call it at.

16:12.390 --> 16:15.240
At Dual Brands, they have the big ash table,

16:15.240 --> 16:16.650
their table's made of ash, right?

16:16.650 --> 16:17.677
And everybody is like,

16:17.677 --> 16:19.260
"Your assignment for the next six months

16:19.260 --> 16:21.240
is at this table next to, you know,

16:21.240 --> 16:22.830
these complimentary disciplines.

16:22.830 --> 16:24.360
Here's your problem.

16:24.360 --> 16:26.880
You know, here's your roles and responsibilities."

16:26.880 --> 16:27.740
And that's...

16:29.010 --> 16:31.983
It's uncomfortable and it's forced,

16:31.983 --> 16:34.950
but, you know, after a week,

16:34.950 --> 16:36.480
it's where you go every morning, you know,

16:36.480 --> 16:37.770
and that is how you work.

16:37.770 --> 16:40.818
and you're working on whiteboards and mural and Miro,

16:40.818 --> 16:42.630
and it's iterative and so forth.

16:42.630 --> 16:43.884
So...

16:43.884 --> 16:44.717
<v ->And it's almost that startup culture.</v>

16:44.717 --> 16:46.140
And it reminds me of some of the conversations

16:46.140 --> 16:47.520
we were having last night.

16:47.520 --> 16:48.510
And we're at CES.

16:48.510 --> 16:51.300
There's thousands, if not, tens of thousands of startups.

16:51.300 --> 16:54.120
You can see many of them at the COVESA event

16:54.120 --> 16:56.670
this evening over at the Bellagio.

16:56.670 --> 16:57.503
But in reality,

16:57.503 --> 16:59.940
as I go around all of these different incubators,

16:59.940 --> 17:01.050
all of these different startups,

17:01.050 --> 17:01.897
the standard question is,

17:01.897 --> 17:03.967
"How long did it take you to develop this?"

17:03.967 --> 17:05.730
"How long did it take to develop

17:05.730 --> 17:09.060
your amazing concept of a future product?"

17:09.060 --> 17:10.440
And they give me a number,

17:10.440 --> 17:12.690
and it's normally, like, four to nine months.

17:12.690 --> 17:14.610
And they say, "How much time did it actually take you

17:14.610 --> 17:16.140
to get that base platform

17:16.140 --> 17:18.120
before you could start building your experiences

17:18.120 --> 17:19.680
and your product on top?"

17:19.680 --> 17:22.980
And invariably, it's at least half that time.

17:22.980 --> 17:23.820
And then I think about it.

17:23.820 --> 17:25.800
It's like all of those startups

17:25.800 --> 17:28.410
and all of us with the experiences we want in the vehicle,

17:28.410 --> 17:29.760
all going in different directions

17:29.760 --> 17:33.570
to create the same thing that underpins

17:33.570 --> 17:36.750
the thing that we all want, their true IP, which is on top.

17:36.750 --> 17:38.340
And if we can get this collaboration,

17:38.340 --> 17:40.060
if we can get these underpinnings

17:41.310 --> 17:43.470
from an open source or proprietary

17:43.470 --> 17:45.870
or software as a service model, anything,

17:45.870 --> 17:48.210
it must be better for automotive,

17:48.210 --> 17:49.810
as well as the other industries.

17:50.790 --> 17:52.560
But I guess, Rebeca, we are...

17:52.560 --> 17:55.170
Have you noticed we're actually steering super clear

17:55.170 --> 17:57.930
of discussing any possible future experiences?

17:57.930 --> 17:59.580
I don't know whether this is on purpose.

17:59.580 --> 18:02.790
And I'm not gonna try and draw it out of the team yet.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.357
But given all these future experiences,

18:04.357 --> 18:06.540
you know, the ones that we're really reluctant

18:06.540 --> 18:08.010
to talk about,

18:08.010 --> 18:11.433
what are the underpinning technologies that we'll need?

18:12.300 --> 18:14.700
<v ->I love that that segue, right?</v>

18:14.700 --> 18:15.720
At the end of the day,

18:15.720 --> 18:19.380
the future feels like this horizon line that we can't get to

18:19.380 --> 18:21.690
because exactly what Matt just articulated, right?

18:21.690 --> 18:23.670
Everybody's reinventing the wheel

18:23.670 --> 18:25.680
and spending the majority of their cycles

18:25.680 --> 18:26.910
in just the baseline

18:26.910 --> 18:29.370
before you can deliver any innovation

18:29.370 --> 18:31.500
or value or differentiation, right?

18:31.500 --> 18:33.000
So in that regard,

18:33.000 --> 18:34.830
because Intel's DNA has been,

18:34.830 --> 18:37.110
you know, years and years of delivering compute

18:37.110 --> 18:40.020
for all of these foundational technologies

18:40.020 --> 18:42.030
that now we're leveraging

18:42.030 --> 18:44.550
for the automotive future vehicle experiences

18:44.550 --> 18:46.380
and the current vehicle experiences,

18:46.380 --> 18:48.300
our ultimate commitment has always been,

18:48.300 --> 18:51.720
as a company, to open compute,

18:51.720 --> 18:56.287
open platforms, open APIs, open software.

18:56.287 --> 18:59.583
Because only through this forced collaboration, right,

18:59.583 --> 19:01.657
that allows for interoperability,

19:01.657 --> 19:05.493
allows for, like, the best solution to solve the problem.

19:07.230 --> 19:10.830
It's where you can then finally encounter

19:10.830 --> 19:13.830
that possibility of scaling, right?

19:13.830 --> 19:15.210
'Cause without scaling,

19:15.210 --> 19:17.130
the future just continues to escape

19:17.130 --> 19:20.640
your grasp of the minimum viable product, right?

19:20.640 --> 19:24.712
So that open collaboration mentality

19:24.712 --> 19:27.360
then needs to truly trickle down

19:27.360 --> 19:30.248
to the elements of your solution and your underpinnings,

19:30.248 --> 19:32.457
which at the end of the day,

19:32.457 --> 19:34.380
we all talk about software defined as a buzzword.

19:34.380 --> 19:37.140
But software defined means that this value

19:37.140 --> 19:42.140
is your north light of how your whole company and operations

19:42.650 --> 19:44.310
get guided through,

19:44.310 --> 19:47.520
and then inform the articulation of the infrastructure

19:47.520 --> 19:50.250
of all of your elements of technology, right?

19:50.250 --> 19:51.960
For that to exist,

19:51.960 --> 19:55.340
it will mean that none of us as ecosystem players

19:55.340 --> 19:59.460
can own everything, starting with the OEMs, right, Matt?

19:59.460 --> 20:02.550
So it will require these layered mentality

20:02.550 --> 20:05.430
instead of being vertical to being horizontal.

20:05.430 --> 20:08.096
And for that horizontal collaboration to occur

20:08.096 --> 20:10.864
for the future to realize,

20:10.864 --> 20:15.360
it will require truly that open perspective, right?

20:15.360 --> 20:19.230
And then second, everybody's very, very focused

20:19.230 --> 20:21.030
on the highest performance socket, right,

20:21.030 --> 20:24.990
because that's what's the most direct impact to the eyes

20:24.990 --> 20:27.750
and the emotional response of the consumer.

20:27.750 --> 20:29.010
But the other element

20:29.010 --> 20:31.614
that we're all forgetting in this fragmentation of solutions

20:31.614 --> 20:34.290
is that these solutions have to scale

20:34.290 --> 20:36.510
to every level of vehicle, right?

20:36.510 --> 20:40.050
So open compute, open software, open APIs,

20:40.050 --> 20:41.760
but then it cannot just address

20:41.760 --> 20:44.010
the most premium or the lowest, right?

20:44.010 --> 20:44.850
An OEM...

20:44.850 --> 20:47.010
I mean, Matt, you tell me.

20:47.010 --> 20:48.270
An OEM doesn't wanna pay

20:48.270 --> 20:50.520
three different solution stacks, right,

20:50.520 --> 20:51.930
for their whole vehicle lineup.

20:51.930 --> 20:54.720
So this has to be software defined first,

20:54.720 --> 20:56.250
then it has to be scalable.

20:56.250 --> 20:58.260
And then it has to be,

20:58.260 --> 21:00.810
let's see at the whole vehicle as a platform,

21:00.810 --> 21:04.950
as a sandbox for innovation for future-proofing.

21:04.950 --> 21:06.930
Because if you don't future-proof,

21:06.930 --> 21:08.880
the future catches up with you

21:08.880 --> 21:10.590
and you are no longer viable.

21:10.590 --> 21:14.610
So software define that it's open,

21:14.610 --> 21:15.900
that it's scalable,

21:15.900 --> 21:18.240
and that has a holistic approach

21:18.240 --> 21:20.040
looking at the whole vehicle as a platform

21:20.040 --> 21:21.630
for a sandbox of innovation.

21:21.630 --> 21:22.560
<v ->And you're absolutely right.</v>

21:22.560 --> 21:25.080
From the OEM perspective, if you think of Ford,

21:25.080 --> 21:28.890
we sell Rangers and Territories into Sub-Saharan Africa.

21:28.890 --> 21:31.650
Even if we just look at the US an F-150,

21:31.650 --> 21:33.060
bestselling pickup truck,

21:33.060 --> 21:35.950
we have something that is literally a job site

21:36.930 --> 21:39.780
right the way up to these premium towing vehicles

21:39.780 --> 21:42.030
that would do hundreds of miles.

21:42.030 --> 21:44.130
Huge dynamic range.

21:44.130 --> 21:46.500
Many of the vehicle systems are similar.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.960
We would want to reuse the software.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.610
But when it comes to infotainment

21:50.610 --> 21:54.570
or ADAS or audio systems, the seats,

21:54.570 --> 21:55.890
all of these different pieces

21:55.890 --> 21:57.210
that we don't necessarily think about,

21:57.210 --> 22:00.750
we have to have that low overhead configurability,

22:00.750 --> 22:03.480
maintainability from the software

22:03.480 --> 22:07.410
based on roadmaps of silicon, not just one level.

22:07.410 --> 22:10.145
But didn't want to not let Rebeca down

22:10.145 --> 22:11.883
with the OEM opinion there.

22:12.870 --> 22:14.040
<v ->Just one comment on this.</v>

22:14.040 --> 22:15.960
I think one of the missing ingredients...

22:15.960 --> 22:16.800
I won't say it's missing,

22:16.800 --> 22:18.980
but the ingredient that we need to use more of

22:18.980 --> 22:20.610
is systems thinking.

22:20.610 --> 22:22.590
I'm not saying systems engineering purposely

22:22.590 --> 22:24.420
because it's not just engineers

22:24.420 --> 22:25.890
that need to come to the table on this.

22:25.890 --> 22:28.395
It's the design element of this.

22:28.395 --> 22:30.960
It's the AHMI, it's the psychological side.

22:30.960 --> 22:33.840
It's everything that we need to think about from day one

22:33.840 --> 22:35.250
when you start to put pen to paper

22:35.250 --> 22:37.290
on a new concept or design.

22:37.290 --> 22:40.470
How are we thinking of this through a systems lens

22:40.470 --> 22:42.750
all the way through those over the air updates

22:42.750 --> 22:45.570
that are gonna happen for the next now, what, 20 years?

22:45.570 --> 22:46.800
<v ->I would add to the systems</v>

22:46.800 --> 22:48.810
thinking that's a platform thinking.

22:48.810 --> 22:50.970
No OEM just has one vehicle.

22:50.970 --> 22:52.260
Or even if they just have one now,

22:52.260 --> 22:53.850
they will have an aspiration.

22:53.850 --> 22:57.000
And in reality, a lot of OEMs and a lot of engineers,

22:57.000 --> 22:59.070
we love to design for the top.

22:59.070 --> 23:01.260
And you design for the top and you put all this stuff in,

23:01.260 --> 23:03.270
and it's really hard to take out.

23:03.270 --> 23:05.637
And sometimes you need to design for the lowest entry level

23:05.637 --> 23:07.851
where you can then stack in these options

23:07.851 --> 23:10.140
to get that cost control model.

23:10.140 --> 23:11.910
Sometimes you need to design

23:11.910 --> 23:15.120
for that highest availability somewhere in the middle.

23:15.120 --> 23:19.350
But very rarely do the engineer left alone get it right.

23:19.350 --> 23:20.183
And then similarly,

23:20.183 --> 23:22.263
if we've got four or five different models,

23:23.130 --> 23:24.900
think of it as an A through E class,

23:24.900 --> 23:27.510
whatever you want to think about in these different domains,

23:27.510 --> 23:28.710
how do you design a platform

23:28.710 --> 23:31.853
that's scalable across these different sized vehicles

23:31.853 --> 23:34.918
with similar experiences that go across that.

23:34.918 --> 23:37.203
It's not as easy as we think.

23:38.280 --> 23:39.696
<v ->If I could add.</v>

23:39.696 --> 23:42.750
You know, one of the things that we think about is,

23:42.750 --> 23:44.010
obviously, the infotainment piece, right?

23:44.010 --> 23:45.270
That's what we're really focused on.

23:45.270 --> 23:46.200
And so to your point, right,

23:46.200 --> 23:48.344
there's all these different levels of vehicles

23:48.344 --> 23:50.700
and different customers in those vehicles.

23:50.700 --> 23:52.170
And so when we think about,

23:52.170 --> 23:53.610
I'm gonna use buzzwords, right?

23:53.610 --> 23:55.053
Large language models and generative AI,

23:55.053 --> 23:57.960
that that will meet the customers where they are, right,

23:57.960 --> 23:59.910
to be able to have that very conversational

23:59.910 --> 24:01.440
interaction with the technology.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.000
So, you know, for us,

24:03.000 --> 24:06.300
it's like being able to implement that at different levels,

24:06.300 --> 24:08.850
you know, whether it's on the edge or in the cloud.

24:08.850 --> 24:11.190
To be able to do that for those different customers

24:11.190 --> 24:13.170
and for those different OEMs customized

24:13.170 --> 24:15.813
to their vehicles, it's really important.

24:15.813 --> 24:17.490
And the reason it's so important

24:17.490 --> 24:19.410
is when I think back to the end customer, right?

24:19.410 --> 24:22.080
We're always working backwards from the actual customer

24:22.080 --> 24:24.060
that's in the vehicle, the driver and the passenger.

24:24.060 --> 24:27.360
And by adding this kind of technology into the vehicles,

24:27.360 --> 24:30.210
they're able to have a more conversational interaction

24:30.210 --> 24:31.290
with their technology.

24:31.290 --> 24:32.850
So, when you think about,

24:32.850 --> 24:33.683
I'll just give a couple

24:33.683 --> 24:35.460
of examples, but you think about,

24:35.460 --> 24:37.800
you know, today some of the challenges that we've had,

24:37.800 --> 24:39.690
a lot of times, it's a little bit hard

24:39.690 --> 24:41.340
to talk to that voice assistant.

24:41.340 --> 24:44.880
And using generative AI and large language models,

24:44.880 --> 24:47.880
now that technology can handle the fumbles

24:47.880 --> 24:48.870
that we make when we speak,

24:48.870 --> 24:50.640
the pauses that we take when we speak,

24:50.640 --> 24:52.320
the colloquial language, right?

24:52.320 --> 24:55.980
And it can be this very conversational natural interaction.

24:55.980 --> 24:58.080
It also can take things to the next level

24:58.080 --> 25:01.110
in terms of personalization and proactivity.

25:01.110 --> 25:04.644
It can also help when you have multiple intents,

25:04.644 --> 25:06.210
you know, so right now,

25:06.210 --> 25:08.700
sometimes you have to do one step at a time.

25:08.700 --> 25:12.030
So I'll just quickly take navigation as an example.

25:12.030 --> 25:13.377
If you are navigating somewhere

25:13.377 --> 25:15.990
and you realize, "Oh, I need to stop and get gas,"

25:15.990 --> 25:17.552
you have to ask just for gas.

25:17.552 --> 25:21.000
But with generative AI and large language models,

25:21.000 --> 25:22.530
you can take that experience

25:22.530 --> 25:25.350
for that more sophisticated customer to the next level.

25:25.350 --> 25:27.390
So you can say, "Oh, I'm looking for gas

25:27.390 --> 25:28.680
on my route that's cheap,

25:28.680 --> 25:30.840
and, oh, I need a car wash and has a car wash."

25:30.840 --> 25:33.240
And that technology can handle all of those things

25:33.240 --> 25:35.859
and then give the customers those options.

25:35.859 --> 25:38.514
And then finally, I would say that it also,

25:38.514 --> 25:40.920
this kind of technology helps

25:40.920 --> 25:43.680
so that rather than the end customer

25:43.680 --> 25:46.200
having this sort of very transactional experience

25:46.200 --> 25:47.430
with the technology,

25:47.430 --> 25:50.010
it can be more like a true companion

25:50.010 --> 25:52.260
where the technology can actually take action

25:52.260 --> 25:53.580
on behalf of the customer.

25:53.580 --> 25:54.840
And those are the kinds of things

25:54.840 --> 25:56.820
that people across the board wanna see.

25:56.820 --> 25:58.991
You know, whether it's that high level vehicle

25:58.991 --> 26:01.020
with all of the bells and whistles in it

26:01.020 --> 26:02.550
or an entry level model.

26:02.550 --> 26:03.630
<v ->The really interesting thing,</v>

26:03.630 --> 26:05.130
and it kind of comes back to my comments

26:05.130 --> 26:07.380
at the start of, like, 20 years of CES,

26:07.380 --> 26:08.490
if we think of these vehicles,

26:08.490 --> 26:10.980
we sat here at the start of 2025.

26:10.980 --> 26:15.000
We might launch some of these things in '25, '26, '27.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.810
Might build them in our plants till 2030.

26:18.810 --> 26:21.480
And we might have to maintain them till 2045.

26:21.480 --> 26:25.620
So this is really like a generational maintenance headache

26:25.620 --> 26:27.810
that we're talking about if we don't get it right.

26:27.810 --> 26:30.420
And it almost comes onto the next question, Parrish.

26:30.420 --> 26:33.720
It's like many of the OEMs we're integrating our systems

26:33.720 --> 26:34.650
in multiple countries.

26:34.650 --> 26:36.600
We're selling into many more.

26:36.600 --> 26:39.180
It's not just a US-centric.

26:39.180 --> 26:40.410
It's not a Nevada-centric,

26:40.410 --> 26:41.430
it's not a US-centric,

26:41.430 --> 26:42.780
it's not an America-centric.

26:42.780 --> 26:47.340
It's like this worldwide, 184 markets in Ford's case.

26:47.340 --> 26:50.820
How do we even contemplate engineering these experiences

26:50.820 --> 26:54.840
and all of this underpinning stuff?

26:54.840 --> 26:56.403
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->Digital stuff.</v>

26:57.240 --> 26:59.070
<v ->I think you guys have laid out a pretty good framework</v>

26:59.070 --> 27:00.220
in that last discussion

27:01.410 --> 27:04.110
and, you know, more or less the enablers

27:04.110 --> 27:07.140
and creating the sandbox for experimentation

27:07.140 --> 27:08.490
and things like that.

27:08.490 --> 27:11.191
I think when you extend it across the globe,

27:11.191 --> 27:13.830
let's talk about kind of that regional lens

27:13.830 --> 27:14.910
and what we're dealing with, right?

27:14.910 --> 27:19.910
So, maybe cultural and regulatory rules and mandates, right?

27:20.296 --> 27:23.602
Maybe popular regional services along with the specialists

27:23.602 --> 27:27.298
that are really experts in that field, right?

27:27.298 --> 27:30.220
And sometimes that's even a regional partnership.

27:30.220 --> 27:33.900
It's obviously language, communication.

27:33.900 --> 27:36.034
Most importantly, I think it's a lot of the nuances

27:36.034 --> 27:38.010
of the cultural dynamics,

27:38.010 --> 27:40.710
sociocultural dynamic of where you're going as well

27:40.710 --> 27:42.030
and being able to capture that

27:42.030 --> 27:43.846
and reflect that back into the experience

27:43.846 --> 27:48.540
of your standardized platform, your scalable capabilities,

27:48.540 --> 27:51.490
your decoupled hardware and software, those kind of things.

27:53.520 --> 27:54.353
I think...

27:54.353 --> 27:55.890
So I use the word maturity a lot,

27:55.890 --> 27:59.313
whether it's around process or it's around the tools.

28:00.180 --> 28:01.470
A lot of these things can be embedded

28:01.470 --> 28:03.823
into the tools these days and rendered dynamically

28:03.823 --> 28:07.073
and built and even virtualized.

28:07.073 --> 28:09.180
We talked about org mindset

28:09.180 --> 28:10.828
and kind of a maturity of a software,

28:10.828 --> 28:12.663
architecture and platform.

28:14.280 --> 28:16.170
I think we've talked about standardization

28:16.170 --> 28:19.020
and middleware abstraction and data cloud strategy

28:19.020 --> 28:21.793
and all these things that, again, are enablers.

28:21.793 --> 28:23.820
Cross-industry collaboration,

28:23.820 --> 28:26.100
I think, particularly with hyperscalers

28:26.100 --> 28:30.821
and SOC providers and everybody else that's working across,

28:30.821 --> 28:32.550
I think, analogous industries

28:32.550 --> 28:34.050
and everything else happening elsewhere

28:34.050 --> 28:36.155
that can be translated into a region

28:36.155 --> 28:38.419
that might actually be stronger in one thing

28:38.419 --> 28:41.913
and not as strong in automotive, but a lot to learn.

28:43.890 --> 28:45.780
And lastly, and most important to me,

28:45.780 --> 28:47.940
is kind of that cultural and regional maturity.

28:47.940 --> 28:51.003
So, are you entering a new market?

28:52.470 --> 28:53.880
Are you supporting a multitude

28:53.880 --> 28:57.480
of regulatory structures across markets?

28:57.480 --> 28:59.433
Are you managing customer data,

29:00.300 --> 29:03.270
autonomous driving and safety issues, right?

29:03.270 --> 29:05.970
Cultural understanding, data residency,

29:05.970 --> 29:07.980
all these rules and regulations.

29:07.980 --> 29:10.377
And now it's a mountain, right?

29:10.377 --> 29:15.377
Nothing we're discussing here today is not complex, right?

29:16.230 --> 29:21.230
But, yeah, I think that onboard/offboard capability APIs

29:21.996 --> 29:24.183
have been talked about a lot,

29:25.830 --> 29:29.466
you know, including both on onboard and offboard components,

29:29.466 --> 29:33.420
microservices encapsulated in the API

29:33.420 --> 29:34.950
and being flexible with those.

29:34.950 --> 29:39.950
So, you know, but again, I think the experience roadmap.

29:40.446 --> 29:43.076
I work with a lot of anthropologists that go into regions

29:43.076 --> 29:45.273
and really deeply understand,

29:46.590 --> 29:48.690
you know, what matters to these people

29:48.690 --> 29:50.310
and, you know, what's the difference?

29:50.310 --> 29:52.980
Like, what is luxury defined in four different places

29:52.980 --> 29:54.406
and how does that manifest

29:54.406 --> 29:58.530
into four different stories in giant regions?

29:58.530 --> 30:00.207
So, those kind of things, I think, are really important.

30:00.207 --> 30:02.400
<v ->Has it changed with the more prevalence</v>

30:02.400 --> 30:05.550
of these global consumer electronics experiences?

30:05.550 --> 30:06.700
<v ->I don't think it has.</v>

30:07.554 --> 30:09.090
I think it's just amplified.

30:09.090 --> 30:11.283
But I think the route was always there.

30:12.870 --> 30:14.580
A lot of us come from, you know,

30:14.580 --> 30:18.205
the software and computer hardware world

30:18.205 --> 30:19.920
and computer software world,

30:19.920 --> 30:21.780
and then even telecommunications.

30:21.780 --> 30:23.250
And to me in telecommunications,

30:23.250 --> 30:25.794
you were always testing and you were releasing,

30:25.794 --> 30:30.210
you know, at Motorola, a Ming phone in China,

30:30.210 --> 30:31.260
and we learned quite a bit

30:31.260 --> 30:33.930
or a handful of feature phones in Korea.

30:33.930 --> 30:36.483
But you knew what socializing meant,

30:36.483 --> 30:38.790
you knew what assistance meant,

30:38.790 --> 30:42.930
you know what connecting meant, those kind of things.

30:42.930 --> 30:43.980
And it hasn't changed.

30:43.980 --> 30:44.813
That hasn't changed.

30:44.813 --> 30:47.790
But sure, everything else is amplified,

30:47.790 --> 30:49.350
all these capabilities.

30:49.350 --> 30:52.050
I don't necessarily think that consumer expectations

30:52.050 --> 30:52.950
are changing that much.

30:52.950 --> 30:57.240
It's just we come to CES and we somehow hear about

30:57.240 --> 30:59.730
these new domains of enablement

30:59.730 --> 31:01.800
that are brought on by the maturity

31:01.800 --> 31:03.750
of all the things we're talking about, right?

31:03.750 --> 31:05.160
I love the last conversation

31:05.160 --> 31:08.370
around the habitat on wheels, right,

31:08.370 --> 31:10.530
and stationary moments and these kind of things.

31:10.530 --> 31:12.693
So, yeah.

31:13.560 --> 31:14.393
<v ->Fantastic.</v>

31:14.393 --> 31:15.517
Tim, did you wanna...

31:15.517 --> 31:16.350
<v ->Yeah, I mean, I come back</v>

31:16.350 --> 31:17.760
to actually the word you mentioned, Matt,

31:17.760 --> 31:19.050
which is platform.

31:19.050 --> 31:22.685
And I think it's not just platform at a vehicle level,

31:22.685 --> 31:25.140
it's platform at electrical architecture level,

31:25.140 --> 31:27.840
a software level, at a infotainment level.

31:27.840 --> 31:29.340
<v ->Platforms all the way down.</v>

31:29.340 --> 31:30.450
<v ->All the way down.</v>

31:30.450 --> 31:34.470
And, you know, when you do that, and you do it right,

31:34.470 --> 31:39.000
it's potentially does serve your global marketplace

31:39.000 --> 31:40.170
if you do it right.

31:40.170 --> 31:42.240
And it takes a lot more energy

31:42.240 --> 31:43.980
and a lot more effort to plan it,

31:43.980 --> 31:46.230
get those systems thinkers at the table

31:46.230 --> 31:49.230
at the ash table that Parrish mentioned.

31:49.230 --> 31:50.820
But if you do it,

31:50.820 --> 31:52.440
you do it right and you take the time to do it,

31:52.440 --> 31:54.900
it pays so many dividends down the road.

31:54.900 --> 31:55.950
Right before Christmas,

31:55.950 --> 31:58.950
we had just launched an EVPKI solution,

31:58.950 --> 32:01.590
which is Electric Vehicle Public Key Infrastructure,

32:01.590 --> 32:05.190
which is a cybersecurity platform for charging vehicles

32:05.190 --> 32:07.530
that provides interoperability.

32:07.530 --> 32:09.373
We had one OEM customer.

32:09.373 --> 32:10.998
I can say it wasn't one of you.

32:10.998 --> 32:11.867
It wasn't you.

32:11.867 --> 32:12.900
But they said-
<v ->Wasn't me.</v>

32:12.900 --> 32:15.420
<v ->Outside of somebody cutting the copper off</v>

32:15.420 --> 32:17.430
and stealing the connector in a cord,

32:17.430 --> 32:20.220
this will solve roughly 40% of our-

32:20.220 --> 32:21.607
<v ->Look at what we've-</v>

32:21.607 --> 32:23.260
<v ->Challenges in the last 18 months</v>

32:23.260 --> 32:24.093
with the Next Connector

32:24.093 --> 32:25.170
and the charging infrastructure.

32:25.170 --> 32:28.500
Which is another example of an experience

32:28.500 --> 32:30.420
that interacted with the digital domain,

32:30.420 --> 32:31.890
that interacted with the physical domain,

32:31.890 --> 32:33.240
that interacted with the cloud

32:33.240 --> 32:35.415
that brings all of these together.

32:35.415 --> 32:36.248
So, we can do it.

32:36.248 --> 32:37.081
<v ->And to your point, it's not just,</v>

32:37.081 --> 32:37.914
"Oh, we're gonna change the connector,

32:37.914 --> 32:38.747
and everything works out now."

32:38.747 --> 32:41.880
<v ->It's not in law so we can improve it with time.</v>

32:41.880 --> 32:43.140
<v ->Yes.</v>

32:43.140 --> 32:45.810
It's all these things coming together at a platform level.

32:45.810 --> 32:46.770
Arianne, can we go to you

32:46.770 --> 32:49.650
and then we're gonna go to the last question if we can.

32:49.650 --> 32:51.716
<v ->I think everybody did a great job on this one.</v>

32:51.716 --> 32:54.420
Yeah, yeah, let's do the last question.

32:54.420 --> 32:56.610
<v ->So this is my attempt,</v>

32:56.610 --> 32:59.430
my final attempt to think about the future experiences.

32:59.430 --> 33:01.110
I don't know whether it's gonna work or not,

33:01.110 --> 33:04.590
but what are you as an individual,

33:04.590 --> 33:07.830
maybe you are not representing your company,

33:07.830 --> 33:10.473
most excited to see in the next few years?

33:11.850 --> 33:14.790
<v ->I love this question because as a technologist,</v>

33:14.790 --> 33:16.620
I could be talking about generative AI,

33:16.620 --> 33:18.060
all of these other technologies

33:18.060 --> 33:20.888
that are really revolutionizing all of these things.

33:20.888 --> 33:24.000
But what I'm most excited to see

33:24.000 --> 33:29.000
is the absolutely imperative cultural mindset shift

33:29.949 --> 33:31.200
in the automotive industry.

33:31.200 --> 33:32.310
Not to age myself here,

33:32.310 --> 33:34.530
but I've been in automotive 20 years.

33:34.530 --> 33:36.540
I started with like 8-bit microcontrollers

33:36.540 --> 33:38.730
where we're counting the bits in RAM

33:38.730 --> 33:41.250
so we could squeeze this edge of technology

33:41.250 --> 33:44.283
that was lend into an 8-bit microcontroller, right?

33:45.450 --> 33:49.110
The cultural mindset shift necessary for the industry

33:49.110 --> 33:51.660
being in this high performance tech world

33:51.660 --> 33:54.520
and having started microcontrollers at Motorola

33:54.520 --> 33:57.133
a couple decades ago,

33:57.133 --> 34:02.133
culture eats strategy for breakfast, right?

34:02.250 --> 34:05.760
So we all truly need to start

34:05.760 --> 34:09.600
at the human-centric experiences for the future

34:09.600 --> 34:10.830
to future-proof.

34:10.830 --> 34:12.233
And therefore, all of a sudden,

34:12.233 --> 34:14.333
this silo mentality of, "This is mine

34:14.333 --> 34:15.840
and this is protective,

34:15.840 --> 34:18.372
and this is what's gonna preserve my empire

34:18.372 --> 34:20.700
and longevity and my career,"

34:20.700 --> 34:22.530
is no longer the best approach.

34:22.530 --> 34:23.363
Right?

34:23.363 --> 34:24.196
Now, all of a sudden, it's like,

34:24.196 --> 34:27.210
"Hey, what is truly the most innovative

34:27.210 --> 34:29.880
differentiated value I can bring to the table,

34:29.880 --> 34:32.430
and where do, you know, stay in my wheelhouse

34:32.430 --> 34:35.190
and focus on the value that we can bring?"

34:35.190 --> 34:39.780
So back to how Intel works with the open compute,

34:39.780 --> 34:42.210
open approach and things

34:42.210 --> 34:45.360
is the only way to deliver innovation at scale.

34:45.360 --> 34:46.350
<v ->Tim, one minute.</v>

34:46.350 --> 34:47.970
Same question.

34:47.970 --> 34:50.370
<v ->You know, seeing things come to life.</v>

34:50.370 --> 34:54.270
And by that, go back 10 years and look at technology.

34:54.270 --> 34:55.350
I'll give a quick example.

34:55.350 --> 34:56.183
Think of your vehicle.

34:56.183 --> 34:58.110
You're lucky if you had an 8-inch display

34:58.110 --> 34:59.640
in your vehicle 10 years ago.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.650
And walk the show floor now.

35:01.650 --> 35:03.720
You know, pillar to pillar displays,

35:03.720 --> 35:06.090
portrait, landscape, letterscape,

35:06.090 --> 35:07.410
whatever size you wanna call,

35:07.410 --> 35:09.702
which then drives different HMIs,

35:09.702 --> 35:12.330
drives different processing power,

35:12.330 --> 35:14.670
different chips, different experiences.

35:14.670 --> 35:17.580
So you have to, all of us in this room, fight the fight.

35:17.580 --> 35:19.080
Fight for those technologies.

35:19.080 --> 35:20.520
Fight to get them pushed forward.

35:20.520 --> 35:22.770
Fight inside of your company to get 'em approved.

35:22.770 --> 35:25.410
It's always a challenge because it's new and it's different,

35:25.410 --> 35:27.303
but that's what makes CES CES.

35:28.975 --> 35:31.784
<v ->I think I'm gonna stick with the mindset change</v>

35:31.784 --> 35:34.740
and even process and organizational structure

35:34.740 --> 35:36.180
and the way decisions are made

35:36.180 --> 35:38.330
and things that we've talked about already.

35:40.650 --> 35:43.530
Removing the wrinkles of the experience

35:43.530 --> 35:44.640
and getting things better and better.

35:44.640 --> 35:46.320
We hear a lot of complaints.

35:46.320 --> 35:49.050
You know, I think about using streaming services

35:49.050 --> 35:50.820
in my hotel room and trying to configure that.

35:50.820 --> 35:52.181
It feels like,

35:52.181 --> 35:54.540
okay, that was the automotive service infrastructure,

35:54.540 --> 35:56.190
not, you know, a couple years ago.

35:56.190 --> 35:58.440
And I think there's gonna be this acceleration.

35:58.440 --> 36:01.768
Again, coming to CES year after year, I think the stack is,

36:01.768 --> 36:03.259
and I'll say it's vertical,

36:03.259 --> 36:06.381
it's hardware and software shifting,

36:06.381 --> 36:08.550
and it's cloud, and it's AI,

36:08.550 --> 36:10.680
and it's just continuously maturing.

36:10.680 --> 36:13.680
But then longitudinally, you know, we've got the product.

36:13.680 --> 36:15.840
It's connected, it's smart and it's connected.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.250
It's part of a system.

36:17.250 --> 36:19.260
It's part of a system of systems.

36:19.260 --> 36:22.800
And what does that mean and how are companies gonna play

36:22.800 --> 36:24.810
and what are they gonna choose to be known for

36:24.810 --> 36:26.520
and what experience roadmaps

36:26.520 --> 36:29.160
are they gonna create and bring to life

36:29.160 --> 36:32.580
that makes them unique in incredibly variable,

36:32.580 --> 36:36.513
flexible, platform-oriented, software-driven world?

36:37.678 --> 36:38.878
<v ->Arianne.</v>
<v ->Last word.</v>

36:39.750 --> 36:41.490
So I'm actually excited about two things.

36:41.490 --> 36:43.050
One is, you know, all this collaboration

36:43.050 --> 36:46.530
that we've been talking about really helps us as an industry

36:46.530 --> 36:48.870
bring experiences to customers faster, right?

36:48.870 --> 36:50.040
Shortens the time to market.

36:50.040 --> 36:51.360
So I'm super excited about that.

36:51.360 --> 36:52.710
We're seeing it in action now,

36:52.710 --> 36:55.230
and I think it's just gonna accelerate in the future.

36:55.230 --> 36:56.880
The other thing I'm really excited about

36:56.880 --> 36:58.140
is when I think about, you know,

36:58.140 --> 37:00.240
we're very focused on the voice assistant,

37:00.240 --> 37:02.730
the intelligent personal assistant experience.

37:02.730 --> 37:06.456
And by bringing these new technologies to bear,

37:06.456 --> 37:09.720
we're actually starting to be able to solve

37:09.720 --> 37:11.790
some of the problems that we as an industry

37:11.790 --> 37:14.190
have faced over the last decade.

37:14.190 --> 37:15.270
So I mentioned earlier,

37:15.270 --> 37:16.860
you know, being able to do things

37:16.860 --> 37:19.020
like have a more conversational experience

37:19.020 --> 37:19.853
with the voice assistant.

37:19.853 --> 37:20.686
That's huge, right?

37:20.686 --> 37:22.830
Not having dead ends when you ask a question.

37:22.830 --> 37:26.340
That's a really big differentiator for the end customer.

37:26.340 --> 37:29.040
Being able to have that seamless connectivity

37:29.040 --> 37:32.100
between all of your digital content and services

37:32.100 --> 37:33.840
that you have outside the car, inside the car,

37:33.840 --> 37:35.820
and make it really easily accessible,

37:35.820 --> 37:38.670
you know, again, is part of the experience

37:38.670 --> 37:39.960
of the technology of the vehicle

37:39.960 --> 37:41.636
as opposed to just an add-on.

37:41.636 --> 37:44.640
And then I think maybe, you know, lastly,

37:44.640 --> 37:47.970
I would say in terms of that customer experience,

37:47.970 --> 37:49.740
you know, making sure that that technology

37:49.740 --> 37:52.500
understands the context that you're in a vehicle.

37:52.500 --> 37:54.240
Understands what's going on with the vehicle

37:54.240 --> 37:56.310
can help the customer with that.

37:56.310 --> 37:58.380
Understand what's going on in the real world

37:58.380 --> 37:59.400
so that the customer

37:59.400 --> 38:01.320
can actually interact with that technology,

38:01.320 --> 38:02.917
get the content, the, the services,

38:02.917 --> 38:04.950
the productivity that they want,

38:04.950 --> 38:06.690
all in a way that does not distract

38:06.690 --> 38:08.100
from the driving experience.

38:08.100 --> 38:09.810
And I just, I'm really excited to see

38:09.810 --> 38:11.523
how this goes and how we solve these things

38:11.523 --> 38:12.840
with the new technologies.

38:12.840 --> 38:14.383
<v ->Completely.</v>

38:14.383 --> 38:15.743
And I think everybody in the audience

38:15.743 --> 38:16.576
knows that question's unfair.

38:16.576 --> 38:18.630
If you're expecting anybody up here,

38:18.630 --> 38:21.240
I don't believe any of us are billionaires at this point.

38:21.240 --> 38:22.073
Nope.

38:22.073 --> 38:24.180
To predict, like, what is the feature

38:24.180 --> 38:25.650
we should be discussing in three months,

38:25.650 --> 38:27.300
six months, 12 months time.

38:27.300 --> 38:28.530
It's wrong.

38:28.530 --> 38:29.760
What we've actually been discussing

38:29.760 --> 38:31.680
is how we create the experiences

38:31.680 --> 38:33.987
and how we figure out exactly what those are

38:33.987 --> 38:35.940
and how those evolve in the future.

38:35.940 --> 38:37.230
And it goes back to the start.

38:37.230 --> 38:39.450
We know they're gonna iterate rapidly.

38:39.450 --> 38:41.820
It's about the platforms, it's about the systems,

38:41.820 --> 38:43.080
it's about the cloud stacks,

38:43.080 --> 38:43.913
it's about the silicon,

38:43.913 --> 38:46.050
about everything that comes together

38:46.050 --> 38:49.530
to allow the one in a billion person

38:49.530 --> 38:51.930
to bring those experiences that we want to see

38:51.930 --> 38:54.180
to market far faster than before.

38:54.180 --> 38:55.560
And if you sat in the audience,

38:55.560 --> 39:00.560
and if you know what that next big thing, Facebook 2.0, is,

39:01.110 --> 39:02.370
like, don't bother talking to us.

39:02.370 --> 39:03.203
Go and build it.

39:03.203 --> 39:04.140
Go and demonstrate it.

39:04.140 --> 39:06.480
Come back and show it to the world.

39:06.480 --> 39:07.530
Because we're in a race

39:07.530 --> 39:10.800
with our own expectations in automotive.

39:10.800 --> 39:14.340
And if we can collaborate through SAE, through COVESA,

39:14.340 --> 39:17.010
through commercial relationships and partner companies,

39:17.010 --> 39:18.910
and if we can make it easier to build,

39:19.835 --> 39:21.090
we are gonna win our own race

39:21.090 --> 39:23.100
and see the experiences we want.

39:23.100 --> 39:26.553
So with that, I'd love everybody to thank the panel.

39:27.800 --> 39:31.050
(audience applauding)

39:32.812 --> 39:35.130
And hopefully we'll see you next year

39:35.130 --> 39:37.440
and be able to talk about even more LLMs

39:37.440 --> 39:39.090
and proof points to the experiences.

39:39.090 --> 39:39.923
Thank you again.

39:39.923 --> 39:41.408
Bye-bye.
<v ->Thank you.</v>

39:41.408 --> 39:46.408
<v ->Thank you.
(upbeat music)</v>
