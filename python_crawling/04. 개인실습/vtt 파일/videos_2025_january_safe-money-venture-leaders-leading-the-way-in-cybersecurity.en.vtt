1
00:00.079 --> 00:02.662
(upbeat music)

2
00:10.590 --> 00:11.460
<v ->Good morning, everyone.</v>

3
00:11.460 --> 00:14.610
Welcome to our panel, Safe Money, Venture Leaders

4
00:14.610 --> 00:16.800
Leading the Way in Cybersecurity.

5
00:16.800 --> 00:18.960
My name is Chris Ahern, I'll be the moderator today

6
00:18.960 --> 00:20.100
for our panel.

7
00:20.100 --> 00:22.440
I'm a partner at Strategic Cyber Ventures.

8
00:22.440 --> 00:25.650
We're a venture capital firm based in Washington, DC.

9
00:25.650 --> 00:29.250
We invest in early stage cybersecurity technology companies.

10
00:29.250 --> 00:32.640
I've been at SCV for about eight years.

11
00:32.640 --> 00:35.070
Prior to that I was at Georgetown for my MBA

12
00:35.070 --> 00:36.930
and then before that I was at Ernst &amp; Young

13
00:36.930 --> 00:40.285
getting my, or in the audit practice there.

14
00:40.285 --> 00:41.880
So, we have a great panel today.

15
00:41.880 --> 00:43.320
We're gonna be discussing all things

16
00:43.320 --> 00:45.723
cybersecurity and venture capital.

17
00:46.590 --> 00:48.840
So why don't we start off with the round of intros.

18
00:48.840 --> 00:50.220
Kaiti, why don't you kick us off?

19
00:50.220 --> 00:53.640
<v ->Kaiti Delaney, I'm a principal at Ten Eleven Ventures.</v>

20
00:53.640 --> 00:56.100
We're a cybersecurity only fund.

21
00:56.100 --> 00:57.030
We're stage agnostic.

22
00:57.030 --> 01:00.390
Anything from series C all the way to full buyouts.

23
01:00.390 --> 01:04.710
My background is in strategic finance M&amp;A.

24
01:04.710 --> 01:07.020
I joined Ten Eleven back in 2018,

25
01:07.020 --> 01:09.420
so I've seen kind of all the hype cycles

26
01:09.420 --> 01:13.170
that have gone on over the last almost decade.

27
01:13.170 --> 01:14.460
Nick.

28
01:14.460 --> 01:16.140
<v ->Nick Sands with Citi Ventures,</v>

29
01:16.140 --> 01:19.590
it's Citibank's Venture Corporate Venture Fund.

30
01:19.590 --> 01:22.680
We invest in FinTech companies, lending marketplaces,

31
01:22.680 --> 01:25.980
Web3 to cyber dev tools, and we have about

32
01:25.980 --> 01:29.734
20 some odd cyber companies in our portfolio right now.

33
01:29.734 --> 01:32.130
I used to work at Lockheed Martin before that.

34
01:32.130 --> 01:33.890
To you, Brian.

35
01:33.890 --> 01:36.690
<v ->Brian Norville, I am the technology lead</v>

36
01:36.690 --> 01:40.380
for the IQT's cybersecurity investment practice.

37
01:40.380 --> 01:43.380
In-Q-Tel is a not-for-profit strategic investor

38
01:43.380 --> 01:45.750
and we invest in enhanced technologies

39
01:45.750 --> 01:48.003
on behalf of the national security community.

40
01:49.161 --> 01:54.120
We, so prior to IQT, I've been there for about seven years

41
01:54.120 --> 01:56.370
and prior to that I spent a number of years

42
01:56.370 --> 01:57.930
working for various organizations

43
01:57.930 --> 02:00.120
within the national security community

44
02:00.120 --> 02:02.430
as a cybersecurity practitioner.

45
02:02.430 --> 02:03.263
<v ->Great.</v>

46
02:03.263 --> 02:06.660
So maybe we can start by just kind of setting the stage

47
02:06.660 --> 02:09.990
for the cybersecurity venture capital landscape.

48
02:09.990 --> 02:13.200
So 2024 was a little bit of a comeback year

49
02:13.200 --> 02:15.330
in cybersecurity venture capital.

50
02:15.330 --> 02:19.230
2023 was fairly muted after a really strong

51
02:19.230 --> 02:23.670
and really record breaking 2021 and 2022.

52
02:23.670 --> 02:25.470
So maybe let's just kind of set the stage.

53
02:25.470 --> 02:28.410
So, Kaiti, maybe what are you seeing

54
02:28.410 --> 02:33.410
in terms of like deal activity, deal volume, valuations?

55
02:34.048 --> 02:36.270
Are you busier now than ever?

56
02:36.270 --> 02:38.807
What are you seeing today heading into 2025?

57
02:38.807 --> 02:41.250
<v ->So I'm a little biased coming off of Q4.</v>

58
02:41.250 --> 02:43.645
I think every company tries to get

59
02:43.645 --> 02:45.930
some announcement in before the holidays.

60
02:45.930 --> 02:48.210
So, Q4 was really busy.

61
02:48.210 --> 02:49.043
<v Chris>Yep.</v>

62
02:49.043 --> 02:50.730
<v ->I would say from most of the sources</v>

63
02:50.730 --> 02:53.490
that I've seen in kind of our own internal tracking,

64
02:53.490 --> 02:56.400
2024 was busier than 2023.

65
02:56.400 --> 02:58.620
I think the innovation cycles in 2023

66
02:58.620 --> 03:01.905
were a bit muted as you kind of spoke of.

67
03:01.905 --> 03:05.300
And I think then 2024, we had a lot of innovation

68
03:05.300 --> 03:10.000
in kind of the automated SOC space, a lot of data privacy,

69
03:10.000 --> 03:12.720
AI, security.

70
03:12.720 --> 03:15.930
So I think that there was a lot more hype in the market

71
03:15.930 --> 03:18.030
and we did see crazy deals

72
03:18.030 --> 03:20.760
with crazy valuations getting done.

73
03:20.760 --> 03:23.550
I think from our perspective, we're still dealing

74
03:23.550 --> 03:28.320
with an overhang of 2021 and 2022 valuations.

75
03:28.320 --> 03:31.050
So there were a decent amount of rerating

76
03:31.050 --> 03:34.980
and kind of restructurings and expectations

77
03:34.980 --> 03:37.050
when it came to fundraising.

78
03:37.050 --> 03:39.408
But I still think that it's a really robust

79
03:39.408 --> 03:41.820
funding market right now.

80
03:41.820 --> 03:46.170
And everything I've seen is 2024 was a bigger year

81
03:46.170 --> 03:50.220
in terms of dollars and deal account than 2023.

82
03:50.220 --> 03:51.053
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

83
03:51.053 --> 03:54.330
So you mentioned like really lofty valuations.

84
03:54.330 --> 03:57.000
I've seen the same thing and I've been trying

85
03:57.000 --> 03:59.567
to think about that and kind of rationalize that.

86
03:59.567 --> 04:03.240
So yeah, I mean there is still some frothiness

87
04:03.240 --> 04:05.987
in the market even though overall funding

88
04:05.987 --> 04:09.750
is kind of feels a little bit more kind of pre-pandemic.

89
04:09.750 --> 04:12.450
So, Nick, like how do you think about that?

90
04:12.450 --> 04:16.140
Just sort of kind of those two concepts

91
04:16.140 --> 04:18.780
that for some companies is really, really hard to raise

92
04:18.780 --> 04:20.940
and then other companies, you know,

93
04:20.940 --> 04:22.770
there's term sheets flying at them

94
04:22.770 --> 04:26.940
and valuations get pretty zany.

95
04:26.940 --> 04:29.550
<v ->Yeah, I mean you see it with the companies</v>

96
04:29.550 --> 04:31.920
that are just performing like exceptionally well.

97
04:31.920 --> 04:35.187
They get priced at 100x current revenue.

98
04:35.187 --> 04:37.290
And that's just pretty consistent

99
04:37.290 --> 04:40.260
across all really high-quality companies.

100
04:40.260 --> 04:42.960
Or if you're an AI company, you also get kind of

101
04:42.960 --> 04:45.513
a blank check to have a really high evaluation.

102
04:46.830 --> 04:49.620
It's tough to say exactly,

103
04:49.620 --> 04:52.440
but if you look at public markets,

104
04:52.440 --> 04:54.450
you look at the top cyber companies,

105
04:54.450 --> 04:57.110
they're the highest like valued companies

106
04:57.110 --> 05:00.059
EV to revenue out there right now.

107
05:00.059 --> 05:02.220
And I think the private markets see that,

108
05:02.220 --> 05:04.500
see the resilience of those companies, even when we go

109
05:04.500 --> 05:08.100
through economic downturns, those companies still perform

110
05:08.100 --> 05:10.020
and it's because those budgets

111
05:10.020 --> 05:12.060
don't usually go away in a downturn.

112
05:12.060 --> 05:14.220
Those budgets usually remain constant.

113
05:14.220 --> 05:17.493
<v ->Yeah, I was looking at some data for the panel.</v>

114
05:18.330 --> 05:21.480
So Altitude Cyber, they're a investment bank

115
05:21.480 --> 05:22.710
in the cybersecurity space.

116
05:22.710 --> 05:25.483
So they had some data, I thought this was interesting.

117
05:25.483 --> 05:27.350
So Q2 and Q4 of 2023, there was 1.7 billion and 1.9 billion

118
05:30.810 --> 05:33.903
of venture financing in the cybersecurity space.

119
05:34.920 --> 05:37.200
You actually have to go all the way back to 2018

120
05:37.200 --> 05:39.945
to find a single quarter with that little

121
05:39.945 --> 05:41.943
of transaction volume.

122
05:43.230 --> 05:46.103
Yeah, so it's, I mean 2018 seems like

123
05:46.103 --> 05:49.680
it's like when I started my venture career, it's like,

124
05:49.680 --> 05:51.330
it seems like ages ago.

125
05:51.330 --> 05:53.221
It was ages ago.

126
05:53.221 --> 05:56.970
I guess is that just like a hangover

127
05:56.970 --> 06:01.440
from like the craziness of 2021 and 2022?

128
06:01.440 --> 06:03.523
I dunno, Brian, do you wanna?

129
06:03.523 --> 06:04.523
<v ->No, maybe.</v>

130
06:05.366 --> 06:07.980
<v ->Or Kaiti or Nick, whoever.</v>

131
06:07.980 --> 06:11.100
<v ->Yeah, I think there's a lot of firms</v>

132
06:11.100 --> 06:16.080
that saw what crazy valuations too early

133
06:16.080 --> 06:20.940
in a company's lifecycle could do to a company

134
06:20.940 --> 06:24.120
and it's damaging on some level for their ability

135
06:24.120 --> 06:27.060
to fundraise going forward and they have

136
06:27.060 --> 06:30.150
to reset expectations and cap tables are really messy

137
06:30.150 --> 06:33.540
and recaps are not really ideal for new investors.

138
06:33.540 --> 06:38.310
So I think that there is a lot more, I would say, cognizance

139
06:38.310 --> 06:41.340
around these crazy valuations.

140
06:41.340 --> 06:44.190
Still there's hot companies and hot spaces

141
06:44.190 --> 06:48.240
that I think people are okay riding blind 100 times

142
06:48.240 --> 06:50.730
multiples on just knowing that they're gonna grow

143
06:50.730 --> 06:52.230
into them over time.

144
06:52.230 --> 06:55.830
But I do think there's more cognizance among,

145
06:55.830 --> 06:59.190
I would say the VCs in cyber and we talk a lot about

146
06:59.190 --> 07:02.219
the tourists that came in in 2021, 2022.

147
07:02.219 --> 07:03.322
They've left.

148
07:03.322 --> 07:04.710
<v Chris>Yeah.</v>
<v ->For the most part.</v>

149
07:04.710 --> 07:06.679
And so I think that also has rationalized a lot

150
07:06.679 --> 07:10.002
of the deal volumes than I think that it is more of a,

151
07:10.002 --> 07:13.230
I would say, investor friendly environment

152
07:13.230 --> 07:16.920
than it has been over the last three, four years.

153
07:16.920 --> 07:18.420
So, that's kind of my view.

154
07:18.420 --> 07:22.140
<v ->Yeah, the only other thing I'd add is that in 2023</v>

155
07:22.140 --> 07:24.510
people talked about like the VC overhang,

156
07:24.510 --> 07:25.980
there's a bunch of dry powder,

157
07:25.980 --> 07:28.230
basically funds had raised a lot of money

158
07:28.230 --> 07:29.940
and they hadn't deployed it yet.

159
07:29.940 --> 07:32.220
There's still a little bit of that in the market

160
07:32.220 --> 07:34.590
with these really highly valued companies

161
07:34.590 --> 07:37.320
is that venture firms need to deploy capital,

162
07:37.320 --> 07:39.420
and so they wanna write really big checks.

163
07:39.420 --> 07:41.460
Usually a really big check correlates

164
07:41.460 --> 07:42.720
to a really high price.

165
07:42.720 --> 07:43.695
<v Chris>Yeah.</v>

166
07:43.695 --> 07:46.170
<v ->And so we still see that for a couple companies.</v>

167
07:46.170 --> 07:47.610
<v ->Yeah, and the one thing I'll add there</v>

168
07:47.610 --> 07:50.040
is that we're seeing a lot of activity

169
07:50.040 --> 07:52.770
and interest in the hype around generative AI,

170
07:52.770 --> 07:54.720
especially in cybersecurity and we're seeing a lot

171
07:54.720 --> 07:56.970
of really great teams and repeat founders

172
07:56.970 --> 07:59.400
kind of venture out into that space.

173
07:59.400 --> 08:03.420
But I think both on the investor and buyer side,

174
08:03.420 --> 08:05.760
there's a little bit of skepticism to see

175
08:05.760 --> 08:07.740
how this actually shakes out since we're really early

176
08:07.740 --> 08:10.470
in the hype cycle and the space is moving fairly quickly.

177
08:10.470 --> 08:13.740
So what we're hearing from buyers

178
08:13.740 --> 08:15.180
is that they're really interested

179
08:15.180 --> 08:20.160
in how much incremental benefit these solutions,

180
08:20.160 --> 08:21.499
generative AI enhanced solutions provide

181
08:21.499 --> 08:23.760
over the current set of cybersecurity tools.

182
08:23.760 --> 08:26.670
So they're more interested in increased security outcomes

183
08:26.670 --> 08:29.620
and not necessarily in a novelty of applying generative AI.

184
08:30.540 --> 08:33.780
<v ->Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean I personally,</v>

185
08:33.780 --> 08:36.540
I kind of prefer this environment.

186
08:36.540 --> 08:40.050
Like I remember 2021, 2022,

187
08:40.050 --> 08:42.690
you'd meet an interesting company and the deal would,

188
08:42.690 --> 08:44.910
you know, it'd be like you have 48 hours

189
08:44.910 --> 08:48.270
to get a term sheet out and it was,

190
08:48.270 --> 08:50.400
yeah, it was just a tough environment.

191
08:50.400 --> 08:51.990
This is a little bit more, I think,

192
08:51.990 --> 08:54.273
a little bit more rational I think overall.

193
08:55.290 --> 08:58.540
So we discussed, we mentioned generative AI.

194
08:58.540 --> 09:01.230
I think, Kaiti, you mentioned data privacy

195
09:01.230 --> 09:02.763
and data security.

196
09:04.140 --> 09:07.200
In 2024, I also noticed that identity and access management

197
09:07.200 --> 09:09.963
was a very hot area in terms of investment.

198
09:11.010 --> 09:14.190
So what are the areas that you all are excited about

199
09:14.190 --> 09:15.780
heading into 2025?

200
09:17.380 --> 09:18.360
We can start with you, Kaiti.

201
09:18.360 --> 09:20.370
<v ->Yeah, so we're a little bit unique</v>

202
09:20.370 --> 09:22.020
because we're cyber only.

203
09:22.020 --> 09:25.080
We kind of have our own view of the ecosystem.

204
09:25.080 --> 09:28.410
There's like 20 big verticals that we look at

205
09:28.410 --> 09:30.750
and then we have sub-verticals within that

206
09:30.750 --> 09:32.970
and we can't invest in competing companies.

207
09:32.970 --> 09:37.410
So we have bets in kind of the data privacy side

208
09:37.410 --> 09:39.420
or the data DLP side.

209
09:39.420 --> 09:43.020
We have AI for security.

210
09:43.020 --> 09:45.240
So I would say are a little bit unique,

211
09:45.240 --> 09:50.240
but what we're looking at into 2025 is a lot around quantum.

212
09:50.910 --> 09:52.740
We haven't made a bet in that space.

213
09:52.740 --> 09:54.900
We haven't made a bet necessarily

214
09:54.900 --> 09:57.540
in smacked up application security.

215
09:57.540 --> 10:00.559
And I think that it's pretty ripe for disruption.

216
10:00.559 --> 10:03.270
We think that cloud security is something

217
10:03.270 --> 10:05.490
where the incumbents are pretty strong,

218
10:05.490 --> 10:08.730
but we hear a lot of whispers about runtime cloud security,

219
10:08.730 --> 10:10.650
so we're doing a little bit more

220
10:10.650 --> 10:12.150
of a deep dive in that space.

221
10:12.150 --> 10:17.150
So it's more of the next gen agentic AI enabled companies

222
10:18.270 --> 10:19.470
that we're starting to look at.

223
10:19.470 --> 10:24.470
So maybe next gen network security, next gen EDR.

224
10:24.600 --> 10:26.940
So those are kind of the areas that we're looking at,

225
10:26.940 --> 10:31.140
which I would say is a little different than most companies

226
10:31.140 --> 10:36.140
or most VC firms that don't have bets in security

227
10:36.180 --> 10:40.500
for AI or DLP for LLMs and whatnot.

228
10:40.500 --> 10:43.140
<v ->Yeah, so like what is the next evolution</v>

229
10:43.140 --> 10:46.890
of these various security categories likely

230
10:46.890 --> 10:51.060
with some kind of AI kind of use case.

231
10:51.060 --> 10:51.893
Nick, what about you?

232
10:51.893 --> 10:53.070
What are you interested in?

233
10:54.000 --> 10:55.920
<v ->Well, so I'm really interested in identity</v>

234
10:55.920 --> 10:57.840
and it has to do a lot with AI.

235
10:57.840 --> 10:59.940
So if you think about how, you know,

236
10:59.940 --> 11:02.430
even consumers are gonna start interacting with AI,

237
11:02.430 --> 11:05.520
like you might start telling Siri to go buy groceries

238
11:05.520 --> 11:08.700
for you, or in the context of a large business,

239
11:08.700 --> 11:11.587
you might tell some sort of bot to like,

240
11:11.587 --> 11:13.680
"Hey, go pull these reports for me."

241
11:13.680 --> 11:16.350
And so then the concept of what's an identity

242
11:16.350 --> 11:18.450
kind of changes a lot.

243
11:18.450 --> 11:21.870
Hey did like, how do you know that Steve told that AI

244
11:21.870 --> 11:23.340
to like go pull those reports?

245
11:23.340 --> 11:25.890
Like how do you have auditability around that?

246
11:25.890 --> 11:28.110
And then how do you know, hey, I told that AI

247
11:28.110 --> 11:29.880
to go buy me groceries.

248
11:29.880 --> 11:32.370
I think the way that we're gonna be transacting

249
11:32.370 --> 11:33.390
is gonna be very different.

250
11:33.390 --> 11:36.599
And so there's an entirely new identity landscape

251
11:36.599 --> 11:39.510
that's gonna have to be kind of constructed.

252
11:39.510 --> 11:42.600
We'll kind of see that play out over the next couple years

253
11:42.600 --> 11:45.300
as you start seeing more of these age agentic things.

254
11:45.300 --> 11:48.540
People are starting to see that integrated in their devices,

255
11:48.540 --> 11:51.420
in their browsers and are starting to use AI more

256
11:51.420 --> 11:54.510
to do day-to-day things and transactions.

257
11:54.510 --> 11:57.120
<v ->Yeah, we're also interested in identities</v>

258
11:57.120 --> 11:59.430
around agentic AI as that system of systems

259
11:59.430 --> 12:02.700
that are operating on your behalf in addition

260
12:02.700 --> 12:06.750
to all of the high proliferation of IOT devices that are,

261
12:06.750 --> 12:08.310
is happening in the world right now.

262
12:08.310 --> 12:10.020
And now you have devices talking to devices,

263
12:10.020 --> 12:11.760
services talking to services, which makes it

264
12:11.760 --> 12:13.680
a really complex problem.

265
12:13.680 --> 12:16.980
But we're also interested in kind of generative AI security

266
12:16.980 --> 12:18.180
in two different ways, right?

267
12:18.180 --> 12:21.720
So the first being securing enterprise use of generative AI

268
12:21.720 --> 12:24.960
and then the second, which I think everyone earlier

269
12:24.960 --> 12:27.390
kind of spoke to, applying generative AI

270
12:27.390 --> 12:28.890
to security workflows.

271
12:28.890 --> 12:32.310
So on the first piece, the way that you interact

272
12:32.310 --> 12:34.440
with generative AI models is fundamentally different

273
12:34.440 --> 12:36.720
than the way we interact with our existing

274
12:36.720 --> 12:37.920
IT systems, right?

275
12:37.920 --> 12:39.840
These systems, they're probabilistic,

276
12:39.840 --> 12:41.786
they're not deterministic.

277
12:41.786 --> 12:43.470
And you can interact with them

278
12:43.470 --> 12:45.000
in an almost infinite amount of ways.

279
12:45.000 --> 12:46.450
You can ask the same question

280
12:46.450 --> 12:48.840
and while conveying the same intent.

281
12:48.840 --> 12:51.420
And that makes it really challenging for the current crop

282
12:51.420 --> 12:53.432
of security tools that we're used to using

283
12:53.432 --> 12:56.122
to secure those environments, right?

284
12:56.122 --> 12:58.770
It's really hard to use a regex

285
12:58.770 --> 13:01.260
or a deterministic style rule or policy-based approach.

286
13:01.260 --> 13:04.170
So we've been looking at several tools in the market

287
13:04.170 --> 13:06.360
that are popping up, that are looking at combining

288
13:06.360 --> 13:09.480
the deterministic and classical detection approach

289
13:09.480 --> 13:12.480
with using additional maybe smaller models on top of that

290
13:12.480 --> 13:15.540
to kind of catch some of the variants.

291
13:15.540 --> 13:19.350
And then on the generative AI for security,

292
13:19.350 --> 13:21.360
we're kind of looking at looking at that

293
13:21.360 --> 13:22.380
in three different ways.

294
13:22.380 --> 13:26.100
So, one being upskilling your existing cyber talent.

295
13:26.100 --> 13:27.300
The second being automation,

296
13:27.300 --> 13:29.670
which I think we heard about earlier.

297
13:29.670 --> 13:31.950
And then the third being like workforce agility.

298
13:31.950 --> 13:34.440
So the upskilling is really about how do we make

299
13:34.440 --> 13:38.070
my junior analysts that just came out of a security program

300
13:38.070 --> 13:41.070
or a university a super analyst on day one, right?

301
13:41.070 --> 13:43.200
How do we automate a lot of the tedious tasks

302
13:43.200 --> 13:44.703
that they do on a daily basis?

303
13:45.540 --> 13:49.290
And then the automation is both semi-autonomous

304
13:49.290 --> 13:50.250
and fully autonomous.

305
13:50.250 --> 13:52.800
And what we're seeing and with the current set

306
13:52.800 --> 13:54.930
of cybersecurity tools, and organizations

307
13:54.930 --> 13:58.470
are still very hesitant to let their tools kind of run amuck

308
13:58.470 --> 14:00.060
in their environment and start turning knobs.

309
14:00.060 --> 14:02.400
And we see that same hesitancy carry across

310
14:02.400 --> 14:05.100
to the generative AI enhanced security tooling.

311
14:05.100 --> 14:07.650
So we think the key there is really gonna be

312
14:07.650 --> 14:08.910
about transparency, right?

313
14:08.910 --> 14:11.610
So tools that really show you exactly

314
14:11.610 --> 14:13.830
what these generative AI models are doing

315
14:13.830 --> 14:15.480
and how they're coming to the assessment

316
14:15.480 --> 14:17.370
that they're coming for the environment.

317
14:17.370 --> 14:18.630
And then the last piece,

318
14:18.630 --> 14:22.200
and then I'll hit on is workforce agility.

319
14:22.200 --> 14:26.190
We all know how hard it is to hire and retain

320
14:26.190 --> 14:28.080
really great cybersecurity talent, right?

321
14:28.080 --> 14:30.180
And then you hire them and then they spend six months

322
14:30.180 --> 14:31.740
in your organization really understanding

323
14:31.740 --> 14:33.540
your environment and then they leave.

324
14:33.540 --> 14:34.800
And that's really hard 'cause now you have

325
14:34.800 --> 14:37.140
to bring in someone else and train 'em up all over again.

326
14:37.140 --> 14:39.570
So we're looking at platforms that maybe use things

327
14:39.570 --> 14:41.310
like natural language querying that allows you

328
14:41.310 --> 14:45.810
to ask really critical questions of your cyber data sets

329
14:45.810 --> 14:47.400
in a way that makes sense for them, right?

330
14:47.400 --> 14:50.580
So that they don't have to go through the de tedious effort

331
14:50.580 --> 14:52.680
of learning new environment, learning the specific

332
14:52.680 --> 14:54.270
query languages across different tools.

333
14:54.270 --> 14:57.240
So that's really where we're focusing for the time being.

334
14:57.240 --> 15:00.303
<v ->Yeah, so you mentioned automation.</v>

335
15:03.906 --> 15:08.100
Do you see like a fully automated SOC in our future?

336
15:08.100 --> 15:10.563
So SOC is a security operations center.

337
15:11.490 --> 15:13.800
Do do you see that down the road?

338
15:13.800 --> 15:16.680
Do you have like a rough timeline in your head?

339
15:16.680 --> 15:18.870
<v ->Yeah, I think we're a ways off.</v>

340
15:18.870 --> 15:20.580
I think people are still figuring out

341
15:20.580 --> 15:23.730
how to get the full value from the current

342
15:23.730 --> 15:25.500
set of security tools.

343
15:25.500 --> 15:27.720
So for certainly for some with short organizations,

344
15:27.720 --> 15:29.490
I think they're gonna lean in, really lean into

345
15:29.490 --> 15:32.670
the fully autonomous SOC, especially at the tier one level

346
15:32.670 --> 15:34.320
where the stakes are a little bit lower.

347
15:34.320 --> 15:36.960
But I think as you go higher into the tier two

348
15:36.960 --> 15:38.880
or tier three where the stakes are higher,

349
15:38.880 --> 15:40.380
we'll see more hesitancy.

350
15:40.380 --> 15:41.340
<v ->Right.</v>

351
15:41.340 --> 15:45.660
But right now we're not really seeing fully autonomous

352
15:45.660 --> 15:49.500
like decisioning done by AI at the SOC level.

353
15:49.500 --> 15:52.080
People are just aren't quite ready for that and maybe they,

354
15:52.080 --> 15:55.110
you know, the models are not quite ready for that yet.

355
15:55.110 --> 15:56.040
<v ->Yeah, not quite ready.</v>

356
15:56.040 --> 15:58.470
There are are a few startups that are popping up

357
15:58.470 --> 16:00.450
and a lot of novel capabilities that are aiming

358
16:00.450 --> 16:03.690
to kind of develop that, but we're still early days.

359
16:03.690 --> 16:08.670
<v ->So, Kaiti, how do you think about what Brian mentioned,</v>

360
16:08.670 --> 16:11.850
like AI for cybersecurity, cybersecurity for AI,

361
16:11.850 --> 16:16.080
that's kind of a basic mental model that I use.

362
16:16.080 --> 16:18.150
So yeah, how are you thinking about that?

363
16:18.150 --> 16:21.630
Like cybersecurity impacting AI and vice versa

364
16:21.630 --> 16:24.360
and what are you excited about in AI?

365
16:24.360 --> 16:28.500
<v ->Yeah, so I think we forget that AI has been around</v>

366
16:28.500 --> 16:30.690
for cybersecurity for a long time.

367
16:30.690 --> 16:33.780
We were early investors in Cylance, Darktrace.

368
16:33.780 --> 16:38.780
They all were using some form of machine learning and AI.

369
16:39.060 --> 16:42.120
And so I don't think that part is necessarily new.

370
16:42.120 --> 16:45.960
I think what came out were LLMs and the ability

371
16:45.960 --> 16:50.490
for all companies to take advantage of the technology.

372
16:50.490 --> 16:52.950
So the hurdle rate is a lot lower.

373
16:52.950 --> 16:56.940
So I think from the aspect of AI for security,

374
16:56.940 --> 17:00.300
it's not necessarily new and kind as Brian said,

375
17:00.300 --> 17:01.800
we have a long ways to go.

376
17:01.800 --> 17:04.980
I think we're early in the lifecycle of being able

377
17:04.980 --> 17:08.460
to fully trust AI in their decision making.

378
17:08.460 --> 17:11.190
If you look at network detection, a lot of people

379
17:11.190 --> 17:14.760
don't have the auto remediate on there

380
17:14.760 --> 17:17.310
'cause they don't want their networked connection

381
17:17.310 --> 17:18.920
to just be cut off.
<v Chris>Right.</v>

382
17:18.920 --> 17:21.480
<v ->So I think human in the loop is gonna be really important</v>

383
17:21.480 --> 17:24.600
and I think we're probably five plus years out

384
17:24.600 --> 17:29.600
of being able to actually have things go autonomously.

385
17:29.700 --> 17:34.200
So tier one level triaging and a SOC is a great use case

386
17:34.200 --> 17:35.708
'cause it's low stakes.

387
17:35.708 --> 17:38.700
In terms of security for AI,

388
17:38.700 --> 17:40.650
I think that's a really innovative space.

389
17:40.650 --> 17:42.720
We've invested in hidden layer,

390
17:42.720 --> 17:45.000
which has kind of coined the MLDR.

391
17:45.000 --> 17:47.550
So it's machine learning detection and response.

392
17:47.550 --> 17:49.530
And I think there's a lot of opportunities there.

393
17:49.530 --> 17:51.990
So there's a lot of the governance

394
17:51.990 --> 17:54.270
and compliance piece of AI.

395
17:54.270 --> 17:57.390
I think that there is a lot of opportunity

396
17:57.390 --> 18:01.380
for companies to do the DLP side of LLMs

397
18:01.380 --> 18:04.170
and the usage more across the enterprise.

398
18:04.170 --> 18:07.383
So I think that's an area I think of more innovation.

399
18:08.400 --> 18:11.350
And I think we have a long ways to go for AI for security.

400
18:11.350 --> 18:13.650
<v ->Yeah, so maybe touch on that.</v>

401
18:13.650 --> 18:15.000
You mentioned hidden layer.

402
18:15.847 --> 18:17.327
Like what are sort of some

403
18:17.327 --> 18:20.520
of the cybersecurity risks associated with AI?

404
18:20.520 --> 18:25.520
I mean, I think every Fortune 1000 in the country

405
18:25.680 --> 18:29.613
wants to adopt AI, but I know security is top of mind.

406
18:30.630 --> 18:31.980
For the audience that maybe doesn't know,

407
18:31.980 --> 18:36.090
like what's the risk of adopting these technologies?

408
18:36.090 --> 18:38.160
You mentioned data loss.

409
18:38.160 --> 18:41.730
What are some of the concerns that companies

410
18:41.730 --> 18:43.470
like Hidden Layer help with?

411
18:43.470 --> 18:45.660
<v ->Yeah, so there's data poisoning.</v>

412
18:45.660 --> 18:48.480
So somebody could come in and tamper

413
18:48.480 --> 18:50.250
with the data that's training your model.

414
18:50.250 --> 18:51.690
It might not be operating the way

415
18:51.690 --> 18:53.910
that you had intended it to.

416
18:53.910 --> 18:56.880
Kind of a good example is all the autonomous cars,

417
18:56.880 --> 19:00.660
they learn off of stop signs so that they know how to stop,

418
19:00.660 --> 19:03.450
but you could go in and basically change the algorithm

419
19:03.450 --> 19:06.900
or change the data so that they end up blowing through them.

420
19:06.900 --> 19:08.520
So making sure that they're actually

421
19:08.520 --> 19:09.870
operating the way that they should.

422
19:09.870 --> 19:12.480
Hallucinations is the other one.

423
19:12.480 --> 19:16.140
As we've all kind of seen in the news,

424
19:16.140 --> 19:21.140
it's all what's feeding into your data is kind of the,

425
19:21.570 --> 19:24.630
I would say the goldmine of AI/ML.

426
19:24.630 --> 19:27.030
So having proprietary data that's protected

427
19:27.030 --> 19:30.335
and not tamperable is really important.

428
19:30.335 --> 19:33.630
And then it's also kind of that compliance piece.

429
19:33.630 --> 19:37.440
So there's a lot of watermarking of making sure

430
19:37.440 --> 19:40.050
that the content is AI generated,

431
19:40.050 --> 19:44.040
that a lot of these companies are being forced to produce.

432
19:44.040 --> 19:48.870
And so being able to almost do like an AI bomb

433
19:48.870 --> 19:51.330
of where everything is coming from

434
19:51.330 --> 19:53.490
and being able to accredit the fact

435
19:53.490 --> 19:56.490
that it's AI generated is also important.

436
19:56.490 --> 19:59.160
<v ->Yeah, I would love to hear what Brian has to say about it,</v>

437
19:59.160 --> 20:01.764
but I think just to add to what Kaiti just said.

438
20:01.764 --> 20:03.810
One of the key things to think about it

439
20:03.810 --> 20:05.670
is it's application software

440
20:05.670 --> 20:08.760
just like you would download repos from GitHub,

441
20:08.760 --> 20:11.010
but there are different type of application.

442
20:11.010 --> 20:13.560
And so the entire supply chain's really important.

443
20:13.560 --> 20:17.160
Like lots of companies mid market to up market

444
20:17.160 --> 20:19.530
scan their code before it ever goes to production.

445
20:19.530 --> 20:21.300
They scan their open source code.

446
20:21.300 --> 20:23.310
You should be scanning your models the same way.

447
20:23.310 --> 20:25.620
You should understand where your model came from,

448
20:25.620 --> 20:28.020
who's the one who uploaded it last

449
20:28.020 --> 20:30.455
in probably something like Hugging Face.

450
20:30.455 --> 20:32.100
Are you getting 'em from Google?

451
20:32.100 --> 20:33.784
Are you getting them from OpenAI?

452
20:33.784 --> 20:35.280
And you should understand where those

453
20:35.280 --> 20:36.990
are going in production and you should understand

454
20:36.990 --> 20:38.490
that entire lifecycle.

455
20:38.490 --> 20:40.350
And we're just starting to see companies

456
20:40.350 --> 20:41.970
that are trying to tackle that problem.

457
20:41.970 --> 20:44.400
But that's the problem that enterprises are gonna start

458
20:44.400 --> 20:46.590
facing in the next year or two.

459
20:46.590 --> 20:48.060
<v ->Yeah, completely agree.</v>

460
20:48.060 --> 20:50.670
I think companies like Hugging Face,

461
20:50.670 --> 20:52.980
there where GitHub was like several years ago

462
20:52.980 --> 20:55.530
before they really started scrutinizing the code

463
20:55.530 --> 20:58.020
that's there and running their own kind of internal

464
20:58.020 --> 20:59.733
and community-based scans on it.

465
21:00.600 --> 21:03.630
But I would say DLP, that's the one area

466
21:03.630 --> 21:04.920
where I think is the biggest

467
21:04.920 --> 21:07.410
and what we hear from CISOs a lot.

468
21:07.410 --> 21:09.870
And it's been really fascinating to see

469
21:09.870 --> 21:14.870
how quickly generative AI has been adopted by organizations,

470
21:15.180 --> 21:17.310
so enterprises and consumers, right?

471
21:17.310 --> 21:18.810
So everyone started using it

472
21:18.810 --> 21:21.870
for some sort of productivity gain.

473
21:21.870 --> 21:24.750
And a lot of organizations realize like, wait, "Hey,

474
21:24.750 --> 21:27.390
our engineers are copying in proprietary code

475
21:27.390 --> 21:30.720
and are using it to write things, right?

476
21:30.720 --> 21:32.640
And our sensitive information is just going out the door."

477
21:32.640 --> 21:34.470
We really don't understand these things enough.

478
21:34.470 --> 21:36.120
We don't understand where they're being stored,

479
21:36.120 --> 21:38.280
who has access to that data?

480
21:38.280 --> 21:40.680
Is the model being retrained on that and will it spit it out

481
21:40.680 --> 21:42.570
to one of our competitors later, right?

482
21:42.570 --> 21:46.717
So the initial kind of response by the market was just like,

483
21:46.717 --> 21:48.300
"Hey, let's block everything."

484
21:48.300 --> 21:51.900
And then as we began to understand, there's been policies,

485
21:51.900 --> 21:54.300
data security policies that organizations have put in place

486
21:54.300 --> 21:58.530
around that and we're really seeing the DLP cybersecurity

487
21:58.530 --> 22:01.080
or DLP tools for AI models coming into play,

488
22:01.080 --> 22:02.730
looking at the prompts that are going in

489
22:02.730 --> 22:04.770
and out of these platforms and making sure

490
22:04.770 --> 22:07.630
that the people who need access to that data

491
22:08.520 --> 22:10.410
can only access that data and nothing else.

492
22:10.410 --> 22:11.880
And I think that also ties into

493
22:11.880 --> 22:13.923
Nick's point earlier on identity.

494
22:15.060 --> 22:17.073
<v ->So, Brian, when you talk to companies,</v>

495
22:18.030 --> 22:21.000
what sort of the breakdown of,

496
22:21.000 --> 22:22.740
so companies that are use using LLMs,

497
22:22.740 --> 22:27.497
what's sort of the breakdown of closed source, open source?

498
22:29.190 --> 22:31.140
Are they taking open source models

499
22:31.140 --> 22:33.060
off the shelf and customizing them?

500
22:33.060 --> 22:35.580
Do you have like kind of an idea in your head

501
22:35.580 --> 22:38.790
of how these are all kind of breaking out a little bit?

502
22:38.790 --> 22:41.190
<v ->Yeah, I think we're seeing a little bit of both, right?</v>

503
22:41.190 --> 22:44.130
So obviously in Intel we operate

504
22:44.130 --> 22:46.080
on behalf of the national security community.

505
22:46.080 --> 22:49.320
And I would say a close analogy is the financial sector.

506
22:49.320 --> 22:51.170
That's super highly regulated, right?

507
22:52.099 --> 22:53.490
So I think for the commercial market

508
22:53.490 --> 22:56.580
is certainly fine to use some of the closed source

509
22:56.580 --> 23:01.580
hosted models like your ChatGPTs and others,

510
23:02.220 --> 23:04.920
or Gemini and other that are offered.

511
23:04.920 --> 23:08.220
But for close environments that are disconnected

512
23:08.220 --> 23:10.110
from the internet, we're seeing companies

513
23:10.110 --> 23:12.390
really think about how to provide the same value

514
23:12.390 --> 23:14.130
that they would provide to their commercial customers,

515
23:14.130 --> 23:15.420
to those environments as well.

516
23:15.420 --> 23:16.740
So I would say it's a hybrid of both,

517
23:16.740 --> 23:18.420
but it's really mostly about the customer

518
23:18.420 --> 23:19.950
and the deployment environment.

519
23:19.950 --> 23:21.194
<v ->Gotcha.</v>

520
23:21.194 --> 23:26.194
So, 2024 was an interesting year in cybersecurity though.

521
23:26.730 --> 23:28.770
I think there's basically never

522
23:28.770 --> 23:30.423
a dull year in cybersecurity.

523
23:31.410 --> 23:35.580
So we had the largest telecoms hack

524
23:35.580 --> 23:38.250
in maybe the country's history.

525
23:38.250 --> 23:41.850
We had a large outage, IT outage,

526
23:41.850 --> 23:44.070
caused by a cybersecurity vendor.

527
23:44.070 --> 23:46.990
And then there was also most recently

528
23:48.330 --> 23:50.310
an incident at the Department of Treasury.

529
23:50.310 --> 23:54.570
I guess for me it seems like these events

530
23:54.570 --> 23:58.770
are getting bigger and bigger each year, broader and broader

531
23:58.770 --> 24:00.483
and more and more impactful.

532
24:01.440 --> 24:04.023
What's your your take on this?

533
24:04.890 --> 24:07.890
Is this like just the new normal?

534
24:07.890 --> 24:09.780
Kaiti, I dunno, we can start with you.

535
24:09.780 --> 24:12.150
<v ->Yeah, so I think that even with AI,</v>

536
24:12.150 --> 24:14.910
it's gonna get even more difficult to defend against

537
24:14.910 --> 24:18.060
because the attacks are gonna get better and better

538
24:18.060 --> 24:21.240
and I think social engineering's gonna get trickier

539
24:21.240 --> 24:24.480
and I think the human aspect of cybersecurity

540
24:24.480 --> 24:27.144
is the hardest to defend against.

541
24:27.144 --> 24:28.950
And so I think what we've started to see

542
24:28.950 --> 24:31.050
is a zero trust architecture

543
24:31.050 --> 24:33.090
where you just don't trust anybody.

544
24:33.090 --> 24:34.680
And I think that's gonna be

545
24:34.680 --> 24:37.350
kind of the go forward assumption

546
24:37.350 --> 24:39.390
is that you've already been breached

547
24:39.390 --> 24:42.180
and you have to basically make sure

548
24:42.180 --> 24:44.198
that you are not gonna get exfiltrated

549
24:44.198 --> 24:47.850
or that you are taking the precautions to make sure

550
24:47.850 --> 24:52.170
that there's not huge ramifications after a breach.

551
24:52.170 --> 24:55.320
So I think that kind of that zero trust architecture

552
24:55.320 --> 24:57.303
is gonna be the go forward norm.

553
24:58.295 --> 25:00.567
And I do think that we're gonna have to fight

554
25:00.567 --> 25:04.653
more sophisticated attacks with more sophisticated tools.

555
25:05.916 --> 25:06.749
Yeah.

556
25:06.749 --> 25:08.677
<v ->Yeah, if you talk to most CISOs they'll say like,</v>

557
25:08.677 --> 25:11.730
"It's not if but when you'll get hacked."

558
25:11.730 --> 25:13.140
I think that's gonna be, you know,

559
25:13.140 --> 25:14.520
going forward it's gonna be much the same.

560
25:14.520 --> 25:17.010
And you see like a couple key categories

561
25:17.010 --> 25:18.780
where like people are investing in things

562
25:18.780 --> 25:20.340
that are gonna allow you to continue your,

563
25:20.340 --> 25:23.220
allow your business to continue to operate

564
25:23.220 --> 25:24.420
even though you've been hacked.

565
25:24.420 --> 25:26.100
So like Rubrik just went public,

566
25:26.100 --> 25:29.430
and that's a cloud data backup company.

567
25:29.430 --> 25:30.900
There's a bunch of interesting companies

568
25:30.900 --> 25:33.933
that are just focused on alleviating ransomware.

569
25:35.653 --> 25:37.410
So part of your systems get ransomware,

570
25:37.410 --> 25:38.970
they capture the encryption keys

571
25:38.970 --> 25:41.610
and they're able to unransomware your keys.

572
25:41.610 --> 25:42.570
So you've still been hacked,

573
25:42.570 --> 25:45.600
but you can continue to operate your business.

574
25:45.600 --> 25:48.060
I think you're gonna start seeing more and more technologies

575
25:48.060 --> 25:50.730
that allow people to continue to do their work

576
25:50.730 --> 25:53.190
even when they're someone inside your systems

577
25:53.190 --> 25:56.133
that you're trying to actively get outta your systems.

578
25:57.030 --> 25:59.190
<v ->Yeah, I agree with Nick and Kaiti.</v>

579
25:59.190 --> 26:00.720
The other thing I'll add.

580
26:00.720 --> 26:03.060
With some of these attacks, a lot of them

581
26:03.060 --> 26:05.100
have been focused on legacy infrastructure

582
26:05.100 --> 26:07.830
and traditionally these devices, they're old,

583
26:07.830 --> 26:09.480
they weren't developed with security in mind

584
26:09.480 --> 26:12.360
and people are very hesitant to do anything to them, right?

585
26:12.360 --> 26:14.280
Like you can't apply your traditional

586
26:14.280 --> 26:17.190
or your general purpose compute on cybersecurity solutions

587
26:17.190 --> 26:19.050
to these devices because they might break.

588
26:19.050 --> 26:21.750
And in a critical infrastructure situation

589
26:21.750 --> 26:23.580
that might have catastrophic consequences.

590
26:23.580 --> 26:27.060
So, I think we need to look at

591
26:27.060 --> 26:29.220
implementing security practices in those environments,

592
26:29.220 --> 26:32.280
which will help with some of these really large attacks

593
26:32.280 --> 26:34.680
that where the attackers are able to kind of operate

594
26:34.680 --> 26:36.690
low and slow within the environment.

595
26:36.690 --> 26:38.010
The other thing that I think

596
26:38.010 --> 26:40.710
is key for the industry going forward is a renewed focus

597
26:40.710 --> 26:43.653
on cyber data management and cyber data analytics.

598
26:44.760 --> 26:47.280
A lot of these attackers, they're practicing kind of

599
26:47.280 --> 26:51.090
living off the land, so they're using benign tools

600
26:51.090 --> 26:53.070
that exist on your system that wouldn't necessarily

601
26:53.070 --> 26:55.170
raise an alarm to operate and persist

602
26:55.170 --> 26:57.483
within that network without flagging

603
26:57.483 --> 27:00.660
by being flagged by any of the security tools.

604
27:00.660 --> 27:03.090
And this may happen over the course of a year, right?

605
27:03.090 --> 27:06.270
And many organizations, it's really expensive to store data

606
27:06.270 --> 27:07.980
and oftentimes you have a 30 day window

607
27:07.980 --> 27:10.380
and then after that it's like out the window.

608
27:10.380 --> 27:12.510
So figuring out ways that we can figure out

609
27:12.510 --> 27:14.430
which information we need, normalize it,

610
27:14.430 --> 27:16.620
so it's all in a similar format.

611
27:16.620 --> 27:18.330
And then get that into the right place.

612
27:18.330 --> 27:20.610
so that we can drop really critical insights out of it,

613
27:20.610 --> 27:22.350
I think is gonna be essential in the future

614
27:22.350 --> 27:24.840
to really highlight anomalies.

615
27:24.840 --> 27:28.200
<v ->Yeah, I think there's so much interconnectedness.</v>

616
27:28.200 --> 27:32.130
You have software using third-party software.

617
27:32.130 --> 27:35.100
Sometimes that software is using other third-party software

618
27:35.100 --> 27:39.550
and open source software that when you have a breach

619
27:41.040 --> 27:44.730
of a software application, and it's used

620
27:44.730 --> 27:46.470
by a hundred thousand customers.

621
27:46.470 --> 27:50.253
I mean, that's gonna be just a fairly catastrophic event.

622
27:51.570 --> 27:54.665
On that topic, have you all looked at

623
27:54.665 --> 27:57.783
software supply chain security companies?

624
27:58.650 --> 28:02.610
<v ->Yeah, so I think 2021 was kind of the poster year</v>

625
28:02.610 --> 28:04.950
of software supply chain companies

626
28:04.950 --> 28:07.170
just given the SolarWinds breach.

627
28:07.170 --> 28:10.800
So I think that the market went crazy in 2021

628
28:10.800 --> 28:12.150
and all of the companies that came

629
28:12.150 --> 28:14.340
to market got crazy valuations.

630
28:14.340 --> 28:16.686
We actually sat out just because we couldn't get there

631
28:16.686 --> 28:20.490
in terms of exit profile given the valuations

632
28:20.490 --> 28:21.570
that they were requiring.

633
28:21.570 --> 28:23.850
But yes, we've seen a ton of them

634
28:23.850 --> 28:27.840
and I think that it's a pretty fragmented space still.

635
28:27.840 --> 28:30.640
There's a lot when you look at the SDLC

636
28:31.560 --> 28:33.660
to see kind of where you can play in.

637
28:33.660 --> 28:37.700
I think Snyk's kind of the best well-known, maybe Veracode

638
28:37.700 --> 28:42.700
in that space where you can have a whole suite of tools

639
28:42.870 --> 28:43.890
that help you kind of do

640
28:43.890 --> 28:46.950
that software supply chain analysis.

641
28:46.950 --> 28:48.120
So yeah, we spent a lot of time,

642
28:48.120 --> 28:51.603
we haven't necessarily made a bet in this space.

643
28:52.440 --> 28:55.020
<v ->Yeah, we invested in a company called Indoor Labs.</v>

644
28:55.020 --> 28:56.637
We're also investors in Snyk.

645
28:56.637 --> 28:59.640
And I think with all things software supply chain,

646
28:59.640 --> 29:04.443
it's about increasing kind of signal to noise.

647
29:04.443 --> 29:06.540
So a lot of tools out there are super, super noisy,

648
29:06.540 --> 29:10.398
whether it's a SaaS tool, an SCA tool, a DAS tool.

649
29:10.398 --> 29:14.160
Your people who are analyzing these results

650
29:14.160 --> 29:17.100
get a swamp of data and then they have to go decide

651
29:17.100 --> 29:18.330
like what to go fix first.

652
29:18.330 --> 29:20.250
What am I gonna go tell my developers to fix first?

653
29:20.250 --> 29:23.010
And it's really difficult problem.

654
29:23.010 --> 29:25.980
So there's new techniques coming out there that are able

655
29:25.980 --> 29:28.140
to tell like, well, this is a vulnerability,

656
29:28.140 --> 29:30.420
but this one actually gets executed in your code,

657
29:30.420 --> 29:31.920
so that's probably something you should fix.

658
29:31.920 --> 29:33.870
This is a vulnerability, it doesn't get executed

659
29:33.870 --> 29:36.175
in your code, so you shouldn't fix it.

660
29:36.175 --> 29:39.930
As well as like new techniques in SCA to just improve

661
29:39.930 --> 29:42.240
kind of signal to noise ratio for reachability.

662
29:42.240 --> 29:44.970
So I think there's just a lot of really cool innovation

663
29:44.970 --> 29:47.137
in this space right now and I think

664
29:47.137 --> 29:48.510
you're gonna kind of continue to see that

665
29:48.510 --> 29:51.540
because it's so important going into '25.

666
29:51.540 --> 29:53.070
<v ->Yeah, we're also interested in the</v>

667
29:53.070 --> 29:55.350
software supply chain security space.

668
29:55.350 --> 29:58.050
We're looking at it from the lens of secure by design.

669
29:58.050 --> 29:59.490
So secure by design software.

670
29:59.490 --> 30:01.470
So there's companies out there like Chainguard,

671
30:01.470 --> 30:04.620
which offer containers that they kind of rebuild

672
30:04.620 --> 30:07.080
from scratch with where they can promise zero

673
30:07.080 --> 30:08.940
or near zero CVEs over the lifetime

674
30:08.940 --> 30:10.950
of your use of that container.

675
30:10.950 --> 30:12.720
We're also interested in software

676
30:12.720 --> 30:14.400
contributor analysis, right?

677
30:14.400 --> 30:17.490
So most people when they go to write code today,

678
30:17.490 --> 30:20.070
the first line in that code is an import or an include.

679
30:20.070 --> 30:21.660
And immediately they're bringing in

680
30:21.660 --> 30:23.970
potentially thousands of lines of code that let's be honest,

681
30:23.970 --> 30:26.250
like no one sits there and looks through it, right?

682
30:26.250 --> 30:28.860
And that is introducing vulnerabilities

683
30:28.860 --> 30:30.270
into your environment, which could have

684
30:30.270 --> 30:32.640
like really bad consequences down the road.

685
30:32.640 --> 30:35.892
So number one, we need to understand the provenance

686
30:35.892 --> 30:38.760
of those pieces of code and libraries

687
30:38.760 --> 30:40.260
and dependencies that we're bringing in.

688
30:40.260 --> 30:43.140
And we also need to know who's contributing to those, right?

689
30:43.140 --> 30:45.180
So if you go to these projects on GitHub,

690
30:45.180 --> 30:47.460
there's a long list of user handles

691
30:47.460 --> 30:49.620
and screen names of people that we have no idea

692
30:49.620 --> 30:50.453
where they're from, right?

693
30:50.453 --> 30:53.831
It may list a geographic IP, but that's really hard

694
30:53.831 --> 30:55.830
to actually truly pinpoint.

695
30:55.830 --> 30:59.250
So I think solutions, we've been looking at solutions

696
30:59.250 --> 31:01.830
that can help us to gain a more holistic understanding

697
31:01.830 --> 31:03.300
of the people contributing to the code

698
31:03.300 --> 31:05.253
within our environments and our code.

699
31:06.090 --> 31:06.923
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

700
31:06.923 --> 31:09.690
And that is the beauty of open source as well

701
31:09.690 --> 31:13.890
is that you can actually look at and analyze the code.

702
31:13.890 --> 31:15.360
So, let's see.

703
31:15.360 --> 31:18.520
So we all invest at kind of different stages

704
31:18.520 --> 31:23.050
of the software lifecycle or sorry, the startup lifecycle

705
31:24.060 --> 31:26.310
and we all have like kind of slightly different mandates

706
31:26.310 --> 31:28.740
though there is a lot of overlap.

707
31:28.740 --> 31:32.400
What are some of the things that you all look for

708
31:32.400 --> 31:37.080
when evaluating these early stage technology companies?

709
31:37.080 --> 31:38.730
Kaiti, maybe we can start with you.

710
31:38.730 --> 31:41.760
<v ->Yeah, so my background is actually in more public markets.</v>

711
31:41.760 --> 31:43.890
So when I started venture and realized

712
31:43.890 --> 31:48.890
there's no revenue to value, I was a little dumbfounded.

713
31:49.230 --> 31:51.720
Math is really easy in venture,

714
31:51.720 --> 31:53.760
it's really more of the intangibles.

715
31:53.760 --> 31:56.450
So the team, especially in cybersecurity,

716
31:56.450 --> 31:59.460
you've really gotta have that ecosystem

717
31:59.460 --> 32:01.050
of who's your next hire.

718
32:01.050 --> 32:03.030
And so people coming out of really

719
32:03.030 --> 32:05.610
well-known big cybersecurity companies

720
32:05.610 --> 32:08.730
that know who their number one, two, three next hires

721
32:08.730 --> 32:10.230
are really important.

722
32:10.230 --> 32:12.570
So, a lot of times you're betting on the team.

723
32:12.570 --> 32:13.680
On the product side.

724
32:13.680 --> 32:15.787
I mean even in public markets you're like,

725
32:15.787 --> 32:17.670
"Oh, I know exactly what products I could do

726
32:17.670 --> 32:18.900
with some of the parts."

727
32:18.900 --> 32:20.610
Half the time they don't even have a product,

728
32:20.610 --> 32:23.010
they have a deck and an idea.

729
32:23.010 --> 32:26.370
So a lot of times it's the feasibility, the architecture,

730
32:26.370 --> 32:28.260
what the incumbents are doing

731
32:28.260 --> 32:30.540
and the vulnerabilities in the incumbents.

732
32:30.540 --> 32:34.560
And so it's more, I would say, future looking,

733
32:34.560 --> 32:35.940
you know, what can they do?

734
32:35.940 --> 32:39.029
And then we look at go to market as well.

735
32:39.029 --> 32:42.120
So, are the incumbents really well funded?

736
32:42.120 --> 32:43.740
Like Wiz is a really great example.

737
32:43.740 --> 32:46.170
Like I don't think I'd wanna go up against Wiz

738
32:46.170 --> 32:48.543
directly in the synapse space right now.

739
32:49.380 --> 32:51.240
And so you start to really look at like

740
32:51.240 --> 32:53.310
how they're gonna market motion's gonna impact

741
32:53.310 --> 32:54.810
their success going forward.

742
32:54.810 --> 32:57.810
And then daily odds is kind of what we call

743
32:57.810 --> 33:00.690
the term sheets and the valuations.

744
33:00.690 --> 33:02.370
Like if you're getting in a series A

745
33:02.370 --> 33:05.970
at a hundred million posts, most cybersecurity companies

746
33:05.970 --> 33:10.970
are exiting at less than 450 million to strategic companies.

747
33:11.550 --> 33:14.670
So when you're looking at 10x in your early seed As.

748
33:14.670 --> 33:17.610
That's pretty difficult to do when you start to do the math.

749
33:17.610 --> 33:20.220
So there does have to be some easy math

750
33:20.220 --> 33:21.480
that corresponds with it.

751
33:21.480 --> 33:23.070
And then because we're cyber only,

752
33:23.070 --> 33:28.070
we have to preclude ourselves from any competing spaces.

753
33:28.170 --> 33:30.270
So we don't wanna to have any companies

754
33:30.270 --> 33:32.910
that are gonna have a conflict of interest

755
33:32.910 --> 33:34.020
with us being on the board.

756
33:34.020 --> 33:36.570
So that's the other nuance for us.

757
33:36.570 --> 33:40.950
<v ->Yeah, yeah, I have a friend who invests in public markets</v>

758
33:40.950 --> 33:43.650
and he's like, "I don't know how you guys do what you do.

759
33:43.650 --> 33:45.557
There's no information."

760
33:45.557 --> 33:46.390
(panelists chuckling)

761
33:46.390 --> 33:48.390
And I'm like, "I don't know how you do what you do.

762
33:48.390 --> 33:50.730
There's an overwhelming amount of information.

763
33:50.730 --> 33:53.850
You can almost just drown in the amount of information."

764
33:53.850 --> 33:57.480
So, Nick, so what are you,

765
33:57.480 --> 34:01.080
I guess, yeah, from your perspective,

766
34:01.080 --> 34:04.110
what are you seeing in terms of like the market?

767
34:04.110 --> 34:06.600
<v ->Yeah, I mean I think it really depends on</v>

768
34:06.600 --> 34:10.451
like how the economy goes this year and still TBD.

769
34:10.451 --> 34:14.220
I think if things continue as they go this year,

770
34:14.220 --> 34:15.750
then it's gonna be a lot like 2024

771
34:15.750 --> 34:17.670
and we're gonna have another hot year,

772
34:17.670 --> 34:18.660
a lot of acquisitions.

773
34:18.660 --> 34:19.770
Like one thing that we did mention

774
34:19.770 --> 34:21.180
in terms of big cyber events,

775
34:21.180 --> 34:23.940
Splunk got bought for $16 billion last year.

776
34:23.940 --> 34:26.296
That's maybe the biggest cyber acquisition ever.

777
34:26.296 --> 34:27.963
<v Chris>I think so, yeah.</v>

778
34:27.963 --> 34:30.484
<v ->So, I think we're gonna continue to see that.</v>

779
34:30.484 --> 34:32.250
There are a lot of companies out there

780
34:32.250 --> 34:34.620
and a lot of companies that are valued way higher

781
34:34.620 --> 34:35.850
than their current traction.

782
34:35.850 --> 34:37.980
And maybe those companies aren't gonna go anywhere.

783
34:37.980 --> 34:40.350
And so you're gonna see strategic acquirers

784
34:40.350 --> 34:42.390
start buying them and not just cyber companies.

785
34:42.390 --> 34:43.710
You're not gonna just see CrowdStrike buying,

786
34:43.710 --> 34:46.709
but you're gonna see the likes of Google, Amazon,

787
34:46.709 --> 34:51.210
other companies, IBM, et cetera, that are gonna be looking

788
34:51.210 --> 34:53.520
to pick up these teams and pick up these products

789
34:53.520 --> 34:55.950
because of how important this market is

790
34:55.950 --> 34:59.403
to anything IT related right now.

791
35:00.277 --> 35:01.110
<v Chris>Yeah.</v>

792
35:01.110 --> 35:01.943
<v ->Yeah, right.</v>

793
35:01.943 --> 35:03.630
Other thing I'll add on to Kaiti's point on team,

794
35:03.630 --> 35:06.270
we're looking at the technical pedigree of the founders

795
35:06.270 --> 35:10.080
and the engineering team, especially as related to the space

796
35:10.080 --> 35:11.280
that they're operating in, right?

797
35:11.280 --> 35:13.710
So if you're someone that's developing an embedded system

798
35:13.710 --> 35:15.900
security company, that's a very specific profile

799
35:15.900 --> 35:17.190
of a person.

800
35:17.190 --> 35:19.500
I'd also say just given that generative AI

801
35:19.500 --> 35:22.170
is the new hotness and all cybersecurity,

802
35:22.170 --> 35:24.480
a lot of cybersecurity companies are looking

803
35:24.480 --> 35:27.382
to incorporate generative AI into their product offerings.

804
35:27.382 --> 35:29.460
We're looking for that AI and data skill set

805
35:29.460 --> 35:31.110
in addition to the security expertise

806
35:31.110 --> 35:33.570
on those founding teams, 'cause we feel like that

807
35:33.570 --> 35:36.030
is a fundamentally different skill

808
35:36.030 --> 35:38.850
and it's gonna be really critical as these companies scale

809
35:38.850 --> 35:42.270
to support enterprise level data.

810
35:42.270 --> 35:44.220
<v ->Yep, so we have five minutes left.</v>

811
35:44.220 --> 35:45.930
We're also happy to take questions.

812
35:45.930 --> 35:49.260
So if you have any questions, you know, feel free to come up

813
35:49.260 --> 35:52.353
to one of the mics and and we can answer that.

814
35:53.460 --> 35:54.990
Oh.
<v Bob>Yeah.</v>

815
35:54.990 --> 35:55.840
<v ->Sure, go ahead.</v>

816
35:57.229 --> 36:00.090
<v Bob>Hello, Bob Struble from Blue Venture Investors.</v>

817
36:00.090 --> 36:02.280
I think we've worked with a couple of y'all.

818
36:02.280 --> 36:04.590
Just something Nick said, pops in my head

819
36:04.590 --> 36:07.830
it was sort of the exit path to strategics,

820
36:07.830 --> 36:10.050
non-cyber strategics, the Googles and the Microsofts,

821
36:10.050 --> 36:11.640
et cetera, of the world.

822
36:11.640 --> 36:14.040
Everywhere else we're hearing that those people

823
36:14.040 --> 36:16.530
are gonna go crazy investing in buying an AI companies

824
36:16.530 --> 36:17.880
and there's not enough skills, et cetera.

825
36:17.880 --> 36:21.750
So the thought is, is there potentially a crowding out

826
36:21.750 --> 36:25.770
of time, attention, money as those big enterprises

827
36:25.770 --> 36:28.140
look for the AI skill sets and cyber

828
36:28.140 --> 36:29.790
kind of falls to the back burner?

829
36:31.200 --> 36:32.340
<v ->Sorry, could you rephrase the question?</v>

830
36:32.340 --> 36:33.510
Like, what are you asking?

831
36:33.510 --> 36:35.700
<v Bob>I'm talking about if Google and Microsoft</v>

832
36:35.700 --> 36:39.210
and other large enterprises are gonna be viable exit paths

833
36:39.210 --> 36:42.780
for our portfolio companies, does the attention on cyber

834
36:42.780 --> 36:44.790
that we've seen become diminished

835
36:44.790 --> 36:48.270
because there is so much focus now on AI and acquihire

836
36:48.270 --> 36:49.590
and we've gotta get these skill sets

837
36:49.590 --> 36:52.170
and there's not enough out there on the AI side itself?

838
36:52.170 --> 36:54.510
<v ->Oh yeah, no, I mean that's definitely a great question.</v>

839
36:54.510 --> 36:56.160
Probably best to be answered by someone

840
36:56.160 --> 36:57.840
who works at Google or Microsoft.

841
36:57.840 --> 37:02.160
But I mean, I think if you think about what those companies

842
37:02.160 --> 37:03.150
are thinking about strategically,

843
37:03.150 --> 37:07.170
like they're very AI focused right now and their M&amp;A teams

844
37:07.170 --> 37:09.030
are very AI focused right now,

845
37:09.030 --> 37:12.660
including cyber companies whose M&amp;A teams

846
37:12.660 --> 37:14.700
are very AI focused as well.

847
37:14.700 --> 37:16.350
So I think it's a totally valid point.

848
37:16.350 --> 37:18.510
I mean I think we'll have to see how the year goes,

849
37:18.510 --> 37:21.660
but I'm still pretty optimistic overall.

850
37:21.660 --> 37:22.493
I don't know.

851
37:22.493 --> 37:23.326
Kaiti, what do you think?

852
37:23.326 --> 37:26.130
<v ->Yeah, so I'll opine because some of our investment thesis</v>

853
37:26.130 --> 37:29.690
in investing in company security for AI

854
37:29.690 --> 37:31.830
is that Microsoft would go buy 'em.

855
37:31.830 --> 37:35.026
I think that there's a huge concern in the general public

856
37:35.026 --> 37:38.670
on safety, privacy, especially everything that happened

857
37:38.670 --> 37:40.830
with Apple and Siri just recently.

858
37:40.830 --> 37:43.186
So I actually think that there's a signal to the market

859
37:43.186 --> 37:47.010
from these big aggregators buying security companies

860
37:47.010 --> 37:49.601
that their browsers are more secure

861
37:49.601 --> 37:52.680
or their AI models are more secure.

862
37:52.680 --> 37:55.590
So I actually think that they could throw out

863
37:55.590 --> 38:00.510
crazy multiples for AI, security for AI companies

864
38:00.510 --> 38:03.120
and it's more of a signal to the market that,

865
38:03.120 --> 38:05.928
hey, like Microsoft for example,

866
38:05.928 --> 38:08.760
we have the most secure models in the industry

867
38:08.760 --> 38:12.390
because we ended up buying X company.

868
38:12.390 --> 38:15.000
So I actually think that they're not precluded

869
38:15.000 --> 38:17.190
from focusing on the security aspect.

870
38:17.190 --> 38:20.640
I think that the general public is still just as concerned

871
38:20.640 --> 38:22.680
and with all of the news articles,

872
38:22.680 --> 38:27.680
especially on the privacy side and AI leakage,

873
38:27.770 --> 38:29.973
I think that they're still interested.

874
38:31.110 --> 38:32.610
<v ->Yep, other thing I'll add on that</v>

875
38:32.610 --> 38:34.620
is such a fast paced market

876
38:34.620 --> 38:37.890
and novel capabilities are being developed all the time.

877
38:37.890 --> 38:39.270
So I think we're gonna start to see

878
38:39.270 --> 38:41.040
a lot more startup activity in that space.

879
38:41.040 --> 38:42.870
And over time some of them will stick around

880
38:42.870 --> 38:45.090
and for the long run, but ultimately a lot

881
38:45.090 --> 38:47.580
of those really great security capabilities will be acquired

882
38:47.580 --> 38:49.230
by some of these large market incumbents

883
38:49.230 --> 38:50.430
and then that's how they'll kind of

884
38:50.430 --> 38:52.180
bolstered their security offerings.

885
38:53.250 --> 38:57.240
<v ->So we have about a minute and 30 seconds left.</v>

886
38:57.240 --> 38:58.080
Maybe we could just end

887
38:58.080 --> 39:03.080
on some maybe personal cybersecurity best practices.

888
39:03.390 --> 39:05.490
I imagine the audience, there's a kind of wide range

889
39:05.490 --> 39:06.750
of cybersecurity knowledge.

890
39:06.750 --> 39:08.490
So what are some tips you can give

891
39:08.490 --> 39:12.780
on cybersecurity best practices from a personal standpoint?

892
39:12.780 --> 39:14.670
<v ->Yeah, so joining a cyber only firm,</v>

893
39:14.670 --> 39:16.173
you get pretty paranoid.

894
39:17.160 --> 39:20.610
So I would say that my cyber hygiene's a little bit more

895
39:20.610 --> 39:23.700
robust than you would see other people.

896
39:23.700 --> 39:26.280
So we don't use public Wi-Fi,

897
39:26.280 --> 39:28.773
we always use our phones as hot spots.

898
39:29.610 --> 39:32.610
Also, password managers is really important,

899
39:32.610 --> 39:37.610
MFA whenever possible, don't ever use public USB ports.

900
39:37.830 --> 39:39.693
They could have malware in them.

901
39:40.922 --> 39:42.810
And then I would say a lot of times

902
39:42.810 --> 39:45.394
it's the human clicking on phishing

903
39:45.394 --> 39:49.290
that is getting credentials compromised,

904
39:49.290 --> 39:52.590
and so be very cautious of the links that you guys click on.

905
39:52.590 --> 39:56.220
Make sure that attachments are from people you know.

906
39:56.220 --> 39:58.110
Just some basic things.

907
39:58.110 --> 39:58.960
<v Nick>Yeah, I mean.</v>
<v Chris>Perhaps quick ones.</v>

908
39:58.960 --> 40:01.740
<v ->Yeah, you took mine, I would say password manager.</v>

909
40:01.740 --> 40:02.910
And this is more personal for me

910
40:02.910 --> 40:04.710
and it's actually less about security

911
40:04.710 --> 40:05.880
and more about productivity.

912
40:05.880 --> 40:09.210
Like I find that whether you're using like Googles or Apples

913
40:09.210 --> 40:11.220
or like another third-party provider,

914
40:11.220 --> 40:13.230
it just like makes life so much easier

915
40:13.230 --> 40:14.550
to have a password manager.

916
40:14.550 --> 40:17.040
So, that's only personally for me.

917
40:17.040 --> 40:19.920
<v ->Yeah, and I'll add the use encrypted messaging</v>

918
40:19.920 --> 40:22.320
applications when you can like Signal.

919
40:22.320 --> 40:23.153
<v ->That's a good one.</v>

920
40:23.153 --> 40:24.810
<v ->Especially after the telecom hack. (laughs)</v>

921
40:24.810 --> 40:26.340
<v ->Oh yeah, that's a good one, yeah, yeah.</v>

922
40:26.340 --> 40:28.800
<v ->All right, well, thank you all for coming today</v>

923
40:28.800 --> 40:30.791
and thank you to our panelists.

924
40:30.791 --> 40:32.049
(audience applauding)

925
40:32.049 --> 40:34.632
(upbeat music)
