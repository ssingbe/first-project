1
00:00.000 --> 00:03.500
(upbeat electronic music)

2
00:11.220 --> 00:14.190
<v ->Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today.</v>

3
00:14.190 --> 00:15.360
My name is Ally Peck.

4
00:15.360 --> 00:18.150
I'm the senior manager of environmental policy

5
00:18.150 --> 00:21.960
and sustainability at the Consumer Technology Association.

6
00:21.960 --> 00:25.620
Thanks for joining us at CES, the most powerful tech event.

7
00:25.620 --> 00:27.870
Today we'll be discussing climate emissions,

8
00:27.870 --> 00:31.200
carbon accounting, how companies are tackling the task

9
00:31.200 --> 00:35.010
of reporting their emissions, complying with regulations,

10
00:35.010 --> 00:37.560
all while setting ambitious reduction goals.

11
00:37.560 --> 00:38.730
So thanks for joining us.

12
00:38.730 --> 00:41.250
The way it's gonna work is I'm gonna give each panelist

13
00:41.250 --> 00:44.190
about five minutes or so to introduce themselves

14
00:44.190 --> 00:47.280
and explain what they bring to this topic.

15
00:47.280 --> 00:49.380
I'll ask them a couple questions myself.

16
00:49.380 --> 00:50.370
And then at the end,

17
00:50.370 --> 00:52.200
I'll probably save five minutes or so

18
00:52.200 --> 00:54.210
for an audience question or two.

19
00:54.210 --> 00:56.460
So as we go through it,

20
00:56.460 --> 00:58.590
keep thinking about maybe a question you have

21
00:58.590 --> 00:59.550
to ask our panel.

22
00:59.550 --> 01:02.520
So I'm gonna start off with Johanna.

23
01:02.520 --> 01:04.609
We're gonna go down the line.

24
01:04.609 --> 01:07.650
And then I'll kick it off with some questions.

25
01:07.650 --> 01:09.270
<v ->Amazing. Hi, everybody.</v>

26
01:09.270 --> 01:12.480
Thanks for being here. Thanks for the opportunity, Ally.

27
01:12.480 --> 01:13.680
My name is Johanna Puetz.

28
01:13.680 --> 01:15.480
I'm a managing director and partner

29
01:15.480 --> 01:17.667
at the Boston Consulting Group, BCG.

30
01:17.667 --> 01:20.190
And BCG is a management consulting firm

31
01:20.190 --> 01:22.650
that advises companies on all kinds

32
01:22.650 --> 01:26.520
of strategic questions, from technology to sustainability.

33
01:26.520 --> 01:28.590
And I'm based in Berlin, Europe,

34
01:28.590 --> 01:31.680
and I'm in the climate and sustainability service line.

35
01:31.680 --> 01:36.330
So I've been in sustainability consulting since about 2008,

36
01:36.330 --> 01:39.030
and 14 years of this with BCG.

37
01:39.030 --> 01:42.840
And I've probably worked with 20 to 30 or more companies

38
01:42.840 --> 01:45.030
on developing their climate strategies.

39
01:45.030 --> 01:47.340
So any questions for the discussion today around

40
01:47.340 --> 01:49.890
how companies approach climate strategies,

41
01:49.890 --> 01:51.873
or also, of course, after the session,

42
01:53.050 --> 01:55.710
I'm very happy and excited to address.

43
01:55.710 --> 01:59.010
I do work mostly in the automotive and industrial space,

44
01:59.010 --> 02:01.230
so I think that's a really interesting, maybe,

45
02:01.230 --> 02:03.930
contrast and comparison here with some of the consumer work

46
02:03.930 --> 02:05.830
that my colleagues on stage are doing.

47
02:06.676 --> 02:07.770
<v ->Great.</v>
<v ->Excellent. Hi, everyone.</v>

48
02:07.770 --> 02:09.150
My name is Erin Hiatt.

49
02:09.150 --> 02:12.660
I am vice president of corporate social responsibility

50
02:12.660 --> 02:14.730
with another trade association,

51
02:14.730 --> 02:17.490
the Retail Industry Leaders Association.

52
02:17.490 --> 02:20.550
So we are who our name suggests.

53
02:20.550 --> 02:22.770
We are the trade association in the US

54
02:22.770 --> 02:25.500
for retailers with largest operating footprint.

55
02:25.500 --> 02:29.130
I actually have one quick slide from the deck

56
02:29.130 --> 02:32.250
that I like to show, just to see who the logos are,

57
02:32.250 --> 02:34.890
because sometimes that's a little more illustrative.

58
02:34.890 --> 02:36.480
We'll get that up in a second.

59
02:36.480 --> 02:39.540
But with my role, I oversee anything related

60
02:39.540 --> 02:41.850
to corporate responsibility or ESG.

61
02:41.850 --> 02:43.500
So these are our members.

62
02:43.500 --> 02:44.333
I like doing this

63
02:44.333 --> 02:46.860
instead of reading out a random smattering of them.

64
02:46.860 --> 02:50.310
So with my role, anything corporate responsibility,

65
02:50.310 --> 02:54.600
anything ESG, voluntary, or mandatory reporting related.

66
02:54.600 --> 02:56.490
So what this looks like on a day-to-day basis

67
02:56.490 --> 03:00.810
is that the CEOs of our member companies make up our board,

68
03:00.810 --> 03:03.990
and they determine what pre-competitive areas

69
03:03.990 --> 03:05.730
they would like our membership companies

70
03:05.730 --> 03:06.840
to work together around.

71
03:06.840 --> 03:10.500
So if it's an issue that's too big for any company

72
03:10.500 --> 03:11.550
to tackle on their own,

73
03:11.550 --> 03:13.860
that's kind of a association sweet spot.

74
03:13.860 --> 03:17.160
So I have colleagues who focus on supply chain, HR issues,

75
03:17.160 --> 03:19.500
asset protection, loss prevention,

76
03:19.500 --> 03:21.840
but I get to handle the excellent portfolio

77
03:21.840 --> 03:24.240
of corporate responsibility and ESG.

78
03:24.240 --> 03:28.070
So beyond the sustainability piece, it includes DEI,

79
03:28.070 --> 03:30.240
it includes responsible sourcing.

80
03:30.240 --> 03:33.270
It's very kind of across different issue sets

81
03:33.270 --> 03:35.640
and different operational issues.

82
03:35.640 --> 03:36.960
But at the end of the day,

83
03:36.960 --> 03:38.700
we run a number of different committees

84
03:38.700 --> 03:41.400
that various executives participate in.

85
03:41.400 --> 03:43.170
And we're helping them figure out,

86
03:43.170 --> 03:44.370
where do they wanna benchmark?

87
03:44.370 --> 03:45.870
Where do they wanna learn from experts?

88
03:45.870 --> 03:47.550
And how do they wanna collaborate?

89
03:47.550 --> 03:49.860
So Lowe's is one of our members.

90
03:49.860 --> 03:52.650
<v ->Perfect. Thank you all for joining us today.</v>

91
03:52.650 --> 03:53.820
My name's Campbell Weyland,

92
03:53.820 --> 03:57.570
and I work at the home improvement retailer known as Lowe's.

93
03:57.570 --> 03:59.610
For those of you all that do not know,

94
03:59.610 --> 04:02.160
Lowe's is a US-based company.

95
04:02.160 --> 04:05.790
We have approximately 1,747 different stores

96
04:05.790 --> 04:07.890
across all 50 states.

97
04:07.890 --> 04:11.490
We do about $86 billion in sales every year.

98
04:11.490 --> 04:14.010
And we sell everything from a tomato plant

99
04:14.010 --> 04:19.010
to a kitchen faucet to a refrigerator.

100
04:19.050 --> 04:21.030
And so sustainability looks very differently

101
04:21.030 --> 04:22.530
across the board.

102
04:22.530 --> 04:26.490
At Lowe's, I am on the corporate sustainability team.

103
04:26.490 --> 04:28.740
And I look at that tomato plant,

104
04:28.740 --> 04:31.440
and I analyze how we can start

105
04:31.440 --> 04:35.100
to make that tomato plant more carbon efficient.

106
04:35.100 --> 04:36.930
So that's partnering with our suppliers

107
04:36.930 --> 04:41.610
to use better recycled content in that material,

108
04:41.610 --> 04:43.350
partner with them on how they actually grow

109
04:43.350 --> 04:44.670
that tomato plant.

110
04:44.670 --> 04:47.190
I also partner with our refrigeration team

111
04:47.190 --> 04:50.460
to figure out how to sell a more efficient product.

112
04:50.460 --> 04:53.370
And so what I bring to the table is I get

113
04:53.370 --> 04:55.440
to work on all of those different products that we sell.

114
04:55.440 --> 04:58.890
We sell about a million different SKUs.

115
04:58.890 --> 05:00.060
So as you can imagine,

116
05:00.060 --> 05:02.640
that is a really large amount of products

117
05:02.640 --> 05:04.470
that we have to analyze all the time.

118
05:04.470 --> 05:07.080
And so, yeah, looking forward to today's panel.

119
05:07.080 --> 05:07.913
<v ->Great.</v>

120
05:07.913 --> 05:09.720
Well, thank you guys all for introducing yourselves.

121
05:09.720 --> 05:13.110
I'm gonna start off with Johanna, this first question,

122
05:13.110 --> 05:17.010
just to, you know, blanket set on the topic itself.

123
05:17.010 --> 05:19.350
So can you explain to us what the status

124
05:19.350 --> 05:22.560
of global corporate climate action is right now,

125
05:22.560 --> 05:24.300
how it's changed maybe

126
05:24.300 --> 05:26.820
with maybe the recent current ESG backlash,

127
05:26.820 --> 05:28.650
and where we see it maybe going?

128
05:28.650 --> 05:30.570
<v ->Yeah, for sure.</v>

129
05:30.570 --> 05:33.150
So I think it's a really interesting time right now.

130
05:33.150 --> 05:35.490
I think it's fair to say that we've never seen

131
05:35.490 --> 05:38.394
as much corporate climate action

132
05:38.394 --> 05:42.483
as we are seeing today, or as we have seen in 2024.

133
05:43.320 --> 05:45.960
So as of now, there's around 10,000 companies

134
05:45.960 --> 05:49.620
that have signed up to the Science Based Targets Initiative,

135
05:49.620 --> 05:51.870
which is one of the largest bodies internationally

136
05:51.870 --> 05:54.153
that certifies corporate climate strategies.

137
05:55.020 --> 05:59.760
90 of the 250 largest blue chip organizations worldwide have

138
05:59.760 --> 06:01.950
climate targets that they have set

139
06:01.950 --> 06:04.770
and that they're reporting and tracking against.

140
06:04.770 --> 06:08.340
And also, on the regulatory side,

141
06:08.340 --> 06:09.990
a lot has happened last year.

142
06:09.990 --> 06:13.320
The California climate disclosure law has been passed.

143
06:13.320 --> 06:15.360
I know there are still some legal challenges around it,

144
06:15.360 --> 06:17.373
but we are positive that, in some sort,

145
06:18.524 --> 06:21.210
it's going to be fully implemented.

146
06:21.210 --> 06:24.870
Europe has gone its next step in carbon

147
06:24.870 --> 06:27.210
and climate disclosure with the first year

148
06:27.210 --> 06:29.610
of CSRD reporting.

149
06:29.610 --> 06:33.273
That's our major reporting standard for ESG in Europe.

150
06:35.163 --> 06:37.590
And also, like, just on the progress side,

151
06:37.590 --> 06:42.590
we had 14% of carbon-neutral energy

152
06:42.810 --> 06:45.300
in terms of primary energy consumption last year,

153
06:45.300 --> 06:47.730
and that's the highest we've ever seen.

154
06:47.730 --> 06:49.650
So there's a lot happening

155
06:49.650 --> 06:53.280
and there's really meaningful progress across all fronts,

156
06:53.280 --> 06:56.220
but at the same time, it's not uncriticized.

157
06:56.220 --> 06:58.860
I think when we were coming out of COVID a few years ago,

158
06:58.860 --> 07:02.490
there was this unwavering enthusiasm about everything ESG.

159
07:02.490 --> 07:06.483
And I think we've come down a little bit from that pinnacle.

160
07:07.440 --> 07:10.530
We had some corporate backtracking on their commitments.

161
07:10.530 --> 07:12.540
I'm not going to name anybody here on stage,

162
07:12.540 --> 07:15.870
but some of the really big names have actually rolled back

163
07:15.870 --> 07:17.730
their climate commitments.

164
07:17.730 --> 07:19.920
Some regulations are challenged in court,

165
07:19.920 --> 07:22.050
or they get implemented later.

166
07:22.050 --> 07:23.430
And last but not least,

167
07:23.430 --> 07:27.393
2024 has been the hottest year on record that we've had.

168
07:28.500 --> 07:31.620
We are way beyond 1.5 degrees

169
07:31.620 --> 07:36.270
in pretty much all countries and all regions globally.

170
07:36.270 --> 07:39.870
So this really, really underlines the point that,

171
07:39.870 --> 07:41.580
while there's a lot happening,

172
07:41.580 --> 07:44.310
there's still so much more potential opportunity

173
07:44.310 --> 07:46.770
and also necessity to go the next step

174
07:46.770 --> 07:50.670
and to scale climate action way wider

175
07:50.670 --> 07:52.570
than it has been scaled to this point.

176
07:53.580 --> 07:55.680
Maybe, like, one last sentence.

177
07:55.680 --> 07:59.760
I said I've been in sustainability consulting since 2008.

178
07:59.760 --> 08:02.100
I actually started to go into that space right

179
08:02.100 --> 08:04.890
before Lehman Brothers and the global financial crisis,

180
08:04.890 --> 08:07.800
which wasn't the best time for any strategy topic,

181
08:07.800 --> 08:09.060
as you might imagine.

182
08:09.060 --> 08:12.450
So right after 2008 and the financial crisis,

183
08:12.450 --> 08:15.870
basically everything around sustainability stopped

184
08:15.870 --> 08:19.170
or wasn't really progressed anymore.

185
08:19.170 --> 08:21.180
And in Europe at least,

186
08:21.180 --> 08:24.090
we are facing a sort of severe economic crisis

187
08:24.090 --> 08:24.923
at this point.

188
08:24.923 --> 08:26.167
So people ask me a lot, like,

189
08:26.167 --> 08:27.750
"What's happening to sustainability?

190
08:27.750 --> 08:29.820
Are we going to backtrack on everything?"

191
08:29.820 --> 08:32.490
But honestly, this is not going to happen this time.

192
08:32.490 --> 08:34.140
I think in terms of where we are

193
08:34.140 --> 08:35.430
when it comes to global warning,

194
08:35.430 --> 08:38.880
we are in a way more severe state than we were 15 years ago,

195
08:38.880 --> 08:41.910
but also in terms of the regulation that has been set up.

196
08:41.910 --> 08:44.340
But also all of the people and organizations

197
08:44.340 --> 08:47.370
that are working on climate and sustainability topics.

198
08:47.370 --> 08:50.010
It is so institutionalized now as a topic.

199
08:50.010 --> 08:51.900
We have the CES Sustainability track

200
08:51.900 --> 08:53.340
for the first time this year.

201
08:53.340 --> 08:54.270
That I think we are going

202
08:54.270 --> 08:56.610
to see more action rather than less,

203
08:56.610 --> 08:59.790
even in a situation of relative backtracking.

204
08:59.790 --> 09:01.830
<v ->Great, thank you. I agree.</v>

205
09:01.830 --> 09:05.070
I think sustainability is more popular than ever,

206
09:05.070 --> 09:07.800
and I think it'll continue to become more front and center,

207
09:07.800 --> 09:10.500
even if there are challenges ahead.

208
09:10.500 --> 09:12.600
Okay, so Campbell, I'm gonna go to you.

209
09:12.600 --> 09:15.210
Similarly, can you talk about Lowe's carbon footprint

210
09:15.210 --> 09:17.370
and your decarbonization strategy?

211
09:17.370 --> 09:18.270
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

212
09:18.270 --> 09:21.660
So I've been with Lowe's for seven years now.

213
09:21.660 --> 09:24.450
And primarily, we were focused on how we operate

214
09:24.450 --> 09:26.880
our big-box retail store.

215
09:26.880 --> 09:30.420
So not very dissimilar from other retailers,

216
09:30.420 --> 09:32.670
we had to figure out our own footprint.

217
09:32.670 --> 09:34.200
We've done a pretty decent job.

218
09:34.200 --> 09:36.840
We've cut our emissions in half

219
09:36.840 --> 09:38.790
while also growing our business,

220
09:38.790 --> 09:41.670
which is very, very impressive.

221
09:41.670 --> 09:42.900
But we quickly realized

222
09:42.900 --> 09:45.390
when we started setting a scope three target,

223
09:45.390 --> 09:48.723
which that's inclusive of everything in the value chain,

224
09:49.650 --> 09:51.330
that we were only doing a really good job

225
09:51.330 --> 09:53.160
at 1% of our total impact,

226
09:53.160 --> 09:55.860
and that 99% of our impact actually occurred

227
09:55.860 --> 09:58.320
outside of the four walls of Lowe's.

228
09:58.320 --> 10:00.630
And so when we started on this journey,

229
10:00.630 --> 10:03.960
we identified some gaps in how it's measured

230
10:03.960 --> 10:05.340
and how it's reported.

231
10:05.340 --> 10:07.920
And so that's why we partnered with RILA,

232
10:07.920 --> 10:11.160
to really focus on collaborating with other retailers

233
10:11.160 --> 10:12.810
and really highlighting the fact

234
10:12.810 --> 10:14.790
that this is a global issue.

235
10:14.790 --> 10:17.100
Lowe's does not win if we achieve net zero

236
10:17.100 --> 10:18.900
and all the other retailers don't.

237
10:18.900 --> 10:20.310
It's a collective issue.

238
10:20.310 --> 10:23.220
And hopefully everyone's achieving that same target.

239
10:23.220 --> 10:25.410
So for Lowe's,

240
10:25.410 --> 10:28.380
when you think about all the products that we sell,

241
10:28.380 --> 10:32.340
80% of our impact comes actually from your home.

242
10:32.340 --> 10:34.020
So in the US,

243
10:34.020 --> 10:37.860
20% of emissions is associated with your home.

244
10:37.860 --> 10:40.230
Lowe's is a big home improvement retailer,

245
10:40.230 --> 10:43.200
so naturally, most of our impact comes from the energy

246
10:43.200 --> 10:44.760
that's used in your home.

247
10:44.760 --> 10:48.630
And so we identified that as a gap.

248
10:48.630 --> 10:49.920
I was constantly tired

249
10:49.920 --> 10:52.770
of my boss asking me why our numbers were so different

250
10:52.770 --> 10:53.880
from our peers.

251
10:53.880 --> 10:56.940
And what we ultimately decided was,

252
10:56.940 --> 10:59.820
instead of using that Reddit or that YouTube post

253
10:59.820 --> 11:03.210
of how long Bobby Joe uses that lawnmower,

254
11:03.210 --> 11:05.910
it would be better to partner with other retailers

255
11:05.910 --> 11:08.970
through an industry group to kind of collaborate

256
11:08.970 --> 11:09.903
and come together.

257
11:10.860 --> 11:12.270
<v Ally>Great.</v>

258
11:12.270 --> 11:14.550
So Erin, I feel like Campbell kind

259
11:14.550 --> 11:19.550
of teased this new technology or,

260
11:19.590 --> 11:22.560
I don't even know, program that you guys are developing.

261
11:22.560 --> 11:25.470
Do you wanna dive into that, the DPED version, too?

262
11:25.470 --> 11:27.390
<v ->Yeah, absolutely. Thank you.</v>

263
11:27.390 --> 11:29.190
So Campbell alluded to it greatly.

264
11:29.190 --> 11:30.023
And I think the way

265
11:30.023 --> 11:32.850
that Johanna explained kind of the landscape

266
11:32.850 --> 11:33.690
that we think about,

267
11:33.690 --> 11:35.880
working with our members around climate,

268
11:35.880 --> 11:36.960
is very, very similar.

269
11:36.960 --> 11:40.440
There's this element of, you know, the regulatory context.

270
11:40.440 --> 11:43.230
You need to measure these elements.

271
11:43.230 --> 11:45.690
There's actual management and reducing the reductions,

272
11:45.690 --> 11:47.640
making progress on a lot of the targets.

273
11:47.640 --> 11:50.820
And then there's a resiliency element to it as well.

274
11:50.820 --> 11:54.090
You know, you're seeing these really huge climate events

275
11:54.090 --> 11:57.420
that are impacting stores, impacting supply chains.

276
11:57.420 --> 11:58.920
How do you build up resiliency

277
11:58.920 --> 12:00.870
and be a bit more proactive in planning for that?

278
12:00.870 --> 12:03.780
So it all sort of comes into place in a variety

279
12:03.780 --> 12:06.810
of different business contexts for the organization.

280
12:06.810 --> 12:09.840
And so where we end up doing kind of deeper dives

281
12:09.840 --> 12:12.060
with some of our industry collaborative work

282
12:12.060 --> 12:14.310
is really very much industry driven.

283
12:14.310 --> 12:16.590
So, you know, that conversation that Campbell talked

284
12:16.590 --> 12:18.870
about was truly one where he

285
12:18.870 --> 12:20.970
and a couple of our other members came to us

286
12:20.970 --> 12:22.590
and described this challenge.

287
12:22.590 --> 12:23.880
You know, you could imagine,

288
12:23.880 --> 12:25.860
if you're talking about your emissions footprint,

289
12:25.860 --> 12:29.182
you have a similar product scope to other companies,

290
12:29.182 --> 12:30.547
you know, you might have stakeholders asking,

291
12:30.547 --> 12:32.430
"Well, why do these look a little bit different?"

292
12:32.430 --> 12:33.360
And at the end of the day,

293
12:33.360 --> 12:36.540
it's a fairly arbitrary difference in assumptions.

294
12:36.540 --> 12:37.530
And so, you know,

295
12:37.530 --> 12:40.650
when you look at standards like the Greenhouse Gas Protocol,

296
12:40.650 --> 12:43.560
you know, there's only so much guidance you get

297
12:43.560 --> 12:44.880
from a document like that.

298
12:44.880 --> 12:46.987
At the end of the day, it's not telling you,

299
12:46.987 --> 12:49.140
"Oh, here's where you get the data sources,"

300
12:49.140 --> 12:51.120
or, "Here's how you get to, you know,

301
12:51.120 --> 12:53.880
a certain use phase estimation."

302
12:53.880 --> 12:56.220
And so what we looked into:

303
12:56.220 --> 12:57.540
the creation of the DPED tool.

304
12:57.540 --> 13:01.140
It stands for Direct-Use Product Emissions Database.

305
13:01.140 --> 13:04.440
I'll actually go ahead and pull up the next slide

306
13:04.440 --> 13:06.990
that just has a little bit of an overview around it.

307
13:06.990 --> 13:09.930
So we launched version one of this resource

308
13:09.930 --> 13:12.033
in spring of last year.

309
13:13.410 --> 13:14.700
Go to that slide.

310
13:14.700 --> 13:15.810
There's a QR code here,

311
13:15.810 --> 13:18.330
if you'd like to learn more about it.

312
13:18.330 --> 13:21.600
But essentially this is tackling exactly the type

313
13:21.600 --> 13:23.880
of product footprint that Campbell talked

314
13:23.880 --> 13:25.410
about being some of the most challenging.

315
13:25.410 --> 13:27.510
So when we say direct-use product,

316
13:27.510 --> 13:29.850
we mean something that plugs into the wall

317
13:29.850 --> 13:32.910
or has a fuel that is directly powering it.

318
13:32.910 --> 13:35.970
There is a direct use of energy element to this.

319
13:35.970 --> 13:38.310
So as you can imagine, this is a lot of appliances,

320
13:38.310 --> 13:41.910
electronics, small appliances, everything down to,

321
13:41.910 --> 13:44.340
you know, a hairstyling tool.

322
13:44.340 --> 13:47.340
It can cover a vast number of different retail products

323
13:47.340 --> 13:49.470
that our members sell, because as you saw, you know,

324
13:49.470 --> 13:51.780
we really represent everyone across,

325
13:51.780 --> 13:54.270
you know, multi-line down through apparel.

326
13:54.270 --> 13:56.640
And so the way that we wanted

327
13:56.640 --> 14:00.390
to approach this was really to understand,

328
14:00.390 --> 14:02.520
you know, what the core challenges are.

329
14:02.520 --> 14:05.520
A lot of this is a data quality issue.

330
14:05.520 --> 14:08.010
A lot of this is a consistency issue.

331
14:08.010 --> 14:09.000
So if you're talking

332
14:09.000 --> 14:11.700
about some of the regulatory considerations,

333
14:11.700 --> 14:13.470
that consistency is critical.

334
14:13.470 --> 14:17.100
If any stakeholders are gonna be comparing this information,

335
14:17.100 --> 14:18.180
but there are, you know,

336
14:18.180 --> 14:19.950
reasonably made differences in assumption,

337
14:19.950 --> 14:22.170
we can't put a smart measurement device

338
14:22.170 --> 14:25.230
on every single product that enters a consumer's home,

339
14:25.230 --> 14:27.510
then how do we use a reasonable assumption

340
14:27.510 --> 14:30.150
for how often Bobby Joe is, you know,

341
14:30.150 --> 14:32.160
using his lawnmower or grill

342
14:32.160 --> 14:34.290
or these other products that fall outside

343
14:34.290 --> 14:36.510
of the scope of EPA ENERGY STAR?

344
14:36.510 --> 14:38.520
So EPA ENERGY STAR has its own tool

345
14:38.520 --> 14:41.760
for scope 3, category 11 that's really helpful,

346
14:41.760 --> 14:44.730
but there are a large, large number of product categories

347
14:44.730 --> 14:46.830
that fall outside of that.

348
14:46.830 --> 14:48.870
So all of that to say,

349
14:48.870 --> 14:51.180
the goal with this is to kind of keep it simple

350
14:51.180 --> 14:54.510
and make it really easy for folks to adopt it.

351
14:54.510 --> 14:56.790
The version one that came out, as I mentioned,

352
14:56.790 --> 14:59.190
in spring of 2024 includes

353
14:59.190 --> 15:02.310
over 180 different product categories.

354
15:02.310 --> 15:06.300
A variety of different products that it's covering.

355
15:06.300 --> 15:08.760
And for each of those it's looking at region,

356
15:08.760 --> 15:12.180
fuel, energy type, emission factor, lifetime emissions,

357
15:12.180 --> 15:13.920
essentially some of those core elements

358
15:13.920 --> 15:17.100
that can vary the most from company to company.

359
15:17.100 --> 15:19.920
And so our hope is that this gets used

360
15:19.920 --> 15:21.630
as widely as possible.

361
15:21.630 --> 15:24.180
You know, we can talk a little bit more about it later,

362
15:24.180 --> 15:27.540
but this is a resource that's not specific to RILA members.

363
15:27.540 --> 15:30.360
It's open to any individual reporter

364
15:30.360 --> 15:32.310
that wants to use it for their own emissions.

365
15:32.310 --> 15:33.600
It is open access.

366
15:33.600 --> 15:35.970
And then if you represent a consultancy

367
15:35.970 --> 15:38.580
or a software company that maybe supports companies

368
15:38.580 --> 15:40.680
with their carbon emission footprints,

369
15:40.680 --> 15:44.370
there is just an at-cost licensing fee to just be able

370
15:44.370 --> 15:47.310
to access the database and integrate it into your own work.

371
15:47.310 --> 15:51.030
So it is in the super flashy form of an Excel database

372
15:51.030 --> 15:53.010
because we didn't want there to be, you know,

373
15:53.010 --> 15:57.630
some proprietary system that folks needed to log into.

374
15:57.630 --> 15:59.520
But the whole idea here

375
15:59.520 --> 16:03.510
is it's not a perfect solution,

376
16:03.510 --> 16:04.830
but you have to start somewhere,

377
16:04.830 --> 16:06.870
and we wanna improve it over time.

378
16:06.870 --> 16:10.020
So we'll have a version two coming out in the fall.

379
16:10.020 --> 16:10.853
<v ->Great.</v>

380
16:10.853 --> 16:13.860
I know, for electronics at least,

381
16:13.860 --> 16:16.260
use of sold products, category 11,

382
16:16.260 --> 16:21.260
is also our largest place, where we see nearly 80%

383
16:21.450 --> 16:24.000
of our total industry emissions coming from.

384
16:24.000 --> 16:26.250
So I think it's something that a variety

385
16:26.250 --> 16:28.860
of different industries are hopefully going to be using,

386
16:28.860 --> 16:32.730
and be able to holistically, together,

387
16:32.730 --> 16:34.800
report their missions in the same kind of way.

388
16:34.800 --> 16:39.090
So it definitely will be useful. (laughs)

389
16:39.090 --> 16:41.073
Okay, my next question.

390
16:42.750 --> 16:45.150
Johanna, what would you say is the business case

391
16:45.150 --> 16:46.800
for carbon neutrality?

392
16:46.800 --> 16:49.650
And do we think consumers are maybe willing

393
16:49.650 --> 16:51.900
to pay more for more sustainable goods?

394
16:51.900 --> 16:53.490
And feel free for others to jump in

395
16:53.490 --> 16:55.200
and respond as we go through it.

396
16:55.200 --> 16:56.760
<v ->Let me unpack this question a little bit.</v>

397
16:56.760 --> 16:58.710
It's, of course, a super critical one, right?

398
16:58.710 --> 17:02.520
No organization can be reasonably asked to do something

399
17:02.520 --> 17:04.380
that goes against their business interests.

400
17:04.380 --> 17:06.660
We would all not be in business if we did that,

401
17:06.660 --> 17:10.350
and the same applies to climate strategies.

402
17:10.350 --> 17:12.330
I would say, I mean, on the macro level,

403
17:12.330 --> 17:15.239
the cost for action is actually, sorry,

404
17:15.239 --> 17:17.989
the demand or the need for action is actually so clear.

405
17:19.260 --> 17:22.020
Just a few weeks ago, we published a study together

406
17:22.020 --> 17:24.660
with the World Economic Forum investigating

407
17:24.660 --> 17:26.160
the cost of inaction.

408
17:26.160 --> 17:29.550
So the negative consequences of climate change

409
17:29.550 --> 17:33.720
and what they will mean for corporate bottom lines

410
17:33.720 --> 17:36.660
that we can expect to see across different industries.

411
17:36.660 --> 17:39.450
And, of course, it depends a lot by region,

412
17:39.450 --> 17:43.800
by sector, and also, yeah, by sector and by geography.

413
17:43.800 --> 17:44.920
But in many sectors

414
17:45.959 --> 17:50.959
we already expect a 25% EBITDA risk until 2030

415
17:51.120 --> 17:54.120
because of the physical consequences of climate change.

416
17:54.120 --> 17:56.220
And this will be less pronounced in retail,

417
17:56.220 --> 17:57.750
it'll be less pronounced in the US.

418
17:57.750 --> 18:01.203
My figures are more for, like, southern countries.

419
18:02.177 --> 18:05.760
But still, there's, like, a real cost of not acting now.

420
18:05.760 --> 18:10.440
And I think that's a really important beacon to have there

421
18:10.440 --> 18:13.680
as you devise a climate neutrality strategy.

422
18:13.680 --> 18:16.170
On the more immediate and lower-term,

423
18:16.170 --> 18:17.700
or, sorry, shorter-term business case,

424
18:17.700 --> 18:21.960
there are also a couple of key things to consider

425
18:21.960 --> 18:23.670
or things that play a role.

426
18:23.670 --> 18:25.770
Very often, not always, but very often,

427
18:25.770 --> 18:28.950
CO2 reduction does go together also with cost reduction.

428
18:28.950 --> 18:31.320
So operational costs typically lower

429
18:31.320 --> 18:33.120
or energy security can be higher

430
18:33.120 --> 18:36.000
if you use renewable resources.

431
18:36.000 --> 18:37.710
There is typically faster growth

432
18:37.710 --> 18:40.590
and also higher sales in green products.

433
18:40.590 --> 18:43.470
So there's a revenue upside to this.

434
18:43.470 --> 18:46.260
In another study that we did last year,

435
18:46.260 --> 18:50.070
25% of companies told us about a clear revenue uplift

436
18:50.070 --> 18:51.930
from their climate strategies.

437
18:51.930 --> 18:55.740
So there's a clear consideration to this as well.

438
18:55.740 --> 18:56.760
To your second question,

439
18:56.760 --> 18:59.010
are consumers necessarily willing to pay more

440
18:59.010 --> 19:00.480
for green products?

441
19:00.480 --> 19:02.340
I wish I could say a clear yes,

442
19:02.340 --> 19:05.430
but I think it's not entirely that simple.

443
19:05.430 --> 19:07.200
Consumers want green products.

444
19:07.200 --> 19:09.330
About 80% tell us sustainability

445
19:09.330 --> 19:11.910
is a key factor in their choice.

446
19:11.910 --> 19:13.680
The number is actually higher even,

447
19:13.680 --> 19:16.860
if we look at luxury products or also for automotive.

448
19:16.860 --> 19:20.520
It's an even more important decision factor,

449
19:20.520 --> 19:22.868
but that doesn't mean they're going to pay a dollar more,

450
19:22.868 --> 19:26.493
$2 more, $10 more just because a product is green.

451
19:28.440 --> 19:31.530
To really expand into green willingness to pay,

452
19:31.530 --> 19:34.530
typically the green product attributes need to be linked

453
19:34.530 --> 19:36.420
to other desirable attributes.

454
19:36.420 --> 19:39.630
Design, health, performance.

455
19:39.630 --> 19:41.763
Lower operating costs, eventually.

456
19:42.720 --> 19:44.580
So it's not green as such

457
19:44.580 --> 19:46.050
that we'll create that business case,

458
19:46.050 --> 19:47.670
but linking it to other attributes,

459
19:47.670 --> 19:49.620
which is possible in most cases,

460
19:49.620 --> 19:54.090
unlocks this positive business side of green sales.

461
19:54.090 --> 19:55.800
<v Ally>Great. Anyone else have something to say?</v>

462
19:55.800 --> 19:57.300
<v ->Yeah, I think-</v>
<v ->Whoops.</v>

463
19:57.300 --> 20:00.810
<v ->if I was to tell you to buy a heat pump, water heater,</v>

464
20:00.810 --> 20:02.880
you know, just because it's good for the environment,

465
20:02.880 --> 20:05.754
maybe some of you all would purchase.

466
20:05.754 --> 20:06.900
It's significantly more expensive.

467
20:06.900 --> 20:08.550
But if I was to tell you that 20%

468
20:08.550 --> 20:10.080
of your energy bill every month

469
20:10.080 --> 20:12.360
is associated with your water heater,

470
20:12.360 --> 20:15.000
and you have a way to cut that in half,

471
20:15.000 --> 20:17.220
that probably gets a lot more people interested.

472
20:17.220 --> 20:21.150
So when you think about how you're approaching your home,

473
20:21.150 --> 20:23.820
you're kind of treating it like a business.

474
20:23.820 --> 20:26.070
And as you can explain more and more

475
20:26.070 --> 20:28.800
of what that lower operating model is,

476
20:28.800 --> 20:31.620
I think that allows customers

477
20:31.620 --> 20:34.950
to feel more comfortable paying the higher premium.

478
20:34.950 --> 20:37.170
For example, you know,

479
20:37.170 --> 20:40.680
it's pretty cost comparative when you look at leaf blowers,

480
20:40.680 --> 20:42.120
electric and gas.

481
20:42.120 --> 20:45.780
But I like leaf blowing after I get home from work,

482
20:45.780 --> 20:47.580
and I like not disturbing my neighbors.

483
20:47.580 --> 20:51.300
And so for me, the ancillary benefit is no noise

484
20:51.300 --> 20:52.740
or a limited amount of noise.

485
20:52.740 --> 20:56.430
So I think as you can frame up all of these other benefits

486
20:56.430 --> 20:59.220
and then say, "Also, it's better for the environment,"

487
20:59.220 --> 21:00.930
I think you're gonna see more

488
21:00.930 --> 21:04.650
and more consumers actually purchasing more green products.

489
21:04.650 --> 21:07.380
<v ->Yeah, I think it's interesting how it sort of tells us,</v>

490
21:07.380 --> 21:09.360
you know, it's an aspiration for consumers, right?

491
21:09.360 --> 21:12.000
They're looking for an excuse to buy sustainable,

492
21:12.000 --> 21:14.760
if they can justify it with, you know, the cost point,

493
21:14.760 --> 21:18.120
if they can justify it over the other benefits.

494
21:18.120 --> 21:19.950
It's great to have more than one good reason

495
21:19.950 --> 21:21.030
for doing something.

496
21:21.030 --> 21:23.550
And so it really does depend on the product category.

497
21:23.550 --> 21:27.477
We did a recent presentation, too.

498
21:27.477 --> 21:29.790
NYU and Circana do some really interesting research

499
21:29.790 --> 21:31.980
about this, looking at receipts.

500
21:31.980 --> 21:34.320
And so they do see a lot of difference

501
21:34.320 --> 21:36.150
depending on the product category,

502
21:36.150 --> 21:38.070
where there's some of that willingness

503
21:38.070 --> 21:39.870
and the higher growth, the higher premium

504
21:39.870 --> 21:42.480
that can be tolerated by a consumer.

505
21:42.480 --> 21:44.220
But then when you have those other elements of it,

506
21:44.220 --> 21:46.500
you know, you're not disturbing your neighbors,

507
21:46.500 --> 21:47.640
you're not breathing in the fuel,

508
21:47.640 --> 21:49.860
we were talking about how, you know,

509
21:49.860 --> 21:51.870
didn't realize that gas can go bad in your tank.

510
21:51.870 --> 21:53.250
That's gonna happen in a lawnmower.

511
21:53.250 --> 21:54.870
So there are all these sort of maintenance

512
21:54.870 --> 21:56.580
and ancillary considerations.

513
21:56.580 --> 21:57.480
That there's, you know,

514
21:57.480 --> 21:59.940
a consumer education element of this,

515
21:59.940 --> 22:02.340
where if you can lead with some of those elements,

516
22:02.340 --> 22:05.190
and yes, and you get to purchase on something

517
22:05.190 --> 22:06.900
that aligns with your values,

518
22:06.900 --> 22:09.690
and that's not always the case,

519
22:09.690 --> 22:11.940
I think it's just a real opportunity for us

520
22:11.940 --> 22:13.920
to understand a bit more about, you know,

521
22:13.920 --> 22:15.360
what resonates with the consumer

522
22:15.360 --> 22:17.580
and how to really frame a lot of this

523
22:17.580 --> 22:19.893
so that it's kind of all of the above benefit.

524
22:20.760 --> 22:21.810
<v ->Great.</v>

525
22:21.810 --> 22:23.580
I think kind of what we're getting at,

526
22:23.580 --> 22:25.080
I'm gonna tie it back together

527
22:25.080 --> 22:27.060
to something we touched on a little bit earlier.

528
22:27.060 --> 22:29.970
But a more sustainable product

529
22:29.970 --> 22:32.970
is going to reduce our scope three emissions.

530
22:32.970 --> 22:34.860
If you aren't really familiar, I would encourage you

531
22:34.860 --> 22:37.170
to just quickly Google scope one, two, and three.

532
22:37.170 --> 22:40.020
Scope three is the hardest for companies to control

533
22:40.020 --> 22:41.850
because it's all downstream.

534
22:41.850 --> 22:45.090
And so if a product is more sustainable,

535
22:45.090 --> 22:46.860
it's using less energy,

536
22:46.860 --> 22:50.880
and it is gonna reduce a company's overall category 11,

537
22:50.880 --> 22:53.490
use of sold products, under scope three.

538
22:53.490 --> 22:57.240
So Campbell, you kind of mentioned category 11 earlier.

539
22:57.240 --> 22:59.100
Is there anything else you wanna touch on

540
22:59.100 --> 23:01.200
when we're thinking about this topic, specifically?

541
23:01.200 --> 23:04.260
<v ->Yeah, so scope three,</v>

542
23:04.260 --> 23:07.020
to put it pretty cleanly,

543
23:07.020 --> 23:08.790
so we sell dishwashers.

544
23:08.790 --> 23:11.220
And so scope three includes everything

545
23:11.220 --> 23:14.400
from the mining of that metal to the manufacturing,

546
23:14.400 --> 23:16.290
to the warping of that dishwasher,

547
23:16.290 --> 23:19.443
to it being shipped oversea on a Maersk ship,

548
23:20.700 --> 23:22.530
to it even being used in the home.

549
23:22.530 --> 23:25.560
So for us, use of sold products focused

550
23:25.560 --> 23:29.370
in the customer's home, in their energy usage.

551
23:29.370 --> 23:30.450
And if we can start

552
23:30.450 --> 23:33.780
to lean into certifications like the EPA ENERGY STAR,

553
23:33.780 --> 23:36.930
which shows that compared to the standard product,

554
23:36.930 --> 23:39.210
it's 20% more efficient,

555
23:39.210 --> 23:42.600
that helps us lower our overall footprint.

556
23:42.600 --> 23:43.830
And so for us,

557
23:43.830 --> 23:46.440
we're really leaning into third-party certifications

558
23:46.440 --> 23:48.960
to understand, one, they have credibility

559
23:48.960 --> 23:51.150
and there's some rigor around it,

560
23:51.150 --> 23:55.050
but two, it's a certification that consumers can trust

561
23:55.050 --> 23:58.230
and understand that it actually saves them money.

562
23:58.230 --> 23:59.460
And so it's on the retailer

563
23:59.460 --> 24:02.070
to actually tell that business case story

564
24:02.070 --> 24:04.710
and kind of explain why you'd want to invest

565
24:04.710 --> 24:07.173
in the more efficient technology.

566
24:08.340 --> 24:09.360
But that's something

567
24:09.360 --> 24:11.220
that we've been significantly focused on,

568
24:11.220 --> 24:14.100
especially when we think about our scope three footprint,

569
24:14.100 --> 24:17.070
is trying to simplify the message.

570
24:17.070 --> 24:19.320
Because when you start talking about carbon emissions,

571
24:19.320 --> 24:20.910
probably not a lot of people

572
24:20.910 --> 24:23.430
that shop at Lowe's knows what that means

573
24:23.430 --> 24:25.320
and their eyes will glaze over.

574
24:25.320 --> 24:28.053
Although the nerd in me is very excited about it,

575
24:29.160 --> 24:31.320
we gotta start to simplify our message.

576
24:31.320 --> 24:34.080
So focus on saving money, saving the environment.

577
24:34.080 --> 24:36.450
Saving energy is good for both your pocketbooks

578
24:36.450 --> 24:38.130
and the environment.

579
24:38.130 --> 24:40.350
<v Ally>Agreed. Definitely agreed. (laughs)</v>

580
24:40.350 --> 24:41.340
<v ->I was gonna say, too,</v>

581
24:41.340 --> 24:43.560
like, the one message to kind of hear,

582
24:43.560 --> 24:44.850
underlying all of that,

583
24:44.850 --> 24:46.560
is engagement with business partners

584
24:46.560 --> 24:48.210
and within the supply chain as well.

585
24:48.210 --> 24:50.400
So, you know, whether it's around the transportation,

586
24:50.400 --> 24:52.140
but scope...

587
24:52.140 --> 24:55.320
So scope 3, category 11 is the largest for, you know,

588
24:55.320 --> 24:58.020
companies that sell a lot of energy-consuming devices.

589
24:58.020 --> 25:00.960
For the rest of RILA's membership, it's category one.

590
25:00.960 --> 25:03.870
And that's looking at really the manufacturing process,

591
25:03.870 --> 25:05.880
what goes into the product itself.

592
25:05.880 --> 25:08.160
And then, you know, kind of further down the list,

593
25:08.160 --> 25:09.810
there are some things like transportation

594
25:09.810 --> 25:11.580
and all of the other elements that go

595
25:11.580 --> 25:14.640
into getting a product where it needs to be

596
25:14.640 --> 25:18.630
and some of the other kind of lifecycle elements of this.

597
25:18.630 --> 25:19.650
And so, you know,

598
25:19.650 --> 25:22.080
one definite challenge to folks in the room,

599
25:22.080 --> 25:23.850
if you represent a brand

600
25:23.850 --> 25:25.860
that manufactures some of the products

601
25:25.860 --> 25:27.240
that get sold in a retail company,

602
25:27.240 --> 25:29.700
or direct-to-consumer elements of it,

603
25:29.700 --> 25:32.670
I mean, there's just so much collaboration potential

604
25:32.670 --> 25:35.760
because the need for the data across voluntary

605
25:35.760 --> 25:38.880
and mandatory reporting contexts is there.

606
25:38.880 --> 25:42.150
The consistency is so important for, you know,

607
25:42.150 --> 25:44.040
some of the stakeholders that are using this,

608
25:44.040 --> 25:46.050
and for the relationships, really,

609
25:46.050 --> 25:48.630
that are gonna help influence decisions

610
25:48.630 --> 25:50.970
that companies are making to lower their footprints

611
25:50.970 --> 25:52.830
based on some of those indirect factors

612
25:52.830 --> 25:54.270
that contribute to them.

613
25:54.270 --> 25:56.550
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

614
25:56.550 --> 25:59.400
Speaking to the upstream manufacturing,

615
25:59.400 --> 26:02.250
before you can start to talk about product footprint,

616
26:02.250 --> 26:03.570
you actually have to educate them

617
26:03.570 --> 26:05.523
on what carbon footprint means.

618
26:06.510 --> 26:07.343
And so last year,

619
26:07.343 --> 26:10.350
we were named CDP Supplier Engagement Leader.

620
26:10.350 --> 26:11.850
And personally, I'm very proud of that

621
26:11.850 --> 26:14.340
because over last summer,

622
26:14.340 --> 26:17.373
I actually did weekly webinars with our supply chain,

623
26:18.240 --> 26:19.890
teaching them everything from

624
26:19.890 --> 26:22.080
how to measure your carbon footprint

625
26:22.080 --> 26:23.850
to how to actually lower it.

626
26:23.850 --> 26:25.627
And now I have suppliers calling me, saying,

627
26:25.627 --> 26:26.790
"Hey, Campbell, guess what?

628
26:26.790 --> 26:30.000
We're doing our third solar installation thanks

629
26:30.000 --> 26:31.290
to your renewable energy team."

630
26:31.290 --> 26:33.540
And so I think the more you can collaborate

631
26:33.540 --> 26:35.850
with your upstream value chain,

632
26:35.850 --> 26:37.980
you're gonna see benefits in the downstream.

633
26:37.980 --> 26:41.610
And obviously, you're trying to upskill everyone.

634
26:41.610 --> 26:44.430
And obviously, their leadership team is very excited

635
26:44.430 --> 26:46.920
about saving money in any way they can.

636
26:46.920 --> 26:49.740
So I think if you can understand the message

637
26:49.740 --> 26:51.750
for your upstream suppliers,

638
26:51.750 --> 26:54.300
that's gonna help you ultimately in your downstream

639
26:54.300 --> 26:56.280
when you get down to the consumer.

640
26:56.280 --> 26:58.400
<v ->And we really see this across industries.</v>

641
26:58.400 --> 26:59.820
So in every industry,

642
26:59.820 --> 27:01.620
and it's typically the downstream companies

643
27:01.620 --> 27:04.920
that are closest to the consumer that play this role,

644
27:04.920 --> 27:09.920
you need somebody that kicks off decarbonization work

645
27:10.050 --> 27:11.580
in the entire value chain.

646
27:11.580 --> 27:16.580
So CSRD's standards for reporting comes together to,

647
27:16.980 --> 27:19.920
well, standardize or at least develop consistent language

648
27:19.920 --> 27:23.493
around emissions, like you did with your DPED tool,

649
27:24.600 --> 27:26.820
educate suppliers.

650
27:26.820 --> 27:31.650
Maybe also installing tools or technological solutions

651
27:31.650 --> 27:34.530
that all of the players are using to calculate

652
27:34.530 --> 27:37.380
in reporting their emissions.

653
27:37.380 --> 27:39.480
I think what's really interesting, that it can,

654
27:39.480 --> 27:42.330
I think it offers opportunity for the downstream companies,

655
27:42.330 --> 27:45.390
as well as for the upstream companies to change

656
27:45.390 --> 27:46.230
how you do business,

657
27:46.230 --> 27:48.180
because you're adding another element

658
27:48.180 --> 27:51.060
to a competitive situation that has been

659
27:51.060 --> 27:53.520
in sort of a cost-benefit relationship

660
27:53.520 --> 27:55.080
for the past decades, right?

661
27:55.080 --> 27:57.900
All of a sudden, your suppliers can differentiate themselves

662
27:57.900 --> 27:59.490
also through climate action,

663
27:59.490 --> 28:02.070
potentially gaining a larger share of wallet

664
28:02.070 --> 28:03.300
in that process.

665
28:03.300 --> 28:04.133
So I think it's

666
28:04.133 --> 28:08.100
an interesting competitive dimension as well.

667
28:08.100 --> 28:08.933
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

668
28:08.933 --> 28:12.960
And I think you're changing a transaction relationship

669
28:12.960 --> 28:15.270
to more of a relationship.

670
28:15.270 --> 28:18.840
I think it's very important to form kind of like a team.

671
28:18.840 --> 28:23.010
And so I think, through our work with supplier engagement,

672
28:23.010 --> 28:26.160
we've created kind of this cohort of team members

673
28:26.160 --> 28:27.870
within our supply chain that one,

674
28:27.870 --> 28:30.180
feel empowered to start thinking about sustainability,

675
28:30.180 --> 28:31.837
but two, start to say,

676
28:31.837 --> 28:33.870
"Hey, when there's a jump ball situation,

677
28:33.870 --> 28:37.590
and we have product A that's priced the same as product B,

678
28:37.590 --> 28:40.530
but product B's manufacturer is really leaning

679
28:40.530 --> 28:42.750
into this work, they're starting to reduce their footprint,

680
28:42.750 --> 28:46.110
they're, you know, even just answering us and innovating,

681
28:46.110 --> 28:47.760
I mean, that sets them apart.

682
28:47.760 --> 28:50.700
And they view this as a differentiator."

683
28:50.700 --> 28:51.533
<v ->Great.</v>

684
28:51.533 --> 28:52.860
Okay, so we are at CES,

685
28:52.860 --> 28:55.290
and this is the last topic I'm gonna have them all touch on

686
28:55.290 --> 28:57.480
before we jump into maybe an audience question or two.

687
28:57.480 --> 28:59.430
But we're at CES, the tech event.

688
28:59.430 --> 29:02.610
So Johanna, how can technology help

689
29:02.610 --> 29:05.610
in reducing our overall emissions?

690
29:05.610 --> 29:07.170
And, you know,

691
29:07.170 --> 29:09.930
how can that help companies be more successful?

692
29:09.930 --> 29:10.763
<v ->Hmm.</v>

693
29:10.763 --> 29:12.660
So I mean, all about CES seems

694
29:12.660 --> 29:14.340
to be about artificial intelligence.

695
29:14.340 --> 29:16.170
So let me quickly comment on that one.

696
29:16.170 --> 29:19.440
It's, of course, a little bit of an upside

697
29:19.440 --> 29:20.520
and downside topic, right?

698
29:20.520 --> 29:24.180
I mean, a ChatGPT search takes about 10 times

699
29:24.180 --> 29:26.460
as much energy as a Google search.

700
29:26.460 --> 29:28.590
For hopefully a better result,

701
29:28.590 --> 29:29.670
but I mean, right now,

702
29:29.670 --> 29:32.760
also a very similar result at this point.

703
29:32.760 --> 29:34.680
So in the US,

704
29:34.680 --> 29:37.290
we actually expect data center capacity

705
29:37.290 --> 29:40.080
to potentially double up until 2030,

706
29:40.080 --> 29:42.990
just because of the rise of AI.

707
29:42.990 --> 29:45.930
So that's a massive toll on energy systems,

708
29:45.930 --> 29:47.910
on energy supply, and, of course,

709
29:47.910 --> 29:52.380
on the CO2 emissions connected to that energy consumption.

710
29:52.380 --> 29:53.400
I think it's important

711
29:53.400 --> 29:57.210
that data center operators own that responsibility,

712
29:57.210 --> 30:00.660
do the maximum they can in terms of energy efficiency,

713
30:00.660 --> 30:02.940
do the maximum they can in terms of investing

714
30:02.940 --> 30:07.770
in large-scale, CO2-neutral energy technology.

715
30:07.770 --> 30:09.540
And we see this, right?

716
30:09.540 --> 30:12.000
Amazon is going into nuclear.

717
30:12.000 --> 30:16.233
Google is doing the same, just to sort of build that up.

718
30:17.130 --> 30:20.040
Overall, I think artificial intelligence holds

719
30:20.040 --> 30:21.360
massive potential, though,

720
30:21.360 --> 30:23.580
to also address some of the issues

721
30:23.580 --> 30:26.640
that we have around climate change head on.

722
30:26.640 --> 30:30.150
I mean, the climate system is very, very complex.

723
30:30.150 --> 30:33.720
And without machine learning, advanced analytics,

724
30:33.720 --> 30:36.750
and so on, many of the questions that we can tackle now,

725
30:36.750 --> 30:40.590
we would not have been able to tackle before.

726
30:40.590 --> 30:42.060
So for example,

727
30:42.060 --> 30:46.770
forecasting of extreme weather events, droughts, floods,

728
30:46.770 --> 30:49.470
modeling the implications of this on cities.

729
30:49.470 --> 30:53.640
Many cities now have such climate disaster plans in place,

730
30:53.640 --> 30:55.680
and they were all done with varieties

731
30:55.680 --> 31:00.510
of advanced analytics or AI-based software.

732
31:00.510 --> 31:03.870
Or another example that I quite like is contrails,

733
31:03.870 --> 31:06.420
the white thingies behind aircraft

734
31:06.420 --> 31:08.010
that you can see in the sky.

735
31:08.010 --> 31:11.190
They make up a third or so of aviation emissions.

736
31:11.190 --> 31:14.760
And there is analytics software now that can,

737
31:14.760 --> 31:17.340
through following certain flight patterns,

738
31:17.340 --> 31:20.520
avoid these contrails to emerge,

739
31:20.520 --> 31:22.350
and hence reducing emissions.

740
31:22.350 --> 31:25.050
And without the analytics that needs to go in there,

741
31:25.050 --> 31:26.460
we wouldn't have been able to do that.

742
31:26.460 --> 31:30.120
So I think especially on the optimization, efficiency,

743
31:30.120 --> 31:32.850
and modeling side, massive potential from AI,

744
31:32.850 --> 31:35.880
and I really think we need it to bring emissions down.

745
31:35.880 --> 31:36.713
<v Ally>Great.</v>

746
31:36.713 --> 31:37.950
And then, Campbell, I think you mentioned something earlier,

747
31:37.950 --> 31:40.020
too, about how you thought it could help Lowe's.

748
31:40.020 --> 31:43.923
<v ->Yeah, absolutely. So how many of you all own a car?</v>

749
31:45.630 --> 31:48.783
Do you all do regular maintenance on those cars?

750
31:49.980 --> 31:51.303
No? Some?

751
31:52.170 --> 31:53.220
Some probably do it

752
31:53.220 --> 31:56.610
because they want that car to last as long as possible.

753
31:56.610 --> 32:00.510
What Lowe's actually has started to leverage technology for

754
32:00.510 --> 32:04.560
is to create a maintenance schedule for your appliances.

755
32:04.560 --> 32:07.500
So within your appliance, your refrigerator,

756
32:07.500 --> 32:11.190
if you're not cleaning out the vent at the bottom, the fan,

757
32:11.190 --> 32:13.410
your appliance is not gonna last as long.

758
32:13.410 --> 32:15.060
So what we're actually connecting

759
32:15.060 --> 32:18.750
is your MyLowe's Rewards program to that appliance

760
32:18.750 --> 32:21.060
that you bought and providing you a maintenance schedule,

761
32:21.060 --> 32:22.050
similar to your car.

762
32:22.050 --> 32:25.800
So that's where I think technology can really help lower

763
32:25.800 --> 32:28.590
and also make those products last longer,

764
32:28.590 --> 32:30.420
which I think is super important,

765
32:30.420 --> 32:32.250
especially as almost the cost

766
32:32.250 --> 32:35.880
of everything has gone significantly up.

767
32:35.880 --> 32:37.830
And when you're investing tens of thousands

768
32:37.830 --> 32:39.180
of dollars in your appliances,

769
32:39.180 --> 32:40.230
you probably don't want that

770
32:40.230 --> 32:42.780
to only last for a couple years.

771
32:42.780 --> 32:45.840
So I think technology is gonna enable that.

772
32:45.840 --> 32:48.990
It's also, on the flip side, gonna enable you to understand,

773
32:48.990 --> 32:51.180
okay, when I'm getting that energy bill from,

774
32:51.180 --> 32:54.750
you know, Pacific, you know, Natural Gas or whatever,

775
32:54.750 --> 32:57.570
understanding where your weak spots are

776
32:57.570 --> 32:59.040
is super, super important.

777
32:59.040 --> 33:03.600
This summer I was paying close to $400 in energy costs,

778
33:03.600 --> 33:05.730
which is crazy, per month.

779
33:05.730 --> 33:08.580
Found out my HVAC unit was 25 years old.

780
33:08.580 --> 33:10.920
So technology really helped me understand,

781
33:10.920 --> 33:13.080
okay, if I switch a heat pump,

782
33:13.080 --> 33:15.000
you know, a heat pump HVAC unit,

783
33:15.000 --> 33:17.400
I can save this amount of money.

784
33:17.400 --> 33:18.600
And so we made the switch.

785
33:18.600 --> 33:21.990
And that was technology that was made by the manufacturer.

786
33:21.990 --> 33:24.780
But as a retailer that sells many of these products

787
33:24.780 --> 33:27.000
and many of these different brands,

788
33:27.000 --> 33:28.440
having it in one location

789
33:28.440 --> 33:30.330
rather than having your separate apps

790
33:30.330 --> 33:31.860
for all these different things I think

791
33:31.860 --> 33:32.910
is gonna be super important.

792
33:32.910 --> 33:35.790
And that's where retail can really play a huge role.

793
33:35.790 --> 33:38.010
<v ->Great. Okay, well, let's see.</v>

794
33:38.010 --> 33:40.410
Does anybody have a question in the audience?

795
33:40.410 --> 33:44.283
If so, come up to the microphones.

796
33:47.400 --> 33:49.950
<v Adrian>Hi. My name is Adrian Valdez, with Honda.</v>

797
33:49.950 --> 33:52.080
I had a question for you more specifically, Johanna,

798
33:52.080 --> 33:54.240
about the automotive sector.

799
33:54.240 --> 33:56.490
Obviously, 2024 we saw a lot of backtracking,

800
33:56.490 --> 33:59.187
as you mentioned, of emission goals, carbon-neutral goals.

801
33:59.187 --> 34:01.620
And so I guess my question to you is,

802
34:01.620 --> 34:04.320
why did we see so much backtracking of these goals?

803
34:04.320 --> 34:08.040
And maybe if you have any general advice for companies,

804
34:08.040 --> 34:12.060
auto OEMs to avoid any future backtracking.

805
34:12.060 --> 34:13.620
<v ->Yeah, sure.</v>

806
34:13.620 --> 34:15.930
I think, especially in automotive, it's also important

807
34:15.930 --> 34:18.450
to distinguish the different emission scopes

808
34:18.450 --> 34:21.510
and which climate targets people backtracked on,

809
34:21.510 --> 34:23.430
to our discussion earlier.

810
34:23.430 --> 34:25.810
We saw a lot of sort of postponement

811
34:26.940 --> 34:28.410
of electrification goals.

812
34:28.410 --> 34:30.270
So that's scope three downstream,

813
34:30.270 --> 34:31.950
the equivalent to your DPED tool

814
34:31.950 --> 34:34.290
and what you discussed earlier.

815
34:34.290 --> 34:37.410
And I think the main reason there was actually a lack

816
34:37.410 --> 34:40.350
of consumer demand for these products.

817
34:40.350 --> 34:41.940
And especially in Europe,

818
34:41.940 --> 34:45.090
that's always the market that I'm best able to comment on,

819
34:45.090 --> 34:50.090
the expectations on uptake of electrified mobility

820
34:50.520 --> 34:53.910
that we had a few years ago were not met last year.

821
34:53.910 --> 34:56.640
And that is why many companies postponed

822
34:56.640 --> 34:58.770
or even abandoned their plans

823
34:58.770 --> 35:03.477
for full electrification by 2030 or the early 2030 year.

824
35:04.440 --> 35:05.880
In my personal opinion,

825
35:05.880 --> 35:08.010
this particular development is also due

826
35:08.010 --> 35:09.780
to a government policy failure.

827
35:09.780 --> 35:11.280
Like, on the highest level,

828
35:11.280 --> 35:14.490
very ambitious targets for electric mobility were set,

829
35:14.490 --> 35:17.760
but they weren't followed through with the incentives

830
35:17.760 --> 35:21.270
and subsidies that basically every technology needs

831
35:21.270 --> 35:23.310
for a limited period of time

832
35:23.310 --> 35:25.590
before it is sufficiently mature

833
35:25.590 --> 35:29.100
to be the mainstream technology in a sector.

834
35:29.100 --> 35:32.493
So I think that's mainly what has caused that.

835
35:35.198 --> 35:40.198
On the scope one and two and scope three upstream side,

836
35:40.320 --> 35:42.960
we actually haven't seen so much backtracking

837
35:42.960 --> 35:45.030
also in the automotive space.

838
35:45.030 --> 35:47.190
So comparatively, that's a bit more

839
35:47.190 --> 35:49.830
under the control of individual OEMs

840
35:49.830 --> 35:52.980
and sits in their production choices,

841
35:52.980 --> 35:55.080
in their product design choices,

842
35:55.080 --> 35:56.730
in their procurement choices.

843
35:56.730 --> 35:59.460
And I think this is actually entirely voluntary.

844
35:59.460 --> 36:01.470
It's not driven by regulation.

845
36:01.470 --> 36:06.120
And many OEMs and also suppliers that I speak to have set up

846
36:06.120 --> 36:09.150
now very successful supplier engagement modes,

847
36:09.150 --> 36:12.030
to what you discussed earlier, Campbell,

848
36:12.030 --> 36:15.990
that actually has enabled them to make progress a bit faster

849
36:15.990 --> 36:17.940
in many areas than they expected.

850
36:17.940 --> 36:20.280
So I haven't seen so much backtracking there.

851
36:20.280 --> 36:21.990
There's another external factor there

852
36:21.990 --> 36:24.360
that's general technological development.

853
36:24.360 --> 36:26.460
So for example, hydrogen,

854
36:26.460 --> 36:28.470
like, it's very far from a car,

855
36:28.470 --> 36:31.020
but it's an important input factor, for example,

856
36:31.020 --> 36:32.820
in the production of low-carbon steel.

857
36:32.820 --> 36:35.380
And that's going to be a key driver

858
36:36.480 --> 36:39.810
of decarbonizing the car in itself.

859
36:39.810 --> 36:42.630
And also, there we saw some slower developments

860
36:42.630 --> 36:44.130
than initially expected.

861
36:44.130 --> 36:48.390
And that's what's driving some, yeah, lower progress

862
36:48.390 --> 36:51.510
or smaller steps than maybe we'd like to see.

863
36:51.510 --> 36:54.453
But what's there to learn there for your own strategies?

864
36:56.520 --> 36:58.380
Not so much the case anymore now,

865
36:58.380 --> 37:00.810
but when climate strategy started,

866
37:00.810 --> 37:03.330
many people set targets and then stopped.

867
37:03.330 --> 37:06.210
As in like, we have a target. We are good.

868
37:06.210 --> 37:07.410
That shouldn't be the case.

869
37:07.410 --> 37:09.567
The key thing after a target is the action

870
37:09.567 --> 37:12.510
and the measures that you need to actually do,

871
37:12.510 --> 37:14.370
including the business cases associated

872
37:14.370 --> 37:15.450
to achieve that target.

873
37:15.450 --> 37:16.830
And also the governance.

874
37:16.830 --> 37:19.170
How do you change each one of your processes,

875
37:19.170 --> 37:20.970
each one of your incentive systems,

876
37:20.970 --> 37:24.030
each one of your business procedures

877
37:24.030 --> 37:27.030
in order to take CO2 into account?

878
37:27.030 --> 37:29.700
So I think that's really important.

879
37:29.700 --> 37:32.940
So go sort of all the steps in a climate strategy,

880
37:32.940 --> 37:34.683
not just the target-setting step.

881
37:35.640 --> 37:36.600
Be realistic.

882
37:36.600 --> 37:37.800
Work with scenarios,

883
37:37.800 --> 37:40.140
especially where technology is immature,

884
37:40.140 --> 37:42.240
which you will have in many areas.

885
37:42.240 --> 37:45.960
And also, really openly communicate that you might have to,

886
37:45.960 --> 37:49.020
I won't say backtrack now, but maybe sidestep

887
37:49.020 --> 37:51.750
because an external development didn't realize

888
37:51.750 --> 37:54.000
in the way that you thought it would.

889
37:54.000 --> 37:55.980
I think in this way, I think there's, in general,

890
37:55.980 --> 37:59.250
the opportunity for way more open discussion

891
37:59.250 --> 38:01.020
about the challenges,

892
38:01.020 --> 38:05.070
to have a sidestep not be seen as a misdemeanor,

893
38:05.070 --> 38:06.860
but rather one thing that, you know,

894
38:06.860 --> 38:08.160
is maybe a sidestep now,

895
38:08.160 --> 38:09.660
but will ultimately get us further.

896
38:09.660 --> 38:12.450
So I think we'd benefit from more of those, like,

897
38:12.450 --> 38:15.150
honest, content-driven discussions.

898
38:15.150 --> 38:17.703
<v Ally>Great. Anyone else have a question?</v>

899
38:18.720 --> 38:20.340
Okay, we can take one more and then-

900
38:20.340 --> 38:21.173
<v ->Sorry.</v>

901
38:21.173 --> 38:22.140
<v ->No worries.</v>
<v ->Hello.</v>

902
38:22.140 --> 38:23.250
My name's Mike Rockwell.

903
38:23.250 --> 38:27.120
I'm a supply chain sustainability consultant with Anthesis.

904
38:27.120 --> 38:31.094
So scope three supplier engagement is my every day.

905
38:31.094 --> 38:32.940
And from where you sit,

906
38:32.940 --> 38:34.980
what are the carrots and sticks

907
38:34.980 --> 38:37.770
that are actually effective in not just measuring,

908
38:37.770 --> 38:40.950
but actually reducing those supplier emissions?

909
38:40.950 --> 38:42.393
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

910
38:43.650 --> 38:45.420
So when I first started on the journey,

911
38:45.420 --> 38:48.480
I sent a 10,000-word email talking

912
38:48.480 --> 38:50.760
about how much Lowe's cared about the environment.

913
38:50.760 --> 38:52.560
Really assumed that every supplier

914
38:52.560 --> 38:55.560
of ours had a sustainability person.

915
38:55.560 --> 38:57.704
And frankly, I got crickets.

916
38:57.704 --> 38:59.100
(Ally laughs)

917
38:59.100 --> 39:02.100
So then it was really leveraging our procurement team

918
39:02.100 --> 39:03.690
and their relationships.

919
39:03.690 --> 39:05.190
I mean, we've been doing business with some

920
39:05.190 --> 39:08.040
of the companies for the past 100 years,

921
39:08.040 --> 39:11.253
and using those relationships to just open the door.

922
39:12.570 --> 39:15.900
Really depends on how mature your supply chain is.

923
39:15.900 --> 39:19.050
But I would venture to say many supply chains need

924
39:19.050 --> 39:23.040
a point person or a champion of sustainability.

925
39:23.040 --> 39:24.870
And so it's on you and your role

926
39:24.870 --> 39:28.230
to actually educate them and equip them with the tools

927
39:28.230 --> 39:31.380
to feel confident before you can get to the reduction phase.

928
39:31.380 --> 39:32.790
This has been a three-year journey

929
39:32.790 --> 39:35.280
for me within supplier engagement,

930
39:35.280 --> 39:39.240
and I'm now starting to see investments in electrification

931
39:39.240 --> 39:42.660
and solar and all of these different great programs.

932
39:42.660 --> 39:46.743
But without the piece of why they're doing this,

933
39:48.045 --> 39:50.550
it disincentivizes them to do it.

934
39:50.550 --> 39:53.550
And so what we've also done is we've leveraged

935
39:53.550 --> 39:54.900
from our learned experience,

936
39:54.900 --> 39:58.980
so business cases, manufacturers,

937
39:58.980 --> 40:00.420
people that we've worked with,

938
40:00.420 --> 40:02.130
and actually brought them all together

939
40:02.130 --> 40:04.650
to offer that to our supply chain.

940
40:04.650 --> 40:07.170
I think the more that you can cut out the red tape

941
40:07.170 --> 40:09.390
and all of the information gathering

942
40:09.390 --> 40:11.460
and all of this kind of stuff that takes,

943
40:11.460 --> 40:12.873
frankly, full teams,

944
40:13.920 --> 40:15.720
you're gonna enable that supply chain

945
40:15.720 --> 40:16.860
and that supply chain member

946
40:16.860 --> 40:19.650
to make the decision on LEDs, right?

947
40:19.650 --> 40:22.350
I mean, investing in the LEDs seems like a no-brainer,

948
40:22.350 --> 40:24.757
but when you don't have an energy team that actually says,

949
40:24.757 --> 40:27.990
"Hey, this is how much we're gonna start to save,"

950
40:27.990 --> 40:29.640
it's really hard to make that decision.

951
40:29.640 --> 40:33.330
So trying to lift as much of the decision making off of

952
40:33.330 --> 40:34.447
that supplier and just saying,

953
40:34.447 --> 40:36.930
"Hey, here's what we can expect,

954
40:36.930 --> 40:38.100
here's how much it costs,

955
40:38.100 --> 40:40.110
and here's what your return will be."

956
40:40.110 --> 40:42.150
I think you'll start to see a lot more progress

957
40:42.150 --> 40:44.010
within the space.

958
40:44.010 --> 40:44.843
<v ->And I'll say, too,</v>

959
40:44.843 --> 40:46.590
we're seeing a lot of companies step

960
40:46.590 --> 40:47.940
into more of that, like,

961
40:47.940 --> 40:50.040
broader supply chain education role

962
40:50.040 --> 40:51.360
to bring others up to speed.

963
40:51.360 --> 40:52.680
'Cause obviously, there are a ton of companies.

964
40:52.680 --> 40:55.200
You know, sometimes your suppliers are more mature

965
40:55.200 --> 40:58.260
than you are as a company and what they're doing.

966
40:58.260 --> 41:00.150
The vast majority are not.

967
41:00.150 --> 41:00.983
So I think some

968
41:00.983 --> 41:03.030
of these engagement programs have been really exciting

969
41:03.030 --> 41:05.880
to say, "We'll lend some of what we've learned to you.

970
41:05.880 --> 41:07.897
We may even help organize a particular project that,

971
41:07.897 --> 41:10.320
you know, helps you make an investment."

972
41:10.320 --> 41:12.030
So there's been a lot of creativity.

973
41:12.030 --> 41:14.370
And if there's anything that comes of all of this,

974
41:14.370 --> 41:17.640
it's the opportunities for collaboration, I think.

975
41:17.640 --> 41:18.870
<v ->Definitely. Well, great.</v>

976
41:18.870 --> 41:21.240
Thank you. I think, unfortunately, we're out of time.

977
41:21.240 --> 41:23.190
We will hang back for a couple minutes.

978
41:23.190 --> 41:25.500
So if you guys wanna come up and meet us individually,

979
41:25.500 --> 41:27.390
we're happy to answer some more of your questions

980
41:27.390 --> 41:29.430
on a smaller scale.

981
41:29.430 --> 41:31.110
But thank you guys for coming.

982
41:31.110 --> 41:35.340
I'm wondering, can we get that second up maybe one more time

983
41:35.340 --> 41:39.540
for the DPED, so people can, you know,

984
41:39.540 --> 41:41.580
share it and get it on their phone,

985
41:41.580 --> 41:43.430
if they wanna learn more information?

986
41:45.600 --> 41:46.433
Great. Okay.

987
41:46.433 --> 41:47.602
Well, thank you.

988
41:47.602 --> 41:51.102
(upbeat electronic music)
