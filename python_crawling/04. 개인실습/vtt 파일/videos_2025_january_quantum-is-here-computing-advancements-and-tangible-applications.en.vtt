1
00:00.125 --> 00:02.708
(cheerful music)

2
00:10.290 --> 00:11.730
<v ->Thank you all for coming.</v>

3
00:11.730 --> 00:12.600
Thank you all for coming

4
00:12.600 --> 00:15.630
to the Quantum Means Business segment at CES.

5
00:15.630 --> 00:17.400
We are thrilled to be here,

6
00:17.400 --> 00:19.740
thrilled to have so many familiar faces and friends

7
00:19.740 --> 00:21.180
in the room as well.

8
00:21.180 --> 00:23.050
This is a big kind of step

9
00:23.050 --> 00:24.383
(cheerful music)
for the quantum industry,

10
00:24.383 --> 00:26.670
to come to CES

11
00:26.670 --> 00:30.420
and present where we are from an overarching perspective.

12
00:30.420 --> 00:32.670
My name is George Thomas,

13
00:32.670 --> 00:34.800
and it's my pleasure here today

14
00:34.800 --> 00:36.960
to kind of give you a little lay of the land

15
00:36.960 --> 00:38.250
and introduce us.

16
00:38.250 --> 00:40.230
So there's three segments to the session today.

17
00:40.230 --> 00:41.687
The first one is gonna be called Quantum is Here.

18
00:41.687 --> 00:44.313
We are gonna be focusing on quantum computing.

19
00:45.420 --> 00:47.160
But before we get started,

20
00:47.160 --> 00:50.250
I just wanted to kind of give a lay of the land

21
00:50.250 --> 00:52.800
with regard to what quantum is for those of you,

22
00:52.800 --> 00:53.760
just to kind of level set,

23
00:53.760 --> 00:56.110
so that we are all speaking from the same page.

24
00:57.330 --> 00:58.740
My name is George Thomas, as I said,

25
00:58.740 --> 01:01.950
I'm the president and CEO of Connected DMV,

26
01:01.950 --> 01:03.990
and we organize the Quantum World Congress,

27
01:03.990 --> 01:05.640
it's an annual kind of gathering

28
01:05.640 --> 01:08.880
for the leadership in quantum from around the world.

29
01:08.880 --> 01:12.157
So the industry itself and the market when we say,

30
01:12.157 --> 01:15.090
"Quantum," and quantum essentially is quantum mechanics,

31
01:15.090 --> 01:18.660
which is physics at the subatomic level,

32
01:18.660 --> 01:21.450
that has now created entire industries

33
01:21.450 --> 01:25.680
that are enabling us to use the science,

34
01:25.680 --> 01:28.050
to create engineering and applications,

35
01:28.050 --> 01:30.810
to drive substantial change within the world

36
01:30.810 --> 01:31.830
that we live in.

37
01:31.830 --> 01:36.360
The promise of quantum is, by all intents and purposes,

38
01:36.360 --> 01:38.700
going to be as profound, if not more,

39
01:38.700 --> 01:40.320
than when the internet came about.

40
01:40.320 --> 01:44.640
For those of you that remember pre-1995 to 2005,

41
01:44.640 --> 01:46.260
that was such a substantial change

42
01:46.260 --> 01:49.080
in pretty much everything that we do and how we interact.

43
01:49.080 --> 01:51.810
This is another one of those step changes that can happen

44
01:51.810 --> 01:54.240
in our lifetimes with regard to what this could do.

45
01:54.240 --> 01:56.130
So from a pure market perspective itself,

46
01:56.130 --> 01:59.520
that physics at the subatomic level has kind of evolved

47
01:59.520 --> 02:01.620
into multiple kind of domains of expertise,

48
02:01.620 --> 02:04.200
the first one being quantum computing,

49
02:04.200 --> 02:05.490
which everybody has heard of.

50
02:05.490 --> 02:06.750
There's also other areas,

51
02:06.750 --> 02:08.220
which I will kind of talk about in a little bit.

52
02:08.220 --> 02:10.830
From an overall market perspective, the rough estimate,

53
02:10.830 --> 02:13.530
and there's lots of variations, depending on what you count,

54
02:13.530 --> 02:16.260
is about 173 billion, this is a report from McKinsey,

55
02:16.260 --> 02:17.670
and you can see kind of like the breakout

56
02:17.670 --> 02:20.550
of that by quantum sensing, communications, and others.

57
02:20.550 --> 02:22.950
But the one, two numbers I would point out on the slide

58
02:22.950 --> 02:25.860
to also pay attention to is the economic impact

59
02:25.860 --> 02:28.110
just from quantum computing itself,

60
02:28.110 --> 02:30.150
is between 1 and $2 trillion,

61
02:30.150 --> 02:31.550
is the anticipation by 2040.

62
02:32.490 --> 02:34.980
And if you look across from a talent perspective,

63
02:34.980 --> 02:36.240
there's already, you know,

64
02:36.240 --> 02:40.050
55 masters-level quantum degrees that's possible.

65
02:40.050 --> 02:44.070
So it's not science in a lab, it's as much as it's here,

66
02:44.070 --> 02:45.540
talent is being developed,

67
02:45.540 --> 02:47.790
economic impact is being looked at.

68
02:47.790 --> 02:49.770
So this is a fast-moving

69
02:49.770 --> 02:53.280
and fast-evolving kind of market space as it were.

70
02:53.280 --> 02:54.780
And one of the other factors on there

71
02:54.780 --> 02:57.420
is that $40 billion that you see below it.

72
02:57.420 --> 02:59.970
So publicly available information

73
02:59.970 --> 03:03.150
from central and federal governments around the world

74
03:03.150 --> 03:06.300
showcase that this is a global phenomenon.

75
03:06.300 --> 03:08.760
There's a significant amount of investment happening,

76
03:08.760 --> 03:10.530
led by China, with about 15 billion,

77
03:10.530 --> 03:12.060
and the US with about four.

78
03:12.060 --> 03:13.380
But everybody's participating.

79
03:13.380 --> 03:15.060
And this is publicly available information

80
03:15.060 --> 03:15.960
from central governments.

81
03:15.960 --> 03:17.550
It's a lot more money going in

82
03:17.550 --> 03:19.230
outside of these kind of spheres.

83
03:19.230 --> 03:20.760
So the purpose of these two slides

84
03:20.760 --> 03:24.450
was to kind of impart on the fact that this is here,

85
03:24.450 --> 03:27.870
this is now, and there is a lot of money and expertise

86
03:27.870 --> 03:30.270
being spent to kind of develop what this looks like.

87
03:30.270 --> 03:32.760
And it's really a race between companies,

88
03:32.760 --> 03:35.700
between countries to kind of go after what the promise

89
03:35.700 --> 03:36.900
of this could look like.

90
03:38.550 --> 03:40.410
So going back one level,

91
03:40.410 --> 03:42.450
there's four or five ways you can kind of split up

92
03:42.450 --> 03:45.330
what quantum means from an industry perspective.

93
03:45.330 --> 03:47.190
We've just chosen to show it as five.

94
03:47.190 --> 03:49.590
There is a compute segment, which is, you know, computers.

95
03:49.590 --> 03:52.260
The second one is materials,

96
03:52.260 --> 03:54.090
so properties with different spin

97
03:54.090 --> 03:56.580
and different magnetic properties at the subatomic level

98
03:56.580 --> 03:58.047
create new ways we can think about

99
03:58.047 --> 04:00.180
and what kind of materials we could develop.

100
04:00.180 --> 04:02.280
Sensors, like high fidelity,

101
04:02.280 --> 04:03.900
are different ways to kind of measure

102
04:03.900 --> 04:04.823
what we see in the physical world,

103
04:04.823 --> 04:07.470
there's a whole kind of segment under quantum sensing.

104
04:07.470 --> 04:10.200
And arguably, quantum sensing is further along

105
04:10.200 --> 04:12.570
than even quantum computing with the types of assets.

106
04:12.570 --> 04:14.550
So the third segment sessioned today

107
04:14.550 --> 04:16.830
is gonna have a panel with quantum sensing companies

108
04:16.830 --> 04:17.850
talking about what they have done

109
04:17.850 --> 04:19.410
and where they're kind of going with it.

110
04:19.410 --> 04:21.630
So these are kind of five things

111
04:21.630 --> 04:22.530
that we've kind of broken up.

112
04:22.530 --> 04:25.590
And quantum cryptography is two sides of it, it is,

113
04:25.590 --> 04:27.660
how do we protect classical compute

114
04:27.660 --> 04:29.697
and classical assets from the advent

115
04:29.697 --> 04:31.500
when a quantum computer comes,

116
04:31.500 --> 04:34.320
and also what does pure kind of quantum property mean

117
04:34.320 --> 04:35.340
when that kinda comes around?

118
04:35.340 --> 04:37.800
So it's both sides of that equation, is a market,

119
04:37.800 --> 04:40.020
and there's a tremendous amount of market for it now.

120
04:40.020 --> 04:42.570
And NIST recently announced a set of, you know,

121
04:42.570 --> 04:45.960
protective algorithms to protect classical computers.

122
04:45.960 --> 04:47.550
And there's a whole industry being formed

123
04:47.550 --> 04:49.290
around how do we do that today

124
04:49.290 --> 04:50.880
before true quantum comes about.

125
04:50.880 --> 04:54.600
So not only is it quantum from a pure sensitive perspective,

126
04:54.600 --> 04:56.430
but the transition that needs to come through

127
04:56.430 --> 04:58.590
to make that happen over the next 10 years.

128
04:58.590 --> 05:00.810
So there's businesses, there's industries,

129
05:00.810 --> 05:03.090
there is applications, there is devices,

130
05:03.090 --> 05:05.310
all being kind of created in what we call

131
05:05.310 --> 05:07.620
the kind of like the overarching world of quantum

132
05:07.620 --> 05:09.000
is really the idea.

133
05:09.000 --> 05:11.280
So let me talk very quickly about two more things.

134
05:11.280 --> 05:14.640
So if I go into the quantum computing,

135
05:14.640 --> 05:16.980
this will give you kind of a very high level,

136
05:16.980 --> 05:19.950
it's by Fractal, about some of the potential applications

137
05:19.950 --> 05:21.690
that is possible in compute.

138
05:21.690 --> 05:23.536
It also touches on cryptography and communications.

139
05:23.536 --> 05:25.260
So I'm not gonna read the slide.

140
05:25.260 --> 05:26.370
But there's enough material

141
05:26.370 --> 05:28.890
about where these kind can be applied.

142
05:28.890 --> 05:30.750
And the next one is around sensing,

143
05:30.750 --> 05:32.730
these are some of the places and industries

144
05:32.730 --> 05:35.970
and the key things that we can now decide on what to do.

145
05:35.970 --> 05:37.320
There's a couple of things I'll mention,

146
05:37.320 --> 05:39.840
like gravity meters that used to measure stuff, you know,

147
05:39.840 --> 05:41.370
infrastructure in the ground.

148
05:41.370 --> 05:44.730
The level of fidelity is going to be so much better

149
05:44.730 --> 05:45.780
than what we have today.

150
05:45.780 --> 05:48.120
We can entirely have a whole new industry

151
05:48.120 --> 05:51.270
on infrastructure protection and risk mitigation.

152
05:51.270 --> 05:53.250
We can have entirely new mechanisms

153
05:53.250 --> 05:55.770
to understand how to deal with disasters

154
05:55.770 --> 05:57.690
before they happen, like an earthquake,

155
05:57.690 --> 05:59.850
far more so than we are able to do today.

156
05:59.850 --> 06:02.608
So it'll give you a sense of the types of industries that,

157
06:02.608 --> 06:03.570
you know, quantum is going to affect,

158
06:03.570 --> 06:07.140
and what will kind of come about to make this happen.

159
06:07.140 --> 06:11.190
So while all this was going on, one of the things,

160
06:11.190 --> 06:12.720
so because of all of this stuff,

161
06:12.720 --> 06:15.120
about three years ago, in 2022,

162
06:15.120 --> 06:17.700
we decided to start getting the leadership

163
06:17.700 --> 06:21.060
from around the world to come together in Washington, DC,

164
06:21.060 --> 06:22.860
to kind of talk about what this means,

165
06:22.860 --> 06:24.060
how do we collaborate,

166
06:24.060 --> 06:26.280
what are the mechanisms we can use

167
06:26.280 --> 06:28.530
to kind of drive forward progress,

168
06:28.530 --> 06:30.780
because nothing in science and technology

169
06:30.780 --> 06:32.010
is a straight line,

170
06:32.010 --> 06:34.620
there's lots of steps and stops and starts.

171
06:34.620 --> 06:37.740
One of my best examples of this is electric vehicles.

172
06:37.740 --> 06:42.330
The first suite of electric vehicles was a set of taxis

173
06:42.330 --> 06:46.373
that was deployed in London in 1897, 1897,

174
06:48.090 --> 06:50.610
it was called the Hummingbird Taxi Service.

175
06:50.610 --> 06:53.460
It lasted for about six years and went out of business.

176
06:53.460 --> 06:54.900
And the reason it went out of business

177
06:54.900 --> 06:56.820
was not because of the electric vehicle,

178
06:56.820 --> 07:00.000
it went out of business because vulcanization of rubber

179
07:00.000 --> 07:02.190
was not invented till 1920,

180
07:02.190 --> 07:04.260
which means the tires kept breaking

181
07:04.260 --> 07:06.840
on roads meant for horse carts.

182
07:06.840 --> 07:08.328
And then we lost 100-something years

183
07:08.328 --> 07:10.710
before the Hummingbird Service went back to London

184
07:10.710 --> 07:12.510
in the 2000s.

185
07:12.510 --> 07:16.080
So technologies fits and starts, ups and downs.

186
07:16.080 --> 07:17.790
So we need to come together as a community.

187
07:17.790 --> 07:20.340
So the Quantum World Congress allowed us that opportunity

188
07:20.340 --> 07:23.010
for the thousand leaders from about 29 countries,

189
07:23.010 --> 07:23.940
gathered this year,

190
07:23.940 --> 07:26.670
to kind of talk about a whole number of advancements.

191
07:26.670 --> 07:27.990
One of the big advancements there was,

192
07:27.990 --> 07:30.410
Boeing announced the launch in 2026

193
07:30.410 --> 07:31.800
of the first quantum satellite

194
07:31.800 --> 07:34.020
that they wanna put up in the air.

195
07:34.020 --> 07:36.030
So just to kind of give you a sense for that.

196
07:36.030 --> 07:38.910
So that's the background to kind of level set.

197
07:38.910 --> 07:41.400
So the plan for today, essentially, is threefold,

198
07:41.400 --> 07:43.800
three sessions, first on compute, the second one,

199
07:43.800 --> 07:45.840
we're gonna talk about how industry is getting involved,

200
07:45.840 --> 07:47.640
something called the Global Industry Challenge.

201
07:47.640 --> 07:49.170
And the third session is Quantum is Now,

202
07:49.170 --> 07:52.683
focused primarily on devices and sensors.

203
07:56.490 --> 07:58.650
And we would not be here without our sponsors,

204
07:58.650 --> 08:01.620
I really want to thank our sponsors, sitting here as well.

205
08:01.620 --> 08:03.270
IONQ, Microsoft, and Quantinuum,

206
08:03.270 --> 08:04.710
thank you for your generosity

207
08:04.710 --> 08:06.660
for allowing us to come to CES

208
08:06.660 --> 08:08.940
and have this discussion and this dialogue.

209
08:08.940 --> 08:12.210
We are really, really thrilled that you're all able to join

210
08:12.210 --> 08:14.490
in hearing what they have to say.

211
08:14.490 --> 08:15.693
So thank you, sponsors.

212
08:17.280 --> 08:18.113
So with that,

213
08:18.113 --> 08:22.020
let me invite my good friend, Jacqueline Tame.

214
08:22.020 --> 08:25.320
Jacqueline is an operating partner at Playground Global,

215
08:25.320 --> 08:28.800
which is a incredible venture capital firm

216
08:28.800 --> 08:31.020
that have invested heavily into the quantum space.

217
08:31.020 --> 08:33.300
And Jacqueline is gonna come up and introduce our panel.

218
08:33.300 --> 08:34.133
Jackie.

219
08:40.920 --> 08:43.410
<v ->Thank you so, so much, George and CES,</v>

220
08:43.410 --> 08:45.810
and to all of you who have joined us this morning.

221
08:45.810 --> 08:48.132
We have an early morning,

222
08:48.132 --> 08:51.825
yet, hopefully, very lively and spicy conversation

223
08:51.825 --> 08:54.450
about a topic that is critically important,

224
08:54.450 --> 08:56.010
has a lot of coverage these days

225
08:56.010 --> 08:57.690
for a whole host of reasons,

226
08:57.690 --> 08:59.640
and that, hopefully, with that introduction from George,

227
08:59.640 --> 09:03.480
you already know is well worth all of this focus

228
09:03.480 --> 09:05.670
and investment and attention.

229
09:05.670 --> 09:07.590
So I'm gonna briefly introduce

230
09:07.590 --> 09:11.460
my esteemed panelists up here today,

231
09:11.460 --> 09:14.400
and then I'm gonna offer a few sort of just opening remarks

232
09:14.400 --> 09:15.630
from my vantage point.

233
09:15.630 --> 09:17.580
And then we're gonna go into a pretty, I think,

234
09:17.580 --> 09:20.760
robust discussion along the lines of all of the things

235
09:20.760 --> 09:22.620
that George has just kind of highlighted for us.

236
09:22.620 --> 09:25.620
So to my immediate left, we have Joe Broz,

237
09:25.620 --> 09:28.170
who is a vice president of IBM Quantum,

238
09:28.170 --> 09:30.660
and leads their business development efforts.

239
09:30.660 --> 09:32.730
We have Margaret Arakawa,

240
09:32.730 --> 09:36.000
who is the chief marketing officer at IONQ.

241
09:36.000 --> 09:37.590
We have John Nici, who's the head

242
09:37.590 --> 09:40.650
of Growth and Strategic Technologies for Microsoft.

243
09:40.650 --> 09:42.647
And we have Nash Palaniswamy,

244
09:42.647 --> 09:45.600
who is the chief commercial officer at Quantinuum.

245
09:45.600 --> 09:47.640
So thank you all so much for being here.

246
09:47.640 --> 09:49.680
And I think, just given, oh, yes,

247
09:49.680 --> 09:52.110
please, thanks.
(audience applauding)

248
09:52.110 --> 09:52.965
Appreciate that.

249
09:52.965 --> 09:54.750
(audience applauding)

250
09:54.750 --> 09:57.420
Yeah, so to have these four people,

251
09:57.420 --> 09:59.820
whose jobs are clearly pretty important these days

252
09:59.820 --> 10:01.170
for all of those respective companies,

253
10:01.170 --> 10:02.250
be here to talk about this

254
10:02.250 --> 10:05.130
I hope is another sort of just signal and indicator

255
10:05.130 --> 10:10.130
of how critical this technology is, where we are,

256
10:10.620 --> 10:12.960
and where we are in the business cycle here,

257
10:12.960 --> 10:16.260
which we're gonna talk about in a lot of detail today.

258
10:16.260 --> 10:18.570
I will offer just a really, really brief perspective,

259
10:18.570 --> 10:19.770
which may be a little bit different

260
10:19.770 --> 10:20.940
than what you hear from my colleagues,

261
10:20.940 --> 10:23.010
just based on my background.

262
10:23.010 --> 10:24.090
So as George shared,

263
10:24.090 --> 10:25.830
I'm an operating partner with Playground Global,

264
10:25.830 --> 10:28.680
which is an early-stage deep-tech venture capital firm.

265
10:28.680 --> 10:31.290
I'm actually building our global government practice.

266
10:31.290 --> 10:33.360
So I'm not on the investment side of the house.

267
10:33.360 --> 10:35.850
Playground realized about a year ago,

268
10:35.850 --> 10:37.200
maybe a little earlier,

269
10:37.200 --> 10:40.950
that the government and industry intersection

270
10:40.950 --> 10:42.990
and private capital intersection

271
10:42.990 --> 10:47.220
around these critical emerging technologies is just,

272
10:49.650 --> 10:52.440
you can't underestimate how important it is

273
10:52.440 --> 10:53.940
to get those relationships right

274
10:53.940 --> 10:58.320
and those elements of education and understanding right.

275
10:58.320 --> 11:00.930
So much of my job, both internally and externally,

276
11:00.930 --> 11:03.690
is educating the government stakeholders

277
11:03.690 --> 11:07.125
about where we are in the markets for these technologies

278
11:07.125 --> 11:09.060
for quantum computing and everything else.

279
11:09.060 --> 11:10.470
And then, in turn,

280
11:10.470 --> 11:13.290
helping to educate our portfolio companies

281
11:13.290 --> 11:16.440
and industry partners and LPs on where the government is

282
11:16.440 --> 11:18.420
and what that signal means.

283
11:18.420 --> 11:20.400
And I grew up in the intelligence community

284
11:20.400 --> 11:21.480
and the Department of Defense,

285
11:21.480 --> 11:25.290
I ran the AI center at the Department of Defense

286
11:25.290 --> 11:27.390
in my last kind of full-time role.

287
11:27.390 --> 11:29.460
And the reason that I got into quantum,

288
11:29.460 --> 11:31.470
I actually started with one of our portfolio companies

289
11:31.470 --> 11:32.303
called Si-Quantum,

290
11:32.303 --> 11:36.270
which is a hardware, a quantum computing hardware company,

291
11:36.270 --> 11:40.260
is because I saw how absolutely behind we were

292
11:40.260 --> 11:42.720
in the government on some of these technologies.

293
11:42.720 --> 11:45.270
I saw it in the AI space, and then I started to learn

294
11:45.270 --> 11:47.160
about the quantum technology aspect of things.

295
11:47.160 --> 11:51.420
And so my vantage point is really,

296
11:51.420 --> 11:54.810
I've never come at it from a business side until now.

297
11:54.810 --> 11:56.310
And now, I get to see

298
11:56.310 --> 11:59.250
sort of not only the threat aspect of it, right?

299
11:59.250 --> 12:01.260
Which is how I grew up,

300
12:01.260 --> 12:04.890
but I also see the unbelievable opportunity aspect of it

301
12:04.890 --> 12:07.380
in terms of fundamentally changing

302
12:07.380 --> 12:10.360
how we see and interact with the world

303
12:11.220 --> 12:14.220
and unlock incredible revenue opportunities (laughs)

304
12:14.220 --> 12:15.870
across a whole host of markets, right?

305
12:15.870 --> 12:17.580
Which is what we're gonna talk about today.

306
12:17.580 --> 12:21.453
So I'll offer three points before we go into our discussion.

307
12:22.710 --> 12:26.430
For your context, publicly announced,

308
12:26.430 --> 12:30.630
at least two utility-scale quantum computers

309
12:30.630 --> 12:33.330
will be operational by 2028, at least,

310
12:33.330 --> 12:36.090
we know of at least one company that's announced that.

311
12:36.090 --> 12:38.700
Those computers will be 10,000 times

312
12:38.700 --> 12:41.610
the size of Google's Willow hardware, recently announced,

313
12:41.610 --> 12:43.530
for a scale perspective.

314
12:43.530 --> 12:44.580
Quantum algorithms,

315
12:44.580 --> 12:45.870
which we're gonna talk a lot about today,

316
12:45.870 --> 12:49.140
are improving 1,000 times faster

317
12:49.140 --> 12:52.860
than the hardware improvements that we're gonna talk about.

318
12:52.860 --> 12:56.730
And no GPU will ever be able to answer

319
12:56.730 --> 12:58.350
an important class of questions

320
12:58.350 --> 13:01.830
about the quantum nature of nature.

321
13:01.830 --> 13:03.540
This is what we need to unlock,

322
13:03.540 --> 13:06.930
all of this, quantum technology for.

323
13:06.930 --> 13:09.993
So I'm gonna start with a question, John, for you.

324
13:11.643 --> 13:13.560
And the question is, and I'm sure that this is the question

325
13:13.560 --> 13:18.560
on everybody's mind this week, there is a widespread belief

326
13:19.320 --> 13:24.183
that quantum computing is still decades away, maybe two,

327
13:25.170 --> 13:27.390
how does Microsoft's investment

328
13:27.390 --> 13:30.240
in quantum technologies challenge this perception,

329
13:30.240 --> 13:34.980
and how are you managing expectations about when enterprises

330
13:34.980 --> 13:36.880
are actually gonna be seeing real ROI?

331
13:37.890 --> 13:42.063
<v ->Well, we do believe that it's years, not decades.</v>

332
13:43.530 --> 13:48.530
We are in the era of reliable quantum computing today.

333
13:48.600 --> 13:52.950
We have achieved detecting errors,

334
13:52.950 --> 13:55.350
correcting errors, and doing compute.

335
13:55.350 --> 13:59.640
And that was really a big milestone for many of us up here,

336
13:59.640 --> 14:03.420
to be able to compute and create answers

337
14:03.420 --> 14:06.420
and data from these quantum systems.

338
14:06.420 --> 14:07.710
You know, you mentioned a lot

339
14:07.710 --> 14:08.850
about the intelligence community,

340
14:08.850 --> 14:10.440
and there's an agency here

341
14:10.440 --> 14:11.520
in the United States called DARPA,

342
14:11.520 --> 14:14.670
who does research projects,

343
14:14.670 --> 14:17.160
and the, you know, you can go back to GPS,

344
14:17.160 --> 14:20.490
the internet, voice transcription, all have roots in DARPA.

345
14:20.490 --> 14:23.880
And DARPA has funded and worked with many of us

346
14:23.880 --> 14:28.880
to create supercomputing utility-scale quantum computing

347
14:29.790 --> 14:33.480
before 2033, which is eight years away.

348
14:33.480 --> 14:36.000
We are and many others are well on their way

349
14:36.000 --> 14:37.560
to meeting that goal.

350
14:37.560 --> 14:40.620
And so when I look at what we're doing in investing

351
14:40.620 --> 14:43.770
at Microsoft, we're doing two very important things.

352
14:43.770 --> 14:46.380
One, we're investing highly in our partners

353
14:46.380 --> 14:49.200
and the capabilities from Quantinuum and IONQ

354
14:49.200 --> 14:53.790
and others to make sure that a robust ecosystem,

355
14:53.790 --> 14:55.170
that the skilling is there,

356
14:55.170 --> 14:57.600
that we have the options and capabilities

357
14:57.600 --> 15:00.210
to have different types of quantum computers.

358
15:00.210 --> 15:03.210
We announced just a few months ago with another partner,

359
15:03.210 --> 15:05.880
Atom Computing, that this calendar year,

360
15:05.880 --> 15:09.360
we will ship the world's most powerful quantum computer

361
15:09.360 --> 15:13.290
to customers with a discovery suite around it

362
15:13.290 --> 15:17.550
that will help do an end-to-end analysis, discovery,

363
15:17.550 --> 15:19.830
and solution for many types of problems.

364
15:19.830 --> 15:20.970
<v ->You said, "This year," John.</v>

365
15:20.970 --> 15:21.803
<v ->That's right, this calendar year.</v>

366
15:21.803 --> 15:23.100
<v ->Okay.</v>
<v ->That's right.</v>

367
15:23.100 --> 15:26.550
And on top of that, we're also pursuing

368
15:26.550 --> 15:30.240
our own first-party quantum computer as well.

369
15:30.240 --> 15:33.783
We've been on this journey over 15 years, closer to 20.

370
15:34.770 --> 15:39.120
And we believe that these quantum computers

371
15:39.120 --> 15:44.120
will absolutely have the ability to solve, as you said,

372
15:44.460 --> 15:49.460
subatomic answers, model nature, and that is why we're here,

373
15:50.010 --> 15:53.700
because you'll hear from many of the other panelists,

374
15:53.700 --> 15:56.370
the solutions are happening today.

375
15:56.370 --> 15:59.190
And, you know, as you learn more about it,

376
15:59.190 --> 16:01.470
and as Quantum World Congress continues,

377
16:01.470 --> 16:04.860
and we all see you probably in DC in September,

378
16:04.860 --> 16:06.450
you'll see even more.

379
16:06.450 --> 16:07.950
Now, the last part of your question

380
16:07.950 --> 16:11.670
was how do we manage expectations in ROI.

381
16:11.670 --> 16:14.310
And it's really important when we talk to our customers

382
16:14.310 --> 16:18.660
to realize that there is an advantage coming,

383
16:18.660 --> 16:20.670
just like there was with advanced analytics,

384
16:20.670 --> 16:22.680
just like there was with GenAI.

385
16:22.680 --> 16:25.590
Quantum computing will have that advantage for companies,

386
16:25.590 --> 16:27.900
for businesses, for regions, for governments.

387
16:27.900 --> 16:29.850
And so beginning that journey now

388
16:29.850 --> 16:32.100
with understanding what does it mean,

389
16:32.100 --> 16:33.240
what should I be focused on,

390
16:33.240 --> 16:35.250
which of those areas that George showed

391
16:35.250 --> 16:37.080
are most important to me, and where should I go,

392
16:37.080 --> 16:40.620
and how do I get my hands on the capabilities today,

393
16:40.620 --> 16:42.540
so I can actually experiment

394
16:42.540 --> 16:45.270
and start to solve these problems, is critical,

395
16:45.270 --> 16:50.270
because we will, in the next, as you said, Jacqueline,

396
16:50.460 --> 16:54.780
one to two years, have those capabilities

397
16:54.780 --> 16:57.570
ready for everyone to use at some level,

398
16:57.570 --> 16:59.790
and then they will exponentially grow.

399
16:59.790 --> 17:02.850
So that's more of how we manage expectations with customers

400
17:02.850 --> 17:05.940
and let them understand there are folks who did very well

401
17:05.940 --> 17:09.657
taking advantage of advanced analytics and then GenAI.

402
17:09.657 --> 17:13.020
And the quantum computing revolution is the next one

403
17:13.020 --> 17:15.020
that they need to be prepared for today.

404
17:15.960 --> 17:17.790
<v ->And Margaret, did you have a perspective also</v>

405
17:17.790 --> 17:21.480
on the kind of timeline aspect of this question?

406
17:21.480 --> 17:23.717
<v ->Yes, I think quantum is now,</v>

407
17:24.750 --> 17:27.210
quantum is now, that's the title of the track.

408
17:27.210 --> 17:31.740
I guess, I think of it in, as George mentioned,

409
17:31.740 --> 17:35.640
there's 40 to $50 billion already invested in this industry.

410
17:35.640 --> 17:37.410
In this entire panel,

411
17:37.410 --> 17:39.390
we have companies, real-life companies,

412
17:39.390 --> 17:43.560
with revenue and customers and a strategy.

413
17:43.560 --> 17:46.080
So for us in particular, you know,

414
17:46.080 --> 17:48.870
our strategy was, "Let's hit the performance benchmarks,"

415
17:48.870 --> 17:49.957
we all are hitting them.

416
17:49.957 --> 17:52.860
"Let's hit the scale benchmarks," we're all hitting them.

417
17:52.860 --> 17:54.120
And then, finally, on QI,

418
17:54.120 --> 17:57.570
we are focusing on making sure we build quantum computers

419
17:57.570 --> 17:59.460
that are data center ready,

420
17:59.460 --> 18:01.440
'cause we know there's lots and lots

421
18:01.440 --> 18:03.090
of data centers in the world,

422
18:03.090 --> 18:07.707
and there's gonna be a collaborative impact of CPUs,

423
18:07.707 --> 18:08.957
GPUs, and QPUs.

424
18:09.930 --> 18:12.210
And we need to make sure that these quantum computers

425
18:12.210 --> 18:14.040
can be in these data centers.

426
18:14.040 --> 18:16.590
So is there a strategy? We have the strategy.

427
18:16.590 --> 18:18.270
Are there customers?

428
18:18.270 --> 18:19.680
You know, we work with the Air Force,

429
18:19.680 --> 18:22.200
we work with Hyundai, we work with Airbus.

430
18:22.200 --> 18:25.230
Our customers actually coming to all of us

431
18:25.230 --> 18:27.960
and focusing on us helping them, you know,

432
18:27.960 --> 18:29.670
solve their biggest problems.

433
18:29.670 --> 18:31.080
And then the third thing is,

434
18:31.080 --> 18:32.400
'cause we're all business people,

435
18:32.400 --> 18:34.170
is anyone making revenue?

436
18:34.170 --> 18:37.110
You know, IONQ and a lot of our companies here,

437
18:37.110 --> 18:38.040
we're businesses.

438
18:38.040 --> 18:40.770
You know, IONQ has been doubling revenue every year.

439
18:40.770 --> 18:44.580
So those are important aspects of, is quantum here?

440
18:44.580 --> 18:46.830
These sort of markers that business people use,

441
18:46.830 --> 18:49.110
those are the things you should use to evaluate

442
18:49.110 --> 18:51.843
that quantum is here, and we are working on it now.

443
18:52.800 --> 18:53.633
<v ->Thank you.</v>

444
18:53.633 --> 18:55.200
Joe, I'm gonna actually ask you a question

445
18:55.200 --> 18:57.660
about another kind of myth, right?

446
18:57.660 --> 19:01.320
We're gonna do some myth-busting today, that quantum

447
19:01.320 --> 19:05.070
is going to entirely replace classical computing.

448
19:05.070 --> 19:08.280
Can you share your insights on how the two will coexist,

449
19:08.280 --> 19:09.450
do you think?

450
19:09.450 --> 19:10.713
<v ->Sure. Thank you.</v>

451
19:11.687 --> 19:16.413
Let me address this question from the IBM standpoint,

452
19:17.700 --> 19:19.893
and let me set a little bit of a stage.

453
19:20.760 --> 19:24.420
We firmly believe that we are now in an era

454
19:24.420 --> 19:26.370
of quantum utility,

455
19:26.370 --> 19:29.940
and we are very confident that quantum advantage

456
19:29.940 --> 19:33.573
is in the near term, as our panelists have discussed.

457
19:34.560 --> 19:36.510
We follow a roadmap.

458
19:36.510 --> 19:40.800
We published a roadmap in 2019,

459
19:40.800 --> 19:44.130
we have followed it and met every milestone on time

460
19:44.130 --> 19:48.540
or ahead of time in the last five years.

461
19:48.540 --> 19:53.540
That roadmap calls for a 10,000-qubit machine,

462
19:53.580 --> 19:57.960
error corrected, to be field in '29,

463
19:57.960 --> 20:02.557
and a 100,000 qubit machine in '33.

464
20:05.010 --> 20:10.010
We expect to meet every milestone along that way,

465
20:10.380 --> 20:15.380
and that provides machinery that has great capabilities.

466
20:15.480 --> 20:17.580
Let me set that stage.

467
20:17.580 --> 20:21.097
We went into the cloud in 2016 at IBM.

468
20:22.380 --> 20:27.380
Since that time, we have had 600,000 users use our system,

469
20:28.440 --> 20:30.000
register, and use the system,

470
20:30.000 --> 20:34.650
running over 3 trillion quantum circuits on our system.

471
20:34.650 --> 20:38.370
We have deployed over 70 quantum computers.

472
20:38.370 --> 20:43.370
We have 250 organizations, companies, universities,

473
20:45.870 --> 20:49.593
research labs, national labs on our quantum network.

474
20:51.300 --> 20:53.550
This shows you, you know,

475
20:53.550 --> 20:57.930
there's a large group of people that do, in fact,

476
20:57.930 --> 21:00.750
find utility in using these machines,

477
21:00.750 --> 21:05.010
and expanding the boundaries of scientific capability.

478
21:05.010 --> 21:08.520
Let me be precise about what we mean by utility

479
21:08.520 --> 21:10.380
and quantum advantage.

480
21:10.380 --> 21:15.330
Utility is where a quantum circuit can be run

481
21:15.330 --> 21:19.900
on a quantum machine with a capability equal to

482
21:22.710 --> 21:26.440
or better than that circuit can be run

483
21:27.390 --> 21:30.480
by brute-force classical simulation.

484
21:30.480 --> 21:32.070
Advantage is really

485
21:32.070 --> 21:36.540
about the upcoming quantum compute capability

486
21:36.540 --> 21:40.050
that will outperform all classical methods.

487
21:40.050 --> 21:41.850
So where we are today is,

488
21:41.850 --> 21:46.710
we can exceed the brute-force simulation methods

489
21:46.710 --> 21:49.350
for quantum circuits that are out there.

490
21:49.350 --> 21:54.337
Our paper in June of '23 showed the,

491
21:55.290 --> 21:57.360
and really demonstrated the utility,

492
21:57.360 --> 22:01.200
and there have been 50, 60 papers published since

493
22:01.200 --> 22:03.603
that are using qubit numbers,

494
22:04.830 --> 22:09.570
over 100 qubits in deep circuits,

495
22:09.570 --> 22:11.883
that cannot be simulated classically.

496
22:13.410 --> 22:14.490
<v ->Great. Thank you so much.</v>

497
22:14.490 --> 22:17.130
And I apologize, I can't see everybody's faces.

498
22:17.130 --> 22:18.840
So if you have reactions, please,

499
22:18.840 --> 22:20.400
please go ahead and jump in.
(panelist laughs)

500
22:20.400 --> 22:23.190
But Nash, in the meantime,

501
22:23.190 --> 22:25.530
Quantinuum is operating at the intersection

502
22:25.530 --> 22:27.840
of both hardware and software.

503
22:27.840 --> 22:30.750
And how are you simplifying the explanation

504
22:30.750 --> 22:32.790
of your dual focus

505
22:32.790 --> 22:35.460
when you discuss quantum's transformative potential

506
22:35.460 --> 22:36.543
with your customers?

507
22:37.440 --> 22:38.273
<v ->Sure, thank you.</v>

508
22:38.273 --> 22:40.410
And yeah, hopefully, everybody can see me.

509
22:40.410 --> 22:41.582
It's the corner here.

510
22:41.582 --> 22:43.230
I'm 5'7",
(panelists laughing)

511
22:43.230 --> 22:45.600
I think I can be above that.
(panelists laughing)

512
22:45.600 --> 22:47.910
Yeah, so, you know, my background, you know,

513
22:47.910 --> 22:51.030
I've spent since '88 in accelerated computing, right?

514
22:51.030 --> 22:54.630
I've been in the CPU and making the CPU better

515
22:54.630 --> 22:56.820
from CPU plus GPU.

516
22:56.820 --> 23:00.270
And the software and the algorithms are a major part

517
23:00.270 --> 23:02.610
of the complete solution, right?

518
23:02.610 --> 23:05.190
So from a Quantinuum standpoint, you know,

519
23:05.190 --> 23:07.710
we have already announced that we are gonna go after

520
23:07.710 --> 23:12.710
a universal, fully fault-tolerant computer by 2029, right?

521
23:13.650 --> 23:17.220
So to build a quantum computer,

522
23:17.220 --> 23:19.080
there are certain things that you need to do, right?

523
23:19.080 --> 23:21.330
Which is you have to have the highest fidelity,

524
23:21.330 --> 23:23.670
you have to also handle all the operations,

525
23:23.670 --> 23:24.990
it's gotta be universal.

526
23:24.990 --> 23:27.240
Clifford gates and non-Clifford gates, right?

527
23:27.240 --> 23:29.400
So there's lots of things that you need to happen

528
23:29.400 --> 23:30.960
on the hardware side.

529
23:30.960 --> 23:33.930
On the software side, we take a very different view,

530
23:33.930 --> 23:36.360
which is we have to develop the algorithms

531
23:36.360 --> 23:37.950
and everything necessary

532
23:37.950 --> 23:40.110
that will run not only on our system,

533
23:40.110 --> 23:42.030
but also on other people's system, right?

534
23:42.030 --> 23:46.980
So the state of the quantum industry's in such a situation,

535
23:46.980 --> 23:49.440
that we wanna make sure there are open standards also.

536
23:49.440 --> 23:50.970
We've also open source software.

537
23:50.970 --> 23:53.850
For example, we have taken something called ticket

538
23:53.850 --> 23:55.200
and given it to the industry

539
23:55.200 --> 23:58.890
so that you can develop compilers for other hardware, right?

540
23:58.890 --> 24:03.330
So our strategy's a complete top-down approach,

541
24:03.330 --> 24:04.290
where we're gonna build

542
24:04.290 --> 24:07.590
a universal fully fault-tolerant computer, right?

543
24:07.590 --> 24:08.820
It's gotta be universal.

544
24:08.820 --> 24:09.653
There's no point having a CPU

545
24:09.653 --> 24:12.270
if you can run only two instructions, right?

546
24:12.270 --> 24:13.410
You gotta run all the instructions,

547
24:13.410 --> 24:15.720
so you can run a complete piece of software, right?

548
24:15.720 --> 24:20.310
And from a software standpoint, we're gonna make sure

549
24:20.310 --> 24:23.430
the core components needed to advance the industry

550
24:23.430 --> 24:25.050
is open source.

551
24:25.050 --> 24:26.940
We'll have our key algorithms that we work

552
24:26.940 --> 24:31.350
with our customers, such as BMW, that we will use,

553
24:31.350 --> 24:33.330
so that can be used on different systems, right?

554
24:33.330 --> 24:35.677
We don't want a particular customer to be saying,

555
24:35.677 --> 24:38.100
"Hey, you can only use a Quantinuum system," right?

556
24:38.100 --> 24:40.560
We wanna make sure it's available in all systems.

557
24:40.560 --> 24:44.670
So an open approach is very important for quantum computing.

558
24:44.670 --> 24:46.500
And our approach is to make sure

559
24:46.500 --> 24:49.050
that we are working on the full stack

560
24:49.050 --> 24:53.340
and making it easily accessible for everybody, right?

561
24:53.340 --> 24:54.597
Including other hardware vendors

562
24:54.597 --> 24:56.100
and software vendors, right?

563
24:56.100 --> 24:59.340
So other software vendors can run on our system also.

564
24:59.340 --> 25:00.420
<v ->Perfect. Go ahead, Joe.</v>

565
25:00.420 --> 25:05.420
<v ->Yeah, I might follow on that, what Nash just said.</v>

566
25:07.200 --> 25:10.710
You know, there's a myth or a misconception that quantum

567
25:10.710 --> 25:15.390
is somehow going to displace classical computing,

568
25:15.390 --> 25:17.310
and that's just not the case.

569
25:17.310 --> 25:21.900
Quantum computing is going to enhance

570
25:21.900 --> 25:24.810
classical high-performance compute.

571
25:24.810 --> 25:28.533
You can look at it as an accelerator, an adjunct.

572
25:29.790 --> 25:32.220
The way we see that architecture

573
25:32.220 --> 25:36.030
is what we call quantum-centric supercomputing,

574
25:36.030 --> 25:38.793
what this means is, you take a given problem,

575
25:39.630 --> 25:44.630
and you divide it into those resources that are quantum

576
25:45.390 --> 25:50.390
and those resources that will use the classical computation.

577
25:52.050 --> 25:56.700
A good example is in chemistry.

578
25:56.700 --> 25:59.730
You all, you know, remember from high school chemistry

579
25:59.730 --> 26:04.730
that the bulk electrons, you know, can be calculated.

580
26:05.070 --> 26:08.730
They're not really involved in a chemical reaction.

581
26:08.730 --> 26:13.530
Those can be well approximated in classical systems.

582
26:13.530 --> 26:15.540
But the valence electrons,

583
26:15.540 --> 26:18.960
those electrons that have high correlation

584
26:18.960 --> 26:22.680
and are very active in a chemical reaction,

585
26:22.680 --> 26:26.520
those then, that part of the problem can be adjudicated

586
26:26.520 --> 26:30.540
to the quantum resources, to the quantum processing unit,

587
26:30.540 --> 26:35.540
and the CPU and the quantum processing unit, the QPU,

588
26:37.410 --> 26:41.850
can work in concert with each other in an iterative fashion.

589
26:41.850 --> 26:46.290
And we showed in a paper, published last year,

590
26:46.290 --> 26:51.290
using iron sulfide as the model molecule,

591
26:51.540 --> 26:55.830
something very essential to all proteins in life,

592
26:55.830 --> 27:00.830
that that kind of a calculation can be done very efficiently

593
27:01.860 --> 27:04.200
using this hybrid architecture

594
27:04.200 --> 27:09.120
of both classical compute combined with quantum computing.

595
27:09.120 --> 27:13.140
So I wanna make sure people realize this is not an idea

596
27:13.140 --> 27:18.140
of somehow replacing classical high-performance computing,

597
27:20.340 --> 27:24.930
but it really will be an accelerator, an adjunct, an add-on,

598
27:24.930 --> 27:28.080
and an enhancement of those capabilities.

599
27:28.080 --> 27:30.431
<v ->Yeah, just a quick add-on to that, right?</v>

600
27:30.431 --> 27:32.641
You know, hybrid computing, right,

601
27:32.641 --> 27:36.360
accelerated computing, you know, it's always gonna be CPU

602
27:36.360 --> 27:40.620
plus GPU plus this quantum technology plus something else.

603
27:40.620 --> 27:42.090
There's gonna be other technologies

604
27:42.090 --> 27:44.430
which are gonna come, neuromorphic.

605
27:44.430 --> 27:46.290
You know, this is the vision, right?

606
27:46.290 --> 27:49.140
I think just to have a little bit of humor here, right?

607
27:49.140 --> 27:50.437
I think I've heard other people say,

608
27:50.437 --> 27:54.180
"It is supercomputing-centric quantum computing,

609
27:54.180 --> 27:55.350
you know, not the other way around."

610
27:55.350 --> 27:56.970
So, just, yeah.

611
27:56.970 --> 27:57.803
<v ->Go ahead.</v>

612
27:57.803 --> 27:58.636
<v ->Well, I was just gonna say, you know,</v>

613
27:58.636 --> 28:01.080
to make it real for everyone,

614
28:01.080 --> 28:03.960
Nash and Quantinuum and Microsoft worked together

615
28:03.960 --> 28:08.960
and devised a catalyst problem,

616
28:09.000 --> 28:12.480
which is a very important chemistry problem.

617
28:12.480 --> 28:17.070
And we used classic computing, HPC resources,

618
28:17.070 --> 28:19.380
plus AI to drive the system,

619
28:19.380 --> 28:24.380
plus we spun out the difficult pieces of it

620
28:24.627 --> 28:27.660
to a quantum circuit on Quantinuum's machines

621
28:27.660 --> 28:28.920
using logical qubits.

622
28:28.920 --> 28:32.910
So that quantum circuit created the data that we needed

623
28:32.910 --> 28:36.150
to go feed back into the AI model, so it could be trained,

624
28:36.150 --> 28:39.510
and then properly estimate the science problem

625
28:39.510 --> 28:42.990
of this catalyst, which it did, and it did accurately.

626
28:42.990 --> 28:47.427
So to Joe's point, this is your AI, HPC,

627
28:47.427 --> 28:49.890
and quantum working together,

628
28:49.890 --> 28:52.920
not to come up with a random number

629
28:52.920 --> 28:55.770
or think about something, but we actually, what we believe

630
28:55.770 --> 28:59.460
is the first ever last year end-to-end proof

631
28:59.460 --> 29:01.494
of a science problem-
<v ->That's right.</v>

632
29:01.494 --> 29:02.327
That's right.

633
29:02.327 --> 29:03.990
Yeah, and I think it was really made possible

634
29:03.990 --> 29:05.460
by a couple of things, right?

635
29:05.460 --> 29:07.920
One was definitely, you know,

636
29:07.920 --> 29:11.460
the key work done by Microsoft, right, in the, you know,

637
29:11.460 --> 29:14.610
in the error detection and correction space.

638
29:14.610 --> 29:16.800
You know, you have some fantastic scientists.

639
29:16.800 --> 29:19.197
And also the high fidelity that, you know,

640
29:19.197 --> 29:21.570
the quantum system brought in place,

641
29:21.570 --> 29:23.670
so you could do that complete

642
29:23.670 --> 29:26.250
in an effort to get a real solution in place.

643
29:26.250 --> 29:28.500
So thank you for that work.

644
29:28.500 --> 29:31.620
And I think we'll see more of this from, you know,

645
29:31.620 --> 29:32.509
people in the industry.

646
29:32.509 --> 29:36.030
And I think John gave an example, you know, of IBM.

647
29:36.030 --> 29:38.370
And Margaret, I'm sure you have other examples.

648
29:38.370 --> 29:39.203
<v ->Yeah.</v>

649
29:39.203 --> 29:41.340
Well, one thing I wanted to just go back to which he said

650
29:41.340 --> 29:43.080
which I thought was incredibly important

651
29:43.080 --> 29:47.160
for the audience is access to quantum,

652
29:47.160 --> 29:48.864
'cause we talk about these different applications,

653
29:48.864 --> 29:51.150
we talk about the machines that we're building

654
29:51.150 --> 29:52.980
and delivering and shipping,

655
29:52.980 --> 29:54.330
I think what's very different,

656
29:54.330 --> 29:56.250
'cause I worked at Microsoft,

657
29:56.250 --> 29:58.530
we overlapped 20 years at Microsoft.

658
29:58.530 --> 30:00.990
I worked on every commercial product Microsoft sells,

659
30:00.990 --> 30:02.640
except for, I think, CRM.

660
30:02.640 --> 30:04.890
So hardware all the way to the cloud,

661
30:04.890 --> 30:08.010
on-premises, hybrid, you know, cloud, metal.

662
30:08.010 --> 30:11.190
But the thing that was different for all of us in compute

663
30:11.190 --> 30:14.160
that quantum is incredibly, it's exciting,

664
30:14.160 --> 30:18.060
you can buy or get access to a full quantum computer system,

665
30:18.060 --> 30:22.680
but we are also today available on various clouds.

666
30:22.680 --> 30:26.010
IONQ's computers are sitting on Microsoft Azure,

667
30:26.010 --> 30:28.830
on AWS Bracket, on Google Cloud.

668
30:28.830 --> 30:31.620
You know, Quantinuum and IONQ both work

669
30:31.620 --> 30:33.600
with the Oak Ridge National Research Lab

670
30:33.600 --> 30:37.560
to give access to quantum computing to all the people in HPC

671
30:37.560 --> 30:40.890
that wanna transition for high-performance knowledge

672
30:40.890 --> 30:42.690
to a hybrid knowledge.

673
30:42.690 --> 30:44.940
So that's very different from what I grew up.

674
30:44.940 --> 30:47.253
I grew up coding on minicomputers.

675
30:48.150 --> 30:50.481
I don't know if any of you, that's pretty, way back.

676
30:50.481 --> 30:51.314
(Jacqueline chuckles)

677
30:51.314 --> 30:52.650
So the step beyond a mainframe,

678
30:52.650 --> 30:54.180
but we'd simulate something,

679
30:54.180 --> 30:56.820
it would take a week to get back one answer.

680
30:56.820 --> 31:00.030
My iPhone can get back answers from 50 different people,

681
31:00.030 --> 31:02.220
all at the same time, in an instant.

682
31:02.220 --> 31:04.140
So quantum is very different now,

683
31:04.140 --> 31:05.760
we've learned from our past,

684
31:05.760 --> 31:09.570
and we're trying to bring quantum to the masses sooner

685
31:09.570 --> 31:11.310
and faster so that, you know,

686
31:11.310 --> 31:15.330
developers can create algorithms and create applications.

687
31:15.330 --> 31:18.391
<v ->And I want to add that IBM was the first in the cloud.</v>

688
31:18.391 --> 31:21.510
(panelists laughing)

689
31:21.510 --> 31:24.000
<v ->So just in the interest of time, because, unfortunately,</v>

690
31:24.000 --> 31:27.930
we don't have enough time to go into all of the things

691
31:27.930 --> 31:29.850
that we should be going into today.

692
31:29.850 --> 31:31.830
And please see us after the panel outside

693
31:31.830 --> 31:34.110
if you wanna continue the conversations.

694
31:34.110 --> 31:36.600
Let's talk really quickly about some of the applications

695
31:36.600 --> 31:38.940
that we are kind of making a lot of progress on

696
31:38.940 --> 31:40.650
and their commercial utility.

697
31:40.650 --> 31:41.670
Margaret, I'm gonna start with you.

698
31:41.670 --> 31:45.390
So IONQ has already showcased applications in finance,

699
31:45.390 --> 31:46.920
logistics, et cetera.

700
31:46.920 --> 31:48.810
Can you share a compelling example

701
31:48.810 --> 31:51.270
of a client leveraging quantum today

702
31:51.270 --> 31:53.400
to solve a previously intractable problem?

703
31:53.400 --> 31:54.600
And then I'm gonna ask kind of each of you

704
31:54.600 --> 31:57.930
to share your favorite application stories.

705
31:57.930 --> 32:01.560
<v ->Well, I think the work that we do with Hyundai,</v>

706
32:01.560 --> 32:02.790
we've actually been working with Hyundai

707
32:02.790 --> 32:03.780
for a very long time.

708
32:03.780 --> 32:05.610
We've actually are now on the third project

709
32:05.610 --> 32:06.930
that we're working on them with.

710
32:06.930 --> 32:08.610
And I think what's important is,

711
32:08.610 --> 32:10.860
when you have very large companies, like Hyundai,

712
32:10.860 --> 32:13.140
and people go, "Why are they talking to you guys,"

713
32:13.140 --> 32:15.557
any of us, or BMW with Quantinuum?

714
32:15.557 --> 32:17.190
'Cause they have access

715
32:17.190 --> 32:19.710
to the world's fastest supercomputers.

716
32:19.710 --> 32:22.380
So why do businesses need to talk to quantum?

717
32:22.380 --> 32:25.350
It's because they need that collaboration.

718
32:25.350 --> 32:27.990
They need HPC, and they need quantum.

719
32:27.990 --> 32:31.290
So for a lot of industries that need, you know,

720
32:31.290 --> 32:33.180
generative AI capabilities,

721
32:33.180 --> 32:35.400
can you actually look at images and detect them

722
32:35.400 --> 32:38.400
and sort them and actually manage them?

723
32:38.400 --> 32:40.830
We worked with Hyundai on autonomous driving,

724
32:40.830 --> 32:42.480
'cause it turns out, machines,

725
32:42.480 --> 32:45.630
they look at a stop sign, and it's an octagon, and it's red,

726
32:45.630 --> 32:47.730
if it gets hit by a little bit of rain,

727
32:47.730 --> 32:50.520
and somebody hit the stop sign, you know, a day ago,

728
32:50.520 --> 32:54.090
and it's no longer upright, there's no picture of that,

729
32:54.090 --> 32:57.030
there's no picture of the gray clouds in the sky

730
32:57.030 --> 32:58.657
because then the car looks at it and says,

731
32:58.657 --> 33:00.960
"Ah, that's not a stop sign, I'll go right through it."

732
33:00.960 --> 33:04.620
So how do you take that simple problem, but intractable,

733
33:04.620 --> 33:07.530
and break it down using quantum and classical

734
33:07.530 --> 33:10.920
to actually help create cars that are safer?

735
33:10.920 --> 33:12.180
So those are the important...

736
33:12.180 --> 33:15.060
Like, when you bring it down to what's quantum gonna do,

737
33:15.060 --> 33:18.180
it's gonna make our lives safer, we're gonna be healthier,

738
33:18.180 --> 33:21.240
we're gonna be, I hope, stronger, faster, better.

739
33:21.240 --> 33:24.300
But there's very specific examples today

740
33:24.300 --> 33:26.850
where we're trying to make the world a better place.

741
33:26.850 --> 33:27.870
<v ->John, can you share one</v>

742
33:27.870 --> 33:29.370
about sort of the chemistry application,

743
33:29.370 --> 33:33.270
potentially?
<v ->Yeah, you know,</v>

744
33:33.270 --> 33:35.607
there's a lot of work being done in chemistry

745
33:35.607 --> 33:36.570
and material science.

746
33:36.570 --> 33:39.570
I mean, 96% of all manufactured goods

747
33:39.570 --> 33:41.940
that we interact with every day in the world

748
33:41.940 --> 33:46.110
rely on some sort of chemistry, material, some discovery.

749
33:46.110 --> 33:48.660
Do you wanna create a new material that lasts better,

750
33:48.660 --> 33:50.580
but recycles more effectively?

751
33:50.580 --> 33:53.760
Do you wanna remove forever chemicals from coolants?

752
33:53.760 --> 33:57.510
Do you wanna create a new battery that lasts longer,

753
33:57.510 --> 34:02.130
recharges better, is lighter, is impervious to water?

754
34:02.130 --> 34:03.300
These are the type of things

755
34:03.300 --> 34:05.550
that we're working with our customers on today.

756
34:05.550 --> 34:08.970
So, you know, you can go look at the public studies,

757
34:08.970 --> 34:11.790
but with Pacific Northwest National Labs,

758
34:11.790 --> 34:13.290
we've spent time with them,

759
34:13.290 --> 34:18.290
because we used a highly specialized AI model in HPC

760
34:18.600 --> 34:22.860
to simulate 32 million different compounds

761
34:22.860 --> 34:24.840
for a new lithium battery.

762
34:24.840 --> 34:27.390
And in less than a month,

763
34:27.390 --> 34:29.550
we were able to bring that down to eight candidates,

764
34:29.550 --> 34:31.620
work with them to figure out

765
34:31.620 --> 34:34.950
which one would actually have the parameters that we need.

766
34:34.950 --> 34:36.480
And then it went into a wet lab,

767
34:36.480 --> 34:39.900
and we created a lithium battery that uses 70% less lithium.

768
34:39.900 --> 34:42.600
That was 20 years of discovery

769
34:42.600 --> 34:44.580
baked into less than six months.

770
34:44.580 --> 34:46.890
But what's the turn on that?

771
34:46.890 --> 34:50.850
Now, how do we go and do the intractable next problem,

772
34:50.850 --> 34:53.940
which is, what, at the molecular level,

773
34:53.940 --> 34:56.580
will happen in this new electrolyte?

774
34:56.580 --> 35:00.060
And that's where the quantum computer can help us there.

775
35:00.060 --> 35:02.940
So we're looking at solutions

776
35:02.940 --> 35:06.330
around removing PFAS chemicals from data center coolants,

777
35:06.330 --> 35:08.160
we're looking at these new battery types.

778
35:08.160 --> 35:10.320
We're working with customers across the globe

779
35:10.320 --> 35:12.690
to figure out new drug discoveries,

780
35:12.690 --> 35:16.050
how proteins bond, how we can simulate that.

781
35:16.050 --> 35:18.750
And, you know, one of the fun examples

782
35:18.750 --> 35:21.300
that recently has come up that we've started to think about

783
35:21.300 --> 35:24.990
and work on is is the field of turbulence.

784
35:24.990 --> 35:28.170
And turbulence, while it's a classic physics problem,

785
35:28.170 --> 35:30.870
not a quantum problem, it's highly complex

786
35:30.870 --> 35:34.050
to simulate nature and fluid flow and plasma flow.

787
35:34.050 --> 35:37.800
And so I was speaking with an MIT professor.

788
35:37.800 --> 35:40.230
And he said, "You know, I've been doing this for 25 years,

789
35:40.230 --> 35:43.950
and I feel like we're stuck,

790
35:43.950 --> 35:47.640
and we need a quantum computer that can help simulate,

791
35:47.640 --> 35:50.880
at the atomic level, the different aspects of turbulence,

792
35:50.880 --> 35:53.010
so that we can extract that data,"

793
35:53.010 --> 35:55.140
which is what quantum computers are very good at,

794
35:55.140 --> 35:57.870
simulating natural data,

795
35:57.870 --> 36:01.290
and then we can feed that back into our AI models,

796
36:01.290 --> 36:03.540
which would help us solve what's the new material,

797
36:03.540 --> 36:04.980
what's the new wing shape.

798
36:04.980 --> 36:07.200
You can use the AI to answer the question,

799
36:07.200 --> 36:08.430
find the solution.

800
36:08.430 --> 36:10.740
But right now, we don't have the capabilities

801
36:10.740 --> 36:13.830
to even train a model 'cause we don't have that data,

802
36:13.830 --> 36:15.480
realistic, simulated data.

803
36:15.480 --> 36:16.800
And you've probably all heard the issues

804
36:16.800 --> 36:19.620
with synthetic data coming from AI models.

805
36:19.620 --> 36:22.110
This is the game changer there.

806
36:22.110 --> 36:25.200
So when all of our quantum computers start to be able

807
36:25.200 --> 36:28.140
to create that data with accuracy,

808
36:28.140 --> 36:30.180
and like what we showed in the catalyst,

809
36:30.180 --> 36:32.400
work that we did together with Quantinuum,

810
36:32.400 --> 36:35.160
then you're gonna start to see us be able to use

811
36:35.160 --> 36:38.490
all three of those aspects, HPC, AI, and quantum,

812
36:38.490 --> 36:41.400
to not just say, "I have a problem,"

813
36:41.400 --> 36:43.050
but, "Where's the solution?"

814
36:43.050 --> 36:47.640
And that is, as we've all expressed here, that's now,

815
36:47.640 --> 36:50.430
and will only accelerate exponentially

816
36:50.430 --> 36:54.600
over the next two years based on the roadmaps of all of us.

817
36:54.600 --> 36:57.300
<v ->What John and Margaret just outlined,</v>

818
36:57.300 --> 36:59.013
and I'm sure Nash will agree,

819
37:00.060 --> 37:03.693
it is the era of algorithm development now.

820
37:04.560 --> 37:07.080
We're getting to the point with our hardware

821
37:07.080 --> 37:09.840
that we're really now focused on software,

822
37:09.840 --> 37:14.550
and we're focused on software that is going to expand

823
37:14.550 --> 37:17.940
this hybrid compute environment very efficiently

824
37:17.940 --> 37:21.930
as well as algorithms directed toward chemistry,

825
37:21.930 --> 37:26.930
materials, AI, machine learning,

826
37:27.300 --> 37:31.080
these are the specific application areas,

827
37:31.080 --> 37:34.830
but it really is the era now of algorithm development.

828
37:34.830 --> 37:38.250
We have these machines, they are at our disposal,

829
37:38.250 --> 37:40.230
they are available in the cloud,

830
37:40.230 --> 37:44.460
scientists have access to them.

831
37:44.460 --> 37:48.210
And our aim is to get more and more scientists,

832
37:48.210 --> 37:52.980
not just those in physics or chemistry or computer science,

833
37:52.980 --> 37:57.980
but social scientists, psychologists, neuroscientists,

834
37:58.410 --> 38:03.030
structural biologists, people in many different disciplines

835
38:03.030 --> 38:08.030
that could benefit from performing calculations quantumly.

836
38:09.630 --> 38:13.020
<v ->I think the analogy that most people are very used to is,</v>

837
38:13.020 --> 38:15.330
there's hardware, there's software, there's apps.

838
38:15.330 --> 38:17.850
We're in the stage right now of building the killer apps

839
38:17.850 --> 38:19.320
for every industry.

840
38:19.320 --> 38:21.990
So that is the reason why quantum is now,

841
38:21.990 --> 38:25.740
that is how we grew all of the ecosystems of compute,

842
38:25.740 --> 38:28.860
'cause you need use cases, and you need the killer apps.

843
38:28.860 --> 38:31.770
This is why, as he said, we have the computers,

844
38:31.770 --> 38:34.050
they are available for people to use.

845
38:34.050 --> 38:36.090
Right now, we're all working on the algorithms,

846
38:36.090 --> 38:37.560
which are the applications-
<v ->Yeah.</v>

847
38:37.560 --> 38:39.360
<v ->That will break through in big, big,</v>

848
38:39.360 --> 38:41.250
complex problems.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

849
38:41.250 --> 38:43.350
Yeah, with that, you know, I'd like to add, you know,

850
38:43.350 --> 38:45.480
something which is very important for me

851
38:45.480 --> 38:47.040
and for our company, right?

852
38:47.040 --> 38:49.470
Which is in the computational biology space.

853
38:49.470 --> 38:51.270
We just announced something in Singapore.

854
38:51.270 --> 38:53.760
We are working very closely with Microsoft in this,

855
38:53.760 --> 38:56.940
but, you know, our investors are our customers.

856
38:56.940 --> 38:58.950
So we're working with customers on algorithms

857
38:58.950 --> 39:01.800
and applications, so we have an effort with Amgen

858
39:01.800 --> 39:04.770
on using machine learning to do peptide binding, right?

859
39:04.770 --> 39:07.290
This is super passionate to me,

860
39:07.290 --> 39:11.130
especially 'cause it's gonna help get better vaccines,

861
39:11.130 --> 39:13.320
especially in the cancer vaccine space, right?

862
39:13.320 --> 39:16.410
So my brother-in-law, who's a professor at Emory,

863
39:16.410 --> 39:20.310
Dr. Selvaraj, he's working on a vaccine for cancer, right?

864
39:20.310 --> 39:23.970
Which is basically looking at a cancer tumor,

865
39:23.970 --> 39:26.970
and there are different peptides, it's not one thing.

866
39:26.970 --> 39:30.120
And everybody's tumor, you know, whether it's lung cancer,

867
39:30.120 --> 39:31.440
is gonna be different.

868
39:31.440 --> 39:34.620
So he's actually creating a vaccine

869
39:34.620 --> 39:38.280
from the peptides in the tumor, right?

870
39:38.280 --> 39:41.970
And putting it back, so your immune system kills it,

871
39:41.970 --> 39:44.100
your immune system is basically a break,

872
39:44.100 --> 39:47.040
an accelerator, and a gas tank, okay?

873
39:47.040 --> 39:49.050
So you have to remove the break,

874
39:49.050 --> 39:53.493
somebody's already got a, you know, a noble price for that.

875
39:54.360 --> 39:57.660
The gas tank and the accelerator are important, right?

876
39:57.660 --> 40:02.660
So this can actually kill the tumor the first time,

877
40:03.000 --> 40:05.200
but then you have to continuously give them

878
40:06.210 --> 40:08.670
these vaccines again, but you don't have the tumor anymore

879
40:08.670 --> 40:09.570
and the peptides, right?

880
40:09.570 --> 40:12.210
So you have to take the peptides, get the peptides out,

881
40:12.210 --> 40:15.300
and figure out which peptides can actually bind

882
40:15.300 --> 40:17.820
and actually create the acceleration, okay?

883
40:17.820 --> 40:19.200
So that's where quantum computing

884
40:19.200 --> 40:20.730
is gonna be really, really useful,

885
40:20.730 --> 40:23.220
to figure out which peptides you use,

886
40:23.220 --> 40:25.740
so that you can actually accelerate

887
40:25.740 --> 40:28.020
those T cells going and killing those cancers, right?

888
40:28.020 --> 40:31.937
So excellent opportunities, I think, with quantum computing.

889
40:31.937 --> 40:35.610
We are already working on this with several companies,

890
40:35.610 --> 40:38.340
and I think it's exciting space.

891
40:38.340 --> 40:39.990
<v ->So I hope that you've taken away,</v>

892
40:39.990 --> 40:44.520
if nothing else from today, the unbelievable importance

893
40:44.520 --> 40:47.400
of what this technology is unlocking already

894
40:47.400 --> 40:48.233
and will continue

895
40:48.233 --> 40:51.390
to unlock across disciplines, across sectors.

896
40:51.390 --> 40:52.500
I know we are at time,

897
40:52.500 --> 40:55.170
but I'm just gonna ask for a 15-second from each of you,

898
40:55.170 --> 40:57.510
what is the most exciting hardware or software development

899
40:57.510 --> 41:00.060
that you anticipate in the next 12 to 24 months.

900
41:00.060 --> 41:01.680
Joe?

901
41:01.680 --> 41:05.730
<v ->I would say adoption algorithm development</v>

902
41:05.730 --> 41:09.390
in some of the application areas that we just outlined.

903
41:09.390 --> 41:10.710
<v ->Great. Margaret?</v>

904
41:10.710 --> 41:13.560
<v ->I'd say we have hardware, software applications,</v>

905
41:13.560 --> 41:16.740
what's incredibly exciting is quantum networking.

906
41:16.740 --> 41:19.110
All of us here, we need to build the quantum internet,

907
41:19.110 --> 41:20.700
and that is what we're actually focused

908
41:20.700 --> 41:22.023
on doing now as well.

909
41:23.850 --> 41:26.250
<v ->I'd say that where we're focused</v>

910
41:26.250 --> 41:30.030
is even coming up a level on the algorithm

911
41:30.030 --> 41:32.370
and creating a co-pilot-like experience

912
41:32.370 --> 41:35.160
that automates the entire scientific reasoning loop.

913
41:35.160 --> 41:38.340
So you describe a goal, and you get a solution,

914
41:38.340 --> 41:40.500
and you can do that without being a quantum physicist,

915
41:40.500 --> 41:41.670
which I am not.

916
41:41.670 --> 41:43.560
So many of the examples you heard here,

917
41:43.560 --> 41:46.800
you may say to yourself, "Well, I'm not in academia,

918
41:46.800 --> 41:48.300
I'm not a quantum physicist,"

919
41:48.300 --> 41:53.300
but the algorithms and then the agentic framework

920
41:53.610 --> 41:56.880
that will interact with you trying to solve a problem

921
41:56.880 --> 42:00.270
and take away what you need to do across HPC,

922
42:00.270 --> 42:03.537
AI, and quantum for you, that's what I'm most excited about,

923
42:03.537 --> 42:06.170
and we're going to be seeing vast improvements in that

924
42:06.170 --> 42:07.440
in the next year or two.

925
42:07.440 --> 42:08.970
<v ->Very cool. Nash?</v>

926
42:08.970 --> 42:09.803
<v ->All right, so I'm last.</v>

927
42:09.803 --> 42:12.570
So I think there are three things

928
42:12.570 --> 42:14.410
which I see happening.
<v ->15 seconds, please.</v>

929
42:14.410 --> 42:15.630
<v ->Oh, (laughs) okay.
(Jacqueline laughs)</v>

930
42:15.630 --> 42:17.160
The first one is,

931
42:17.160 --> 42:19.590
the machines are gonna get more reliable, right?

932
42:19.590 --> 42:23.010
Higher fidelity, okay? So I think that is gonna happen.

933
42:23.010 --> 42:25.290
You're gonna have better error correction and algorithms.

934
42:25.290 --> 42:27.240
End of the day, you need more qubits,

935
42:27.240 --> 42:28.890
but at better fidelity.

936
42:28.890 --> 42:30.570
So I think you're gonna see that happen,

937
42:30.570 --> 42:33.330
and you'll see a lot of progress in that in this year.

938
42:33.330 --> 42:36.060
The second one is in terms of applications,

939
42:36.060 --> 42:38.070
I explained a very important application,

940
42:38.070 --> 42:41.640
which is probably affecting everybody on this planet, okay?

941
42:41.640 --> 42:42.690
You'll see more progress

942
42:42.690 --> 42:45.210
in those types of applications and algorithms,

943
42:45.210 --> 42:50.210
with a combination of CPU plus GPU plus quantum.

944
42:50.610 --> 42:53.190
And the third one, I think you alluded to it

945
42:53.190 --> 42:55.950
in terms of how quantum can help AI,

946
42:55.950 --> 42:57.420
especially in the data side,

947
42:57.420 --> 42:59.580
and you're gonna see a lot of progress on that side,

948
42:59.580 --> 43:01.860
especially coming from us, I think, in that space.

949
43:01.860 --> 43:04.590
So these are three important things which are gonna happen,

950
43:04.590 --> 43:07.260
which is really gonna take quantum computing

951
43:07.260 --> 43:09.750
to the next level in 2025.

952
43:09.750 --> 43:12.000
<v ->Amazing. Well, everyone, quantum is here.</v>

953
43:12.000 --> 43:13.470
Thank you so much to our panelists.

954
43:13.470 --> 43:14.700
We really appreciate your time today.

955
43:14.700 --> 43:15.758
And we'll see you next time.
(audience and John applauding)

956
43:15.758 --> 43:17.006
<v ->Thank you.</v>
<v ->Thank you, Jackie.</v>

957
43:17.006 --> 43:18.323
(audience and John applauding)

958
43:18.323 --> 43:21.073
(cheerful music)
